Furthermore, paging requests are queued in N different waiting queues, where N stands for the number of tiers, and multiple paging requests in each waiting queue are served in a pipeline manner. We study the HPP scheme analytically in terms of discovery rate, total delay, paging delay, cost, and load balance, validated with simulations.	human proteome project;load balancing (computing);mobile phone;multitier architecture;paging;pipeline (computing);simulation	Yang Xiao;Mohsen Guizani;Hui Chen	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.959	embedded system;cellular network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;queueing theory;statistics;computer network	EDA	9.55717903643481	97.00182070253062	90322

In order to control their internal buffers and avoid overflow, the intermediate routers of a network send control signals (feedbacks). The source adjusts its transmission rate accordingly. Different control signals have proposed in the literature but the most widely used is performed by dropping the packet. When a packet is dropped, the source does not receive it acknowledgement and is notified of congestion at the network. Active queue management (AQM) is referred to the technique where intermediate routers by employing that can control and stabilize their internal routers and avoid network congestion. In many cases, an AQM technique defines the decision algorithm for dropping the packets of a source. In this paper, we consider the AQM in the network with one wireless access link. Active queue management is more complicated in the wireless networks than that in wired ones due to the changes in the link capacity and packet erasure in the communication channel. The main contribution of our study is to design a robust queue management based on two degree of freedom internal model control for a network consisting of a wireless link with variable capacity, packet loss, and large delay. Simulation results validate the analytical results through which it is proved that the procedure not only can restrict the fluctuations caused by the fading and packet error rate but also can control the queue length in the case of variation in the number of the users.	access network;active queue management;algorithm;bit error rate;call stack;channel (communications);feedback;internet protocol suite;memory controller;network congestion;network packet;router (computing);serial experiments lain;simulation;trusted data format;wireless access point	Ladan Khoshnevisan;Farzad R.

It has been recently proposed in order to improve performance in high speed networks. In this paper, we present a mathematical analysis of such multiplicative increase multiplicative decrease protocols in the presence of random losses. These are typical to wireless networks but can also model losses in wireline networks with very high bandwidth delay product. Our approach is based on showing that the logarithm of the window size evolution has the same behaviour as the workload process in a standard G/G/1 queue. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the equivalent queue is shown to provide directly the throughput of Scalable TCP as well as the higher moments of the window size. We validate our findings using ns-2 simulations.	bandwidth-delay product;coefficient;handbook;john d. wiley;kelly criterion;markov chain;mathematical model;microsoft windows;network congestion;recurrence relation;scalable tcp;shadow volume;simulation;springer (tank);stationary process;throughput;window function;yao graph	Eitan Altman;Konstantin Avrachenkov;Chadi Barakat;Arzad Alam Kherani;Balakrishna J.

9c9574f97f07a0841ccfe4a1f16a5afb17d7f489	convergence to multi-resource fairness under end-to-end window control		The paper relates to multi-resource sharing between flows with heterogeneous requirements as arises in networks with wireless links or software routers implementing network function virtualization. Bottleneck max fairness (BMF) is a sharing objective in this context with good performance. The paper shows that BMF results when local fairness is imposed at each resource while flow rates are controlled by an end-to-end window. We analytically prove convergence to BMF under a fluid model when flows share a network limited to 2 resources while numerical results confirm BMF convergence for larger networks. Simulation results illustrate the impact of packetized transmission.	converge;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;network function virtualization;network packet;numerical analysis;requirement;simulation;vergence;window function	Thomas Bonald;James W.

In this paper we develop a new handoff prioritized scheme which adapts the allocation policy according to the current traffic conditions. The goal is to minimize the new call blocking while keeping the handoff failures close to a targeted objective. This problem is formulated as a constrained semiMarkov decision process (SMDP) with average cost criterion. A simulation-based learning algorithm is developed to determine a control policy from direct interaction with the network without a priori knowledge of the network dynamics or traffic. Extensive simulations test the effectiveness of the algorithm under a variety of traffic conditions. Comparisons with other resource allocation policies, such as complete sharing and channel reservation, are presented.	algorithm;blocking (computing);mobile phone;next-generation network;provisioning;quality of service;simulation	El-Sayed M.

However, the flow characteristics depend on a large number of factors, due to the complexity of the TCP. As a result, the TCP characteristics are normally studied by means of simulations or controlled network setups. In this paper we propose a TCP characterization based on a generic model based of stochastic flow with burstiness and throughput ((σ,ρ)-constrains), which is useful in order to characterize flows in atm and other flow-switched networks. The model is obtained through extensive analysis of a real traffic trace, comprising an approximate number of 1,500 hosts and 1,700,000 TCP connections. The results suggest that TCP connections in the wide area Internet have low throughput while the packet bursts do not suffer an exponential increase, as indicated by the slow-start behavior. On the other hand, the impact of the connection establishment phase is striking. We note that the throughput of the TCP flow is approximately half the throughput which is obtained in the data transfer phase, namely after the connection has been established.

The conventional strategy of retransmitting the entire message when collisions occur results in a reduction in throughput when compared with the single packet case. However, it is proved analytically that the use of ARQ-type retransmission protocols can provide significant performance improvement. In particular, it is shown that a simple go-back-N(GBN) protocol can offer a modest throughput increase, while a selective reject (SREJ) strategy provides exactly the same throughput as a single packet slotted ALOHA system, irrespective of message length statistics. These results motivate a new scheme (referred to as unslotted selective reject (SREJ) ALOHA) for increasing the throughput of unsynchronized random access channels. It is demonstrated that unslotted SREJ ALOHA with optimized parameters can achieve typical maximum throughputs (after accounting for all overheads) at least 25-40 percent higher than conventional pure ALOHA.	automatic repeat request;network packet;random access;retransmission (data networks);selective repeat arq;throughput	Dipankar Raychaudhuri	1984	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOM.1984.1096040	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;go-back-n arq;random access;packet switching;communication theory;computer network;data transmission	Networks	6.408354266128977	94.64856375755991	91159

The investigations have been made in the context of rate envelope (bufferless) multiplexing by the aid of the well-known Chernoff bounding method. After showing fundamental relations between the aforementioned measures, we shed considerable light on some important properties.

Based on the weighted round-robin strategy, the proposed scheduling algorithm allocates a different service quota to different traffic according to the average packet arrival rate. This guarantees proportional fairness in terms of the average packet delivery delay and the average packet loss ratio. Since the scheduling algorithm does not perform high-load operations such as time stamping and sorting, it can be implemented easily and is suitable for resource-limited WSNs. The proposed scheduling algorithm is tested in a WSN and is found to guarantee the proportional fairness of the average packet delivery delay when this is used as the performance metric, and to realize proportional fairness in the average packet loss ratio when all the queues are overflowing and the average packet loss ratio is used as the performance metric.	algorithm;fairness measure;network packet;proportionally fair;queueing theory;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);sorting;weighted round robin	Jian-Hui Huang;Jingping Bi	2015	2015 International Conference on Identification, Information, and Knowledge in the Internet of Things (IIKI)	10.1007/s00779-016-0948-2	fairness measure;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;packet analyzer;computer science;processing delay;maximum throughput scheduling;end-to-end delay;fair queuing;distributed computing;transmission delay;round-robin scheduling;computer network;weighted round robin	Embedded	2.2126565189849994	95.01922953753106	91304

Under multi-access technology, a multi-path transmission can obtain high throughput, increased available bandwidth and enhanced reliability. However, the multi-path transmission with multi-access technology also has the problems that the packet re-ordering is unavoidable, and the fast retransmission is unnecessarily requested. Considering the stochastically varying transmission delay, the problems above may eventually result in a degradation of throughput. As a result, in this paper, we focus on the analysis of buffer overflow probability problem which is influenced by the transmission interval. First, we utilize Reinforcement Learning method to estimate the stochastic delay of end-to-end paths. Then, we discuss problems of re-sequencing buffer occupancy distribution and the overflow probability. In this paper, we model the stochastic delay as a continuous random variable, and then, discuss its mean value and variance. Simulation result shows that the re-sequencing buffer overflow probability is influenced by the transmission intervals and the variance of stochastic delay.	assistive technology;buffer overflow;bulldozer (microarchitecture);elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;network packet;reinforcement learning;retransmission (data networks);simulation;stochastic process;throughput	Dongmei Zhou;Hongyan Li;Jiandong Li	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666565	stochastic process;real-time computing;the internet;computer science;machine learning;probability;distributed computing;statistics	Embedded	1.244012631694689	97.15740929791525	91398
2f72cc3e93d3521b1e7b04d479d2b515963855fb	lte system design for urban light rail transport		This paper deals with the performance of LTE-A (Long Term Evolu‐ tion-Advanced) cellular networks for supporting operational, safety-critical signaling, and standard IT services for urban transportation. Our interests have been focused on Light Rail Transit (LRT) signaling performance for the Song‐ jiang (China) tramway project. Several stationary and mobility use cases have been considered and mean end-to-end delay and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) key performance indicators have been evaluated. Simulation results highlight that, in stationary conditions, LRT signaling performance requirements are fulfilled, while PLR performance degrades when mobility is introduced. Furthermore, we have evaluated the impact of non-critical IT traffic (e.g., UDP-based video) on TCP-based signaling by demonstrating that signaling throughput is not affected by video in stationary scenarios, whereas, in the presence of mobility, handovers degrade signaling performance, which can be guaranteed only if a QoS-aware scheduler is adopted. In conclusions, our results demonstrate that LTE-A can safely support operative and non-critical applications in urban transportation scenarios, where strong connectivity requirements are crucial.	closed-circuit television;compaq lte;end-to-end principle;long-running transaction;network congestion;public lending right;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;stationary process;throughput;window of opportunity	Gianluca Mandò;Giovanni Giambene	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-68499-4_2	throughput;performance indicator;business;computer network;packet loss;systems design;cellular network;transport engineering	Networks	1.9564311238533574	94.36986606898017	91506

By utilizing the dynamic Power Save Mode (PSM), our study proposes an adaptive RTP packet transmission scheme for multimedia traffic. By merging the outbound packet delivery timing with inbound packet reception and estimating each delay component along the packet processing and transmission path, each client manages to meet the stringent end-to-end latency for packets while creating longer sleep intervals. As a benefit it involves no cross-layer communication overhead as the interface state transitions are completely transparent to the application. The experimental results show that 28.53% energy savings on the WiFi interface can be achieved while maintaining satisfactory application performance.	end-to-end principle;fair-share scheduling;inbound marketing;mobile device;network interface;network packet;no-communication theorem;overhead (computing);real-time clock;scheduling (computing)	Haiyang Ma;Roger Zimmermann	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia	10.1109/ISM.2012.57	real-time computing;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;transmission delay;computer network	Embedded	2.4536833018493156	94.08521403638974	91512

According to the directional busy tone, our protocol can avoid data conflict, which will solve the “deaf” and directional “hidden terminal” and other new problems that caused by the directional transmission.

716a7aecc6f8ba9e67270e0e806bfffefb9a525a	analytical modelling and simulation of admission control scheme for non- real time services in lte networks		In 4th generation LTE (Long Term Evolution) and LTE-Advanced networks, there are 9 types of services, which have different service priorities and generated traffics. Depending on the combination of services with different priorities, about 200 radio admission control schemes could be developed. However, international standards have no recommendations for the construction and analysis of methods for such schemes. Thereby, a need for admission control schemes development and selecting the most effective ones arises. The article proposes a scheme based on the bit rate degradation of non-real time services in proportion to the individual thresholds chosen in accordance with the network or consumer devices characteristics. A complex approach for analysing the model performance measures – blocking probability, mean data transfer time – is proposed. It is based on queuing theory via the development of a Markov model of the admission control scheme and on verifying the obtained results via simulation allowing arbitrary arrival process and file sizes. The results obtained in this paper could be used by mobile operators for 4th and 5th generation network planning to evaluate the quality of service level.	analytical engine;blocking (computing);compaq lte;elegant degradation;erlang (unit);markov chain;markov model;quality of service;queueing theory;simulation;verification and validation	Irina Gudkova;Ekaterina V.

For each traffic source type measurements were collected in order to, on the one hand, gain better understanding of the statistical characteristics of the sources and, on the other hand, enable forecasting traffic behavior in the network. The latter can be used to estimate service times and Quality of Service. Based on evaluation of packet inter-arrival times, we propose the Polya distribution to be used in network simulations or in estimations of available capacity in opportunistic sessions. Our results can be applied for dynamic network configuration in order to avoid potential network congestions or overflows.	network packet;quality of service;simulation	Rossitza Goleva;Dimitar Atamian;Seferin Mirtchev;Desislava Dimitrova;Lubina Grigorova	2012		10.1145/2386980.2386987	traffic generation model;network planning and design;network traffic control;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;traffic shaping;computer network;network traffic simulation	Metrics	-3.048306321067325	97.42539009372615	92576

Specifically, we design and implement a PD (Proportional and Derivative) controller at each contending station, that dynamically adjusts CW based on a locally available channel state, i.e., the average number of consecutive idle slots between two transmissions, such that the channel state converges to the optimal value. Simulation results demonstrate that the new scheme outperforms the standard BEB in terms of both throughput and fairness, especially at high contention levels.	access control;design rule for camera file system;exponential backoff;fairness measure;optimization problem;quality of service;requirement;responsiveness;simulation;theory;throughput;wisconsin integrally synchronized computer	Qiuyan Xia;Mounir Hamdi	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255694	throughput;real-time computing;optimal control;telecommunications;computer science;control system;proportional control;feedback;computer network	Robotics	4.637351399377102	95.13760279709119	92672

Typically, 802.11 wireless interfaces consume a significant amount of energy. Previous work has shown that the power saving function specified in the IEEE 802.11 standard is not enough to ensure energy efficiency; thus, other solutions to energy saving are highly needed. Here we consider the 802.11 distributed access scheme and explore the possibility to increase the time period that a wireless station spends in the low-power operational state, the so-called doze state. The key feature of the proposed mechanism is that it enables a station to enter the doze state during channel contention, by exploiting the virtual carrier sense mechanism and the backoff function. By using the network simulator ns-2, we compare the performance obtained through our scheme with the results attained when the standard DCF mechanism is employed.	backoff;design rule for camera file system;low-power broadcasting	Valeria Baiamonte;Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini	2004	IEEE International Conference on Performance, Computing, and Communications, 2004	10.1109/PCCC.2004.1395156	network allocation vector;real-time computing;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;network simulation;efficient energy use;wi-fi array;computer network	Robotics	9.4600106260154	89.80434589766679	92943

However, wireless ad hoc networks do not conform to these assumptions due to the shared and unreliable nature of the transmission medium. In this paper we distinguish the concept of end-to-end bandwidth (the maximum rate that can be achieved when the resources along the path are not shared with competing traffic) from that of end-to-end capacity (the minimum transmission rate among the nodes conforming the path) and show that the former is a random variable distributed within some range, which depends on the packet length, among other factors. After developing a simple theoretical framework to compare with, we devise a simple and effective dispersion-based method to estimate the mean end-to-end bandwidth for any packet length. The method is shown to be efficient, to converge quickly to an accurate estimate for any packet length, to be robust against cross-traffic, and to timely track bandwidth variations.	adaptive algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);catastrophic interference;converge;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);network packet;stationary process	Marco A.

In recent years, fairly tractable models have been shown to yield remarkably accurate throughput estimates for CSMA networks. These models typically assume that both the transmission durations and the back-off periods are exponentially distributed. We show that the stationary distribution of the system is in fact insensitive with respect to the transmission durations and the back-off times. These models primarily pertain to a saturated scenario where nodes always have packets to transmit. In reality however, the buffers may occasionally be empty as packets are randomly generated and transmitted over time. The resulting interplay between the activity states and the buffer contents gives rise to quite complicated queueing dynamics, and even establishing the stability criteria is usually a serious challenge. We explicitly identify the stability conditions in a few relevant scenarios, and illustrate the difficulties arising in other cases.	access control;access network;algorithm;cobham's thesis;network packet;procedural generation;random access;stationary process;throughput	Peter M. van de Ven;Sem C.

7a81b1d5647357a392d6f04f5f52b85ae71681fc	capacity planning for 5g packet-based front-haul		Packet switched transport technologies have been suggested to be used in 5G front-haul networks. Front-haul bandwidth and packet latency are two major challenges to be addressed in these networks. This paper focuses on capacity planning for packet-based front-haul technologies considering the latency requirements of the 5G front-haul flows. More specifically, we answer three main questions for Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and Variable Bit Rate (VBR) packet front-haul networks: First, is statistical multiplexing gain always achievable in packet front-haul networks? Second, what is the minimum bandwidth required to accommodate a set of front-haul flows on a front-haul link? Third, what is the proper bandwidth allocation and the scheduling algorithm among the packets of different antennas to guarantee the latency requirements of the flows? It is shown that for CBR traffic no statistical multiplexing gain is achievable and the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is the optimal packet scheduler. For VBR traffic, statistical multiplexing gain is achievable only when the latency requirement of at least one flow is greater than the packet inter-arrival time. The optimal bandwidth allocation is also determined for a Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) scheduler. Finally, simulation is used to validate the theoretical results for both CBR and VBR front-haul traffic.	algorithm;case-based reasoning;earliest deadline first scheduling;multiplexing;network packet;network scheduler;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;time of arrival;volume boot record;weighted fair queueing	Hassan Halabian;Peter Ashwood-Smith	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377215	statistical time division multiplexing;real-time computing;network scheduler;computer network;earliest deadline first scheduling;scheduling (computing);network packet;bandwidth allocation;multiplexing;computer science;weighted fair queueing	Networks	1.469907676037943	96.7539559944014	93202

An erroneous MAC protocol data unit can be typically retransmitted within a given limit. In order to improve the IP-level performance, which directly affects the user-perceived quality-of-service (QoS), we propose a new truncated ARQ strategy, called MAC service data unit-based ARQ (S-ARQ), where the finite number of opportunities for retransmissions are shared by multiple fragments out of an IP datagram. We describe how S-ARQ can be implemented in a practical system, and then propose another variant of S-ARQ employing a functionality called early detection of failure. Basically, we evaluate the performance of S-ARQ in two different manners. First, assuming i.i.d. error process, we analyze both the probability of the delivery failure and the average delay of IP datagram. Then, we assess the performance of S-ARQ via simulation over a 2-state Markov channel.	access control;automatic repeat request;datagram;markov chain;quality of service;simulation	Youngkyu Choi;Seong-Jun Oh;Sunghyun Choi	2010	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2010.6391374	sliding window protocol;hybrid automatic repeat request;quality of service;stop-and-wait arq;selective repeat arq;telecommunications;computer science;access control;probability of error;wireless network;go-back-n arq;automatic repeat request;implementation;computer security;service quality;wireless;statistics;computer network	Mobile	2.681345870529077	101.09672984988944	93237

We propose in this paper the loan-grant based Round Robin (LGRR) packet scheduler for use in each output port of a router in a DiffServ network. LGRR is a frame-based scheduler to pass traffic streams according to their class types and to their immediate upstream source routers. It uses a loan-grant scheme so that a higher priority traffic stream can be processed quickly by requesting a bandwidth loan from the scheduler. To control the amount of transmitted bits from each stream and to prevent malicious abuse, the bandwidth loan must be paid back from the quantum values acquired in future. LGRR gives a fair opportunity to different traffic streams to access to the network bandwidth. It performs better than MDRR+, MDRR++, and OCGRR in handling traffic under both normal and bursty traffic, but it also gives a better loss and delay performance to the higher-priority traffic when traffic load is very high. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we consider the fundamental problem of designing migration policies for these user agents. We first introduce a general framework for analyzing user agent migration policies, and then highlight, through analysis and simulation, the numerous parameters and tradeoffs that dictate the design of migration policies. We evaluate these policies in the context of both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, and in the presence and absence of processing overheads due to migration. Finally, we identify two simple threshold-based policies that deliver very good performance over a wide range of system parameters and configurations. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose and evaluate policies for migration of user agents.	central processing unit;overhead (computing);proxy server;response time (technology);semantic network;simulation;user agent	Ramachandran Ramjee;Thomas F.

The buffer is modeled as an M/M/1 queue. When the buffer is empty, the service restarts after a certain amount of packets are prefetched. With this goal, we propose two approaches, one of which is based on Ballot theorem, and the other uses recursive equations. The Ballot theorem approach gives an explicit solution, but at the cost of the high complexity order in certain circumstances. The recursive approach, though not offering an explicit result, needs fewer computations. We further propose a fluid analysis of starvation probability on the file level, given the distribution of file size and the traffic intensity. The starvation probabilities of this paper have many potential applications. We apply them to optimize the quality of experience (QoE) of media streaming service, by exploiting the tradeoff between the start-up delay and the starvation.	computation;network packet;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;recursion (computer science);streaming media	Yuedong Xu;Eitan Altman;Rachid El Azouzi;Majed Haddad;Salah-Eddine Elayoubi;Tania Jiménez	2012	2012 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2012.6195557	real-time computing;media;poisson process;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;markov process;queueing theory;statistics;computer network	HPC	-1.0009344820675408	98.35467631875518	93724

Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling, in conjunction with per-hop traffic shaping (jointly called Rate Controlled EDF or RC-EDF) has been recognised as an effective means of end-to-end deterministic delay provisioning. This paper addresses the issue of identifying RC-EDF shaping parameters that realize maximal network utilizations. We first prove that finding “optimal” shapers is in general infeasible, and then propose a heuristic choice derived from the flow’s hoplength. Our choice varies gracefully between known optimal settings for the limiting values of the hop-length, and outperforms shaper selections proposed previously in the literature.	earliest deadline first scheduling;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;heuristic;maximal set;network packet;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);traffic shaping	Vijay Sivaraman;Fabio M.

We present two extreme reliable multicast transport protocols, sender-initiated and receiver-initiated, and two analytic performance models supported and unsupported by transparent proxy servers in each reliable multicast protocol, and analyze the throughput of each model. Numerical results show that in any case the protocol with transparent proxy servers effect overall performance more than the one without transparent proxy servers, and furthermore the receiver initiated reliable multicast supported by transparent proxy servers gives better performance of total throughput than the one sender initiated reliable multicast. We provide efficiency criterion of the number of transparent proxy servers for each protocols for varying wireless loss probabilities.	multicast;profiling (computer programming);proxy server;throughput	Sung-Kwan Youm;Meejoung Kim;Chul-Hee Kang	2005	PCCC 2005. 24th IEEE International Performance, Computing, and Communications Conference, 2005.	10.1109/PCCC.2005.1460566	multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;wireless network;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;transport layer;xcast;computer network	Metrics	-2.0348755325353762	91.08786668388387	93808

We accordingly propose a virtual gradient based back-pressure scheduling algorithm, referred to as VBR. In VBR, intentional virtual queue, whose length (called virtual gradient) depends on the distance to destination, is first built at nodes in a network in the network configuration phase. In this way, virtual gradient is established at nodes in the network. In the network operation phase, the scheduling decision at each node needs to jointly consider both real queue length and virtual queue length. Simulation results show that VBR can obtain significant performance improvement on back-pressure based routing and scheduling, in terms of packet delivery ratio and average E2E delay.	algorithm;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;gradient;network packet;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;volume boot record	Meng Zhou;Zhenzhen Jiao;Wei Gong;Cheng Li;Baoxian Zhang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2015.7248830	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;backpressure routing;distributed computing;transmission delay;round-robin scheduling;computer network	Embedded	2.5803326047689246	94.05709780085661	93941

Unlike earlier studies – which assume two or more static buffers at the relay, one for each packet flow – we propose that the relay dynamically allocate buffer space to incoming packets without assuming the static capacities of their respective buffers. Such dynamic buffer allocation in our context thus operates much like two water tanks positioned side by side and connected at the bottom by a static open valve. Motivated by an increasing demand for real-time applications, we show the delay benefit of network coding for a generic wireless lossy butterfly network over classical scheduling schemes such as first-in first-out and round-robin schemes. To improve the performance further, we propose a simple scheduling algorithm, called buffer equalized opportunistic network coding, which operates much like a pair of water tanks with a sliding open valve in the middle to allow packets (water) to move across tanks. We show that the proposed scheme improves in terms of delay over the original model.	algorithm;fifo (computing and electronics);linear network coding;lossy compression;markov chain;network packet;open network computing remote procedure call;queueing theory;real-time clock;relay;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);synergy;traffic flow (computer networking)	Surachai Chieochan;Ekram Hossain;Teerawat Issariyakul;Dusit Niyato	2009	GLOBECOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425821	linear network coding;real-time computing;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;fifo and lifo accounting;computer science;resource management;markov process;queueing theory;scheduling;wireless;statistics;computer network	DB	3.5917264654527026	93.86193073103694	93974

The same principle is remodeled here to suit the IP network. The blocking probability thus measured is used as a flow admission decision parameter.

This paper presents the selective decoding schemes in MAC (SDS-MAC) protocol for MIMO ad hoc networks. It is able to mitigate interferences by means of a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) technique. As a result, it allows a pair of simultaneous transmissions to the same or different nodes to yield the network utilization increase. The decoding schemes and time line operations are properly selected corresponding to the transmission demand of neighboring nodes to avoid collision. Transmission demand can be determined by the number of RTS packets and type of CTS packets.

A two-level full factorial design of experiment (DOE) was conducted to identify the impact on the bandwidth and reliability of four factors: packet size, data streaming rate, time of the day, and buffer size in a real network environment. Two extreme cases for each factor were tested and statistical analysis is performed to characterize how different factors and their interactions may affect the bandwidth and reliability. The importance of this study is illustrated in the optimal channel selection mechanism where appropriate packet size, data streaming rate and buffer size can be chosen to achieve the best result.	bandwidth (signal processing);byte;clock rate;design of experiments;interaction;network packet;real-time clock;real-time transcription;streaming media;telecommunications link;throughput	Ana Elisa P.

Malicious flows such as UDP flows tend to occupy most of the buffer space leaving little or no room for TCP flows which have their own congestion control mechanism when congestion occurs. In this paper, we develop a modified CHOKe algorithm based on optimizing two main parameters; number of drop candidates (m) chosen for comparison with the incoming packet and the buffer location of those drop candidates (l) in order to improve the fairness. The simulation results show that the modified CHOKe has better performance compared to the original CHOKe, Random Early Detection (RED) and Drop Tail queue management mechanisms.	algorithm;fairness measure;integrated circuit layout design protection;network congestion;network packet;random early detection;simulation;stateless protocol	Medi A.

9189d385345e0f52b50e435dd3c5dc058aaafa7a	performance analysis of a new network access flow control method in computer communication networks	computer communication networks;performance analysis;flow control	Abstract#R##N##R##N#A new flow control rule for the network access level is introduced and its performance is investigated., The rule is based on measurements of the temporal changes of the traffic intensity. The admission of arriving local packets to a node is regulated dependent on the variations of local and transit traffic and the load in the neighbouring nodes. The objective of the new rule is to maximize the power (defined as the ratio of throughput and delay) for transit packets under consideration of a threshold value for local packets. This threshold serves to limit the unfairness for the local packets. A model for the node has been developed and evaluated by approximate analytical techniques. The performance results obtained enable the construction of a very efficient algorithm for the new flow control rule.	access network;flow control (data);profiling (computer programming);telecommunications network	Tadeus Uhl;Bruno Müller-Clostermann	1990	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.4460010304	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;flow control;traffic flow;computer network	Networks	0.489824578844333	96.70926671474125	94610

The first method is a simulation of the WiMAX networks in a network simulator (Network Simulator 3 — NS3) using the standard NS3 libraries. The second simulation implemented in NS3 as well, contains the code altered in a way that will allow implementing the RLNC (random linear network coding) method.	approximation;library (computing);linear network coding;multicast;network model;performance;profiling (computer programming);simulation	Florin Zamfir;Nicolae Paraschiv;Emil Pricop	2017	2017 4th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)	10.1109/CoDIT.2017.8102658	multicast;wireless sensor network;linear network coding;wimax;wireless wan;network simulation;computer network;computer science	HPC	-0.31079983248669274	90.76351452368232	94725

A single repeater is employed to allow a fully co~ected network structure. A channel can be chuacterhed as Inducing a low propagation-delay value, as for terrestrial radio or line networks, or as being associated with a higher propagation-delay value, as for a satellite communication cluumel. A synchronized (slotted) communication medium is considered. Messages are composed of a random number of packets, governed by an arbitrary message-length distribution. The process ‘describing the number of resewed message arrivals w&bin each time frame is assumed to be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables, governed by an arbitrary distribution. (A Poisson arrival stream thus becomes a special case.) The reservation access-control disciplines studied in this paper employ message-switching distributed-control procedures. The performance of each access-control scheme is evaluated according to Its delay-throughput function. IO particular, schemes are developed to adapt their structure, or protocol, dynamically to the underlying fluctuating network traffic-flow values. A fixed-reservation access-control (FRAC) discipline is studied, employing a fiied periodic pattern of reservation and service periods. The reservation periods are used for the transmission of reservation packets as well as for the integrated service of other groups of network stations. The latter stations can accesstkeduumelduriugtkese periods, using any proper access control procedure. As a specfal case, message-delay distributions and moments under a TDMA sckeme are obtalned. Using dynamic estimates of the underlying message traffic parameters, a dynamic f&d-reservation access-control (DFRAC) s&me ls obtained. An analytical teclmique, which employs a Markov ratio limit theorem, is presented for the derivation of the delay-throughput performance curves of dynamic demand-assignment reservation schemes. To illustrate its application, asynchronous reservation demand-assignment (ARDA) schemes are developed to adapt automatically to the underlying network traffic characteristics. Such schemes establish resewation slots dynamically according to observed network service demands and queue	access control;communications satellite;markov chain;network packet;network traffic control;propagation delay;random number generation;resource reservation protocol;software propagation;terrestrial television;throughput	Izhak Rubin	1979	IEEE Trans.

In particular, the authors pose resource allocation problems, present a sensitivity analysis, and provide a glimpse of the possible behavior of such networks. The simplest discipline is assumed: a service request is accepted if the necessary resources are available; otherwise it is rejected. Two results are obtained. The first gives the sensitivity of throughput of service requests of type i with respect to offered traffic and service rates of type j. The second result is that the set of vectors of achievable throughput rates is a convex polyhedron given by an explicit set of linear inequalities. >	telecommunications network;throughput	Scott Jordan;Pravin Varaiya	1991	IEEE Trans.

Its main innovative characteristic is the modulation of the rate increment by the distance between a flow’s present rate and an assumed targeted maximum rate as dictated by the associated application. The previous along with the shaping of the rate decrement by the reported flow’s losses are responsible for a dynamic and self-adjusting behavior that is shown to improve convergence to fairness, the oscillatory behavior of the rate and the induced packet losses when compared with the basic Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AI/MD) scheme. Numerical results illustrate the good properties and intrinsic advantages of the proposed scheme both under the considered modeling assumptions, as well as under more real networking conditions by employing the ns-2 simulator. A brief comparison of the proposed scheme with the TCP-compatible schemes TFRC, IIAD and the non-AI/MD schemes AIPD, LIMPD, is included as well. Because of the aforementioned induced behavior and assumed flow’s characteristics (min and max rates), the proposed congestion control scheme seems to be appropriate for regulating the rate of streaming applications.	additive model;artificial intelligence;converge;cryptographic hash function;fairness measure;increment and decrement operators;maxima and minima;modulation;molecular dynamics;network congestion;network packet;noise shaping;simulation;synapomorphy	Pantelis Balaouras;Ioannis Stavrakakis	2005	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2004.11.006	computer simulation;smoothness;active traffic management;simulation;systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;transmission control protocol;packet loss;network congestion;volumetric flow rate;equity;computer network;data transmission;modulation	Mobile	-0.16962738333914146	102.18968808130458	95116

A key problem with much of the literature on random models is that they produce unrealistic node movement trajectory and have limitations viz., border effect, un-sociological behavior and memory less mobility phenomenon. This paper presents a novel community mobility model, which provide a foundation for generating realistic mobility traces and mimics real-world scenarios. The analytical results validate its performance, extensive simulation experiments are conducted through steady state space analysis.	approximation;coloured petri net;experiment;microprocessor;modified huffman coding;next-generation network;programming paradigm;routing;simulation;state space;steady state;tracing (software);viz: the computer game	Naeem Akhtar Khan;Farooq Ahmad;Syed Asad Hussain;Sher Afzal Khan	2015	2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)	10.1109/ICMLA.2015.110	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;mobility model;wireless;computer network	Mobile	3.426587188794266	88.89871838303019	95290

A message should be received at the destination before its deadline expires. Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) appears to be one of the most common communication network access schemes that can be used in distributed hard real-time systems. In this paper, we propose a new real-time network access protocol which is based on the CSMAjCD scheme. The protocol classifies the messages into two classes as ‘critical’ and ‘noncritical’ messages. The messages close to their deadlines are considered to be critical. A critical message is given the right to access the network by preempting a noncritical message in transmission. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the protocol. It is shown that the protocol can provide considerable improvement over the virtual time CSMAjCD protocol proposed for hard real-time communication by Zhao et al.‘.	access network;collision detection;experiment;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications network	Özgür Ulusoy	1995	Computer Communications	10.1016/0140-3664(96)81593-3	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;communications system;computer network	Embedded	4.180650109278465	93.13872554610228	95320

RSVP-TE uses a soft-state control mechanism to manage lightpaths. In the soft-state control mechanism, each node sets a timer for each control state and resets the timer with refresh messages to maintain the state. When the timer expires due to losses of refresh messages, the control state is initialized and a reserved resource managed with the state is released. It has been considered that resource utilization of soft-state protocols is inferior to that of hard-state protocols since soft-state protocols may reserve resources until control states are deleted due to timeout. Therefore, some extensions to promote the performance of softstate protocols, such as message retransmission, have been considered. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of GMPLS RSVP-TE and its variants with a Markov model and analyze the performance of RSVP-TE. From the results, we demonstrate that resource utilization of RSVP-TE can be equivalent to that of a hard-state protocol when the loss probability of signaling messages is low. We also investigate the effectiveness of message retransmission and show that using message retransmission leads to poor resource utilization in some cases.

c98889265358bcd1fa17c7e214d7d4f15f3738d5	caps: coding-based adaptive packet spraying to reduce flow completion time in data center		Modern data-center applications generate a diverse mix of short and long flows with different performance requirements and weaknesses. The short flows are typically delay-sensitive but to suffer the head-of-line blocking and out-of-order problems. Recent solutions prioritize the short flows to meet their latency requirements, while damaging the throughput-sensitive long flows. To solve these problems, we design a Coding-based Adaptive Packet Spraying (CAPS) that effectively mitigates the negative impact of short and long flows on each other. To exploit the availability of multiple paths and avoid the head-of-line blocking, CAPS spreads the packets of short flows to all paths, while the long flows are limited to a few paths with Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP). Meanwhile, to resolve the out-of-order problem with low overhead, CAPS encodes the short flows using forward error correction (FEC) technology and adjusts the coding redundancy according to the blocking probability. The coding layer is deployed between the TCP and IP layers, without any modifications on the existing TCP/IP protocols. The experimental results of NS2 simulation and Mininet implementation show that CAPS significantly reduces the average flow completion time of short flows by ~30% −70% over the state-of-the-art multipath transmission schemes and achieves the high throughput for long flows with negligible traffic overhead.	blocking (computing);data center;encode;equal-cost multi-path routing;erlang (unit);error detection and correction;forward error correction;internet protocol suite;multipath propagation;network packet;out-of-order execution;overhead (computing);requirement;routing in delay-tolerant networking;simulation;testbed;throughput	Jinbin Hu;Jiawei Huang;Wenjun Lv;Yutao Zhou;Jianxing Wang;Tian He	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8486354	throughput;computer network;redundancy (engineering);multipath propagation;latency (engineering);forward error correction;internet protocol;computer science;exploit;network packet	Networks	-3.9894443793202674	91.47602346399265	95458

There have been some proposals in delay-intensive networks, such as satellite networks as well as underwater networks, that address the variability of system state for tuning the access window. In this paper, we propose a new parametric dynamic reservation access scheme with an aim to improve the system utilization. We first analyze the system performance in many-to-one multi-access with long propagation delay data transfer scenario with the assumption of perfect propagation delay information and with fixed number of access slots. We then investigate the proposed system state aware approach to suitably adjust the number of access slots and investigate the optimum slotting strategy to maximize the system utilization. Via mathematical analysis, supported by discrete event simulations, we show that the system utilization and blocking probability with our proposed modified reservation protocol is consistently better compared to the competitive reservation protocols with fixed as well as dynamic access slots.	blocking (computing);communications protocol;erlang (unit);one-to-many (data model);propagation delay;queueing theory;radio frequency;simulation;software propagation;spatial variability	Priyatosh Mandal;Swades De	2012	2012 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2012.6399325	communications protocol;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;discrete event simulation;computer network	Mobile	3.22119499979266	97.96753434354613	95526
8556fcbcb08bab62427e9ec7a723cc63b2a3d4ba	distributed spatial reuse distance control for basic safety messages in sdma-based vanets	hidden terminals;interference;basic safety message;vehicular ad hoc network;distributed algorithm;space division multiple access	The periodic generation and transmission of basic safety messages (BSM) place a heavy burden on the load of a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), where there also remain multiple packet collisions undetected due to the hidden terminals. In this paper, we propose a distributed scheme that controls the spatial reuse distance to improve the efficiency of BSM transmissions in space-division multiple access (SDMA) based VANETs. With the proposed SDMA structure, only vehicles located sufficiently far apart are allowed to reuse the same time slot to send their BSMs. The signal interference is thus reduced while the hidden-node problem is essentially alleviated. Multiple transmissions per SDMA road segment or 'cell' are also enabled using the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), giving rise to a much better use of both space and bandwidth. To guarantee that the actual number of BSM transmissions does not exceed the maximum allowable in each SDMA cell, we further devise an adaptive scheme that adjusts the spatial reuse distance in accordance with the vehicle density. Because the global information of vehicle density is not available at individual vehicles, we propose a distributed algorithm that estimates the vehicle density and makes consensus to enhance the accuracy of spatial reuse distance estimation. As the transmission range is controlled accordingly, the mutual interference among the SDMA cells is further reduced. Importantly, the developed control algorithm can be distributively implemented by each vehicle with limited information exchange. To optimize the performance of the proposed solution, we also determine the optimal bandwidth utilization that maximizes the newly-defined criterion termed as 'safe range,' an important figure-of-merit in vehicular safety applications. Simulation results confirm the clear advantages of our proposal over the available approaches in terms of safety range, packet reception rate, end-to-end delay and BSM inter-arrival time in realistic network scenarios.

Given the network capacity and the characteristics of the service, we determine the number of subscribers that can be served in the scenarios with and without admission control. The results depend on the activity grade of the subscribers, and on the session blocking probability and/or the packet loss probability that can be tolerated. For a broad range of both probability parameters, the comparison shows a clear benefit of admission control, which permits an increase of the number of subscribers by up to 30%. The benefit of admission control decreases as the subscriber activity grade increases.(a)	best, worst and average case;blocking (computing);common access card;erlang (unit);network packet;offset binary;scott continuity	Gert Van Hoey;Danny De Vleeschauwer;Bart Steyaert;Veronique Inghelbrecht;Herwig Bruneel	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24693-0_30	telecommunications;computer science;access control;packet loss;computer security;dimensioning;computer network	Networks	0.7682158538883742	101.48955670322877	96053

They schedule time slots depending on the channel state and queue length in the base station. Although queue length is correlated with the QoS of real-time applications, the essential performance measure of real-time applications is the playout buffer starvation probability. This study proposes a new scheduling algorithm, the playout-buffer-sensitive (PB) rule, which can efficiently support a mixture of real-time and elastic traffic. The PB rule achieves sufficient QoS for the real-time class as well as allocating higher throughput for the best effort class than the existing algorithms. We numerically show that the efficiency of the PB rule is much closer to the theoretical upper bound than the other algorithms.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;network packet;numerical analysis;playout;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;scheduling (computing);throughput;time complexity	Masaki Fukushima;Hajime Nakamura;Shinichi Nomoto	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

In this environment, intelligent handover decision, beyond traditional ones that are based on only signal strength, is needed so that terminals can select the best option available from diverse networks and services as per user requirements. In the process, it would enable user applications to switch automatically between active interfaces that best suit them based on application requirements and interface capabilities and to use multiple radio interfaces simultaneously ensuring the optimum usage of the network resources available to the terminal. To fulfill the above requirements, this paper proposes the design and implementation of a context-aware vertical handover decision algorithm suitable for multimode mobile devices in heterogeneous networks based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).	algorithm;mobile device;requirement;user requirements document	Tansir Ahmed;Kyandoghere Kyamakya;Markus Ludwig	2006		10.1145/1141277.1141547	real-time computing;heterogeneous network;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	9.311638531661615	98.7836156865993	96096

They, however, require perfect channel prediction before transmission and rarely consider algorithms under the link layer. Instead of perfect channel prediction, most wireless systems adopt the Link Level Retransmission (LLR) algorithm within the link layer for recovering channel errors. However, the LLR algorithm does not work well with the previous prediction-based wireless fair queueing algorithms. Therefore, we propose a new wireless fair queueing algorithm, Wireless Fair Queueing with Retransmission (WFQ-R), which is well matched with the LLR algorithm and does not require channel prediction. In the WFQ-R algorithm, the share consumed by retransmission is regarded as a debt of the retransmitted flow to the other flows. So, the WFQ-R algorithm achieves wireless fairness with the LLR algorithm by penalizing flows that use wireless resources without permission in the link layer. Through analyses, we proved that the WFQ-R algorithm guarantees throughput and delay fairness. Through simulations, we showed that our WFQ-R algorithm maintains fairness adaptively. Furthermore, our WFQ-R algorithm is able to achieve flow separation and compensation.	algorithm;fair queuing;network packet;retransmission (data networks)	Namgi Kim;Hyunsoo Yoon	2005	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2004.10.012	weighted fair queueing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;computer network	Networks	2.763321469518634	102.52299696130596	96121

We demonstrate this approach by measuring the key state parameters of Internet paths, the characteristics of queueing delay, in a part of the European Internet. In the paper we describe in detail the ETOMIC measurement platform that was used to conduct the experiments, and the applied method of queueing delay tomography. The main results of the paper are maps showing various spatial structure in the characteristics of queueing delay corresponding to the resolved part of the European Internet. These maps reveal that the average queueing delay of network segments spans more than two orders of magnitude, and that the distribution of this quantity is very well fitted by the log-normal distribution.	dynamical system;experiment;integrated project support environment;internet;network congestion;prototype;queuing delay;romp;requirement;tomography;unicast	Gábor Simon;József Stéger;Péter Hága;István Csabai;Gábor Vattay	2005	CoRR		simulation;network tomography;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;complex network;internet traffic engineering;statistics;computer network;network mapping	Metrics	-2.394919816429865	98.85483058462933	96350

Given that the licensed or Primary Users (PUs) are oblivious to the presence of unlicensed or Secondary Users (SUs), Cognitive Radio (CR) is a new paradigm in wireless communication that allows the SUs to detect and use the underutilized licensed spectrums opportunistically and temporarily. In this paper, we propose a Context-aware and Intelligent Dynamic Channel Selection scheme that helps SUs to select channel adaptively for data transmission to enhance QoS, particularly throughput and delay. Our scheme is suitable for CR networks with mobile hosts. We formulate and design our scheme using Reinforcement Learning that offers a simple and yet practical solution. Channel heterogeneity, which is a feature unique to CR networks that has been ignored in previous studies, is considered in this paper. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme achieves very good performance.	bit error rate;c2net;cognitive radio;context awareness;ibm systems network architecture;multi-agent system;multiplexing;network packet;one-class classification;programming paradigm;rate of convergence;reinforcement learning;simulation;throughput	Kok-Lim Alvin Yau;Peter Komisarczuk;Paul D.

In this paper we focus on the tradeoff between the accuracy and the complexity of the mathematical models used to describe user movements in the network. We propose a novel Markov chain based model capable of utilizing user's movement history thus providing more accurate results than other models in the literature. The new model is applicable in real-life scenarios, because it relies on information effectively available in cellular networks (e.g. handover history). The complexity of the proposed model is analyzed, and the accuracy is justified by means of simulation.	pattern recognition	Péter Fülöp;Sándor Imre;Sándor Szabó;Tamás Szálka	2009	Mobile Information Systems	10.3233/MIS-2009-0084	simulation;prediction;telecommunications;computer science;handover;operating system;computer network	Mobile	9.4655984854815	100.05250630605254	96694

It can provide 100% rate-guaranteed service with only a two-cell buffer at each crosspoint, and can also support best-effort service with an additional bandwidth regulator. However, the widely used max- flow model for bandwidth regulation is neither scalable nor of 100% throughput. In order to evaluate the performance of bandwidth regulator, we first introduce the 100% ideal throughput measurement in this paper. Then we prove that the total arrival average (TAA) algorithm has got this property, which does not happen in the max-flow allocation. Then an O(N) algorithm called proportion scaling allocation (PSA) is presented. Simulations reveal that PSA can deliver nearly 100% throughput even in a frequently changing traffic pattern. As a comparison, both theoretical and experimental evidences are given to show the inefficiency of the max-flow model.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;computer simulation;crossbar switch;image scaling;maximum flow problem;polar surface area;scalability;smoothing;the 100;throughput	Yi Wang;Simin He;Youjian Zhao;Qiang Zheng;Wen Gao	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.472	best-effort delivery;real-time computing;index term;telecommunications;computer science;telecommunications service;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	HPC	-0.9569742055859926	96.6638219904313	96805

A-ECN can adaptively adjust ECN marking thresholds in different scenarios to achieve good generality. Therefore, network operators can directly deploy A-ECN in various environments regardless of underlying queue types and bandwidth.	arithmetic underflow;data center;explicit congestion notification;item unique identification	Shuo Wang;Jiao Zhang;Tao Huang;Tian Pan;Jiang Liu;Yunjie Liu	2017	2017 IEEE 25th International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	10.1109/ICNP.2017.8117569	throughput;operator (computer programming);arithmetic underflow;computer network;network congestion;computer science;distributed computing;queueing theory;generality;queue;bandwidth (signal processing)	Visualization	-2.9640169657156235	94.31002349192165	96864

However, IP multicast does not provide reliable data transfer which makes it unsuitable for distributing software or a large amount of textual information over the network. We propose a reliable multicast protocol which is designed specifically for a unidirectional satellite link, called reliable multicast over unidirectional satellite link (RMUS). In our design, we consider characteristics of the unidirectional satellite link with long latency delays and often with high bandwidth on the downstream link but narrow return paths. RMUS provides error and congestion control to multicast transmission. RMUS ensures data reliability by having the receivers detect packet loss and report it to the sender. The sender collects data loss information and uses a selective repeat algorithm to retransmit loss packets. RMUS minimizes the acknowledgement process in order to protect the return path from congestion and also to protect the sender from ACK implosion. As for congestion control, RMUS monitors the current condition of the network and adjusts the transmission rate accordingly. The data rate adjustment is designed to effectively utilize the available bandwidth without causing network congestion. Our experimental results show that RMUS provides reliable multicast communication and effectively utilizes the available bandwidth compared to other flow control schemes.	multicast	Patcharee Basu;Kanchana Kanchanasut	2003		10.1109/SAINT.2003.1183080	multicast;reliable multicast;telecommunications;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;network congestion;xcast;computer network	Mobile	-3.9234534552528584	90.63037452448249	96908

We have devised a method to solve the corresponding Markov process efficiently for orbits of up to five satellites. For orbits consisting of a larger number of satellites, we have developed an approximate decomposition algorithm to compute the call-blocking probabilities by decomposing the system into smaller subsystems and iteratively solving each subsystem in isolation using the exact Markov process. Our approach can capture blocking due to handoffs for both satellite-fixed and earth-fixed constellations. Numerical results demonstrate that our method is accurate for a wide range of traffic patterns and for orbits with a number of satellites that is representative of commercial satellite systems.	approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);numerical method	Abdul Halim Zaim;George N.

Based on this system model and the basic concepts, we propose two opportunistic channel selection algorithms to optimize the throughput of the secondary user: minimum collision rate channel selection algorithm and minimum handoff rate channel selection algorithm. According to the two algorithms, we, respectively, present the channel selection scheme based on minimum collision rate algorithm (CSS-MCRA) and the channel selection scheme based on minimum handoff rate algorithm (CSS-MHRA) under the constraint that the collision probability is bounded below collision tolerable level. Theoretical analysis and simulation results both show that, on one hand, both CSS-MCRA scheme and CSS-MHRA can follow the constraint of collision tolerable level; on the other hand, the performance of CSS-MCRA scheme is better than that of CSS-MHRA scheme if handoff latency is zero or very low, while the performance of CSS-MHRA scheme is better than that of CSS-MCRA scheme if handoff latency is long enough.	cognitive radio	Qinghai Xiao;Yunzhou Li;Ming Zhao;Shidong Zhou;Jing Wang	2009	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2009.06.015	simulation;systems modeling;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;computer network	HCI	2.562856856229541	102.5907238391843	97033

As a result, extensive research has been conducted to solve these two problems, such as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). However, CSMA-like protocols cannot solve both of these two problems at once. The fundamental reason lies in the fact that they cannot obtain accurate Channel Usage Information (CUI, who is transmitting or receiving nearby) with a low cost. To obtain additional CUI in a cost-efficient way, we propose a cross layer design, FAST (Full-duplex Attachment System). FAST contains a PHY layer Attachment Coding, which transmits control information independently on the air, without degrading the effective throughput of the original data traffic, and a MAC layer Attachment Sense, which utilizes the PHY layer control information to identify the hidden and exposed nodes in real time. We theoretically analyze the feasibility of the Attachment Coding, and then implement it on a GNU Radio testbed consisting of eight USRP2 nodes. We also conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FAST, and the experimental results show that FAST can effectively solve both the hidden and the exposed terminal problems, and improve the average throughput by up to 200% over CSMA in practical ad-hoc networks.	attachments;cognitive radio;cost efficiency;duplex (telecommunications);gnu radio;hoc (programming language);mimo;phy (chip);parallel ata;real-time locating system;regular expression;simulation;testbed;throughput;transmitter;verification and validation	Lu Wang;Kaishun Wu;Mounir Hamdi	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.092712.120628	wireless ad hoc network;communications protocol;exposed node problem;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;bit error rate;telecommunications;computer science;access control;wireless network;signal processing;noise reduction;interference;coding;implementation;computer security;hidden node problem;wireless;encoding;computer network	Mobile	9.073389950241825	92.26307607368813	97089
81ef921eb6cf5207b68994595913c549aa193bda	contention window-based deadlock-free mac for blind rendezvous in cognitive radio ad hoc networks		Cognitive radio (CR) technology is a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity problem. Due to the spectrum varying nature of CR networks, unlicensed users are required to perform channel hopping to realize blind rendezvous. However, blind rendezvous can easily cause deadlock in the network. Moreover, due to the nature of blind rendezvous, a deadlock cannot be detected by either the suffering users or other users. Consequently, a deadlock will eventually cause the whole network stuck and prohibit the network throughput. In this paper, the challenge of deadlock-free blind rendezvous in CR networks is addressed for the first time. By analyzing the deadlock issues in both two-user and multi-user scenarios, we propose a novel MAC protocol with an optimal contention window size which can avoid deadlock and provide high network throughput. In addition, we also propose a probabilistic model for analyzing the network performance with our MAC. Simulation results validate our analytical model and demonstrate that our proposed protocol outperforms other possible attempts.	ch c/c++ interpreter;cognitive radio;deadlock;exposing to the right;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;multi-user;network performance;rendezvous protocol;scenario (computing);simulation;statistical model;throughput	Xingya Liu;Jiang Xie	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417327	throughput;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.014467082625991	91.24390816503211	97124

End-to-end congestion control using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) packet marking has the potential to solve this problem. In this paper, we develop and evaluate ECN mechanisms for switches with input-buffered configuration (typical for InfiniBand), as opposed to traditional techniques that target outputbuffered switches. Our mechanisms vary in two dimensions: the condition that triggers a marking event, and the set of packets marked at such an event. The experimental results show that our approaches avoid congestion spreading while preserving high network throughput. In addition, selective marking of packets at all input buffers on each marking event provides better fairness than a naive mechanism that marks only packets in a full input buffer. Finally, schemes that use state at both input and output ports to trigger marking events can improve fairness over purely inputtriggered marking schemes.	blocking (computing);bottleneck (network);data buffer;end-to-end principle;erlang (unit);explicit congestion notification;fairness measure;flow control (data);ip traceback;infiniband;input/output;interaction;item unique identification;network congestion;network packet;network performance;network switch;sensor;throughput	Jose Renato Santos;Yoshio Turner;G.

One way to reduce channel zapping time is a predictive tuning method, which reduces channel zapping time by prejoining channels that are likely to be selected next, in addition to the currently watched channel. This paper presents an improved predictive tuning method that satisfies required channel zapping time with minimized bandwidth usage. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method determines the most efficient number of prejoining channels in a surfing period and in a viewing period differently by estimating expected channel zapping time and expected bandwidth usage with a Semi-Markov Process. We also propose a prejoining channel selection method according to the combined button and channel preference. Mathematical model and simulation show that the proposed method achieves the required channel zapping time with less bandwidth consumption and a more stable network than previous works.	algorithm;emoticon;iptv;markov property;mathematical model;performance tuning;qualitative comparative analysis;semiconductor industry;set-top box;simulation	Chae-Young Lee;Chang Ki Hong;Kang Yong Lee	2010	IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting	10.1109/TBC.2010.2051494	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;markov process;statistics;computer network	Mobile	-2.1273870410750333	102.37049351036427	97403

We extend the equivalent method of Butto to the multiservice case. We finally present some numerical studies on small networks, showing that the inclusion of two moments produces conservative evaluations, and quantify the change in performance measure brought about by the use of two-moment methods.	integrated services digital network;performance evaluation	Anouck Girard;H.

We verify the analytical model via simulations. Then, based on the model, we analyze the call blocking and dropping probabilities of iCAR system with and without call admission control (CAC) schemes. The fractional guard channel scheme is deployed as the CAC scheme in the iCAR system. From the analytical and simulation results, we find that although the iCAR system has much lower call dropping probability than cellular networks, when the traffic load is high, it still cannot guarantee a low call dropping probability without CAC schemes. It is anticipated that the analytical model reported in this paper will serve as a guideline for handoff performance evaluation and CAC scheme design of the iCAR system.	blocking (computing);common access card;erlang (unit);hoc (programming language);markov chain;performance evaluation;simulation	Zhaoji Xu;Nan Hu;Zhiqiang He	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.257	markov chain;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	5.212012706719826	98.34869021140007	97504

Realistic traffic loads in wireless local area networks (WLANs) with multimedia applications often exhibit the bursty and self-similar properties which imply the frequent occurrence of the large bursts of frame arrivals and thus require the TXOP scheme to be dynamically adapted to the traffic characteristics. This paper presents a dynamic TXOP scheme which adjusts the TXOP limits of mobile stations according to the current status of their transmission queues. We further develop an analytical model to evaluate the performance of this scheme under self-similar traffic. QoS performance metrics in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay, and frame loss probability are derived and validated via NS2 simulation experiments. The numerical results reveal that the dynamic TXOP scheme achieves the better QoS than the original one under self-similar traffic.	end-to-end principle;experiment;numerical analysis;self-similarity;simulation;throughput	Geyong Min;Jia Hu;Michael E.

c7e011459bd9b7d64408ee1f1e0dda41d42d4a09	a fuzzy-based mechanism for delay window adjustment to improve tcp performance in wireless multi-hop networks		TCP protocol was initially designed for wired networks to guarantee reliable data transfer. In wired networks, TCP assumes congestion if data packets are dropped. However, this assumption does not hold when the end-to-end path includes wireless links, where, high bit error rate (BER), shared medium and dynamic nature of the wireless channel may cause packet loss. This results in a severe degrade in performance of standard TCP in wireless networks. On the other hand, TCP cannot be changed fundamentally due to the large base of installation in the wired network. Delayed-ACK generation at the TCP receiver has been proposed to mitigate collision rate within wireless network. However, choosing appropriate delayed window size is an important issue. In this article, we propose a new delayed-ACK approach based on a fuzzy controller to improve TCP performance in wireless networks. The major advantage of our mechanism is reducing the overhead and the collision rate in multi-hop wireless networks. We also compare ou...

Till now, a draft of the IEEE 802.11e enhanced distributed coordination function (EDCF) has been proposed. In the literature, there is very limited analysis about EDCF since it is a new protocol, and most related work are only confined to simulation or saturation state. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of EDCF by dividing the traffic into two groups, namely real-time packets and non-real-time packets, and use an analytical model to quantify the performance of both IFS priority and contention window (CW) priority in the EDCF. In our analysis, we assume that the traffic arrival is a Poisson process. We provide a queue model for EDCF. Since there are multiple stations contending for one channel in the system, the queue model for EDCF cannot be a regular M/G/1 model. We redefine the service time and the waiting time so that we can still use M/G/1 model in the analysis. To validate the accuracy of our analytical results, we have done extensive simulations and we observed that EDCF does provide service differentiation between different traffic categories. But due to the inherent contention characteristic of carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) MAC protocol, the delay cannot be guaranteed, even for the highest priority traffic. A lot more work needs to be done for the MAC protocol to effectively support service differentiation in the future.

Each receiver of a mobile node may receive a packet in the presence of collision depending on the receiver quality defined as capture ratio. The maximum throughput per mobile node depends exclusively on the number of receivers per node and the capture ratio. Since the maximum throughput is independent of the variable factors of the network, the network is self-optimized. The self-optimized throughput increases with the increase of the number of receivers per node and the quality of each receiver (defined as capture ratio). On the other hand, the cost per mobile node also increases with the increase of the number of receivers per node and the quality of each receiver. The trade-off between the self-optimized throughput per node and the cost per mobile node is analyzed. In mission critical networking system, most of the traffic may be the real-time traffic, where the number of retransmission attempts is limited. The normalized delay is almost constant if the number of retransmission attempts is more than eight. However, the packet rejection probability decreases with the increase of the number of retransmission attempts.	mission critical;random access	Jahangir H. Sarker;H. T.

Sincronia uses a simple greedy mechanism to periodically order all unfinished coflows; each host sets priorities for its flows using corresponding coflow order and offloads the flow scheduling and rate allocation to the underlying priority-enabled transport layer. We evaluate Sincronia over a real testbed comprising 16-servers and commodity switches, and using simulations across a variety of workloads. Evaluation results suggest that Sincronia not only admits a practical, near-optimal design but also improves upon state-of-the-art network designs for coflows (sometimes by as much as 8X)."""	greedy algorithm;network planning and design;network switch;optimal design;scheduling (computing);simulation;testbed	Saksham Agarwal;Shijin Rajakrishnan;Akshay Narayan;Rachit Agarwal;David B.

However, current packet dispersion techniques were developed for wired network environments and can provide inaccurate results in wireless networks due to wireless capacity variability over short time scales. This paper develops an analytical model to investigate packet dispersion behavior in wireless networks. The packet dispersion model is validated using both an extended ns-2 simulator that includes 802.11 MAC layer rate adaptation and wireless 802.11b testbed measurements. Utilizing the model, this study shows that packet dispersion measures effective capacity and achievable throughput of wireless networks instead of the maximum capacity as in wired networks. Additionally, mean and variance of packet dispersion in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks is analyzed while considering the impact of channel conditions such as packet size, link rate, bit error rate and RTS/CTS	bit error rate;carpal tunnel syndrome;glossary of computer graphics;heart rate variability;maximum throughput scheduling;network packet;rs-232;testbed;x.690	Mingzhe Li;Mark Claypool;Robert E.

In order to avoid the degradation of network performance when congestion appears, several congestion management mechanisms have been proposed. Most of these mechanisms are based on explicit congestion notification. For this purpose, switches detect congestion and depending on the applied strategy, packets are marked to warn the source hosts. In response, source hosts apply some corrective actions to adjust their packet injection rate. Although these proposals seem quite effective, they either exhibit some drawbacks or are partial solutions. Some of them introduce some penalties over the flows not responsible for congestion, whereas others can cope only with congestion situations that last for a short time. In this paper, we present an overview of the different strategies to detect and correct congestion in multistage interconnection networks, and propose a new mechanism referred to as Marking and Validation Congestion Management (MVCM), targeted to this kind of lossless networks, and based on a more refined packet marking strategy combined with a fair set of corrective actions, that makes the mechanism able to effectively manage congestion regardless of the congestion degree. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed mechanism.

Unlike the well-known p-persistent CSMA for modeling the legacy IEEE 802.11 MAC, the proposed protocol truly exploits the p-persistent transmission capability for this MAC. Moreover, the protocol is not restricted to IEEE 802.11 and, in fact, it can be executed on the top of a pre-existent access protocol without introducing additional overhead. When considered with WLAN, this protocol can optimize the throughput of the wireless network by setting the optimal transmission probability in the IEEE 802.11 MAC according to the throughput calculation given in this paper. The key characteristics of this protocol are represented by its simplicity, integration with the Standard, complete distribution, absence of modifications to the original IEEE 802.11 MAC frame format, and no requirement of extra messages being shared by the cooperating nodes. Analysis and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the p-persistent protocol in achieving the optimal throughput and in improving the frame delay. In addition, the protocol can be easily extended to be a distributed priority mechanism, which requires further research.	distributed transmission system;performance evaluation	Jain-Shing Liu	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.6.1837	ieee 802.11s;address resolution protocol;reverse address resolution protocol;network allocation vector;user datagram protocol;systems modeling;ieee 802.1x;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;internet protocol control protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;access control;link control protocol;transmission control protocol;ieee 802.11h-2003;tunneling protocol;ieee 802.11r-2008;computer security;spanning tree protocol;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005;internetwork protocol;ieee 802.1q	Mobile	2.776941724525147	102.06023330419272	98689

More precisely, we show that when such sources share a buffer with deterministic service rate, a constraint on the tail of the buffer occupancy distribution is a linear constraint on the number of sources. That is, for a small loss probability one can assume that each source transmits at a fixed rate called its effective bandwidth. When traffic parameters are known, effective bandwidths can be calculated and may be used to obtain a circuit-switched style call acceptance and routing algorithm for ATM networks. The important feature of the effective bandwidth of a source is that it is a characteristic of that source and the acceptable loss probability only. Thus, the effective bandwidth of a source does not depend on the number of sources sharing the buffer or tbe model parameters of other types of sources sharing the buffer.	atm turbo;algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);circuit switching;markov chain;routing	George Kesidis;Jean C.

In a cognitive radio network, secondary users (SUs) need to sense the spectrum to obtain currently available channels and have to vacate the occupied channels when primary users (PUs) return. In cognitive radio networks, establishing a link through a common available channel is defined as the rendezvous process between two SUs. Channel hopping is a widely used method to solve the rendezvous problem that two SUs hop according to a designed channel hopping sequence until they meet on a common available channel. Past works on rendezvous focus on designing the channel hopping sequence while ignoring the necessary RTS-and-CTS exchange process to build a link when two SUs hop to a common available channel. However, during the initialization phase of a cognitive radio network (CRN), each SU may try to rendezvous with other SUs to exchange control information. There is no explicit role for an SU, since it cannot determine if other SUs are senders or receivers currently. Therefore, in this paper, we define a send-or-receive problem in a rendezvous process of SUs during the initialization phase of a CRN and propose a new rendezvous problem as the link rendezvous problem. We also propose a blind rendezvous scheme to solve the link rendezvous problem considering practical scenarios in a CRN. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes can achieve a fast successful link rendezvous considering the send-or-receive problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that addresses the link rendezvous problem in a cognitive radio ad-hoc network.	carpal tunnel syndrome;cognitive radio;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hoc (programming language);polynomial-time approximation scheme;regular expression;simulation;superuser	Ji Li;Jiang Xie	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842215	wireless ad hoc network;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;process control;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	9.876074330723627	91.3231996913663	99348

The proposed scenario controls all mobile terminals separately. To dedicate control of each user, this scenario induces rate control (RC), MT status indication (MSI), and rate variation indication (RVI). It supports a large variance of the data rate due to the estimation of the mobile location and speed. To verify the performance of the proposed scenario, we investigated a portion of overshoot, goodput and delay. The results shows that the proposed scenario can utilize the reverse link resource efficiently by providing a rapid adaptation and accurate control of the data rate.	expectation–maximization algorithm;telecommunications link;throughput	Young-uk Chung;Dong-Ho Cho	2002		10.1109/VTC.2002.1002765	real-time computing;adaptive control;telecommunications;computer science;circuit switching;computer network	Mobile	6.692930270472335	96.76633750885452	99618

Burst level resource allocation is one such dynamic control. Potential benefits and other issues for burst level (in-call) resource parameter negotiations for bursty data traffic over high speed wide area packet networks have been discussed earlier in [l-51. A detailed analysis of an adaptive buffer/window negotiation scheme for long file transfers using these concepts is presented in [l]. In this paper we discuss two in-call bufferhvindow negotiation schemes for short intermittent file transfers, focusing on the specific needs of such traffic streams. We develop closed network of queues models to reflect the behavior of the proposed schemes. These models, while being simple, capture essential details of the control schemes. Under fairly g e n d assumptions, the resulting network of queues is of product form and can be analyzed using the mean value analysis [l]. We use such an analysis to compare the proposed schemes and to determine appropriate sizes of trunk buffers to achieve the desired balance between bandwidth utilization and file transfer delay. The effects of other parameters on the performance of these schemes as well as on the buffer sizing rules are also discussed. In-call parameter negotiation may be carried out by the end system with the network elements or by the access controller with the internal network elements. We discuss implications of this location as well as the needed protocol features. Finally, the service discrimination capabilities desired at the trunk controllers in switching nodes are briefly discussed.	case-based reasoning;end system;file transfer;intranet;network packet	Bharat T.

5efb1ccd7f8e84145e255dfca4505ba6658f2eb3	performance evaluation of fairness between high-speed tcps in wireless environment		Among various TCP congestion controls proposed for high delay-bandwidth networks thus far, CUBIC and Compound TCP have been implemented as default congestion control in Linux and Microsoft Windows OS, respectively. CUBIC is loss-based high-speed congestion control. Compound TCP is constructed with NewReno TCP and delay-based high-speed congestion control. When these two versions of TCP shares bottleneck link, their aggressiveness and different behaviors might fall into unfair condition. In current network environment, bandwidth of wired networks is sufficiently large and a wireless access network can be one of the most likely bottleneck points. This wireless access network has different feature than wired networks, i.e. wireless caused loss which occurs independently of congestion. In this paper, we evaluate fairness among CUBIC and Compound TCP sessions sharing high-speed wireless channel. Our simulation results show that Compound TCP is seriously suffered by CUBIC with low loss rate and this unfair condition is relieved with increase of packet loss rate because loss based CUBIC is gradually degraded by wireless caused packet loss.	fairness measure;performance evaluation	Hiroki Mihara;Yuki Hayashi;Miki Yamamoto	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-38227-7_5	fairness measure;computer network	Mobile	-3.233357669395256	92.58362893901723	99715

The idea is to use congestion pricing as an effective approach to control traffic rate for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) flows, with Explicit Congestion Notification as a congestion feedback mechanism, by taking into account network users’ willingness-to-pay. With multitude of competing TCP flows, congestion pricing ensures that the higher the user’s willingness-to-pay, the higher the traffic throughput. We implement the congestion pricing approach on the ns-2 simulator and evaluate its performance on both geostationary and non-geostationary satellite IP networks. Simulation results show that congestion pricing can be adopted as an effective approach for service differentiation in satellite IP networks and achieves fair relative service differentiation.	algorithm;differentiated service;eclipse;experiment;explicit congestion notification;fairness measure;feedback;geosynchronous satellite;internet protocol suite;lossy compression;network congestion;propagation delay;really simple discovery;simulation;software propagation;throughput	Wei Koong Chai;Kin-Hon Ho;George Pavlou	2006		10.1007/11759355_24	internet protocol;congestion pricing;pricing;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;active traffic management;tcp global synchronization;telecommunications;computer science;transmission control protocol;explicit congestion notification;feedback;h-tcp;tcp tuning;implementation;network congestion;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;telecommunications network;computer network	Networks	0.33841646388409685	102.38120042747735	100181
0f228c413fc545f2f810a4c635c0a85fc63f822b	optimization and performance analysis of high speed mobile access network		Cost-effective end-to-end performance is one of the key objectives which should be optimised for any broadband wireless network. Even though the radio channel is an important scarce resource, the rest of the mobile access network must respond according to the time variant radio channel capacity, otherwise a good overall performance cannot be achieved effectively. The packet traffic of high speed mobile access networks often has a bursty nature which causes a severe impact on the performance. For the reasons given above, a proper control of data flows over the access network is required. In a modern mobile access network not only the throughput optimization has to be considered, but also the QoS for different service requirements should be guaranteed at a minimum cost. The main focus of this work is the performance evaluation of High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) networks. In addition, the effects of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) transport network (S1and X2 interfaces) on the end user performance are investigated and analysed by introducing a novel comprehensive MAC scheduling scheme and a novel transport service differentiation model. In order to achieve the aforementioned goals, new transport technologies and features are introduced within the focus of this work. Novel adaptive flow control and enhanced congestion control algorithms are proposed, implemented, tested and validated using a comprehensive HSPA system simulator which is developed by the author. In addition to the development of HSPA network protocols, novel scheduling approaches are introduced and developed in the HSPA system simulator for the downlink and the uplink. Therefore, the system simulator provides great flexibility and enhanced scalability for the analysis of the overall network performance for all protocol layers from the applications to the physical layer. Effects of the adaptive flow control and the congestion control algorithms on the end-toend performance have been investigated and analysed using detailed HSPA system simulations. These analyses confirm that aforementioned algorithms do not only enhance the end user performance by providing guaranteed QoS but also optimise the overall network utilisation and performance. Further, the algorithms are able to provide for both the network operators and the end users reliable and guaranteed services cost-effectively.

The models appear interesting because no one action is optimal and all the actions have to be chosen successively. A preliminary analysis of a linear learning automaton acting in such environments is presented, and certain mathematical questions of convergence which arise are brought to light. The analysis reveals that the automaton tends to equalize the penalty probabilities. Simulation studies of the abstract models as well as the routing of calls in telephone networks appear to reinforce the analytical results and the relevance of such models.	automaton;relevance;routing;simulation	Kumpati S.

Compared to other algorithms, it is modular and intuitive in a first approach, and so is implemented and used nowadays. In this paper, we adapt the discipline to schedule critical real-time flows mixed with other kinds of traffic, as is necessary in a DiffServ environment This requires that some guarantees must be provided deterministically, particularly on queueing delay bounds. Yet theoretical delay bounds for CBQ were never expressed in a general case and with end-to-end derivation, because the nesting of mechanisms makes it hard to predict a worst case scenario. Here we study some cases where an analysis is possible, focusing on two variants of CBQ, and we use network calculus technique to set up a bound that seems realistic. We then show simulations to check the precision of our results.	bandwidth (signal processing);class-based queueing;deterministic algorithm;differentiated services;end-to-end principle;entity framework;fair queuing;network calculus;network packet;offset binary;queuing delay;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);simulation;weighted fair queueing;weighted round robin;worst-case scenario	Anne Millet;Zoubir Mammeri	2004	Twelfth IEEE International Workshop on Quality of Service, 2004.

In light of this, we propose a new rate adaptation scheme, termed as the Rate Adaptation using Coherence Time (REACT), that has the following key features. First, without exchanging RTS and CTS frames, the receiver in REACT informs the transmitter of the improved channel condition via altering the ACK transmission rate, so that the transmitter increases the data rate for subsequent data frames. This enables the transmitter to adapt to the time-varying channel conditions while inducing the marginal overhead. Second, the transmitter in REACT can identify the reasons of frame losses by exploiting the feedback from the receiver and the estimated coherence time. Frame losses are assumed to be caused only by collisions for the duration of the coherence time after receiving an ACK frame with the altered bit rate. The coherence time is also used to enhance the adaptive RTS probing, so that the REACT can prevent the transmitter from decreasing its bit rate when collisions occur. Extensive simulations reveal that REACT consistently performs better than the other rate adaptation schemes (ARF, CARA, RRAA, and RBAR) in all the testing	acknowledgement (data networks);acoustic radiation force;carpal tunnel syndrome;data rate units;institute for operations research and the management sciences;marginal model;overhead (computing);risk aversion;simulation;transmitter	Hakyung Jung;Ted Taekyoung Kwon;Kideok Cho;Yanghee Choi	2011	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2011.01.011	real-time computing;telecommunications;coherence time	Mobile	8.999193566531767	90.72895625767228	100633

The method is based on the analysis of the interference statistics and takes into account slowly varying shadowing and best base station assignment, as well as the effect of the nonuniform traffic distribution induced transmission failures. As an example of application of the technique, two protocols are considered: (1) the classic slotted ALOHA, for which a comprehensive study in a realistic wireless environment has not yet been presented, despite the many analyses published in the past; and (2) the capture division packet access (CDPA). An important conclusion of our study is that if power control and best cell site assignment are jointly used, the performance loss due to slow shadowing is almost negligible.	network packet;software propagation;unified framework	Michele Zorzi;Flaminio Borgonovo	2000	IEEE Trans.

Various anticollision protocols have been proposed, but the majority require considerable additional resources and costs. Distributed Color System (DCS) is a state-of-the-art protocol based on time division, without noteworthy additional requirements. This paper presents the Probabilistic DCS (PDCS) reader-to-reader anticollision protocol which employs probabilistic collision resolution. Differently from previous time division protocols, PDCS allows multichannel transmissions, according to international RFID regulations. A theoretical analysis is provided in order to clearly identify the behavior of the additional parameter representing the probability. The proposed protocol maintains the features of DCS, achieving more efficiency. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the number of reader-to-reader collisions after a slot change is decreased by over 30%. The simulation analysis validates the theoretical results, and shows that PDCS reaches better performance than state-of-the-art reader-to-reader anticollision protocols.	collision problem;hash table;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;requirement;simulation	Filippo Gandino;Renato Ferrero;Bartolomeo Montrucchio;Maurizio Rebaudengo	2011	J.

Two schools of thought have emerged: the first investigates changes to the transport-layer protocol, whereas the second explores the potential to enhance the characteristics of lower layers to improve the end-to-end performance of TCP. This study focuses on the latter, and, in contrast to most research in this area, which thus-far has concentrated on a single TCP flavour, examines the case where different TCP flavours are competing over a wireless link. To this end, the authors present and assess a cross-layer solution to adapt the coding rate at the link-layer based on the detected TCP flavour, to maximise fairness among TCP flows. Through both analysis and simulation, the authors show that the proposed scheme considerably improves the fairness among different TCP flavours that compete over a wireless link. Furthermore, the proposed approach has minimal detrimental effect on the aggregate throughput of TCP flows.	aggregate data;end-to-end principle;error detection and correction;fairness measure;forward error correction;optimal design;simulation;throughput	Toktam Mahmoodi;Vasilis Friderikos;Oliver Holland;Hamid Aghvami	2010	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2009.0394	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;tcp global synchronization;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;zeta-tcp;scalable tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;statistics;computer network	Mobile	2.789441990564404	101.35334103801422	100968

We broadly classified these services into the delay-sensitive (DS) class and the loss-sensitive (LS) class. The scheduling problem for two priority classes is much more complex than the single priority class counterpart. The scheduling algorithm is required to satisfy two conflicting requirements: (i) maintaining the cell delay of DS traffic within an acceptable range by giving it a higher transmission priority; (ii) minimizing the cell loss probability of LS traffic. In this paper, we present a distributed reservation-based scheduling algorithm that can effectively handle the requirements of both the DS and LS classes at the same time. The performance of the proposed method is compared with two other scheduling approaches via simulation. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.	atm turbo;algorithm;link-state routing protocol;non-functional requirement;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation	Derek Chi-Wai Pao;S.

bc070bf9b5f4bf432db0e632bb53ca494d54d2f3	an adaptive opportunistic network coding mechanism in wireless multimedia sensor networks		The network coding technique is promising for improving the performance of video communication in wireless multimedia sensor networks. However, some special characteristics of existing wireless network coding mechanisms degrade the performance of video data delivery. This work begins with a thorough investigation and understanding of the performance limitations of existing wireless network coding mechanisms. On this basis, we propose an Adaptive Opportunistic Network Coding mechanism (AONC) to improve the transmission quality of video stream in wireless multimedia sensor networks. First, we propose a novel asymmetric coding method to process the video data of different lengths. The aim is to improve data exchange gain. Second, we design an opportunistic forwarding strategy based on dynamic priority to ensure that packets have a better chance to be coded and transmitted, thus achieving much higher throughput. Finally, we present a traffic-aware data scheduling algorithm, working together with the above network coding mechanism, to reduce the loss of potential coding opportunities. Our simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the existing typical network coding mechanisms, AONC can greatly enhance video transmission quality and efficiently utilize bandwidth and energy resources.	algorithm;data compression;linear network coding;network congestion;port forwarding;prototype;scheduling (computing);simulation;streaming media;throughput	Hang Shen;Guangwei Bai;Lu Zhao;Zhenmin Tang	2012	IJDSN	10.1155/2012/565604	linear network coding;real-time computing;wireless wan;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;multiple description coding;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	0.9705601860143491	91.19277163639971	101078

The traffic is considered to be divided into traffic classes, characterised by statistical parameters like peak and average bandwidth and by quality of service (QoS) requirements that allow to define a feasibility region: where requirements are guaranteed A model to describe the 'call admission' is proposed: two different cost functions, based on the blocking probability, are defined and minimised, taking into account the 'feasibility region' constraint: the first function is intended to obtain the minimum overall blocking probability, whereas the second is aimed to balance the blocking probability among classes. The maximum number of acceptable calls yielded by each cost function is obtained for each class, by minimising it under stationary traffic conditions. The efficiency of the proposed strategy is tested by simulations and verified by comparing it with other admission schemes.	atm turbo	Raffaele Bolla;Franco Davoli;Mario Marchese	1995		10.1109/ICCCN.1995.540178	minimisation;real-time computing;quality of service;call-second;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;probability;queueing theory;traffic volume;statistics;computer network;traffic equations	Networks	0.17080862075050735	96.63091264476259	101128

But in the general CDMA system environment, this relative portion cannot be varied while keeping the arrival rate fixed, the assertion of which is elaborated on. The modification on the arrival rate leads to the conclusion on system performance, opposite to that made by the previous study that measures such as blocking and handoff refused probability become poorer as the area of the soft handoff region gets larger.	profiling (computer programming)	Eun Seon Cho;Go Whan Jin	2003		10.1109/PIMRC.2003.1259239	code division multiple access;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;soft handover;computer network	Robotics	7.741890915334036	100.52950803486102	101314
829bd5f049fcf88a796ffb0139b705f3d0d30b5e	node-based service-balanced scheduling for provably guaranteed throughput and evacuation time performance		"""This paper focuses on the design of <italic>provably efficient online</italic> link scheduling algorithms for multi-hop wireless networks. We consider single-hop traffic and the one-hop interference model. The objective is twofold: 1) <italic>maximizing the throughput</italic> when the flow sources continuously inject packets into the network, and 2) <italic>minimizing the evacuation time</italic> when there are no future packet arrivals. The prior work mostly employs the link-based approach, which leads to throughput-efficient algorithms but often does not guarantee satisfactory evacuation time performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Node-based Service-Balanced (NSB) online scheduling algorithm. NSB aims to give scheduling opportunities to heavily congested nodes in a balanced manner, by maximizing the total weight of the scheduled nodes in each scheduling cycle, where the weight of a node is determined by its workload and whether the node was scheduled in the previous scheduling cycle(s). We rigorously prove that NSB guarantees to achieve an efficiency ratio no worse (or no smaller) than <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$2/3$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href=""""ji-ieq1-2777828.gif""""/> </alternatives></inline-formula> for the throughput and an approximation ratio no worse (or no greater) than <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$3/2$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""""ji-ieq2-2777828.gif""""/></alternatives></inline-formula> for the evacuation time. It is remarkable that NSB is both throughput-optimal and evacuation-time-optimal if the underlying network graph is bipartite. Further, we develop a lower-complexity NSB algorithm, called LC-NSB, which provides the same performance guarantees as NSB.

I n this paper, we propose and study Multi-Code CDMA (MC-CDMA) with Distributed-Queueing Request Update Multiple Access (DQR UMA) for multi-rate wireless packet networks. The network incorporates MC-CD MA (a flexible multiplexing scheme for providing multi-rate packet transmissions) and DQRUMA (an eficient demandassignment multiple access protocol f o r wireless access and schedulang) to form a unified bandwidth-ondemand fair-sharing platform f o r multi-rwte wireless services. A slot-by-slot packet transmit scheduling policy provides the possibility of slot-by-slot allocation of Pseudo-Noise (PN) codes (primary codes) and optimal power levels t o the mobiles involved in packet transmissions. Also, a Maximum Capacity Power Allocation (MCPA) criterion is derived to exploit the subcode concatenation property of the MC-G‘DMA transmission. Simulation results show that the system provides close to ideal-access performance fo r multi-rate mobiles, both with homogeneous trafic charaderistics and with a mix of heterogeneous traffic characteristics.	atm turbo;access control;code;concatenation;multiplexing;network packet;scheduling (computing);simulation;uniform memory access	Zhao Liu;Mark J.

TCP Westwood controls the window using end-to-end connection bandwidth share estimation. The key innovative idea is to continuously estimate, at the TCP sender, the packet rate of the connection by monitoring the ACK reception rate. The estimated connection rate is then used to compute congestion window and slow start threshold settings after a congestion episode. Resetting the window to match available bandwidth makes TCPW more robust to sporadic losses due to wireless channel problems. An analytic model using Markov Chain techniques is developed in this paper, and then used to assess the performance improvements obtained using TCPW. The model takes into account the estimation and filtering method used in TCPW, as well as the following system parameters, bottleneck link bandwidth, buffer space at the bottleneck router, end-to-end propagation time, and error rate. The model reveals substantial TCPW gains over Reno whenever losses due to link or other errors are taken into consideration. The analytic model accuracy is confirmed by comparing to simulation results. The results match very well for the range of parameter values of interest.	acknowledgement (data networks);bottleneck (network);end-to-end principle;glossary of computer graphics;markov chain;network congestion;network packet;performance evaluation;propagation time;router (computing);simulation;software propagation;tcp congestion control	Andrea Zanella;Gregorio Procissi;Mario Gerla;M.

During ubiquitous data exploitation in these lossy networks, a data-conserving method coherent with coding and transmission scheme is essential. This study centers upon several basic reconstruction methods for unapprehended parts in the voice data gathered at the end-point of a real multi-hop Audio Sensor Network (ASN). Considering gathered voice signals, error concealment (EC) methods are inherently applied over lost packets in the testbed. Around 6,000 real single-path transmission tests are verified with an instrumental simulation. Besides, EC schemes are supported with a multi-path transmission in which data aggregation occurs at certain intervals. Nearly 300,000 qualitative results show that perceptual quality can be preserved promisingly with the utilization of low cost affordable correction techniques.	coherence (physics);data aggregation;error concealment;imperative programming;lossy compression;simulation;speech coding;testbed	Okan Turkes;Sebnem Baydere	2012		10.1145/2348688.2348697	g.729;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;communication	Mobile	-1.6350622451042525	88.78270597117331	101762

They perform a variety of network functions such as WAN optimization, intrusion detection, and network-level firewalls. Processing packets to serve these functions often require multiple middlebox resources, e.g., CPU and link band-width. Furthermore, different packet traffic flows may consume significantly different amounts of various resources, depending on the network functions that are applied. Multi-resource fair queueing is therefore needed to allow flows to share multiple middlebox resources in a fair manner. In this paper, we clarify the fairness requirements of a queueing scheme and present Dominant Resource Generalized Processor Sharing (DRGPS), a fluid flow-based fair queueing idealization that strictly realizes Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) at all times. As a form of Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) running on multiple resources, DRGPS serves as a benchmark that practical packet-by-packet fair queueing algorithm should follow. With DRGPS, techniques and insights that have been developed for traditional fair queueing can be leveraged to schedule multiple resources. As a case study, we extend Worst-case Fair Weighted Fair Queueing (WF2Q) to the multi-resource setting and analyze its performance.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);central processing unit;fair queuing;fairness measure;firewall (computing);generalized processor sharing;global positioning system;intrusion detection system;mathematical optimization;middlebox;network packet;network scheduler;proportionally fair;requirement;wan optimization;weighted fair queueing	Wei Wang;Ben Liang;Baochun Li	2013	2013 IEEE/ACM 21st International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)	10.1109/IWQoS.2013.6550275	weighted fair queueing;generalized processor sharing;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;fair queuing;layered queueing network;distributed computing;queueing theory;network congestion;statistics;computer network	Networks	-2.236036560314779	94.52742990703659	101827

In recent years, IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLANs) have been widely deployed, and more and more mobile devices have built-in WLAN interfaces. However, WLAN employs the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) medium access control (MAC) protocol, which consumes a significant portion of the energy resources of a mobile device. Hence, minimizing the energy consumption of the WLAN interface in mobile devices has recently attracted considerable interest in both academia and industry. This article provides a survey and an experimental study of the energy consumption issues and energy-efficient technologies of the MAC protocol in IEEE 802.11 WLAN. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

d8ecb8dc90ffc5178c259915eafd96c4ae835a15	timing analysis of rate-constrained traffic in ttethernet using network calculus	upper bound;network calculus;timing analysis;ttethernet	TTEthernet is a deterministic, synchronized and congestion-free network protocol based on the Ethernet standard and compliant with the ARINC 664p7 standard network. It supports safety-critical real-time applications by offering different traffic classes: static time-triggered (TT) traffic, rate-constrained (RC) traffic with bounded end-to-end latencies and best-effort traffic, for which no guarantees are provided. TTEthernet uses three integration policies for sharing the network among the traffic classes: shuffling, preemption and timely block. In this paper, we propose an analysis based on network calculus (NC) to determine the worst-case end-to-end delays of RC traffic in TTEthernet. The main contribution of this paper is capturing the effects of all the integration policies on the latency bounds of RC traffic using NC, and the consideration of relative frame offsets of TT traffic to reduce the pessimism of the RC analysis. The proposed analysis is evaluated on several test cases, including realistic applications (e.g., Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle), and compared to related works.	aggregate data;best, worst and average case;best-effort delivery;blocking (computing);communications protocol;computation;deterministic algorithm;end-to-end principle;network calculus;network congestion;preemption (computing);real-time clock;scalability;static timing analysis;test case;time complexity	Luxi Zhao;Paul Pop;Qiao Li;Junyan Chen;Huagang Xiong	2016	Real-Time Systems	10.1007/s11241-016-9265-0	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;static timing analysis	Embedded	1.5517994974293965	94.58263283835417	102371

The value of M depends on the traffic intensity and increases with the packet arrival rate. In this paper, we develop simple mathematical models for the upper and lower bounds on K as a function of M, with N as a parameter taking into account the above active terminal patterns. The models developed are useful in determining the maximum and minimum transmission frame durations for the performance evaluation of binary type LAN protocols and other reservation type LAN protocols which employ binary tree type probing algorithm. In the case of integrated traffic, when frame duration is to be fixed, the model will enable to optimize bandwidth allocation to different types of traffic.	algorithm;binary tree;mathematical model;maxima and minima;network packet;performance evaluation;queueing theory;tree structure	Jagan P.

Moreover to enhance the granularity of the error or loss detection mechanism in the AAL5 PDUs, we also modified the AAL5 PDU trailer fields so that each cell comprising the AAL5 PDU has a sequence number field. The simulation results show that the peak-to-peak PDV of the AAL5 PDU by the proposed method is less than 69.4% to that by AAL5. Moreover, the AAL5 user-HDTV decoder-receives the same or more error-free transport packets in the proposed algorithm than those in the ITU-T AAL5 for the same network simulation environment.	atm turbo;case-based reasoning;lossy compression;network packet;transport layer security	JongMoo Sohn;JongIck Lee;MoonKey Lee;InHwa Hong;ByungRyul Lee	1998		10.1109/ICCCN.1998.998759	cyclic redundancy check;intelligent network;real-time computing;jitter;encapsulation;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;network simulation;standard deviation;packet switching;computer network	Networks	-3.4602653404508317	98.00983649845188	102499

This way the negative effects experienced by deploying the original linear RED drop probability function are improved so that link under-utilization and heavy oscillations are avoided and the function is applicable to a wide load range. As it is impossible to include all of these requirements in one approach, we show two separate approaches and combine them at the end. The first approach aims at avoiding link under-utilization and is achieved heuristically. Therefore we provide a few examples from simulations to illustrate that the original linear RED drop function fails to avoid under-utilization and is not applicable to a wide load range. We use these examples to define conditions a proper drop function has to meet in order for under-utilization to be avoided. Bearing these conditions in mind, we propose a heuristic approach, where even a class of non-linear drop functions originates, with, apart from the usual RED parameters, one parameter free to define. Simple simulations show that such a non-linearity in the drop function should be preferred concerning the metric of under-utilization. According to the second approach the drop function is derived analytically based on the condition to achieve system stability, i.e. to avoid heavy oscillations. Here, we use a mathematical model for the TCP window queue size behavior of a router operating with TCP and apply control theory for the derivation process. The term stability refers to the oscillation amplitude of the steady state queue size, whereas heavy oscillations indicate an unstable state. The analytically derived function is polynomial and can be approximated by using the findings of the first approach. The derived function thus avoids both under-utilization and heavy oscillations. The applicability to an arbitrary load range is included automatically in the derivation process. The impacts of parameter variations are investigated. Simulative comparisons of the derived function with ARED and with GRED (parameter variation included) with both FTP and Web traffic clearly attest to the advantage of the derivation process and to an improvement in RED performance, especially in metrics, such as link utilization, forced drops and queue size variation. 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In the paper, we propose a simple analytical model, which helps one obtain deep insight into the mechanism of achieving optimal performance by using IEEE 802.11 DCF (Distributed Coordination Function) protocol. The first contribution of this paper is the analysis of the optimal operation point where maximum goodput can be achieved. Through the analysis, we answer some fundamental questions about the existence and the uniqueness of the optimal operation point; about the maximum system goodput can be achieved; about the existence of a simple rule to check out if the system operates under the optimal state or not; and how do the data transmission rates, which is dependent on the selected physical transmission mode, and packet transmission errors, caused by channel fading and (or) interference, affect the final system performance. Another contribution is the proposal of a simple distributed adaptive scheme ‘‘LABS’’ (i.e., Link adaptation and Adaptive Backoff Scheme), which makes the system operate under the optimal operation point and, at the same time, achieves some pre-defined target service differentiation ratio between different traffic flows. In the LABS, two adaptive schemes are combined: one is the so called ‘‘Link Adaptation’’ scheme, which dynamically selects an optimal modulation mode at a given time so as to improve the achieved system goodput; the other one is the so called ‘‘Adaptive Backoff’’ scheme, which adaptively adjusts the minimum contention window size of each sending node to guarantee that the system operates under (or near) the optimal operation point. Results obtained in the paper are relevant to both theoretical research and implementation of real systems. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, many quality of service (QoS) issues still need to be achieved such as balance between cell transfer delay (CTD) and cell loss rate (CLR), absence of cell delay variation (CDV) and network traffic utilisation. The main problem with wireless ATM is how to overcome the unreliability of the wireless link in order to maintain QoS requirements especially for variable bit rate (VBR) application. Here, we propose a model that provides QoS support for ATM virtual connections (VC) and solves the unreliability problem of the wireless ATM through an efficient DLC protocol for bursty VBR traffic. This model mainly concerns with enhancing QoS to gain error-free wireless transmission and regulating VBR Traffic.

Although IEEE802.11e (EDCA) standard is concerned to support QoS in wireless networks, it cannot provide strict QoS required by real-time and multimedia services without proper network control mechanisms. The recent standard 802.11n introduced new MAC access mechanism based on aggregation scheme. In this paper, we aim to develop an analytical model for throughput and end-to-end delay under unsaturated 802.11n network taking in consideration the different Access Categories (AC) priorities. Based on simulation results, we demonstrate that even with aggregation mechanism, 802.11n is not able to guarantee QoS for high priority traffics.	control system;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;quality of service;real-time transcription;simulation;throughput	Emna Charfi;Lamia Chaari;Lotfi Kamoun	2011	2011 4th Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference (WMNC 2011)	10.1109/WMNC.2011.6097243	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network	Mobile	3.0721990160841237	96.21602053515268	103138

Clearly, the transmission QoS is significantly degraded when the big data transmissions are done through the TCP protocol over a high interference LTE-A environment. The issue of providing high data rate and high reliability transmissions in cloud computing needs to be addressed completely. Thus, this paper proposes a cross-layer-based adaptive TCP algorithm to gather the LTE-A network states (e.g., AMC, CQI, relay link state, available bandwidth, etc.), and then feeds the state information back to the TCP sender for accurately executing the network congestion control of TCP. As a result, by using the accurate TCP congestion window (cwnd) under a high interference LTE-A, the number of timeouts and packet losses are significantly decreased. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the compared approaches in goodput and fairness, especially in high interference environment. Especially, the goodput of the proposed approach is 139.42 % higher than that of NewReno when the wireless loss increases up to 4 %. Furthermore, the throughput and the response functions are mathematically analyzed. The analysis results can justify the claims of the proposed approach.	advanced mezzanine card;algorithm;big data;cloud computing;common look and feel;compaq lte;data rate units;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;frequency response;goodput;interference (communication);link-state routing protocol;network congestion;network packet;performance;real-time clock;relay;response time (technology);tcp congestion control;throughput;window function	Ben-Jye Chang;Yi-Hsuan Li;Shin-Pin Chen;Ying-Hsin Liang	2016	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-015-1117-7	compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;tcp hole punching;distributed computing;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network	Mobile	-3.8264955938910354	91.88562652493593	103172

However, medium access control (MAC) based on IEEE 802.11 traditional random backoff protocols that are suitable for throughput-sensitive data services cannot satisfy the performance of voice services. Therefore, in this paper we propose an improved MAC based on medium reservations, called EMDA. EMDA improves significantly the optional Mesh Deterministic Access (MDA) MAC, to provide a much higher voice call capacity thanks to voice packet aggregation feasibility and much less MDA signaling overhead. EMDA is based on a per-node reservation of a block of contiguous transmission opportunities that are properly dimensioned. Moreover, we further improve the near-deterministic access of EMDA by using short jamming periods just before these reservations. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed MAC enlarges the voice capacity and uniformly distribute it over the WMN. It also provide a better performance in guaranteeing hard delay constraints, lower jitter and lower packet losses compared to other MAC.	access control;backhaul (telecommunications);backoff;computers, freedom and privacy conference;network packet;overhead (computing);radio jamming;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;wireless mesh network	Racha Ben Ali;Abdelhakim Senhaji Hafid;Jihene Rezgui	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.072512.111738	ieee 802.11s;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;access control;resource management;interference;wireless;computer network	Mobile	5.335905052458553	95.1349801319055	103586

However, these protocols do not necessarily guarantee a fair allocation of wireless medium among contending flows. Our objective in this paper is to adaptively adjust the flow-rates of contending flows, so that each gets fair access to the medium. This adaptive adjustment will also ensure high packet delivery ratio and optimal utilization of wireless medium. We use a deterministic approach to adaptively improve the performance of the suffered flows in the network through mutual negotiation between contending flows. In this paper we have also suggested the use of directional antenna to further reduce the contention between the flows in the wireless medium. The proposed scheme is evaluated on QualNet network simulator to demonstrate that our scheme guarantees fairness to all contending flows.	access control;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);network packet	Dola Saha;Siuli Roy;Somprakash Bandyopadhyay;Tetsuro Ueda;Shinsuke Tanaka	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-30536-1_19	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;business;computer security;computer network	Mobile	8.012642927423089	91.96482207569072	103695

Many recent rate adaptation schemes adopt the RTS/CTS mechanism to prevent collision losses from triggering unnecessary rate decrease. However, the RTS/CTS handshake incurs significant overhead and is rarely activated in today's infrastructure WLANs. In this paper we propose a new rate adaptation scheme that mitigates the collision effect on the operation of rate adaptation. In contrast to previous approaches adopting fixed rate-increasing and decreasing thresholds, our scheme varies threshold values based on the measured network status. Using the """"retry"""" information in 802.11 MAC headers as feedback, we enable the transmitter to gauge current network state. The proposed rate adaptation scheme does not require additional probing overhead incurred by RTS/CTS exchanges and can be easily deployed without changes in firmware.

31332c5212b09402061d96a1fe74fbfde0a470dc	state-dependent bandwidth sharing policies for wireless multirate loss networks		We consider a reference cell of fixed capacity in a wireless cellular network while concentrating on next-generation network architectures. The cell accommodates new and handover calls from different service-classes. Arriving calls follow a random or quasi-random process and compete for service in the cell under two bandwidth sharing policies: 1) a probabilistic threshold (PrTH) policy or 2) the multiple fractional channel reservation (MFCR) policy. In the PrTH policy, if the number of in-service calls (new or handover) of a service-class exceeds a threshold (difference between new and handover calls), then an arriving call of the same service-class is accepted in the cell with a predefined state-dependent probability. In the MFCR policy, a real number of channels is reserved to benefit calls of certain service-classes; thus, a service priority is introduced. The cell is modeled as a multirate loss system. Under the PrTH policy, call-level performance measures are determined via accurate convolution algorithms, while under the MFCR policy, via approximate but efficient models. Furthermore, we discuss the applicability of the proposed models in 4G/5G networks. The accuracy of the proposed models is verified through simulation. Comparison against other models reveals the necessity of the new models and policies.	approximation algorithm;compaq lte;convolution;erlang (unit);load balancing (computing);low-discrepancy sequence;multitier architecture;next-generation network;policy-based design;recursion;simulation;stochastic process	Ioannis D.

Quantitative analysis in this paper based on the IEEE 802.15.4 specification shows a high probability of the continuous hidden node collisions (CHNCs), which seriously decreases network throughput. Based on this observation, we propose a cost-efficient recovery mechanism to achieve fast self-healing when LR-WPANs suffer CHNCs, while introducing no overhead when there are no collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed protocol in terms of network throughput and power saving. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Many proposals of its performance analysis and modifications to remove its limitations are proposed. In this paper we are considering some recent proposals to make a detailed study of the performance comparison between DCF, CONTI, k-EC, and PREMA, which are various contention resolution schemes proposed in various independent researches. The criteria for performance comparison that we use are collision rate, throughput, and average delay between successful transmissions. Also, we consider queuing delay using an exponential on-off based unsaturated model for these protocols whose implementation and performance is consistent with the saturated mode used in the above contention schemes.	access control;design rule for camera file system;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);profiling (computer programming);queuing delay;simulation;software deployment;switch;throughput;time complexity	Amran Kabir;Mahjabeen Alam;Lubna Ahmed;Sanjida Sabah;Hasan Shahid Ferdous	2012	2012 18th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2012.6388275	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Embedded	6.45381335495586	93.97739424300029	104557
72aa74b7a21ad61b24db3e0fcfce30b8c5bdbe89	opportunistic medium access control for maximizing packet delivery rate in dynamic access networks	opportunistic access;packet success probability;channel quality;channel availability	One of the key challenges to enabling efficient cognitive radio (CR) communications is how to perform opportunistic medium access control (MAC) that maximizes spectrum efficiency. Several CRN MAC protocols have been designed assuming relatively static primary radio (PR) channels with average idle durations largely exceed CR transmission times. For such CR environment, typical multichannel MAC protocols, which select the best quality channel, perform reasonably well. However, when such mechanism is employed in a CRN that coexists with highly dynamic licensed PR networks (PRNs), where PR channel idle durations are comparable to CR transmission times, the forced-termination rate for CR transmission can significantly increase, leading to a reduction in network throughput. To reduce the forced-termination rate, many MAC protocols have been proposed to account for the dynamic time-varying nature of PR channels by requiring communicating CR users to consistently perform channel switching according to PR activities. However, such channel-switching strategy introduces significant overhead and latency, which negatively affect network throughput. Hence, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic channel quality- and availability-aware CRN MAC. Our protocol uses a novel channel assignment mechanism that attempts at maximizing the packet success probability of each transmission and hence avoids the significant overhead and latency of channel switching. Simulation results show that by being quality- and availability-aware, our protocol provides better spectrum utilization by decreasing the forced-termination rate and improving network throughput.	access control;access network;network packet	Haythem Bany Salameh;Osamah S.

The proposed schemes are designed to allow the retransmission(s) only once using one or multiple channels simultaneously, unlike other ARQ/HARQ schemes where the retransmission(s) of a link packet can only be in one channel and continue until it is successfully received. By using the application throughput as the objective, the optimal retransmission policy can be determined based on the estimated channel quality and the size of the application-layer protocol data unit. For these two schemes, we show their improvement of the link packet delay and derive formulas of the application throughput, which are then validated via simulations. In addition, a cost analysis for systems adopting the proposed schemes is included. Next, the optimized MF ARQ/HARQ schemes are shown to be able to achieve better effective throughput (goodput) than similar multichannel ARQ/HARQ schemes in various Nakagami-m fading environments. Analytical and simulation results show, when optimized, that the MF HARQ scheme has much better throughput performance than the MF ARQ scheme in highly unreliable environments. We thus conclude that both the MF ARQ scheme and the MF HARQ scheme are excellent ARQ candidates for real-time multimedia transport in the multiradio multichannel environment.	bit error rate;end-to-end principle;goodput;hybrid automatic repeat request;lagrange multiplier;loss function;maxima and minima;metafont;network packet;optimization problem;profiling (computer programming);real-time transcription;retransmission (data networks);simulation;smart card application protocol data unit;throughput;x.690	Yao-Liang Chung;Zsehong Tsai	2010	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2010.2053396	communications protocol;hybrid automatic repeat request;transmitter;throughput;real-time computing;strontium;selective repeat arq;telecommunications;computer science;cost–benefit analysis;protocol data unit;markov process;estimation theory;automatic repeat request;medium frequency;statistics;computer network	Mobile	2.944486218683046	100.50662654621304	104633
ad3be0beeead298a154c8a7a8899786af628795f	q-learning based co-operative spectrum mobility in cognitive radio networks		In cognitive radio systems, fast and efficient spectrum selection is a vital task to minimize the overhead of spectrum scanning, and hence to improve the response time of the system. So, the choice of channel sensing sequence plays an important role for better performance of the system. This paper proposes a co-operative Q-learning based spectrum sensing technique for the secondary users of an ad hoc network to access the primary channels. By the proposed technique, every secondary user (SU) maintains a dynamic priority list of channels based on Q-learning from its own action-observation history, as well as from spatial channel information exchange among its local neighbors. Whenever there is a demand an SU scans the spectrum according to the order in the priority list until there is a success. Simulation studies show that with significantly less computing and scanning overhead, our proposed Q-learning based approach improves the response time and call block / drop rate to offer better performance compared to other contemporary reinforcement learning based approaches.	cognitive radio;hoc (programming language);information exchange;overhead (computing);q-learning;quality of service;reinforcement learning;response time (technology);simulation;superuser;transceiver;value (computer science)	Avirup Das;Sasthi C.

We have proposed an O(n1ogn) algorithm to characterize the bandwidth-buffer tradeoff for the optimal resource management. However, it can not be applied to a general multimedia network with multiple relay-servers. In this paper, we extend our problem model to consider relay-servers. In each relayserver, an O(n1ogn) algorithm is proposed to decide the optimal bandwidth-buffer trade-ofJ: With these pre-computed tradeoff functions, an O(m) QoS control procedure is designed to allocate the suitable bandwidth for the available buffer, where m is the number of relay-servers in the assigned transmission path.	algorithm;computation;precomputation;relay;volume boot record	Ray-I Chang;Meng Chang Chen;Ming-Tat Ko;Jan-Ming Ho	1999		10.1109/MMCS.1999.778134	algorithm design;real-time computing;optimal control;resource allocation;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;bandwidth;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Embedded	-4.505196520532376	99.87157085664498	104695

In this work, we design an experimental test-bed for evaluating an un-slotted spectrum access scheme under real indoor environment conditions. To this end, we use the USRP software defined radio platform along with the GNURadio software that incorporates the PHY and MAC functions and modules. Our contribution is multi-fold. First, we design a MAC protocol to integrate the packet based transmission of the coexisting PU#x002F;SU network, while compensating for spectrum sensing imperfection as well as collision detection faults. Second, we evaluate the USRP-induced latency (delay) and show that it has random behavior.We work around it to obtain a fixed packet transmission time which is crucial for the channel access scheme realization and evaluation. Third, we perform helping experiments to quantify the spectrum sensing imperfection in terms of false alarm and detection probabilities. We also quantify the imperfection in collision detection. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the whole channel access scheme and compare its results to the classical sense-transmit scheme. We show that 28.5% increase in SU throughput can be achieved for the same PU packet collision rate.	cognitive radio;collision detection;collision domain;dynamical system;experiment;field-programmable gate array;gnu radio;ibm systems network architecture;network packet;one-class classification;phy (chip);packet switching;testbed;throughput;universal software radio peripheral	Yahia Shabara;Amr Mohamed;Abdulla K.

We analyze such queues by exploiting a result expressing the distribution of work in system of the G / G / l queue originally derived by BeneS. We provide a simple alternative demonstration of this result and extend it to the case of fluid input systems. The result is applied first to a queue where the arrival process is a superposition of periodic sources (the E D , / D / 1 queue), and then to a variable input rate constant output rate fluid system. The latter is shown to model the so-called burst component of the considered superposition queueing process. The difference between this and the real queue, the cell component, can he evaluated by means of the results obtained for the C D , / D / l queue.

Queueing theory is the mathematical study of queues, proven to be applicable to a wide area of problems, generally concerning about the (average) quantities in an equilibrium state. Since both network calculus and queueing theory are analytical tools for studying queues, a question arises naturally as is if and where network calculus and queueing theory meet. In this paper, we explore queueing principles that underlie network calculus and exemplify their use. Particularly, based on the network calculus queueing principles, we show that for GI/GI/1, similar inequalities in the theory of queues can be derived. In addition, we prove that the end-to-end performance of a tandem network is independent of the order of servers in the network even under some general settings. Through these, we present a network calculus perspective on queues and relate network calculus to queueing theory.	end-to-end principle;exemplification;network calculus;quality of service;queueing theory	Yuming Jiang	2009			jackson network;g-network;loss network;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;gordon–newell theorem;kelly network;layered queueing network;mathematics;fork–join queue;queueing theory;bcmp network;algorithm;traffic equations	Theory	-0.09688756488109675	98.46196317832093	104859

Our protocol is quite simple to analyze and can be used in a lot of different situations. We give mathematical evidence showing that our performance is tight, in the sense that no protocol with fixed congestion window can do better. We also place ourselves in the WiFi/WiMAX framework, and show experimental results enlightening collision reduction of 14% to 21% compared to the best known other methods.

We are primarily motivated by applications to the design of wide-area transmission links carrying coded voice traffic between the base sites and the core network of a cellular system. The large number of such links and distances they span lead to significant recurring costs for cellular operators forcing them to operate these links at very high utilization. The system model is composed of a highly utilized transmission link fed by a large number of voice sources. The voice sources are characterized by their correlation structure and relative time-offset with respect to each other. We present simulation and analytical results for this system emphasizing the impact of system utilization, correlation structure, etc. The analysis is based on two different approaches (1) Gaussian queue analysis and (2) heavy traffic analysis. The analysis reflects the statistical properties of the voice sources, in particular, their correlation structure. A key analytical result is that the delays in the system can be characterized by two scaled exponential distributions: one for small delays and the other for large delays.	network packet	Rajesh S.

We demonstrate via numerical analysis that this state-depe ndent rate along with the consideration of Poisson traffic and infinite (or large enough to be considered infinite) buffer size may ca use a high-throughput and extremely long (in the order of hours) transitory phase when traffic arrivals are right above the stability limit. We also perform an experimental evaluation to provide further insight into the characterisation of this transito ry phase of the network by analysing statistical properties of its duration. The identification of the presence as well as the characteris ation of this behaviour is crucial to avoid misprediction, which has a significant potential impact on network performance and optimisation. Furthermore, we discuss practical implicationsof this finding and propose a distributed and low-complexity mechanism to keep the network operating in the high-throughput phase.	branch misprediction;high-throughput computing;mathematical optimization;network packet;network performance;numerical analysis;random access;throughput	Cristina Cano;David Malone	2014	CoRR		telecommunications;computer science;mathematical statistics;operations research;statistics	Networks	-0.09805762526493025	99.2832355361067	105167

In this paper, we propose a minimal adjustment to the classic random early detection (RED) algorithm, called hyperbola RED (HRED), that uses the hyperbola as the drop probability curve. The control law of HRED can regulate the queue size close to the reference queue size which is settable by the user. As a result, it is expected that HRED is no longer sensitive to the level of network load, its behavior shows low dependence on the parameter settings, and it can achieve higher network utilization. Additionally, very little work needs to be done to migrate from RED to HRED on Internet routers because only the drop profile is adjusted. We implemented HRED on a real Internet router to examine and compare its performance with the classic RED and parabola RED that are currently deployed on Internet routers. From experiments on the real network, we conclude that HRED is insensitive to the network conditions and parameter settings, and can achieve higher network utilization than the other RED schemes	active queue management;algorithm;experiment;optimal control;random early detection;router (computing)	Liujia Hu;Ajay D.

The problems become very complex when combined with Quality of Service(QoS) guarantee for traffic with different characteristics. CAC and network resource allocation are real-time traffic control procedures. Processing load should be minimized to reduce delay. At the same time, network resources should be utilized efficiently to accommodate more users. However, reducing processing load and obtaining high network resource efficiency has been considered to be contradictory matter. In addition, a research on CAC and resource allocation scheme, which considers multiple QoS criteria - loss and delay - simultaneously has not been adequately done. We propose an improved effective bandwidth/buffer calculation method based on a new channel/buffer separation analysis scheme. We show that our method based on effective bandwidth and effective buffer can achieve high network resource efficiency with reduced processing load. Moreover, we show that our scheme allows for simultaneous consideration of multiple QoS criteria, loss and delay.

7bd68ea527cc11712f44df253db8df25207dfa40	efficient simulation of consecutive cell loss in atm networks	consecutive cell loss;atm network;efficient simulation;importance sampling;quality of service	In some B-ISDN applications running on ATM networks (e.g., for audio/video connections), the occasional loss of a single ATM cell may not affect the user’s perceived QoS requirement. However, the QoS may be degraded due to the loss of a multiple (consecutive) ATM cells. As the event of consecutive cell loss is (typically) rare, its probability cannot be estimated efficiently using standard simulation. In this paper we propose a fast simulation method, based on importance sampling, to efficiently estimate the probability of a rare consecutive-cell-loss event. As an example, we consider a queueing model of the Leaky Bucket source policing algorithm, operating in a bursty traffic environment. We present empirical results to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our fast simulation method.	atm turbo;simulation	Victor F. Nicola;Gertjan A.

It targets ultralow complexity, cost, and power for low-rate wireless connectivity among inexpensive, portable, and moving devices. IEEE 802.15.4 provides a guaranteed time slot (GTS) mechanism to allocate a specific duration within a superframe for time-critical transmissions. This paper proposes an adaptive GTS allocation (AGA) scheme for IEEE 802.15.4, which considers low latency and fairness. The scheme is designed based on the existing IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control protocol, and IEEE 802.15.4 devices can receive this AGA service without any modification. A simulation model and an analytical model are developed to investigate the performance of our AGA scheme. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing IEEE 802.15.4 implementation.	arm big.little;access control;experiment;fairness measure;gamma correction;global telecommunications system;mac address;markov chain;numerical analysis;pareto efficiency;performance evaluation;scheduling (computing);self-similarity;simulation;steady state;window of opportunity	Yu-Kai Huang;Ai-Chun Pang;Hui-Nien Hung	2008	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2007.70769	ieee 802.11s;logical link control;network allocation vector;ieee 802.11g-2003;real-time computing;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;operating system;simulation modeling;ieee 802.11h-2003;ieee 802.11r-2008;wireless;computer network;bandwidth allocation;ieee 802.11e-2005;ieee 802.1q;low latency	Visualization	4.095929319158197	95.58629663059129	105437

Such protocols often suffer from a significant degree of imbalance in block distributions, such that certain blocks become rare or even unavailable, adversely affecting content availability. It has been pointed out that randomized network coding may improve block availability in P2P networks, as coded blocks are equally innovative and useful to peers. However, the computational complexity of network coding mandates that, in reality, network coding needs to be performed within segments, each containing a subset of blocks. In this paper, using both theoretical analysis and simulations, we quantitatively evaluate how segment-based network coding may improve resilience to peer dynamics and content availability. The objective of this paper is to explore the fundamental tradeoff between the resilience gain of network coding and its inherent coding complexity. We introduce a differential equations approach to quantify the resilience gain of network coding as a function of the number of blocks in a segment, as well as various other tunable parameters. We conclude that a small number of blocks in each segment is sufficient to realize the major benefits of network coding, with acceptable coding complexity.	computational complexity theory;digital distribution;linear network coding;peer-to-peer;randomized algorithm;simulation	Di Niu;Baochun Li	2007	2007 Fifteenth IEEE International Workshop on Quality of Service	10.1109/IWQOS.2007.376546	linear network coding;information theory;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;differential equation;computer network	Networks	1.6047573245671514	90.93311060321936	105674

Prior work has considered these asymmetries independently with a highly simplified view of the other. However, in this paper, we perform thousands of measurements on coupled flows in urban environments and build a simple yet accurate model that jointly considers information and channel asymmetries. We show that if these two asymmetries are not considered jointly, throughput predictions of even two coupled flows are vastly distorted from reality when traffic characteristics are only slightly altered (e.g., changes to modulation rate, packet size, or access mechanism). These performance modes are sensitive not only to small changes in system properties, but also small-scale link fluctuations that are common in an urban mesh network. We analyze all possible capture relationships for two-flow subtopologies and show that capture of the reverse traffic can allow a previously starving flow to compete fairly. Finally, we show how to extend and apply the model in domains such as modulation rate adaptation and understanding the interaction of control and data traffic.	channel state information;mesh networking;modulation;network packet;throughput	Joseph David Camp;Ehsan Aryafar;Edward W.

This service discipline consists of serving the flow with the least number of backlogged bytes in a buffer. Considering a system with two flows and assuming exponentially distributed service times and Poisson arrivals, we propose a method of computing the Laplace transforms of the workloads in the two virtual queues of the system. We notably derive empty queue probabilities and queue asymptotics. As desired, the analytic results show that SQF performs implicit Head of Line priority for the flow with the smallest traffic intensity.

In this paper, we show that both goals can be effectively achieved at the same time. We propose a novel scheme that realizes flow fairness and queue-length stability. In the proposed scheme, high-bandwidth flows are identified via a multilevel caching technique. Then, we calculate the base drop probability for resolving congestion with a stable queue, and apply it to individual flows differently depending on their sending rates. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed scheme effectively realizes flow fairness between unresponsive and TCP flows, and among heterogeneous TCP flows, while maintaining a stable queue.	active queue management;cache (computing);fairness measure;multilevel model;network congestion;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;scheme;simulation	Jong-Hwan Kim;Hyunsoo Yoon;Ikjun Yeom	2011	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2010.104	fairness measure;maintenance engineering;blue;real-time computing;multilevel queue;stability;computer science;probability;distributed computing;queue management system;queueing theory;scheduling;active queue management;transport layer;bandwidth;statistics;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Metrics	-2.3386563344091145	94.81302234918817	106128

With control messages carried on data payload, the extra air time needed for control packets like RTS/CTS is eliminated and thus channel utilization is improved. However, carrying control signals on the data payload of a packet requires the data packet to have a sufficiently large SNR, otherwise both the data packet and the control messages are lost. In this paper, we propose Hitchhike, a technique that utilizes the preamble field to carry control messages. Hitchhike completely decouples the control messages from the payload and therefore the superposition of (multiple) control messages has little adverse effect on the operation of the payload decoding. We implement and evaluate Hitchhike in the USRP2 platform with 5 nodes. Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of Hitchhike. Compared with the state-of-the-art, e.g., Side-channel in 802.15.4, Hitchhike improves the detection accuracy of control messages by 40% and reduces the data loss caused by control messages by 15%.	algorithm;carpal tunnel syndrome;code;ibm notes;network packet;quantum superposition;rs-232;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput	Xiaoyu Ji;Jiliang Wang;Mingyan Liu;Yubo Yan;Panlong Yang;Yunhao Liu	2014	IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848196	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Visualization	8.678400232089901	89.6990817848205	106185

Some rateless codes have systematic leading parts which have been shown in the literature to enhance their performance. The systematic part allows a node to start transmitting packets as soon as they are received without waiting for the entire multi-packet message to be decoded. This will naturally reduce the end-to-end delay which is critical for streaming applications. Using systematic rateless codes, this paper proposes a network routing algorithm to reduce streaming delays. The algorithm is easy to analyze and implement. Its performance is studied and compared against the existing algorithms through simulations in network scenarios where the nodes use systematic rateless codes for communication.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);binary erasure channel;code (cryptography);end-to-end principle;network packet;polynomial;routing;scalability;simulation;time complexity;transmitter	Sonu K.

Finally, the proportional delay differentiated mechanism is added for this system to support differentiated services (DiffServ).	access control;approximation algorithm;differentiated service;differentiated services;internet backbone;network packet;new media;preemption (computing);quality of service;ring network;simulation;synchronous optical networking;throughput;wavelength-division multiplexing	Jih-Hsin Ho;Wen-Shyang Hwang;Wen-Ping Chen	2007	Third International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing (IIH-MSP 2007)	10.1109/IIH-MSP.2007.48	ring network;network traffic control;real-time computing;systems modeling;network architecture;next-generation network;quality of service;new media;telecommunications;computer science;access control;synchronous optical networking;end-to-end delay;backbone network;ip tunnel;packet loss;computer security;survival function;network delay;wavelength-division multiplexing;statistics;computer network	Networks	-1.0950689532208764	94.84664364478111	106385

We study a packetized (TCP-like) traffic model, which is more realistic than the widely used fluid model. We assume that routers have First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffers of bounded capacity managed by the drop-tail policy. The utility of each user depends on its transmission rate and the congestion level. Since selfish users try to maximize their own utility disregarding the system objectives, we study Nash equilibria that correspond to a steady state of the system. We quantify the degradation in the network performance called the price of anarchy resulting from such selfish behavior. We show that for a single bottleneck buffer, the price of anarchy is proportional to the number of users. Then we propose a simple modification of the Random Early Detection (RED) drop policy, which reduces the price of anarchy to a constant.

High peak transmission rate, spectral efficiency and multiple channel bandwidth requirements influence the design of next generation networks. For efficient usage of resources a number of block assignment strategies are followed based on congestion of traffic and priority of the service. Efficient block assignment schemes such as dynamic channel assignment (DCA) and dynamic packet Assignment (DPA) have been analysed in the literature. The authors propose a block assignment strategy for video traffic which sends video bursts over multiple blocks of orthogonal frequency division multiplexed access subcarriers simultaneously considering the interference characteristics of the channel. They present an analytical model using stochastic petrinets and compute the performance of the system in terms of mean delay and normalised system throughput. The results are validated using simulations. They compare the performance of the proposed sub-sequence DPA scheme in terms of mean delay and normalised throughput with DPA and DCA. It is observed that with the proposed strategy there is an increase in normalised throughput by 66 and 57% and reduction in mean delay by 74 and 61% for DCA and DPA, respectively.	frequency divider;interference (communication);mobile phone;mobile television;multiplexing;network congestion;network packet;next-generation network;petri net;profiling (computer programming);real-time clock;real-time locating system;requirement;simulation;spectral efficiency;subcarrier;throughput	J.

The authors consider static multicast (where membership of the multicast group remains constant for the duration of the connection) in lossless wireline networks. For such networks, first the continuous-time (asynchronous packet transmissions) model is formulated. Subsequently, the discrete-time model for the synchronous packet transmissions scenario is derived. Then, by using an auxiliary time-expanded network, a decentralised algorithm in the presence of link delays, limited buffer-size and time-varying link capacity is proposed. The proposed algorithm when coupled with decentralised code construction schemes results in a fully decentralised approach for achieving minimum-cost in such multicast networks. Also, how adding buffering capability at intermediate nodes reduces the overall cost of the optimal sub-graph is discussed in this study. In addition, as will be shown, inclusion of buffering capacity at intermediate nodes makes it possible to find minimum multicast solution in scenarios that such solutions do not exist otherwise.	algorithm;linear network coding;lossless compression;multicast;network packet	Hossein Ghasvari;Mohammad A.

Mapping SRB on HS-DSCH is necessary to enable high capacity voice over HSPA (Circuit Switched Voice or VoIP over HSPA) since it eliminates the code limitation that arises when SRBs are mapped on DCH. To address the above robustness issue, Enhanced SCC (ESCC) was introduced in 3GPP Release 8. In this paper we highlight the first ever implementation of the E-SCC algorithm in a HSPA prototype system. A comprehensive evaluation of the E-SCC algorithm for voice over HSPA is performed through measurements made over a prototype network. We show that under tough urban canyon conditions, the ESCC procedure provides significant gains compared to the legacy USCC procedure in terms of call drop rates, packet drops and duration of serving cell change, thus allowing robust high quality voice service under mobility conditions. To conclude, this paper provides evidence that E-SCC algorithm implementation is feasible and when implemented, robust mobility for voice over HSPA can be achieved.	circuit switching;display resolution;enhanced graphics adapter;hs algorithm;network packet;prototype filter;scc compliant;telecommunications link	Siddharth Mohan;Rohit Kapoor;Bibhu Mohanty	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493710	additive white gaussian noise;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;telecommunications service;reliability;mathematics;prototype;fading;circuit switching;computer network	Mobile	8.057737096133406	96.11611999964448	106608

This paper proposes a new scheme, the adaptive bandwidth waste rate (ABWR) scheme, for fair bandwidth sharing among active nodes under the DQ protocol with multiple priority classes. With ABWR, each node adjusts the bandwidth waste rate for priority level j dynamically, depending upon the bus-wide bandwidth demand of a priority higher than j. We calculate the system capacity under the DQ protocol with ABWR. Four types of implementation are suggested, and their performance is evaluated by simulation. With the proposed scheme, fair bandwidth sharing among active nodes is accomplished, wasting only a small portion of the bus bandwidth.	data quality	Dong Geun Jeong;Chong-Ho Choi;Wha Sook Jeon	1994	Computer Communications	10.1016/0140-3664(94)90115-5	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;distributed-queue dual-bus;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Networks	1.004046179668768	94.91198083608366	106652

We give a detailed investigation on the performance implications of applying priority scheduler. We provide novel closed-form formulae which are fast, simple and accurate enough for practical implementation of the CAC. A comprehensive performance evaluation study with illustrative numerical examples is also presented.

In the context of path heterogeneity, most existing multipath solutions assume that the receive buffer is infinite. Few of them really consider the fact that a large receive buffer may prevent multipath transmission from being used on busy servers and memory-scarce devices. In Multipath TCP (MPTCP) [1], for example, a large receive buffer (e.g., a few MB) could accommodate all the out-oforder data, whereas, if the receive buffer is bounded, the out-of-order data may overflow the buffer so that the flow control mechanism will be triggered, i.e., the next ACK will contain zero in the advertised window to stop transmission for a non-transient time period, significantly degrading the aggregate throughput. In order to tolerate the path heterogeneity using bounded receive buffers, we propose a new multipath TCP protocol, namely SC-MPTCP, by integrating systematic coding [2] into MPTCP. SC-MPTCP makes use of redundant coded packets to counter against expensive retransmissions. The redundancy is provisioned into both proactive and reactive data. Specifically, SC-MPTCP estimates the aggregate retransmission ratio continuously to provide adaptive proactive redundancy and utilizes a pre-blocking warning mechanism to retrieve reactive redundancy from the sender particularly when the proactive redundancy is underestimated in dynamic networks.	acknowledgement (data networks);aggregate data;blocking (computing);internet protocol suite;multipath propagation;retransmission (data networks);tcp congestion control;throughput	Ming Li;Andrey Lukyanenko;Sasu Tarkoma;Yong Cui;Antti Ylä-Jääski	2013		10.1145/2465529.2465750	real-time computing;computer science;transmission control protocol;flow control;distributed computing;computer network	OS	-3.5434955480057937	90.61564920656518	106950

To facilitate higher bandwidth, modern mobile routers are capable of supporting simultaneous multi-band, leading to less interference, higher capacity. However, there exists no previous work that attempts to maximize utilization through sharing of traffic among different frequency bands. In this paper, we have proposed a novel scheduling algorithm for multi-band mobile routers which transmits different classes of traffic through different frequency bands to achieve improved performance. We have developed an analytical model to perform queuing analysis of the proposed multi-band system and derived various performance metrics, validated by extensive simulations. Our results show that the proposed architecture can ensure maximum possible utilization through sharing of capacities among the bands. Our proposed scheduling algorithm and related analytical model can help network engineers build next generation mobile routers with higher throughput and utilization ensuring least packet loss for different classes of traffic.	algorithm;frequency band;interference (communication);internet;network packet;next-generation network;router (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Md.

Meanwhile, ATM technology is appearing in the marketplace. It is an important problem to integrate ATM networks into this integrated service internet. One of the approaches, classical IP over ATM, is now widely deployed, effectively solving the problem of internetworking and interoperability. A key remaining issue is to provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for internet traffic running through ATM subnets. This paper describes a priority scheme, named User Priority, for providing an IP integrated service with QoS over ATM switched virtual circuits (SVCs) to obtain better performance of packet delivery. The User Priority is defined as a three-bit field which uses a type of service (TOS) field in the IP datagram header. This yields eight different service classes with a value of 7 for the highest priority and 0 for the lowest priority. Class 6 and 7 services are for real-time traffic and have their own VCs. Packets with Classes 0 through 5 are sent an aggregate VC. This method is different from the IP over ATM scheme where only one VC is set up between two communicating IP hosts. Thus, packets can be treated differently according to their priorities such that they can enjoy the various QoS guarantees provided by ATM networks. It is backward-compatible with existing IP implementations. These newer options need only to be implemented on the end systems that want to take advantage of them. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Thus, DCTCP can make a proper tradeoff between high throughput and low latency. However, through our observation, we discover that DCTCP causes severe oscillation of queue under some parameters and network configuration. Our perceptual analysis concludes that the rough single-threshold marking mechanism may be the essential reason. Therefore, we propose Double-Threshold DCTCP as an improvement of DCTCP. Then, by applying describing function method in nonlinear control theory, we analyze the stability of both DCTCP and Double-Threshold DCTCP, and theoretically explain why Double-Threshold DCTCP is more stable than DCTCP. At last, we validate theoretical analysis and conclude that the Double- Threshold DCTCP can achieve smaller queue, and the queue length of Double-Threshold DCTCP is less sensitive to the growing number of flows. Further, Double-Threshold DCTCP can postpone the throughput collapse caused by Incast traffic and reduce the tail latency in completion time experiment.	algorithm;control theory;data center;experiment;explicit congestion notification;item unique identification;network congestion;network switch;nonlinear system;simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput	Wen Chen;Peng Cheng;Fengyuan Ren;Ran Shu;Chuang Lin	2013	2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2013.22	real-time computing;stability;computer science;queueing theory;transport layer;statistics;computer network	HPC	-3.1505032096605263	94.0430330401341	107300

This article analysis, through computer simulation, the performance of WFQ schedulers in a DiffServ node loaded by long range dependence (LRD) traffic. The adopted process for the traffic generation consists in the aggregation of the traffic produced by several TCP connections transmitting files with a size that is modeled by heavy tail distribution. This distribution was obtained, from the Internet, by one-week long measurements. The objective is to observe the bandwidth distribution obtained with the WFQ scheduler, as well as the latency, i.e., the file transfer average delay, in an environment with different priorities. Simulations were carried out with the network simulator NS-2, and several simulation results are presented and analyzed.	computer simulation;differentiated services;file transfer;internet;multiprotocol label switching;provisioning;quality of service;scheduling (computing);transmitter;weighted fair queueing	Kleber Kendy Horikawa Nabas;Walter Godoy;Emílio C.

It is expected to be the prevalent standard in many Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) applications where it will support long-range and energy-efficient communication in dense network environments. Therefore, significant changes in the legacy 802.11 standards have been proposed to improve the network performance in high contention scenarios, most important of which is the Restricted Access Window (RAW) mechanism described in the amendment. In this paper we analyze the performance of the RAW mechanism in the Non-Cross Slot Boundary case under various possible holding schemes. We propose new holding schemes as well as a new grouping scheme for RAW mechanism based on backoff states of the stations. The proposed schemes are shown to improve the saturation throughput and energy efficiency of the network through extensive simulations. These schemes can therefore be adapted in practical deployment scenarios of the IEEE 802.11ah use cases to improve the overall network performance. Overall, these advanced features make 802.11ah standard a true IoT-enabling technology towards seamless integration of massive amount of connected devices in the future.	backoff;boundary case;embedded system;internet of things;machine to machine;network performance;profiling (computer programming);seamless3d;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Muhammad Qutab-ud-din;Ali Hazmi;Behnam Badihi Olyaei;Anna Larmo;Johan Torsner;Mikko Valkama	2015	2015 IEEE 16th International Symposium on A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM)	10.1109/WoWMoM.2015.7158204	ieee 802.11s;payload;throughput;ieee 802.11;real-time computing;ieee 802.1x;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;operating system;ieee 802.11h-2003;ieee 802.11r-2008;particle detector;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Embedded	6.844658447586658	92.96810786001812	107406

Call admission policies, such as fractional guard channel and uniform fractional guard channel policies are used to maintain the pre-specified level of QoS. Since the parameters of network traffics are unknown and time varying, the optimal number of guard channels is not known and varies with time. In this paper, we introduce a new dynamic guard channel policy, which adapts the number of guard channels in a cell based on the current estimate of dropping probability of handolT calls. The proposed algorithm minimizes blocking probability of new calls subject to the constraint on the dropping probability of handolT calls. In the proposed policy, a learning automaton is used to find the optimal number of guard channels. The proposed algorithm doesn't need any a priori information about input traffic. The simulation results show that performance of this algorithm is close to the performance of guard channel policy for which we need to know alltrafllc parameters in advance. Two advantages of the proposed policy are that it is fully autonomous and adaptive. The first advantage implies that, the proposed policy does not require any exchange of information between the neighboring cells and hence the network overheads due to the information exchange will be zero. The second one implies that, the proposed policy does not need any priori information about input traffic and the traffic may vary.	algorithm;automata theory;automaton;autonomous robot;blocking (computing);erlang (unit);information exchange;learning automata;need to know;simulation;system call	Hamid Beigy;Mohammad Reza Meybodi	2002		10.1007/3-540-36087-5_75	cellular network;information exchange;telephone network;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;operations research;service quality	AI	4.251141486833881	102.4689841479868	107408

Our analytic model shows that a station experiencing worse frame error rates than the others suffers severe performance degradation below its deserved throughput and delay performance. 802.11 DCF adopts an exponential back-off scheme. When some stations suffer from high frame error rates, their back-off stages should be increased so that others get the benefit from the smaller collision probabilities. This impact is then recursively applied to degrade the performance of the victim stations. In particular, we show that the performance is considerably degraded even if the frame error rate of the victim station satisfies the receiver input level sensitivity that has been specified in the IEEE 802.11 standard. We also verify the analytic results by the OPNET simulations.

Under a baseline rate control scheme, the receivers' delay performance is examined. Based on their Markov states, the knowledge difference between the sender and receiver, three distinct methods for packet delivery are identified: zero state, leader state, and coefficient-based delivery. We provide analyses of each of these and show that, in many cases, zero state delivery alone presents a tractable approximation of the expected packet delivery behavior. Interestingly, while coefficient-based delivery has so far been treated as a secondary effect in the literature, we find that the choice of coefficients is extremely important in determining the delay, and a well-chosen encoding scheme can, in fact, contribute a significant improvement to the delivery delay. Based on our delivery delay model, we develop a dynamic rate adaptation scheme that uses performance prediction models to determine the sender transmission rate. Surprisingly, taking this approach leads us to the simple conclusion that the sender should regulate its addition rate based on the total number of undelivered packets stored at the receivers. We show that despite its simplicity, our proposed dynamic rate adaptation scheme results in noticeably improved throughput-delay performance over existing schemes in the literature.	approximation;baseline (configuration management);cobham's thesis;coefficient;line code;markov chain;network packet;performance prediction;simulation;throughput	Amy Fu;Parastoo Sadeghi;Muriel Médard	2014	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2013.2292613	best-effort delivery;throughput;linear network coding;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;transmission delay;computer network	Mobile	2.0645678075438156	91.26921754100243	108071

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of PGMCC (Rizzo, 2000) in wireless access networks, and propose an enhanced multicast congestion control scheme, called PGMCC+, which achieves significant performance improvement over PGMCC over loss-prone wireless access links. The key idea of PGMCC+ is to discriminate random loss from congestion loss according to the measured network congestion level, and take different actions accordingly. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that PGMCC+ achieves significant throughput improvement up to 40% over PGMCC in wireless access links with typical random loss rate 1%. Furthermore, the improved throughput achieved by PGMCC+ is not at the expense of coexisting connections but from the utilisation of available bandwidth that is left unused. In wired environment, PGMCC+ keeps the TCP-friendliness feature of PGMCC.	access network;bit error rate;call stack;elegant degradation;multicast;network congestion;network packet;simulation;throughput;wireless access point	Yan Liu;Cheng Peng Fu;Zongkai Yang;Bu-Sung Lee	2005	IJIPT	10.1504/IJIPT.2005.007558	multicast;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-3.1643513837356485	89.58276461729932	108213

We propose a new capture model, Message Retraining,as a means of providing an accurate description of experimental data. Using two fairness indices we undertake a quantitative study of the accuracy with which each capture model is able to reflect experimental data. Standard capture models are shown to be unable to accurately reflect the fairness properties of empirical data. The Message Retraining capture model is shown to provide a good estimate of actual system performance in varying signal strength conditions.	fairness measure;modem;quality of service;relevance;simulation;smoothing	Christopher Ware;Joe F.

The protocol mitigates the multi-channel hidden and exposed terminal problems by using information about channel usage gleaned from overhearing (cooperating) neighbours. By accounting for the multiple access interference, CCM-MAC also addresses the near-far problem of CDMA in MANETs enabling concurrent transmissions on each channel. We provide an analysis of the maximum throughput of CCM-MAC and validate it through simulation in Matlab. We also compare the throughput it achieves to IEEE 802.11, a multi-channel MAC protocol, and a CDMA-based MAC protocol.	hoc (programming language)	Yuhan Moon;Violet R.

To fulfill the real-time requirements in such NCSs, most of the bandwidth of the wireless networks need to be allocated to high-priority data for periodic measurements and control with deadline requirements. However, existing quality of service (QoS)-enabled 802.11 medium access control (MAC) protocols do not consider the deadline requirements explicitly, leading to unpredictable deadline performance of NCS networks. Consequentially, the soft real-time requirements of the periodic traffic may not be satisfied, particularly under congested network conditions. This paper makes two main contributions to address this problem in wireless NCSs. A deadline-constrained MAC protocol with QoS differentiation is presented for IEEE 802.11 soft real-time NCSs. It handles periodic traffic by developing two specific mechanisms, a contention-sensitive backoff mechanism and an intra-traffic-class QoS differentiation mechanism. A theoretical model is established to describe the deadline-constrained MAC protocol and evaluate its performance of throughput, delay, and packet-loss ratio in wireless NCSs. Numerical studies are conducted to validate the accuracy of the theoretical model and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new MAC protocol.	access control;algorithm;backoff;bandwidth (signal processing);control system;markov chain;network computing system;network packet;network performance;numerical method;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;requirement;retry;theory;throughput	Guosong Tian;Seyit Camtepe;Yu-Chu Tian	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2016.2520398	ieee 802.11s;service set;network allocation vector;throughput;real-time computing;media access control;quality of service;inter-access point protocol;computer science;distributed computing;wireless distribution system;markov process;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;statistics;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Embedded	3.7606506056213664	95.78228578133796	108873

Congestion control is a key feature of TCP. TCP performance could have significant impact on the network life for wireless ad-hoc/sensor networks, as higher TCP throughput and lower retransmissions could reduce resource consumption. This paper evaluates the feasibility of an adaptive Proportional and Integral (PI) rate control algorithm in wireless ad-hoc/sensor networks. Performance evaluation and comparison of this adaptive rate controller with TCP New Reno have been conducted by means of simulation. The results obtained from the simulations show that the adaptive PI rate control algorithm can improve the overall average throughput for static scenarios and the collision level at the MAC layer is also reduced, which could have a considerable impact on energy consumption.	anytime algorithm;hoc (programming language);interconnection;mobile phone;network congestion;operating system;performance evaluation;personal digital assistant;simulation;throughput;web server	Chung-Horng Lung;Oliver W.

The impact of transmission range and network density on the connectivity metrics is studied as well. We also find the critical transmission range to reach a certain connectivity level in the network, it can be used to determine the right technology which supports the given connectivity level.

In particular, a cross-layer design is proposed for the packet scheduling on a forward link that implements adaptive coding and modulation (ACM). A cross-layer approach is considered whereby the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers share knowledge of the channel dynamics in presence of ACM. Transmission power and symbol rate are assumed to be constant, and hence the bit rate is time and space dependant according to the channel conditions. An architecture is proposed which relies on the physical characteristics of the Ka-band satellite propagation channel and the definition of """"correlated areas"""". The stable throughput region has been derived assuming full-queue traffic conditions. Moreover, the proposed architecture is simple but flexible enough to allow the implementation of different scheduling policies like the proportionally fair or opportunistic ones. Finally, a new time-fair policy appropriate for wet seasons is proposed. It has the property of isolating users in clear-sky conditions from the effects of the reduced transmission rate experienced by users under a rain fade"""	adaptive coding;modulation;network packet;network scheduler;scheduling (computing)	Maria Angeles Vázquez-Castro;Gonzalo Seco-Granados	2007	IEEE Trans.

The conventional traffic control to a flow corresponds to the destination module, so the flows destined to the same output module have bandwidth competition although they should not. The evaluation of conventional switches is only based on traffic patterns with these two features: the required bandwidth of all output ports is identical and no output is oversubscribed. Under their traffic patterns, bandwidth competition never happens. However, there exist other traffic patterns that they don't concern, in which the existed bandwidth competition will lead to degradation. We define this issue as Flow Interference (FI). To address it, we propose a philosophy that traffic control to a flow should correspond to its own destination output based on the global information. Based on this, we propose our switch architecture to solve FI using round-robin at all stages. Analysis and simulation results show that our multi-stage switch architecture can solve FI and achieve perfect performance, with O(1) computational complexity for the scheduling algorithm.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;elegant degradation;existential quantification;interference (communication);nist hash function competition;network switch;overselling;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation	Yupeng Tian;Xiaoping Zhang;Dehu Li;Chen Zhou	2012	2012 18th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC)	10.1109/APCC.2012.6388281	network traffic control;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Arch	1.2177927643204078	94.48767403611141	109468

Abstrat – Data exchange within a Bluetooth piconet is master-driven. The channel/slot utilization thus depends on the efficiency of the scheduling algorithm adopted by the master. In this paper, a novel MAC layer scheduling algorithm, called Floating Threshold (FT), is proposed. Unlike existing approaches, FT allows the master to estimate the backlog queue status at each slave accurately based only on a single feedback bit and a floating threshold. The master can then derive an optimized packet transmission schedule. Using simulations, we show that FT outperforms existing algorithms in terms of channel utilization, packet delay and packet dropping probability.	algorithm;bluetooth;centralized computing;duplex (telecommunications);network packet;packet switching;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;throughput	Changlei Liu;Kwan Lawrence Yeung;Victor O.

This process helps in decreasing congestion and by consequence, in guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for each class of traffic. In this study we propose a traffic policer based on token bucket concept for WiMAX networks. Token bucket parameters (token rate and bucket size) are adjusted according to the traffic characteristics for each traffic class individually. Simulation results show that the proposed traffic policing technique greatly enhances the network performance. It decreases the average delay for real time traffic like rtPS, and therefore, reduces data drop probability due to missed deadlines. It also decreases data loss probability for non real time service class like nrtPS.	algorithm;leaky bucket;network congestion;network packet;network performance;quality of service;queuing delay;real-time clock;requirement;simulation;token bucket;uncontrolled format string	Sahar Ghazal;Jalel Ben-Othman;Jean-Pierre Claudé	2011	Cluster Computing	10.1007/s10586-011-0159-6	leaky bucket;wimax;traffic policing;real-time computing;token passing;telecommunications;token bucket;computer science;operating system;generic cell rate algorithm;traffic shaping;computer network	Metrics	-0.3460663669076972	95.5823462951405	109696

In our previous research, we have proposed a distributed channel access scheme to achieve guaranteed priority and enhanced fairness performance. To better understand the properties of the scheme, and also for the sake of the network design, it is important to investigate the time domain statistics of the scheme. In this paper, we derive the distributions of node service time and system service time, respectively, for the distributed channel access scheme in the saturated case. Simulation results verify the accuracy of our analysis.	blocking (computing);erlang (unit);fairness measure;network packet;network planning and design;profiling (computer programming);provisioning;simulation	Hai Jiang;Ping Wang;Weihua Zhuang	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.589	network planning and design;real-time computing;telecommunications;time domain;computer science;wireless network;statistics;computer network	Mobile	4.524245950525651	97.80217642581584	109790

Though many proposals have been put forward in the areas of differentiated and guaranteed services, none have met the needs of users and operators. Efforts have been stymied by the complexity of the Internet, its myriad systems of interconnection, and by the technological heterogeneity of these systems. They have also run up against poor general knowledge of traffic characteristics that are largely unknown. In particular, recent monitoring projects showed that Internet traffic exhibited huge variations, leading to non-stationary traffic, and thus making difficult to guarantee a stable QoS. This paper then proposes a new measurement based architecture (MBA) and its related mechanisms (as the measurement signaling protocol (MSP) for instance, aiming at signaling to network components network information in real time) suited for coping with actual non-stationary traffic, and with the actual split topology of the Internet for which each domain provides a particular QoS. The idea of our measurement based networking (MBN) approach relies on a real time analysis of traffic characteristics and QoS evolution, and on the design of mechanisms able to adapt their reactions accordingly. The benefits of MBN are illustrated on a case study: a new measurement based congestion control (MBCC) which aims at smoothing traffic (making it more stable and stationary) and optimizing the use of network resources. Some preliminary results, based on NS-2 simulations, show the perfect suitability of this new mechanism for improving traffic characteristics and multi-domain QoS in the Internet, given the complexity and variability of actual traffic.	fairness measure;interconnection;internet;max;network congestion;quality of service;signaling protocol;simulation;smoothing;spatial variability;stationary process;telecommuting	Nicolas Larrieu;Philippe Owezarski	2005	2005 9th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management, 2005.

316b41fd3e93b4464bdfd0ce7eb2bff2ddc10a9f	slot assignment protocol for narrow band waveform for tactical manets		Over the past few years, Mobile Ad hoc net-works(MANETs) have gained importance in mission critical environments. Software defined radios(SDRs) have provided MANETs a platform for using Narrowband networking wave-form(NBNW) for concurrent voice and data transmissions. Traditional TDMA MAC protocols are not appropriate for such applications. In this paper we have proposed a distributed TDMA slot assignment MAC protocol for VHF/UHF NBWF operating at 25kHz for SDR MANETs. It is a conflict free slot assignment protocol which has improved the average channel utilization and reduced the control traffic overhead thus utilizing the limited bandwidth more efficiently for tactical MANETs. Nodes autonomously detect any change in network topology and assign slot by using local topology knowledge only. The protocol is employing 5Kbps for control slots traffic and the rest of the bandwidth i.e 20Kbps is utilized by data packets. The main contribution of the proposed technique is designing a protocol that works on very narrow band with low data rate for mobile nodes. The performance of the protocol is evaluated in OMNeT++ and we have shown that improved average channel utilization and reduced control traffic for MANETs is efficiently utilizing NBNW bandwidth than existing protocols.	communications protocol;computation;data rate units;etsi satellite digital radio;frequency divider;hoc (programming language);mission critical;network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);throughput;time complexity;ultra high frequency;waveform	Sana Saleem;Shoab Ahmed Khan	2017	2017 25th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM)	10.23919/SOFTCOM.2017.8115583	computer network;real-time computing;computer science;network topology;time division multiple access;narrowband;ultra high frequency;network packet;mobile computing;distributed computing;wireless ad hoc network;communication channel	Mobile	8.219314039062255	90.36203065348748	110128

The novel characteristic of this algorithm, compared to previous proposals, is that it performs channel allocations based on the actual traffic buffered in the various mobile stations, i.e., on the exact transmission requirements. This feature renders ARROW ideal for variable bit rate traffic. However, an enhancement is also presented that improves ARROW performance under constant bit rate traffic. The ARROW algorithm and its enhancement are discussed and evaluated against two other schedulers found in the open technical literature, namely the simple scheduler and SETT-EDD. Results from a detailed simulation model verify that ARROW provides much better channel utilization and considerably improved performance, in terms of mean delay and packet loss	access control;aggregate function;algorithm;arrow (computer science);atmel avr;case-based reasoning;computers, freedom and privacy conference;design rule for camera file system;ed, edd n eddy: the mis-edventures;halt and catch fire;mtd-f;network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);phy (chip);population;programming computable functions;quadratic assignment problem;quality of service;rendering (computer graphics);requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;single-machine scheduling;throughput;timer	Dimitris Skyrianoglou;Nikos I.

TCP's implicit AIMD flow control performs poorly in this environment, because it often cannot keep up with the dynamics of the network. This paper explores the potential utility of explicit flow control in the MANET domain. To this end, we propose an end-to-end rate-based flow control scheme (called EXACT), where a flow's allowed rate is explicitly conveyed from intermediate routers to the end-hosts in each data packet's special control header. As a result, EXACT reacts quickly and precisely to re-routing and bandwidth variation, which makes it especially suitable for a dynamic MANET network and also discusses several supporting mechanisms required for such a scheme at the MAC and the transport layers. By ns-2 simulations, we show that EXACT outperforms TCP in terms of fairness and efficiency, especially in a highly dynamic MANET environment.	end-to-end principle;fairness measure;flow control (data);hoc (programming language);mobile device;network packet;router (computing);routing;simulation;state (computer science);testbed;uncompressed video	Kai Chen;Klara Nahrstedt;Nitin H.

This is due to the success of IEEE 802.11 WLAN technology, which allows the extension of local area networks by mobile stations and establishing of ad-hoc networks. The latter does not need any pre-installed infrastructure. Nodes communicate directly or the traffic is relayed over intermediate wireless nodes. While there are only few nodes the performance of the network is acceptable, but with increasing number of nodes their performance of the network decreases. If TCP is used additional performance degradation is expected. However, TCP is necessary since most applications and application level protocols are based on it. The poor performance of TCP in wireless networks has several reasons, especially the communication medium with high bit error rates (BER) and TCP's optimization on fixed networks. In this paper, we present an analysis of TCP's performance in wireless and ad-hoc networks. We emphasize the role of MAC layer retransmissions without breaking the end-to-end semantic of TCP. For this, we introduce the dynamic short retry limit, which allows the adaptation of RT-S/CTS retransmission.	carpal tunnel syndrome;hoc (programming language);rs-232	Mesut Günes;Marcel Hecker;Imed Bouazizi	2003		10.1109/ISCC.2003.1214224	wireless ad hoc network;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;tcp hole punching;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;computer network	Mobile	-2.0171248860569135	91.37967981239632	110734

Without distinguishing data packets and noise, the Software Defined Access Point (SoDA) samples the wireless channel for the uplink and multicasts the sampled data via Internet to other SoDAs. This leads to tremendous traffic load on the Internet. In this paper, we use energy detection to address this issue. Specifically, we propose EDDD to aim at reducing the traffic load on the Internet under the condition that dropping data packet as few as possible. Through extensive experiments on IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4, we validate the feasibility and effectiveness of EDDD.	experiment;internet;network architecture;network packet;phy (chip);telecommunications link	Chao Dong;Xiaoming Tang;Panlong Yang;Hai Wang;Guihai Chen	2010	2010 IEEE 72nd Vehicular Technology Conference - Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2010.5594499	ieee 802.11;the internet;network architecture;network packet;telecommunications;computer science;noise;wireless network;software-defined radio;distributed computing;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	-3.8965066319945776	91.49648160347637	110762

As a solution to this problem, a broadcast star network with collision avoidance has been proposed and studied in [2 131. In a broadcast star network, collisions of simultaneously transmitted packets are avoided by means of hardware called a collision avoidance switch. While the channel is being used by one station, the collision avoidance switch blocks other stations from using it. This network implements random access protocols without the penalty of collisions among packets and combines the benefits of random access (low delay when traffic is light; simple, distributed, and therefore robust protocols) with excellent network utilization. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a broadcast star network, assuming synchronous operation of a network. In synchronous operation, the channel time is slotted, and stations transmit only a t the beginning of a slot. We obtain the throughput and the distribution of transmission delays. I t is also shown through simulations that a broadcast star operating under synchronous mode yields better performance than that operating under asynchronous mode, where transmissions of packets are not confined to the beginning of slots, and stations start transmission any time.	image resolution;profiling (computer programming);random access;simulation;star network;throughput;transmission (bittorrent client)	Kunio Goto;Tatsuya Suda	1990		10.1109/ICDCS.1990.89259	local area network;broadcast domain;broadcast radiation;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;law;computer network	Mobile	4.453222365989882	94.35181524689679	111002

This paper summarizes the results obtained thus far and include the following: a) results of an exact analysis of the performance of the error monitoring procedures under both random and bursty errors; b) a demonstration that there exists a range of error rates within which the error monitoring procedures of SS7 may induce frequent changeovers and changebacks; c) an analysis of the performance of the SS7 level-2 transmission protocol to determine the tolerable error rates within which the delay requirements can be met; d) a demonstration that the tolerable error rate depends strongly on various link and traffic characteristics, thereby implying that a single set of error monitor parameters will not work well in all situations; e) some recommendations on a customizable/adaptable scheme of error monitoring with a discussion on their implementability. These issues may be particularly relevant in the presence of anticipated increases in SS7 traffic due to widespread deployment of Advanced Intelligent Network (AIN) and Personal Communications Service (PCS) as well as for developing procedures for high-speed SS7 links currently under consideration by standards bodies.	emoticon;intelligent network;requirement;signalling system no. 7;software deployment	Victor T.

However, due to the characteristics of vehicular networks, the limited bandwidth of 3G/3.5G network is not enough to support high resolution or high video quality. In order to improve the quality of video playback, this vehicle, which is defined as requester in this paper, may try to ask other members of the same fleet to download video cooperatively. In other words, other members would download parts of requested video through their 3G/3.5G network individually and then forward video data hop by hop to the requester using the DSRC ad-hoc network. In order to smooth the DSRC ad-hoc network, we propose and discuss two k-hop packet forwarding schemes for the aforementioned cooperative video streaming over vehicular networks in this paper. Each intermediary node of the forwarding route must decide how to deliver buffered video data through the limited DSRC network. Finally, the NS2 simulation tool is adopted to evaluate the proposed schemes. Based on the simulation results, the Playback Priority First (PPF) scheme is performed better than the First-In First-Out (FIFO) scheme.	display resolution;download;fifo (computing and electronics);hoc (programming language);hop;image resolution;network packet;simulation;streaming media	Chao-Hsien Lee;Chung-Ming Huang;Chia-Ching Yang;Hsiao-Yu Lin	2012	2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289202	gold;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;bandwidth;computer network	Mobile	2.4723557750799436	92.99063779488837	111176

In the paradigm under consideration, only two service classes are assumed, which share the storage and bandwidth resources at the network nodes according to an absolute-time-priority scheme, being able to support two general types of applications: real-time and non-real-time ones. The low-priority class is thus of the available-bit-rate (ABR) type, with some service quality guarantee obtained through allocating a minimum amount of bandwidth to it. Proper connection admission control (CAC) for both classes and traffic shaping of the low-priority traffic are employed in order to maintain contracted quality-of-service levels for both classes. Peak rates for the real-time traffic and effective rates for the non-real-time one form the basis of the control functions. A burst-level traffic model based on the M/D/1 queue is proposed for sources without strict delay constraints and the derived effective rate is validated by simulation and results from experiments on an ATM testbed. Following these results, a coherent CAC and traffic shaping scheme is presented. This scheme makes use of the proposed burst-level model to achieve an adaptive shaping of the non-real-time sources. For all links intended to support both classes, real-time sources are allocated, their demanded peak rate and the bandwidth left available by these sources is exploited by the ABR type sources (non-real-time), through adapting the parameters of the shaper. Simulation results validate the concept of this novel ABR-like service. The set of simulation and experimental results contained in the paper constitute the heart of its contribution.	atm turbo;common access card;programming paradigm;traffic shaping	John Soldatos;Evangelos Vayias;Nikolas Mitrou	2000	Computer Networks	10.1016/S1389-1286(00)00097-9	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;traffic shaping;computer network	Networks	-0.25685186257941905	96.45690157358062	111202

Diversity routing has been proposed to improve TCP's performance in these networks. In diversity routing, a sublayer between TCP and the network replicates each transmitted packet and sends the multiple copies along parallel paths. As long as at least one of the copies reaches the receiver, TCP considers the transmission successful and maintains high throughput. Previous investigations of diversity routing have analyzed TCP's performance when there is a single flow and no congestion. In this paper, we analyze the performance of multiple flows in a congested network. The contribution of this work is the discovery of three adverse effects that occur when TCP is combined with diversity routing. The effects are: link capacity overflow, rate unfairness, and lock-out of late-arriving flows. Simulation is used to analyze the root cause of these effects. Our conclusion is that naïve diversity routing fundamentally breaks the TCP congestion control mechanism and cannot be used for TCP performance improvement in networks with stochastic channels, such as many wireless and satellite networks. We propose an improvement to diversity routing that may overcome these problems, enabling use of unmodified TCP.	explicit congestion notification;naivety;network congestion;network packet;randomness;routing;simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput	Yupeng Zhang;John M.

5753941a3a01fe1db860e34c6164bb50f317ba35	ieee 802.11ac dbca: a tug of war between channel utilization and fairness		IEEE 802.11ac supports Dynamic Bandwidth Channel Access (DBCA), where a wireless station dynamically selects the channel bandwidth based on the availability of the secondary channels. Although DBCA reduces the possibility of starvation due to non-availability of secondary channels, however, to the best of our knowledge, no existing works look into the performance benefits of IEEE 802.11ac DBCA based on theoretical modeling. In this paper, we develop a two dimensional Markov chain approach to model the performance of DBCA under various channel bonding conditions. We validate the proposed model based on a real testbed implementation. From the thorough analysis of the numerical results obtained from the model, we show that although DBCA improves channel utilization for secondary channels, it requires proper channel allocations and bonding level distributions across the wireless channels for reducing unfairness in the network. We observe that under certain circumstances, the secondary channel users can affect the throughput of primary channel users, which may introduce a short-term unfairness and a significant performance drop in the network.	access network;baseline (configuration management);channel bonding;fairness measure;markov chain;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;performance tuning;primary channel;testbed;throughput	Saketh Mahankali;K.

The MAC technique of the IEEE 802.11 protocol is called Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). In IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), network nodes experiencing collisions on the shared channel need to backoff for a random period of time, which is uniformly selected from the Contention Window (CW). This contention window is dynamically controlled by the Backoff algorithm. First step to design a an efficient backoff algorithm for multi-hop ad hoc network is to analysis of the existing backoff algorithms in multi-hop ad hoc networks. Thus, in this paper, we considered two important multi-hop adhoc network scenarios: (a) Node Mobility Scenario and (b) Transmission Range Scenario and analyze and evaluate both the impact of mobility (i.e. node speed) and the impact of transmission range of nodes on the performance of various backoff algorithms.	access control;algorithm;backoff;design rule for camera file system;emoticon;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);network packet;simulation;window function	Pooja Saini	2010	CoRR		vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;omics;mobile ad hoc network;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;world wide web;exponential backoff;computer network	Mobile	7.336835702407675	90.10016298316239	111635

This kind of ad hoc and infrastructure-based coexisting architecture can have an important application for the future cognitive radio (CR) network. To establish an overlaying ad hoc network in the presence of primary users, the medium access control (MAC) protocol shall achieve high spectrum utilization, avoid interfering the primary user and establish the link quickly. To this end, we propose four enhanced mechanisms for the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) MAC protocol: (1) a neighbor list establishmentmechanism for recognizing spectrumusage opportunities, (2) a set of contention resolution methods to reduce the collision and delay variance, (3) an invited reservation procedure for meeting the delay requirements of real-time traffic, and (4) a distributed frame synchronization mechanism for coordinating transmission without a centralized controller. Compared to the legacy IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol, the proposed CSMA/CAMAC protocol enhancement can improve the system throughput by 50% through analysis and NS-2 simulations, while keeping the dropping rate lower than 2% for delaysensitive traffic. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the access delay is reduced by five times. With these QoS enhanced mechanisms, the proposed cognitive CSMA/CA MAC protocol can allow an ad hoc network to coexist with the legacy TDMA system. © 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.	access control;algorithm;centralized computing;certificate authority;coexist (image);cognition;cognitive radio;computer automated measurement and control;convergence insufficiency;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);ibm systems network architecture;legacy system;priority queue;provisioning;quality of service;real-time transcription;requirement;simulation;throughput;verlet list	Li-Chun Wang;Anderson Chen;David S.

We look at the packet transmission processes that are induced by a peer-to-peer overlay disseminating real-time traffic from a statistical perspective. Applying the theory of extreme events, we derive that the asymptotic distribution of the end-to-end packet delay (i.e. packet delivery time between sender and receiver peers) is subexponential heavy-tailed if the inter-arrival times between packets are regularly varying heavy-tailed distributed. To evaluate the probability to miss a packet as a quality-of-service attribute one requires a set of observable variables based on the realized flows such as the endto-end packet delays, the packet inter-arrival times and packet lengths of single or aggregated streams associated with a peer.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;extreme value theory;maxima and minima;multicast;network packet;observable;overlay network;peer-to-peer;polynomial;quality of service;rare events;real-time locating system;scheduling (computing);upload	Natalia M.

An analytical model for adaptive bitrate adjustment and throughput optimization reflects the performance impact and the system behaviour of IEEE 802.11b.

8c2ceccbd440d4418df48b675c738944faf9df86	open-loop video distribution with support of vcr functionality	interactivity	Scalable video distribution schemes have been studied for quite some time. For very popular videos, open-loop broadcast schemes have been devised that partition each video into segments and periodically broadcast each segment on a different channel. Open-loop schemes provide excellent scalability as the number of channels required is independent of the number of clients. However, open-loop schemes typically do not support VCR functions. We will show for open-loop video distribution how, by adjusting the rate at which the segments are transmitted, one can provide VCR functionality. We consider deterministic and probabilistic support of VCR functions: depending on the segment rates chosen, the VCR functions are supported either 100% of the time or with very high probability. For the case of probabilistic support of PLAY and Fast-forward (FF) only, we model the reception process as a semi-Markov accumulation process. We are able to calculate a lower bound on the probability of successfully executing FF actions. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The excessive control signaling required for dynamic scheduling of such uplink data in the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard impedes the deployment of LTE networks for M2M communications. Traditional Semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) reduces the load on control channel but it is currently only developed for constant data rate voice packets. For realistic M2M environments, non-deterministic data traffic needs to be served in a resource efficient way. In this paper, we propose a buffer based adaptive SPS scheme for the LTE uplink which does not require the control signaling overhead of dynamic scheduling, but offers the same flexibility of increasing or decreasing the number of allocated radio resource blocks according to the latest buffer status of the device. We examine the influence of SPS periodicity on quality of Service (QoS) satisfaction of delay constrained stochastic M2M traffic and compare the performance of the proposed adaptive SPS scheme with rigid fixed allocation SPS schemes for such traffic. We also demonstrate how the adaptive SPS scheme can be implemented in a resource efficient way to meet the QoS requirements of a large number of machine type nodes through data aggregation.	compaq lte;data aggregation;ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;machine to machine;network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;quasiperiodicity;requirement;scheduling (computing);semiconductor industry;software deployment;telecommunications link;uncompressed video	Nusrat Afrin;Jason Brown;Jamil Y.

02d5da17805b2c302681335be4e3d203d29436ee	performance modeling of delayed offloading in mobile wireless environments with failures		Mobile devices and wireless network links are sometimes unreliable and unstable owing to user mobility in mobile wireless environments. As a result, failures may occur during the offloading process, which has a huge influence on the offloading performance. Worse still, it is challenging to make high-level offloading decisions since they closely rely on an accurate predicting model, especially when encountering with offloading failures. Unfortunately, due to the high mobility and heterogeneous network environments, such a model is currently not available to researchers and practitioners. To fill that gap, this letter develops an analytical queueing model for delayed offloading systems with intermittent connectivity. We set a deadline to detect offloading failures when taking the impatient jobs and service interruptions into account. Furthermore, for different types of mobile applications, a tradeoff analysis between energy saving and latency reducing is analyzed on the basis of an energy–response time weighted product metric. The proposed offloading model can be effectively used for describing complex and realistic offloading systems with the presence of failures.	control theory;high- and low-level;job stream;mobile app;mobile phone;numerical analysis;queueing theory;response time (technology);retry	Huaming Wu	2018	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2866585	latency (engineering);real-time computing;computer network;task analysis;wireless network;wireless;computer science;queueing theory;heterogeneous network;mobile device;server	Metrics	8.717985029408569	100.26423009865239	112736

We prove a heavy-traffic limit theorem for the distribution of the stationary actual waiting time W. If the tail of the service time distribution is heavier than that of the interarrival time distribution, and the traffic load a → 1, then W, multiplied by an appropriate ‘coefficient of contraction’ that is a function of a, converges in distribution to the Kovalenko distribution. If the tail of the interarrival time distribution is heavier than that of the service time distribution, and the traffic load a → 1, then W, multiplied by another appropriate ‘coefficient of contraction’ that is a function of a, converges in distribution to the negative exponential distribution.	coefficient;stationary process;time complexity;traffic analysis	Onno J.

We show that for offl ine scheduling these effects are small even i f the tuning time is as large as the packet duration. In particular, we consider scheduling of random traffic with tunable transmitters and fixed-tuned receivers. We provide a lower bound to the completaon time of any off-line schedule with an arbitrary number of wavelengths. We then describe a near-optimal schedule which is based on the principle of having idle transmitters tune to wavelengths just-in-time to start their transmissions. Stability and capacity issues in the transmission of real-time traffic are considered. We show that the scheduling problem admits a single stable equilibrium point, and point out how the traffic capacity of a bro'adcast network can be reached. We also consider the implications in connection-oriented networks.	connection-oriented communication;idle (cpu);network packet;online and offline;real-time clock;real-time computing;scheduling (computing);service-oriented architecture;transmitter	Murat Azizoglu;Richard A.

In order to handle the metering traffic, under time varying outage conditions we introduce a multi-gate and single-class back-pressure based scheduling algorithm, which takes into account both the hop-count, as well as the queue length of each mesh node. An important requirement of this algorithm is that all the meter nodes should always maintain a separate path to each gateway. We first quantify the stability region of the network when our novel algorithm is applied to schedule the packets. We then present a numeric analysis to prove that the overall network delay is reduced as a result of employing the proposed scheduling algorithm. Moreover, we also theoretically prove that the network is always able to remain stable as long as the arrival rate vector lies inside the stability region provided by our scheduling algorithm. Finally, we derive a distributed objective function that is adopted by the practical implementation of the packet-scheduling scheme. The simulation results indicate that under the context of the multi-gate network, our packet-scheduling scheme can indeed significantly improve the network's reliability and delay performance, which are important factors under outage conditions.	algorithm;downtime;loss function;mesh networking;network architecture;network packet;numerical analysis;optimization problem;queueing theory;scheduling (computing);simulation	Hamid Gharavi;Chong Xu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Communications	10.1109/TCOMM.2012.12.100620	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;distributed object;scheduling;computer network	HPC	5.240099817288492	93.57195895053067	113200
ca94e7c813c9d9e4c76a80c4359cd13fd18359d7	analysis and implementation of packet preemption for time sensitive networks		A standard priority-queuing system is capable of arranging packets with different traffic classes to guarantee a relatively low latency for the high priority traffic. However, in practical cases, severe delay may be caused by starting a large, low-priority frame ahead of a time-critical frame. In this paper, interspersed express traffic is evaluated, which enables preemption of non-time-critical transmission, in particular, the preemptive queuing system allows the cut-through transmission for critical traffic and minimizes the jitter. We analyse the performance of packet preemption through a system level simulation in Riverbed Modeler. The simulation is complemented by numerical analysis which provides the average queuing delay for both types of traffic (preemptable and express). Furthermore, the paper describes an approach to implement the packet preemption solution on an FPGA in VHDL, which illustrates the complexity of hardware implementation.	compaq lte;field-programmable gate array;network packet;network scheduler;numerical analysis;preemption (computing);priority queue;quality of service;queuing delay;simulation;vhdl;window of opportunity	Zifan Zhou;Ying Yan;Sarah Ruepp;Michael S.

Comparing with RED algorithm, although the PI (proportional-integral) controller for AQM designed by C. Hollot improves the stability, the transient performance of the PI controller is not perfect, such as the regulating time is too long. In order to overcome this drawback, in this paper, the PID (proportional-integral-differential) controller is proposed to speed up the responsiveness of AQM system. The controller parameters are tuned based on the determined gain and phase margins. The simulation results show that the integrated performance of the PID controller is obviously superior to that of the PI controller.	active queue management;pid	Yanfei Fan;Fengyuan Ren;Chuang Lin	2003		10.1109/ISCC.2003.1214244	pid controller;real-time computing;computer science;active queue management	Metrics	-3.3684315223480854	95.12431162753916	113432

This paper addresses one of the issues involved in using an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network for such a purpose — that of developing an appropriate call admission control (CAC) procedure for such applications given the special nature of their traffic. In this proposal, connections belonging to the same application and sharing the same link are allowed to utilize the linkbandwidth in a strongly correlated manner. However, connections belonging to different applications are still assumed to be independent. This allows the development of a tabular approach for keeping track of the aggregate bandwidth demand of the applications sharing the same link. The proposed approach is compared with two related approaches (one more conservative and another more aggressive) and is shown to strike a balance between utilization and loss rate.

This technique is able to balance the traffic load among cells accommodating heterogeneous multimedia services while ensuring efficient bandwidth utilization. The most important features of our algorithm are its adaptability, flexibility and responsiveness to current network conditions. In addition, our online scheme to control bandwidth adaptively is a cell-oriented approach. This approach has low complexity making it practical for real cellular networks.

As opposed to previously known algorithms that focus only on achieving high throughput, these algorithms seek to achieve low average delay without compromising the throughput achieved. Packet scheduling in input-queued switches based on the virtual-output-queued architecture is a bipartite graph matching problem wherein ports are represented by vertices and the traffic flows by the edges. The set of matched edges determine the packets that are to be transferred from the input ports to the output ports. Current matching algorithms implicitly prioritize high-degree vertices, i.e., ports with a large number of flows, causing longer delays at ports with a smaller number of flows. Motivated by this observation, we present three matching algorithms based on explicitly prioritizing low-degree vertices and the edges through them. Using both real gateway traffic traces as well as synthetically generated traffic, we present simulation results showing that this class of algorithms achieves a low average delay as compared to other scheduling algorithms of equivalent complexity while still achieving similar throughput. We also show that these algorithms determine the maximum size matching in almost all cases.	approximation algorithm;digital footprint;fairness measure;fibre channel;markov switching multifractal;matching (graph theory);maximum throughput scheduling;network switch;randomness;scheduling (computing);simulation;synthetic intelligence;tracing (software);vertex (graph theory)	Madhusudan Hosaagrahara;Harish Sethu	2007	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-006-9024-y	high-throughput screening;real-time computing;bipartite graph;computer science;theoretical computer science;traffic flow;fair queuing;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Metrics	0.6642578025236499	92.74047753273892	114005

As a consequence, data transfer performance optimization represents a crucial issue due to TCP limitations in wireless environment. In this study, we focus on the overhead deriving from the multilayer ARQ employed at the link and transport layers. To the aim of reducing unnecessary burden on the wireless link, we propose a cross-layer ARQ approach, called ARQ proxy, which substitutes the transmission of TCP ACK packet with a short MAC layer request on the radio link. Packet identification is achieved through the use of hash functions applied to the packet headers. Performance of the ARQ proxy is evaluated using an IEEE 802.16e system level simulator which includes realistic physical layer implementation. The results demonstrate good agreement with the design objectives and achieve the expected levels of system capacity increase, reduction of round trip time, and higher error rate tolerance.	acknowledgement (data networks);channel capacity;error detection and correction;hash function;hybrid automatic repeat request;mathematical optimization;multilayer perceptron;network packet;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;performance tuning;proxy server;simulation;telecommunications link;url shortening	Dzmitry Kliazovich;Tommaso Beniero;Sergio Dalsass;Federico Serrelli;Simone Redana;Fabrizio Granelli	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.247	sliding window protocol;hybrid automatic repeat request;real-time computing;selective repeat arq;telecommunications;computer science;transport layer;computer network	Embedded	-1.2409349062507515	91.56382373479913	114200

An analytical formulation of the queue build-up, and characteristic time instants provides insight of the cause and effect relationships, and can be used for buffer dimensioning. In addition, quantification of the queue build-up and the dependence on other system parameters may prove useful in evaluating other algorithms and designing those that avoid it.

In this paper, we propose a p-persistent frame replication scheme for resilient services in multi-radio wireless networks. In the p-persistent frame replication scheme, packets are transmitted over the primary link and the packets are redundantly sent over the secondary link with probability p. In addition, cooperative retransmission is devised to minimize the overhead in retransmission. Analytical expressions for the reliability, latency, and redundancy in the p-persistent frame replication scheme are derived and validated by extensive simulations. We also develop a binary search algorithm to obtain the optimal p to minimize the redundancy while satisfying the given latency and reliability requirements.	binary search algorithm;cooperative mimo;overhead (computing);requirement;retransmission (data networks);simulation	Sangheon Pack;Joosang Youn;Yong-Geun Hong;Jung-Soo Park	2009		10.1145/1582379.1582655	wimax;cognitive radio;real-time computing;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;high-speed downlink packet access;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network;binary search algorithm;satisfiability	Mobile	7.90220340163361	92.63408545621996	114396
6b1f0f0c992fe9c438a00506b74988e4f1eb6d1f	retransmission algorithm for channel allocation in ieee 802.15.4 lr-wpan		IEEE 802.15.4 was developed for simple, low-power and low-cost wireless communication. It employs the slotted carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) for the contention mechanism. The blind backoff process in the slotted CSMA/CA will cause lower channel utilization. Sensor node performs backoff process immediately when the clear channel assessment (CCA) detecting busy channel. If a collision occurs, CSMA/CA algorithm executes retransmission operation. If packet retransmission fails for three times, this packet is dropped. However if this dropped packet has emergency information, the reliability of data transmission and Quality of Service (QoS) are reduce. In this paper, we design a retransmission algorithm for channel allocation in IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPAN. To conduct performance analysis, we used an OPNET network simulator. A performance analysis shows that the proposed algorithm reduces the dropped packet and throughput, so proposed algorithm improves the reliability of data transmission and Quality of Service (QoS).	algorithm;lr parser;retransmission (data networks)	Hyeopgeon Lee;Aran Kim;Yongtae Shin	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-32645-5_82	network allocation vector;ieee 802.11g-2003;ieee 802.11h-2003;ieee 802.11r-2008;computer network	Visualization	8.105953049709862	90.05357095831319	114700

While the QoS scheduling at the central authority (i.e., base station) has received extensive attention recently, the computation of resource requirements at each individual node has been widely ignored. An inappropriate resource requirement may lead to degraded support for real-time traffic and overprovisioning of scarce network resources. This work addresses this issue by presenting a strategy for nodes to determine minimal resource reservations that guarantee the real-time constraints of their network traffic. In addition, this paper examines the relationship between timeliness constraints of the traffic and resource requirements.	best, worst and average case;computation;control system;embedded system;mobile media;network packet;network traffic control;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;scheduling (computing);streaming media	Dinesh Rajan;Christian Poellabauer;Xiaobo Sharon Hu;Liqiang Zhang;Kathleen Otten	2008		10.1145/1450058.1450077	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;base station;computer network;energy management	Embedded	4.00018587383692	92.79339617274348	114701

A ring network can handle different classes of traffic streams, which differ by their hop-counts (i.e., the number of hops used from source to destination). We assume that for each class of traffic, call interarrival and holding times are exponentially distributed. In such a network, classes of calls with smaller hop-counts, experience lower blocking rates than ones with greater hop-counts. In this paper, a multi-threshold wavelength allocation scheme is proposed to provide equal blocking probabilities experienced by different classes. A recursive simulation-based algorithm is designed to numerically compute the optimal thresholds.

Variable length packets are divided into two groups according to division parameter p, and synchronized their transmission at the beginning or at the end of a coming slot. By this method, the maximum throughput reached a value of 0.26. In addition, variable length packets are divided into four groups according to three division parameters 驴, 脽 and 驴, and synchronized their transmission to two different slots. This method increased the throughput value to 0.35, and also showed an improvement in average delay performance. Finally, we proposed a contention access scheme by combining a reservation-slot to the aloha-slot, where we can expect an increase in throughput value and improved delay performance.

In the DVB-SH system, the satellite broadcasts a signal carrying multimedia services aimed directly to a variety of mobile (handheld or vehicular) and fixed terminals.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#A three-state LMS channel model that describes the narrowband propagation channel in three possible shadowing states—line-of-sight conditions, moderate shadowing and deep shadowing—had been selected as a baseline for physical layer simulation of the DVB-SH waveform. This type of model, capable of generating complex time series, was originally selected, because it is the simplest model that allows the simulation of first- and second-order effects of the LMS channel in a realistic manner. The main limitations of such model are, first of all, that a classification in three states does not necessarily correspond with reality and, secondly, that the statistical parameters for each state were fixed for a given scenario and elevation angle. Those limitations may impact the selection of Physical Layer parameters of the DVB-SH standard.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#A new channel model is proposed based on the original three-state model including two major modifications: a reduction in the number of states and the introduction of a versatile selection of statistical parameters describing each state. Furthermore, the state machine is governed either by Markov or by semi-Markov chains. The new-state classification does not necessarily correspond to intuitive physical definitions of the states as before (line-of-sight, shadowing) but instead to channel variations that share similar statistical characteristics. The two-states are termed for convenience, Good and Bad states, representing a range of LOS-to-moderate shadowing and moderate-to-deep shadowing, respectively. For the model parameters selection, datasets at L- and S-band have been analysed using an iterative algorithm that includes automatic data classification and parameter extraction. The proposed model is considered more suitable for the analysis of DVB-SH test cases.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#This study starts with an overview of the main DVB-SH system parameters and assumptions. The original three-state model is briefly introduced; the new model is presented in detail, including simulator implementation. Finally, both models and experimental data sets are compared on a statistical basis. The performance of both models are discussed to show how effective the model is for the representation of shadowed conditions and therefore, its suitability for the analysis and optimal configuration of the physical and link layer parameters (namely physical layer interleaver size, link layer protection time, overall redundancy, etc.).

Wireless mesh networks have promising commercial potential for a large variety of applications. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of DCCP with TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) in wireless mesh networks using ns2 simulations, in terms of fairness and throughput smoothness. Our results show that in wireless mesh networks DCCP shares the limited wireless channel bandwidth fairly with the competing flows and provides better throughput smoothness than TCP flows in isolation i.e. with no competing flows. However, DCCP loses its ability to maintain the smoothness for streaming media applications with competing flows in the network.	datagram;fairness measure;mesh networking;simulation;streaming media;throughput;wireless mesh network	Pirabakaran Navaratnam;Nadeem Akhtar;Rahim Tafazolli	2006		10.1145/1164783.1164811	wireless mesh network;switched mesh;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;order one network protocol;transport layer;computer network	Mobile	-4.352172125110518	93.5456890937654	114902

A key strategy is to use hybrid ARQ (HARQ) with erasure codes (a.k.a. forward error correction or FEC) sent both proactively and reactively in response to feedback about dynamic loss statistics. A challenge is to design HARQ to satisfy multiple objectives such as high goodput, low latency and negligible residual loss rate. In this paper, we analyze the performance benefits and trade-offs of these reliability strategies (hybrid ARQ+FEC). We derive expressions for the expected good-put (and overhead in terms of FEC wastage), latency, and residual loss for a given raw erasure loss process (e.g. uniform and bursty loss models). We show how the analysis can be used to explain and provide specialized design guidance for link-layer HARQ that is subject to tight delay constraints and a recently designed transport layer HARQ scheme (called loss-tolerant TCP). We validate our analysis by comparing the predictions with values obtained from simulations performed on the link and transport layer HARQ strategies with ns-2. We believe that such an analysis could also have value for other adaptive protocols using network coding and incremental redundancy techniques.	erasure code;error detection and correction;floor and ceiling functions;forward error correction;goodput;hybrid automatic repeat request;linear network coding;lossy compression;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);simulation	Vijaynarayanan Subramanian;Shivkumar Kalyanaraman;K.

Everyone around the world would like to be connected seamlessly anytime anywhere through the best network. The 4G wireless system must have the capability to provide high data transfer rates, quality of services and seamless mobility. In 4G, there are a large variety of heterogeneous networks. The users for variety of applications would like to utilize heterogeneous networks on the basis of their preferences such as real time, high availability and high bandwidth. When connections have to switch between heterogeneous networks for performance and high availability reasons, seamless vertical handoff is necessary. The requirements like capability of the network, handoff latency, network cost, network conditions, power consumption and user’s preferences must be taken into consideration during vertical handoff. In this paper, we have extracted the requirements of a vertical handoff from the literature surveyed. The evaluation of the existing work is also being done on the basis of required parameters for vertical handoff. A sophisticated, adaptive and intelligent approach is required to implement the vertical handoff mechanism in 4G wireless networks to produce an effective service for the user by considering dynamic and non dynamic parameters.	anytime algorithm;high availability;real-time computing;requirement;seamless3d;semantic network;variometer	Mandeep Kaur Gondara;Sanjay Kadam	2011	CoRR	10.5121/ijwmn.2011.3202	real-time computing;heterogeneous network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;high availability;wireless;computer network	Mobile	9.081329000492236	98.59996351498832	115092

Performance of servers is characterized by the behavior of queues, which constitute the main elements of the control loop. The central role of queues in the loop motivates understanding their behavior in the context of feedback control schemes. A popular queueing policy in servers where different traffic classes must be allocated a different share of a common resource is fair queueing (FQ). This paper investigates the interactions between a FQ element and a feedback controller. It is shown that the FQ element introduces challenges that render simple feedback control ineffective and potentially unstable. These challenges are systematically exposed, explained, and resolved. An extended feedback control scheme for the FQ element is subsequently developed. The scheme is tested on an experimental prototype demonstrating higher predictability and an order of magnitude improvement in responsiveness over the initial design. The results of the paper apply in general to most systems that use a dynamic processor sharing approach for service differentiation.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive system;control system;control theory;experiment;fair queuing;feedback;fully qualified name;interaction;network scheduler;prototype;quality of service;responsiveness;scheduling (computing);web server	Ronghua Zhang;Yixin Diao;Shashi Parekh;Tarek F.

To meet the challenge, this paper proposes an adaptive common radio resource management (CRRM) scheme in the context of wireless wide area network (WWAN) and wireless local area network (WLAN). The key parameters of the scheme are service type, user mobility and location information, load information, and service cost. The effectiveness of the proposed CRRM scheme is assessed analytically using the theory of Markov chains. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme minimizes the rate of unnecessary vertical handoffs (VHO), thereby providing stable communication without degrading call blocking performance and increasing service cost.	blocking (computing);erlang (unit);markov chain;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;radio resource management;variometer	Abdul Hasib;Abraham O.

However, mixing voice with data traffic introduces QoS issues because 802.11 DCF does not provide any QoS mechanism. In this paper, an enhanced version of the legacy DCF is proposed in order to support friendly coexistence of voice and data. Every downlink transmission of data packets in an AP, voice packets pending in its queue are simultaneously sent together. It can be easily implemented with packet bursting technique. Thus, voice traffic is hardly interfered by dynamic data load, and its QoS can be consistently protected within an acceptable level. Additionally, the proposed MAC scheme is fully backward compatible with DCF, and requires only partial modifications of the AP MAC protocol. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a high level of voice QoS with data load dynamics. In other words, our solution enables voice and data traffic to coexist harmoniously, greatly reducing interference of data with voice.	backward compatibility;coexist (image);design rule for camera file system;dynamic data;high-level programming language;interference (communication);mac address;network packet;quality of service;scalability;simulation;telecommunications link	Jong-ok Kim;Hideki Tode;Koso Murakami	2006	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2006.1649649	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	5.124299480309983	95.36883883691354	115784

The study considers varying beaconing interval duration and random vehicle speeds and presents an analytical evaluation of the probability of successful data exchange. To corroborate analytical results an ns3 simulator is also developed and the empirical values for the probability of successful data exchange are also obtained for comparison. Results indicate that the IEEE 802.11 standard with its beaconing mechanism can be successfully used for V2I communications.	design rule for camera file system;information exchange;numerical analysis;simulation	Sarwar A.

In this paper, we consider the transmission of prerecorded media from a server to a client by using TFRC, and analytically study the impact of TFRC on user-perceived media quality, which is roughly measured by calculating the rebuffering probability. A rebuffering probability is defined to be the probability that the total duration of all rebuffering events experienced by a user is longer than a certain threshold. Several approaches are presented to help an application determine an appropriate initial buffering delay and media playback rate in order to achieve a certain rebuffering probability under a given network condition. First, we derive a closed-form expression to approximate the average TFRC sending rate, which could be used as the maximum allowed playback rate of a media stream. Second, we develop a queueing model for a TFRC client buffer with the traffic described by a Markov-Renewal-Modulated Deterministic Process (MRMDP), which captures the fundamental behavior of TFRC that predicts the immediate future TCP sending rate based on the history of past loss intervals. We present a closed-form solution and a more accurate iterative method to solve the queueing model and calculate the rebuffering probability.

Traffic self-similarity has been discovered to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in communication networks with a significant impact on the network performance and user-perceived Quality-of-Service (QoS). However, due to the high complexity and challenges of modelling traffic self-similarity, there has not been any analytical model reported for ARQ under self-similar traffic. To fill this gap, we develop a novel analytical model of multi-buffer ARQ systems in the presence of prioritized self-similar traffic for reliable data transmission and QoS differentiation. This model can be used to investigate the probabilities of queueing loss and transmission loss in the multi-buffer ARQ systems. The validity of the analytical model is demonstrated via extensive comparison between analytical and simulation results. The model is further adopted to investigate the effects of service capacity and delay bound of ARQ on the system performance. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we measured times required to transfer files from a laptop in a vehicle and tethered to the Internet via an iPhone hotspot to a stationary host located on the Internet and having a manually assigned IP address. Even though our RaptorQ-based protocol is in its very early stages of development, we found that the file transfer times of the two protocols are comparable in the stationary environment even without doing any specific optimization work on the RaptorQ-based protocol. We also found that SFTP was very prone to stalling whenever we passed through a region where propagation is poor whereas, in the same propagation environment, the RaptorQ-based protocol tended to make use the available bandwidth and complete the file transfer but with a reduced file transfer time.	communications protocol;experiment;hotspot (wi-fi);laptop;mathematical optimization;maximal set;mobile phone;ssh file transfer protocol;software propagation;stationary process;upload	John N.

In this paper, we account for such interactions in a network-layer model that we use to investigate the delay and packet discard performance of a wireless channel. We consider a single ON/OFF traac stream transported over a wireless link. The capacity of this link uctuates according to a uid version of Gilbert-Elliot's model. We derive the packet delay distribution via two diierent approaches: uniformization and Laplace transform. Numerical aspects of both approaches are compared. Using our analytical model, we investigate the packet discard rate at the receiver. This metric is particularly important for delay-sensitive traac, where the due-date of a packet is translated into a limit on the maximum number of packet retransmissions. The delay distribution is further used to quantify the wireless eeective bandwidth under a given delay guarantee. Numerical results and simulations are used to verify the adequacy of our analysis and to study the impact of error control and bandwidth allocation on the packet delay and loss performance.	control system;error detection and correction;gilbert cell;interaction;network packet;numerical linear algebra;quality of service;simulation	Marwan Krunz;Jeong Geun Kim	2001	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.914515	transmitter;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;statistics;computer network	Metrics	1.454092608078812	98.7466113272479	116287

However, if the number of active stations is large for the legacy backoff algorithm (DCF) of the 802.11, the capacity will be very low due to high collision cost. In this paper, we introduce the TDMA concept to partition all numerous active stations into several groups to avoid all stations transmitting the frames simultaneously. When Point Coordinator (PC, generally referring to AP) finds that the number of active stations (M) is large i.e. bigger than 16, it broadcasts grouping number and grouping head bits (such as 00000100 00000000) information in the TIM field of the beacon frame. Once all stations receive this instruction, the stations which last two LSB bits of the MAC address are 00 belonging to group 0 will transfer their frame first. On the contrary, all stations belonging to other groups will set their waiting time, that is, Network Allocation Vector (NAV) much more precisely. Analysis shows that the capacity of our GDCF will be near to the theoretical capacity of 802.11 WLAN even if the distributions of all active stations among all groups are not so uniform. This capacity could be independent of the number of active stations and CWmax (contention window maximum).	algorithm;backoff;collision problem;computation;design rule for camera file system;desktop computer;least significant bit;mac address;microsoft dynamics nav 2016;mobile computing;network packet;personal digital assistant;transmitter	Kuo-Chang Ting;Mao-yu Jan;Sung-huai Hsieh;Hsiu-Hui Lee;Feipei Lai	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.815	network allocation vector;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless lan controller;mobile computing;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	7.624542557852905	97.35180884590314	116312

We explore the random access and handshaking (i.e., RTS/CTS) techniques in both single-channel and multi-channel network scenarios. We model and analyze these two approaches, and conduct extensive simulations to study their performance in various network conditions. Based on our results, we observe that the performance of both approaches are affected by many factors such as data rate, propagation delay and packet size. Our results show that the RTS/CTS approach is more suitable for dense networks with high date rate, whereas the random access approach is preferred in sparse networks with low data rate. Our results also demonstrate that multi-channel techniques can potentially help us combat the long delay feature of underwater acoustic channels. However, uncoordinated random channel access cannot fully exploit the advantages of the multi-channel network settings and it performs even worse than the single-channel random access protocol. Only with careful design and coordination such as multi-channel access with RTS/CTS handshaking process, can multi-channel MAC protocols greatly improve the system performance. We believe that this study will provide useful guidelines for efficient MAC design in underwater wireless acoustic networks.		Zhong Zhou;Zheng Peng;Peng Xie;Jun-Hong Cui;Zaihan Jiang	2013	EURASIP J.

In this report, we first design and implement a real-time 64subcarrier 10 MHz full-duplex OFDM physical layer, FDPHY. The proposed FD-PHY not only allows synchronous full-duplex transmissions but also selective asynchronous fullduplex modes. Further, we show that in over-the-air experiments using optimal antenna placement on actual devices, the self-interference can be suppressed upto 80dB, which is 10dB more than prior reported results. Then we propose a full-duplex MAC protocol, FD-MAC, which builds on IEEE 802.11 with three new mechanisms – shared random backoff, header snooping and virtual backoffs. The new mechanisms allow FD-MAC to discover and exploit fullduplex opportunities in a distributed manner. Our over-theair tests show over 70% throughput gains from using fullduplex over half-duplex in realistically used cases.	backoff;data dredging;duplex (telecommunications);experiment;frequency band;interference (communication);phy (chip);real-time clock;real-time transcription;throughput	Achaleshwar Sahai;Gaurav Patel;Ashutosh Sabharwal	2011	CoRR		use case;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;physical layer;computer network	Mobile	9.392385520000028	88.88919128944715	116453

The SUs have to change spectrum channel no matter when and where the PU(Primary User) appears. Much research has been done on spectrum switching prediction design, without considering the spectrum handoff caused by the randomly moving of SUs and PUs. This paper proposes a novel spectrum handoff management scheme based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). To get a better spectrum sensing result, a cooperative spectrum sensing mechanism is used. The SVM model is introduced to predict the handoff point, so that the SU can prepare to handoff before the channel is occupied. The simulations results show that the algorithm could forecast the handoff point and obviously reduce the handoff time.	algorithm;cognitive radio;randomness;simulation;support vector machine	Jinghua Guo;Hong Ji;Yi Li;Xi Li	2011	2011 6th International ICST Conference on Communications and Networking in China (CHINACOM)	10.1109/ChinaCom.2011.6158234	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.8006154352027135	99.32572539346464	116571

The controlled traffic shares a common bottleneck node with high-priority cross traffic described by a Markovmodulated fluid (MMF). Each controlled source is assumed to have a unique round-trip delay. We wish to maximize a linear combination of the throughput, delay, traffic loss rate, and a fairness metric at the bottleneck node. We introduce an online sampling-based burst-level congestioncontrol scheme capable of performing effectively under rapidly-varying cross traffic by making explicit use of the provided MMF model of that variation. The control problem is posed as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and is solved heuristically using a technique called Hindsight Optimization. We provide a detailed derivation of our congestion-control algorithm based on this technique. The distinguishing feature of our scheme relative to conventional congestion-control schemes is that we exploit a stochastic model of the cross traffic. Our empirical study shows that our control scheme significantly outperforms the conventional proportionalderivative (PD) controller, achieving higher utlization, lower delay, and lower loss under reasonable fairness. The performance advantage of our scheme over the PD scheme grows as the rate variance of cross traffic increases, underscoring the effectiveness of our control scheme under variable cross traffic.

The deployment of network coding in the Internet core still largely lags behind. Among the many challenges, one difficulty is the selection of routers to perform network coding, which relies on the understanding of the queueing behavior of network coding. Unfortunately, the intricate queueing behavior of network coding, even for a single node case, is still unclear. In this paper, we build a generic queueing model to answer many fundamental questions, including for example, under what condition is the system stable? How many packets could be possibly coded when multiple stochastic traffic flows pass through a coding node? What is the quantitative relationship among the traffic arrival rate, the service rate, and the coding opportunities under a general network configuration? Based on our analytical results, we propose a self-adjustable delay-based coding mechanism for better congestion control. Our work provides network researchers and engineers with insights on the queueing behavior of network coding, which are helpful in future applications of network coding in the Internet core. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Simple rules are derived for overload detection and protection of a CSMA/CD LAN. It is demonstrated that a station can correctly determine the total network load and decide whether the medium is currently overloaded or not. A fair share algorithm is suggested for every station in a CSMA/CD LAN to protect the medium from being overloaded. With proper overload protection, it is shown that the expected penalty due to collisions for each successful transmission is geometrically distributed. In conclusion, this analysis shows that the performance of CSMA/CD LANs is significantly better than predicted by simpler models and it can be improved by a simple modification to the standard CSMA/CD protocol.

To obtain this background traffic, a packet stream can be captured on a real network. For testing the application under varying network loads, straightforward techniques can be applied to alter the originally captured traffic trace. An example thereof is faster replay of the packet stream. The drawback of these simple techniques is that the packet stream will be altered in many ways, and thus a simple multiplication of the load that is inflicted by the packet stream on a network cannot be guaranteed. This paper presents and analyzes some frequently used load scaling methods. Next to the computationally more demanding use of traffic models, a novel technique is introduced based on the rotation of the bin vector, that combines better accuracy with computational simplicity.	image scaling;network traffic control	Kristof Sleurs;Jan Potemans;Johan Theunis;Dagang Li;Emmanuel Van Lil;Antoine Van de Capelle	2007	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2007.05.051	traffic generation model;network traffic control;real-time computing;simulation;systems modeling;packet analyzer;telecommunications;self-similarity;computer science;processing delay;traffic shaping;packet switching;computer network	Networks	-1.2978599396642088	102.06647201624915	116697

Models to investigate the QoS requirements rather quickly become complicated and hard to analyze. In the paper a first rough analytical approach for the answer is given. As the users devote more and more time to be connected through wireless connections, and at the same time becomes more and more mobile the traditional systems does not work. Our model is based on a hierarchical structure where different, already existing, wireless systems interact to maintain coverage for moving customers outdoors as well as indoors. The QoS requirements are based on the type of service used and the mobility pattern. The system should be able to configure the connection to make the optimal choice among those networks present at the location of the customer. Further, the mobile terminals must be able to handle the different networks. In a general case, systems with broader coverage and usually lower bandwidth will act as backup systems for higher quality systems. Our analytical tool shows the benefits and drawbacks of such a system. The transition duration times between usage of different systems are analyzed together with their variance and squared coefficient of variation. Each handover is a source for failure. By changing the parameter setting it is possible to get at better understanding of how to configure hierarchical wireless systems for best performance. With the presented formulas this could be achieved in a fast and thorough way.	backup;bandwidth (signal processing);coefficient;quality of service;requirement;rough set;type of service	Johan M.

Motivated by this fact, this paper investigated the importance of collecting and using statistics on neighboring secondary users (SUs) in selecting channels in addition to the knowledge of PU channel usage. The paper assumed that PU traffic characteristics of the channels are included in the radio environment map in the form of probabilistic suffix trees, which is a sequence predictor based on Markov property. In the proposed method, an intelligent sequence hopping-based common control channel and a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)/collision avoidance (CA)-based medium access control (MAC) protocol were introduced. As shown in the paper, selecting channels using statistics of both the neighboring SUs and PUs reduced the number of packet collisions compared to a scheme which only uses PU statistics. Furthermore, the simulation results showed that the scheme proposed had better throughput performance with respect to both the random channel selection scheme and the scheme which only uses PU statistics while having less training complexity.	access control;algorithmic efficiency;cognitive radio;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hoc (programming language);ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);kerrison predictor;map;markov chain;markov property;network packet;one-class classification;planar separator theorem;proactive parallel suite;reflection mapping;simulation;suffix tree;superuser;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system	Chamara Devanarayana;Attahiru Sule Alfa	2015	EURASIP J.

However, there is a lack of fundamental understanding on the interactions between the incentive mechanisms and the underlying protocols (e.g., shortest-path routing, ETX routing or back-pressure scheduling), and whether integration of these protocols will lead to a robust network, i.e., networks can sustain a given traffic workload. The objective of this paper is to present a general mathematical framework via stochastic difference equations to model the interaction of incentive mechanisms and various underlying protocols. We first present a credit evolution model to quantify the expected credit variation of each node in WMN, then use the norm of the expected credits variation to quantify the credit disparity. We also propose the use of differentiated pricing and show how it can achieve credit equality among nodes, resulting in a more robust network under different traffic loading. Our analytical framework can help researchers to model other incentive/routing protocols so to analyze the robustness of the underlying networks. ! 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper describes a TCP window control scheme for a shared memory device that has buffer memory logically organized into multiple queues. To handle changing queue traffic loads, the shared memory device uses a dynamic buffer threshold mechanism to allocate buffer space to the queues. The TCP window control scheme allows the receiver's advertised window size in ACK packets to be modified at the network queue in order to maintain the queue size at a computed dynamic threshold.

33f18341dd34a68dac0e9c2381b3b333ff27dfdf	efficient video distribution for unmanned air vehicles		In Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), video distribution is important since it provides the “eyes-in-the-sky” functionality for the ground crew. However, the link bandwidth available to UAVs may be limited, which includes VHF links, satellite links, directional links, and various other forms of air-to-ground radio frequency links. Also, during the course of a mission/flight, the bandwidth available for communication between the UAV and ground crew can vary significantly and unpredictably due to the wireless nature of the links. The ground crew controlling/monitoring the UAV may be hundreds or thousands of miles away, and have to rely on the video data feed to make decisions throughout the mission. For the success and safety of the mission, the quality, reliability, and delay (constrained by real time requirements) of the video stream must thus be maintained. Further, the number and resolution of video sensors mounted on UAVs have increased over the years, making it even more necessary to improve the efficiency of the video distribution over the available links. In this paper, we will describe how to minimize end-to-end latency of the video path by reducing the delay of the video system components. We also describe scalable video streaming techniques and bandwidth adaptive streaming approaches to mitigate video distribution issues/challenges from UAVs to the ground.	adobe air;bandwidth (signal processing);bi-directional text;data feed;end-to-end encryption;radio frequency;requirement;scalability;sensor;streaming media;unmanned aerial vehicle	Alimuddin Mohammad	2012		10.2514/6.2012-2497	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Mobile	-3.954295467753939	90.15619566080592	117912

Different from traditional MAC protocols, where only one-step reservation is considered, we propose a multiple-step distributed in-band channel reservation, called m-DIBCR, where m represents the number of steps we consider in the channel reservation. In the protocol, each node maintains m timers, each of which serves as the backoff timer for one of the next m packets to be sent. A node broadcasts the initial values of these timers by piggybacking them in the data packet, and simultaneous transmissions can be avoided when its neighboring nodes overhear these values. Extensive simulations show that, compared with one-step channel reservation, throughput can be dramatically improved by multiple-step channel reservation, especially in networks with high transmission error probabilities and/or a large number of contending nodes.

The throughput and the satellite queue size performances of the proposed scheme are mathematically analyzed and simulated. The results show the significant improvement in the proposed scheme comparing with the conventional window-based and rate-based flow control techniques. Such a scheme can be used in the future satellite networks, which are an important component in the global information infrastructure (GII).	algorithm;communications satellite;computer simulation;elegant degradation;fairness measure;flow control (data);interconnection;internet;numerical analysis;performance;robustness (computer science);sisd;terrestrial television;throughput;transmitter;window function	Seungcheon Kim;Abbas Jamalipour	2004	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2004.823413	the internet;simulation;index term;global network;telecommunications;computer science;flow control;satellite internet access;communications satellite;computer network	Mobile	-0.27463691077236163	93.08846641810602	118024

Almost all the existing AQM schemes neglect the impact of large delay on their performance. In this study, we first show an unexpected fact through simulation experiments, which is the dramatic oscillations appear in the queues controlled by several popular AQM schemes, including RED, PI controller and REM, in large delay networks. With appropriate model approximation, we design a robust AQM controller to compensate for the delay using the principle of internal mode compensation in control theory. Our novel algorithm restrains the negative effect on queue stability caused by large delay. Simulation results show that the integrated performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms that of several well-known schemes when the connections have large delay, while keeping buffer queue short. q 2004 Elsevier B.V.

f4f577e3403337a23eef6e9183ab198d0c551125	bandwidth scheduling with flexible multi-paths in high-performance networks		Modern data-intensive applications require the transfer of big data over high-performance networks (HPNs) through bandwidth reservation for various purposes such as data storage and analysis. The key performance metrics for bandwidth scheduling include the utilization of network resources and the satisfaction of user requests. In this paper, for a given batch of Deadline-Constrained Bandwidth Reservation Requests (DCBRRs), we attempt to maximize the number of satisfied requests with flexible scheduling options over link-disjoint paths in an HPN while achieving the best average Earliest Completion Time (ECT) or Shortest Duration (SD) of scheduled requests. We further consider this problem from two bandwidth-oriented principles: (i) Minimum Bandwidth Principle (MINBP), and (ii) Maximum Bandwidth Principle (MAXBP). We show that both of these problem variants are NP-complete, and propose two heuristic algorithms with polynomial-time complexity for each. We conduct bandwidth scheduling experiments on both small-and large-scale DCBRRs in a real-life HPN topology for performance comparison. Extensive results show the superiority of the proposed algorithms over existing ones in comparison.	algorithm;big data;computer data storage;control plane;data-intensive computing;electroconvulsive therapy;experiment;heuristic;np-completeness;polynomial;pontryagin's maximum principle;procedural generation;real life;routing;scheduling (computing);secure digital;simulation;time complexity	Xiaoyang Zhang;Chase Qishi Wu;Liudong Zuo;Aiqin Hou;Yongqiang Wang	2018	2018 18th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGRID)	10.1109/CCGRID.2018.00-69	computer network;reservation;data transmission;big data;resource (disambiguation);scheduling (computing);heuristic;computer data storage;computer science;bandwidth (signal processing)	Arch	-0.4064023127633572	94.150417561485	118560

Recently, some authors suggested that burst loss was not a reliable performance assessment metric for OBS networks. Refuting this claim, this paper presents simulation results obtained for a ring network, using real tributary IPv4 packets as source for the burst assembly. It is shown that burst loss, packet loss and byte loss lead to similar results over a wide range of burst assembly scenarios and network loads, using different resource reservation schemes. Therefore, burst loss is a reliable metric and can be used for evaluation of performance of optical burst switched networks, when realistic burst assembly algorithms are considered over real traffic.	algorithm;byte;jet;network packet;optical burst switching;pareto efficiency;ring network;simulation	Nuno M.

73cbb9f08462fde6af73f497c19dac7a1f346127	minimizing congestion impairment of network update in sdn: a flow-based solution		In software defined networks, network states are frequently updated by controllers. Unfortunately, due to resource and time constraints, there are scenarios in which transient congestion and packet loss are inevitable. In this regard, minimizing the packet loss ratio becomes crucial. Previous efforts on congestion-free updates suggest link-based solutions, which aim at minimizing the overloaded data volume on the bottleneck links. Observing the fact that the least overloaded data volume on links still does not guarantee the least packet loss, in this paper, we propose a flow-based update solution that directly minimizes the packet loss by jointly optimizing the congestion duration and rate limitation. Specifically, congestion impairment is defined to jointly accommodate the flow's importance and packet loss. Then, we present the FBU (Flow-Based Update problem), which minimizes the congestion impairment on a flow basis. To deal with the NP-hardness of this optimization problem, we propose MIC, which is an efficient two-phase heuristic algorithm based on the relationship between rate limitation, congestion duration and packet loss. Experimental results show that MIC can reduce up to 84% of packet loss compared to previous algorithms.

The proposed rerouting and reservation scheme can reduce the delay in connection rerouting by reserving VPI/VCIs for possible inter-switch handoff calls in advance. It also improves the utilization of wired resources by reserving statistically the wired resources in separate ways according to the classes (i.e., real-time vs. non-real-time traffic) of possible inter-switch handoff calls. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme can decrease the dropping rate of inter-switch handoff calls without the sacrifice of the blocking probability of new calls and, moreover, can flexibly cope with the time-variant environment.	atm turbo;program composition notation	Kyunghun Jang;Kyeonghoon Kang;Duckjin Kim	2000	Telecommunication Systems	10.1023/A:1019177014030	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer security	HPC	5.111113241729484	97.86586511492297	119076

The pull scheduling algorithm is widely used in this mesh structure, but it restricts the performance of entire system. Recently, network coding is introduced in mesh P2P streaming system to improve the performance, which makes the push scheduling strategy feasible. Although some push scheduling algorithms based on network coding have achieved some success, there is still a lack of the theoretical model and optimal solution. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal push scheduling algorithm based on network coding. The main contributions of this paper are: i) We put forward a new theoretical model, with a new evaluation function, which simultaneously considers the scarcity and timeliness of the segment; ii) We formulate the push scheduling strategy as an optimization problem and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it; iii) We systematically realize our proposed optimal push scheduling algorithm. Compared with the most famous push scheduling algorithm based on network coding R2, the simulation results demonstrate that decode delay, decode ratio and redundant fraction of the P2P streaming system with our algorithm can be significantly improved, without losing throughput and increasing overhead.	evaluation function;greedy algorithm;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;optimizing compiler;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;scheduling (computing);simulation;streaming media;theory;throughput	Laizhong Cui;Yong Jiang;Jianping Wu	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364294	fair-share scheduling;linear network coding;real-time computing;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	HPC	1.5528234916298274	91.64792739450115	119373

As these traac descriptors are only projections of the traac, connection admission control must be supplemented by input rate control in order to monitor and regulate the actual traac. None of the proposed input rate control schemes enforces multiple traac parameters. Additionally, traac shaping at the UNI based on regulating average and peak rates may enhance statistical multiplexing performance. This paper presents a performance analysis of the two-stage entry monitor combining a sticky buuer policer with a spacer. To the best of our knowledge, no analysis of tandem policers has appeared before this paper. The rst stage enforces the sustained rate R=T negotiated in the connection request; the spacer shapes the traac and controls burstiness by further ensuring that cells enter the network at least S slots apart. We derive the probability generating function for the combined queue length distribution and evaluate numerically (i) the manner in which S and burstiness aaect the cell-loss probability and (ii) the performance penalty caused by enforcing two rates. The principal contribution of this paper is the calculation of the buuer size required to police two parameters subject to a speciied cell-loss ratio. Our principal conclusion is that the increase in buuer size needed to police the peak sustained rate in addition to the sustained rate minimal. We will also demonstrate that the leaky bucket and the single stage sticky buuer have comparable performance enabling us to conclude that a two-stage sticky buuer can police both peak and sustained rates for almost the same cost as a leaky bucket. ITU-T's Recommendation I.371 1] deenes connection admission control (CAC) as \the set of actions taken by the network at the call set up phase ... in order to establish whether"""" a new connection can be accepted or not. An ATM connection is a contract between the user and network (service provider). When requesting a connection, the user provides traac descriptors and quality of service parameters (QoS) to the network. The network determines if its resources are suucient to provide service in accordance with the user-requirements; a connection is made, if this is the case. Peak and average cell rate and peak duration are traac descriptors; QoS parameters include delay, cell delay variation and cell-loss probability. …"""	atm turbo;common access card;leaky bucket;multiplexing;network service provider;noise shaping;numerical analysis;quality of service;requirement;sticky bit;traffic shaping;user interface	Gísli Hjálmtýsson;Alan G.

The objective is to provide a better quality of service to delay-sensitive packets at the cost of allowing higher delays for the best-effort packets. We consider a single-server infinite-capacity queue with general independent packet arrivals of class 1 (delay-sensitive) and class 2 (best-effort). The service times of the packets are independent and have a general distribution that depends on the class of the packet. The scheduling mechanism makes use of an in-queue reserved place for future class-1 packet arrivals. A class-1 arrival takes the place of the reservation in the queue, after which a new reservation is created at the tail of the queue. Class-2 arrivals always take place at the tail of the queue. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the probability generating functions and the mean values of the packet delays of both classes.	best-effort delivery;network packet;quality of service;regular expression;scheduling (computing);server (computing)	Sabine Wittevrongel;Bart Feyaerts;Herwig Bruneel;Stijn De Vuyst	2016		10.1145/3016032.3016042	multilevel feedback queue;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;multilevel queue;bulk queue;computer science;distributed computing;queue management system;fork–join queue;priority queue;queuing delay;computer network;weighted round robin	Metrics	0.28325111482482573	96.72823354331562	119803

Existing CSMA protocols, such as the medium access control (MAC) of WiFi, are designed for a homogeneous network environment in which all nodes adopt the same protocol. Such protocols suffer from severe performance degradation in a heterogeneous environment where there are nodes adopting other MAC protocols. This paper shows that DRL techniques can be used to design efficient MAC protocols for heterogeneous networking. In particular, in a heterogeneous environment with nodes adopting different MAC protocols (e.g., CS-DLMA, TDMA, and ALOHA), a CS-DLMA node can learn to maximize the sum throughput of all nodes. Furthermore, compared with WiFi’s CSMA, CS-DLMA can achieve both higher sum throughput and individual throughputs when coexisting with other MAC protocols. Last but not least, a salient feature of CS-DLMA is that it does not need to know the operating mechanisms of the co-existing MACs. Neither does it need to know the number of nodes using these other MACs.	access control;artificial neural network;backpropagation;cs games;cs-cipher;delay-tolerant networking;driven right leg circuit;elegant degradation;feedforward neural network;heterogeneous system architecture;interaction;need to know;network packet;random neural network;recurrent neural network;red–black tree;reinforcement learning;throughput	Yiding Yu;Soung Chang Liew;Taotao Wang	2018	CoRR		throughput;wireless network;carrier-sense multiple access;access control;computer network;reinforcement learning;distributed computing;computer science;need to know;time division multiple access;homogeneous	Mobile	9.759049707236892	95.71321461409745	119850

However, the total experienced disruption time often exceeds this if strict order delivery of packets is required, since a 40 ms (configurable from 10 ms to 100 ms) topology stabilisation timer is used to avoid packet reordering. In this article, we present three alternative ways to avoid packet reordering for strict order traffic in RPR networks. The three suggested methods are discussed analytically, and simulations are used to compare their performance. Our simulation results suggest that the new methods give up to 90% reduction in packet loss during a failure situation compared to the current RPR standard	denial-of-service attack;network packet;protection mechanism;resilient packet ring;simulation;timer	Amund Kvalbein;Stein Gjessing	2005	2005 14th IEEE Workshop on Local & Metropolitan Area Networks	10.1109/LANMAN.2005.1541529	telecommunications;engineering;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-3.960659448496754	93.26288464402869	119928

Triggering a large number of MTC devices can dramatically overload the underlying transport network system and incur congestion in both the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC). The proposed solution aims at controlling the rate of device trigger requests that MTC servers can generate in order to reduce the system overload. For this purpose, we propose that the Mobility Management Entity (MME), or an alike core network node, computes the device trigger rate that alleviates congestion, and communicates this value to the MTC-Interworking Function (MTC-IWF) element that enforces MTC traffic control, via admission control or data aggregation, on the device trigger request rate received from the different MTC servers. The proposed solution is evaluated through computer simulations and encouraging results are obtained.	computer simulation;data aggregation;electronic product code;mathematical optimization;network congestion;radio access network	Adlen Ksentini;Tarik Taleb;Xiaohu Ge;Honglin Hu	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883334	radio access network;telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.984275139771305	98.39104415923529	120137

Based on the Hiperlan/2 system we design an adaptive radio resource scheduler which autonomously adapts to current traffic types and volume. We assume IP traffic models for voice, HTTP and video users and optimize the scheduling functions in the access point (base station) of broadband mobile network in order to maintain QoS for the services. The interworking among admission control, load control and the adaptive scheduler is shown. The principles discussed here are not restricted to H/2 but can be exploited for any radio access technique (RAT) using adaptive schedulers, e.g. dynamic scheduling for reconfigurable terminals.	algorithm;common access card;control function (econometrics);electronic billing;hypertext transfer protocol;interference (communication);load (computing);load management;lookup table;microsoft outlook for mac;optimization problem;quality of service;radio resource management;scheduling (computing);semantic network;throughput;wireless access point	Jijun Luo;Markus Dillinger;Egon Schulz;Eiman Mohyeldin;Martin Weckerle;Bernhard Walke	2002		10.1109/PIMRC.2002.1047358	radio access network;cellular network;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;resource allocation;computer science;radio resource management;base station;operating system;scheduling;visual communication;computer network;broadband networks	Mobile	4.801765705546061	97.3568769551956	120146

They achieve this goal by releasing slots containing segments which have passed through all their destinations. However, erasure nodes may cause a dramatic degradation of fairness. This paper addresses the overload performance of a network with erasure nodes and the standard B WB mechanism enabled, when alternative implementation schemes of the erasure node protocol are considered. In particular, we present a numerical method to calculate the maximum throughput in any node of the network and discuss the conditions for achieving fairness. Finally, we show that the results obtained through the analytical approach are assessed by simulation.	elegant degradation;fairness measure;maximum throughput scheduling;numerical method;simulation	Andrzej R.

60c69f0bc02cc6d55cc34697736720d265ad1a01	groupdrm: group-based dynamic resource management model in wireless network		In the field of wireless communications, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) offers broadband data transmission for mobile computer and phone users. As a part of UMTS, the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) needs to deploy distributed resource management system to meet three key user operations: Apply, Locate and Release. The traditional resource management models are no longer suitable for the increasing user amount and dynamic these operations, and resource consumption is relatively large especially CPU. We propose a new group-based dynamic resource management model, called as GroupDRM, which can meet all demands. Comparing to the traditional static model and complete dynamic model, GroupDRM model greatly reduces the delay of apply. The model also shows its advantages over the traditional dynamic model on the performances of releasing, locating and resource consumption.

A new scheme is proposed employing round robin assignment of request slots (CFDAMA-RR), which is compared with the standard schemes incorporating random, packet accompanied, and Combined Requests (CFDAMA-CR). It is shown that the CFDAMA-RR scheme can offer improved delay/utilisation performance of a satellite channel due to its inherent fairness and contentionless nature. Simulation results are presented with three different source traffic models, Poisson, self-similar (Pareto ON-OFF) and exponential ON-OFF. The results indicate that the ON-OFF nature of a traffic model has a more significant impact on Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol performance than the specific distribution of ON and OFF times.

To efficiently transport these services will require both an understanding of the source traffic and novel network control schemes. The performance of variable-bandwidth-allocation schemes that estimate the required bandwidth for a VBR Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) video source is studied using a simple prediction algorithm. The advantages of using a layered MPEG coder over the standard MPEG coder are discussed. A method for controlling a layered MPEG coder to reduce the effect of cell losses when compared to a standard MPEG coder is demonstrated. >	atm turbo;moving picture experts group	Pramod Pancha;Magda El Zarki	1993	IEEE Trans.

Each of n players in a network game seeks to send a message with a certain length by choosing one of m parallel links. Each player is restricted to transmit over a certain subset of links and desires to minimize his own transmission-time (latency). We study Nash equilibria of the game, in which no player can decrease his latency by unilaterally changing his link. Our analysis of this game captures two important aspects of network traffic: the dependency of the overall network performance on the total traffic t and fluctuations in the length of the respective message-lengths. For the latter we use a probabilistic model in which message lengths are random variables. We evaluate the (expected) price of anarchy of the game for two social cost functions. For total latency cost, we show the tight result that the price of anarchy is essentially Θ (n √ m/t). Hence, even for congested networks, when the traffic is linear in the number of players, Nash equilibria approximate the social optimum only by a factor of Θ ( √ m). This efficiency loss is caused by link restrictions and remains stable even under message fluctuations, which contrasts the unrestricted case where Nash equilibria achieve a constant factor approximation. For maximum latency the price of anarchy is at most 1+m/t. In this case Nash equilibria can be (almost) optimal solutions for congested networks depending on the values for m and t. In addition, our analyses yield average-case analyses of a polynomial time algorithm for computing Nash equilibria in this	anarchy;approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;nash equilibrium;network packet;network performance;p (complexity);polynomial;routing;statistical model	Martin Hoefer;Alexander Souza	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-79309-0_4	price of stability;random variable;statistical model;mathematical optimization;best response;economics;mathematics;microeconomics;mathematical economics;network performance;welfare economics;price of anarchy;nash equilibrium	ECom	0.7761146983638039	92.88674616889449	120744

Some of the previous strategies addressing this issue leave an open gap, by requiring the use of information that is not generally available to the user (for example, the distance traveled by the user). For this reason, both the implementation of some of these strategies and the performance comparison to existing strategies is not clear. In this work we propose to close this gap by the use of Cell Identification Codes (CIC) for tracking mobile users. Each cell periodically broadcasts a short message which identifies the cell and its orientation relatively to other cells in the network. This information is used by the users to efficiently update their location. We propose several cell identification encoding schemes, which are used to implement different tracking strategies, and analyze the amount of information required by each tracking strategy. One of our major results is that there is no need to transmit a code which is unique for each cell. For example, a 3 bits CIC is sufficient to implement a distance-based tracking strategy in a two-dimensional system. In addition, we propose a combination of timer and movement tracking strategy, based on either a one-bit or a two-bit CIC, depending on system topology and user mobility. An important property of our framework is that the overall performance cost, and hence its comparison to existing methods, is evaluated for each tracking strategy. The CIC-based strategies are shown to outperform the geographic-based method currently used in existing networks, and the timer-based method, over a wide range of parameters. Moreover, this superiority increases as the number of users per cell increases.	timer	Zohar Naor;Hanoch Levy;Uri Zwick	2002	Wireless Networks	10.1023/A:1012723626016	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;mobile technology;computer security;wireless;computer network	Mobile	4.584706631686361	90.1798933457097	120953

This kind of network was usually modeled by means of bidimensional Markov Chains and more recently using semi-Markov process based models. Both these approaches are based on the assumptions of both full load network and independence of collision probability with respect to retransmission count of each packet. Our model inherently releases the latter hypothesis since it is not necessary to establish a constant collision probability at steady state.	design rule for camera file system	Marco Scarpa;Salvatore Serrano	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-61428-1_13	distributed coordination function;collision;real-time computing;steady state;computer science;distributed computing;carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;retransmission;network packet;markov process;markov chain	AI	5.1659793931993345	92.62968021990869	120960

Even though many underwater MAC protocols have been proposed and studied based on simulations and theoretical analysis, few work has been conducted to test and evaluate these protocols in a multi-hop real sea experiment. Due to the harsh acoustic channel condition caused by complex multi-path environment, fast varying acoustic channel and heterogenous channel quality, current simulators can hardly tell us how the protocols work in the real world. Along this direction, we conduced real sea experiments at Atlantic Ocean with 9 nodes deployed forming a multi-hop string network. In this experiment, the performance of three representative MAC protocols, random access based UW-Aloha, handshaking based SASHA, and scheduling based pipelined transmission MAC (PTMAC) are compared and analyzed at both packet behavior and node behavior levels. The end-to-end performance of these three protocols are also tested and studied in terms of throughput, delay, and packet delivery ratio. From field experiment results, the high packet loss rate and significant channel asymmetry, temporal and spatial transmission range uncertainty and delayed data transmissions are discovered to have evidential effects on the MAC performance. We provide some inspirations to address these observed issues in MAC design for real multi-hop networks.	acoustic cryptanalysis;end-to-end principle;experiment;handshaking;interference (communication);network packet;pmac (cryptography);random access;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Lina Pu;Yu Luo;Haining Mo;Zheng Peng;Jun-Hong Cui;Zaihan Jiang	2013	2013 IFIP Networking Conference	10.1016/j.comcom.2014.09.006	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	8.799037529434544	89.4891801437722	121021

To support multimedia services, the IEEE 802.15.3 TG adopts a time-slotted medium access control (MAC) protocol controlled by a central device. In the time division multiple access (TDMA)-based wireless packet networks, the packet scheduling algorithm plays a key role in quality of service (QoS) provisioning for multimedia services. In this paper, we propose an adaptive cross-layer packet scheduling method for the TDMA-based HR-WPAN. Physical channel conditions, MAC protocol, link layer status, random traffic arrival, and QoS requirement are taken into consideration by the proposed packet scheduling method. Performance evaluations are carried out through extensive simulations and significant performance enhancements are observed. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed scheme remains stable regardless of the variable system parameters such as the number of devices (DEVs) and delay bound.	access control;algorithm;half rate;network packet;provisioning;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;time of arrival	Sung Won Kim;Byung-Seo Kim	2006	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2006.6182769	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;operating system;transmission delay;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	2.0241260384574584	102.5169249521047	121220

This is the first method that allows analytical study of the Wi-Fi network performance with consideration of correlated channel failures usually inherent to wireless channels. Within the study, we consider the possible packet fragmentation that can be adopted to reduce the performance waste caused by noise-induced distortions. In addition to the throughput, our method allows estimation of the probability of a packet rejection occurring when the number of packet transmission retries attains its limit. The obtained numerical results of investigating Wi-Fi LANs by the developed method are validated by simulation and show high estimation accuracy as well as the method efficiency in determining the optimal fragmentation threshold.	brute-force search;continuation;distortion;fork (software development);fragmentation (computing);framing (world wide web);gilbert cell;hoc (programming language);hotspot (wi-fi);ip fragmentation;network packet;network performance;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;rejection sampling;retry;simulation;throughput	Andrey I.

As an effective load balance mechanism, traffics may be equivalently assigned to each RA, in proportion to its available capacity. To this end, airtime cost is identified as a common resource measure for WiMAX and WiFi links. Due to their different data transmission mechanisms, the calculation of airtime cost is separately derived. Based on the common metric, the offered traffic for each link is converted into airtime cost required for its transmission. Traffics are distributed so that cumulative airtime cost between RAs is fair. Evaluation results show that airtime cost model can commonly measure the link resources of heterogeneous wireless links, and this measurement enables traffics to be equally distributed, in proportion to their transmission capacity.	access network;airtime;analysis of algorithms;load balancing (computing);network packet;scenario (computing);testbed;traffic collision avoidance system	Jong-Ok Kim;Hiroshi Shigeno;Akira Yamaguchi;Sadao Obana	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394569	wimax;telecommunications;computer science;load balancing;computer security;computer network;data transmission;cumulant;access network	Mobile	7.69946588646258	96.44615010388732	121411

First, from the analysis of long-range dependency, we point out that TCP time series has a weak temporal correlation though UDP time series without huge flooding is well-modeled using a Poisson process. Next, we analyze the spatial correlation between two traffic time series divided by different sized darknet address blocks. We confirm that a TCP SYN traffic time series (e.g, virus or worm) has a clear spatial correlation in the arrival of packets between two neighboring address blocks. Indeed, this spatial correlation remains in traffic time series 1,000 addresses far from the target time series, even if a darknet address block is small (e.g., /26). On the other hand, TCP SYNACK traffic (e.g., backscatter) and UDP traffic (e.g., virus or worm) have less spatial correlation between two adjacent large address blocks. Finally, we estimate the average propagation delay of global unwanted activities appearing in TCP SYN traffic by using the generalized inter-correlation coefficient.	backscatter (email);coefficient;darknet;network telescope;propagation delay;software propagation;time series	Kensuke Fukuda;Toshio Hirotsu;Osamu Akashi;Toshiharu Sugawara	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.314	stochastic process;simulation;telecommunications;time series;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-2.994929411427291	99.23873579434355	121450

To conserve power consumption of mobile subscribe stations (MSSs), three types of power saving classes are defined in the IEEE 802.16e standard. However, the defined power saving mechanism is per-connection basis. When having multiple connections, the power saving efficiency of an MSS degrades significantly. In this paper, a Least-awake-frames scheduling (LAFS) algorithm is proposed to achieve both energy saving and quality-of-service (QoS) fulfillment. The proposed LAFS consists of three phases. The goals of the first two phases are determining awake-frame candidate sets of unsolicited grant service (UGS) connections and sleep/awake intervals of remaining service-classes connections; the third phase is to determine sleep and awake frames of an MSS. The simulation results show that our proposed LAFS algorithm outperforms the power saving protocol defined in the IEEE 802.16e, and other existing power saving algorithms.	access network;algorithm;mobile computing;mobile phone;power management;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation	Chia-Yen Lin;Hsi-Lu Chao;Yang-Jang Liao;Tzu-Jane Tsai	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699822	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile computing;computer network	Embedded	6.720428373426025	97.29313960485514	121476

In order to increase the flexibility of communication, this paper presents a communication protocol with dynamic choosing relay node and automatic cooperative communication called VC-TDMA (Vehicular Cooperative TDMA). The nodes can choose the multi-hop relay nodes rationally and other idle nodes can provide cooperative communication automatically. Considering batch arrival data traffic, the buffer queue state of nodes in the network is numerical analyzed by Markov Chain. The simulation results show that VC-TDMA can improve the throughput of the network compared with the conventional TDMA protocol.	blocking (computing);communications protocol;hoc (programming language);markov chain;network packet;network performance;numerical analysis;relay;simulation;throughput;vc dimension	Tianjiao Zhang;Qi Zhu	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504113	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;vehicular communication systems;spread spectrum;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	6.96199640498326	90.65336086410205	121946

To achieve fairness for best effort (BE) traffic from subscribers, we proposed N rate N+1 color marking (NRN+1CM). However, it is important to realize weighted fairness. Network operators often provide different services that limit the maximum bandwidth or ensure that bandwidth is allocated with appropriate weights. This paper proposes weighted NRN+1CM which can set the maximum bandwidth and the weight for each subscriber and to allocate bandwidth based on the weights. The proposed algorithm modifies the color generation probability with the weight. If the input rate exceeds the maximum rate, frames are discarded to limit the output rate. We confirmed the effect of the proposed algorithm from computer simulations. The throughput ratio matched the weights and the throughput was limited to the maximum rate regardless of changes in traffic.	access network;algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);best-effort delivery;computer simulation;fairness measure;item unique identification;network congestion;network topology;throughput	Yu Nakayama;Noriyuki Oota	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6654894	passive optical network;telecommunications;computer science;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	0.5586268606427406	95.6323654000334	121989

We derive techniques for bounding the probability of delay violations when the session injections are independent. This enables us to determine whether a given set of sessions can all meet their delay bounds with the required violation probability. These techniques can be used by a Connection Admission Control (CAC) scheme to decide whether to admit a new session. Our analysis applies to both the single node problem and the network problem in which the sessions have multiple hops. We also give extensive numerical results to illustrate how our bounds may be calculated and to compare the results with estimates that have been derived for GPS. In addition we show that by altering the deadlines for EDF we ran match the desired violation probabilities more closely.	common access card;earliest deadline first scheduling;global positioning system;multiplexing;network packet;numerical analysis;scheduling (computing)	Matthew Andrews	2000		10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832234	statistical time division multiplexing;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;quality of service;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;end-to-end delay;probability;distributed computing;scheduling;multiplexing;computer network	Theory	2.4377278191482885	97.23699551463822	122152
c4af8d09c1b3fa5b7bc29dd14212e36872e93f9b	bridging inter-flow and intra-flow network coding in wireless mesh networks: from theory to implementation		Abstract This paper presents and characterizes the performance of CORE, a protocol that brings together the efficiency in spectrum usage of inter–session network coding schemes and the robustness against packet losses of intra–session network coding. We provide in-depth mathematical analysis of the gains of CORE followed by protocol design and implementation details needed for CORE’s successful deployment in practice. Finally, we provide extensive measurements with off-the-shelf wireless nodes under various channel and system conditions comparing CORE to other state-of-the-art approaches, namely, forwarding (no coding) and COPE (inter-session network coding). These measurements support our theoretical findings, showing that CORE not only outperforms COPE and forwarding in general, but that order of magnitude gains are possible for cases with high packet losses. Specifically, CORE has a throughput gain of more than 10 x over a COPE-like scheme and 7 x over forwarding when the error ratio is 50 % on all links. Beyond these gains over other protocols, our measurements show that our CORE implementation can achieve close to optimal performance with a gap of less than 0.43 dB.	bridging (networking);flow network;linear network coding;mesh networking;wireless mesh network	Jonas Hansen;Jeppe Krigslund;Daniel Enrique Lucani;Peyman Pahlevani;Frank H.

Our goal is to maximize the number of packets to be sent in uplink such that the expectations from the system are guaranteed. We use our general model and the properties of the application to derive an algorithm which has two highly favorable features: it finds the optimal solution in linear time. Finally, we present a method to fine-tune our general model in order to make sure that the model represents the actual system. This approach guarantees that the optimal algorithm for the model is indeed the optimal scheduler for the system.	algorithm;formal language;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;time complexity	Arezou Mohammadi;Selim G.

Currently, most studies on Ethernet performance assume that the channel is divided into time slots, or the network load is saturated with little attention to a non-slotted channel and the non-saturation status. However, this situation is more consistent with the practical application of Ethernet. This paper first calculates the original collision probability and the retransmission collision probability in the original load, then obtains the retransmission load of the network based on those two collision probabilities, and finally acquires the actual load of the network by an iterative method. In addition, the accuracy of the analysis is checked against simulation results.	approximation algorithm;channel (communications);complexity;computation;iterative method;network packet;profiling (computer programming);propagation delay;real-time transcription;retransmission (data networks);simulation;software propagation;weight function	Ronggang Bai;Jiqiang Xia;Qingfeng Man	2015	Frontiers of Computer Science	10.1007/s11704-015-3306-z	real-time computing;collision domain;telecommunications;computer science;atm card;computer security;computer network	HPC	6.690415130775084	93.25506842528371	122409
4e4f4b3d04f1e1ec2b3a18318d9a42886b10ad25	high speed networks need proactive congestion control	flow scheduling;congestion control;datacenter network	As datacenter speeds scale to 100 Gb/s and beyond, traditional congestion control algorithms like TCP and RCP converge slowly to steady sending rates, which leads to poorer and less predictable user performance. These reactive algorithms use congestion signals to perform gradient descent to approach ideal sending rates, causing poor convergence times. In this paper, we propose a proactive congestion control algorithm called PERC, which explicitly computes rates independently of congestion signals in a decentralized fashion. Inspired by message-passing algorithms with traction in other fields (e.g., modern Low Density Parity Check decoding algorithms), PERC improves convergence times by a factor of 7 compared to reactive explicit rate control protocols such as RCP. This fast convergence reduces tail flow completion time (FCT) significantly in high speed networks; for example, simulations of a realistic workloads in a 100 Gb/s network show that PERC achieves up to 4x lower 99th percentile FCT compared to RCP.	algorithm;converge;data center;gigabyte;gradient descent;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;message passing;network congestion;simulation;traction teampage	Lavanya Jose;Lisa Yan;Mohammad Alizadeh;George Varghese;Nick McKeown;Sachin Katti	2015		10.1145/2834050.2834096	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;network congestion;computer security;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-3.386760460461519	93.14642107343114	122410

In traditional routing protocols, path(s) are selected aiming at providing optimal transmission performance for the current flow while little attention is paid to bandwidth efficiency. This greedy strategy results in the existence of large amounts of bandwidth fragments which can’t be fully used so that the networks capability to carry real-time flows is degraded. In this paper, bandwidth efficient Collaborative Quality of service Routing (CQR) is proposed. The defining aspect of CQR is to collaboratively optimize the path selections of multiple flows over the networks. The CQR problem is formulized as linear programming. Resource allocation vector is constructed to decouple the inherently dependent path selections between different flows and sub-gradient based searching algorithm is proposed to get the optimal solution. Simulation results show that CQR achieves higher call admission rate for real-time flow comparing to existed algorithm, under heavy load CQR outperforms traditional algorithms about 40% in call admission rate and has similar transmission cost.	quality of service;real-time transcription;routing	Xia Zhang;Hongyi Yu;Gang Zhou	2010		10.1109/APSCC.2010.20	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;linear programming;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	0.9433610744385382	91.3414260870637	122717

4e922760a71c56926c378e9a89805ba505c5cc94	comparative study of packet scheduling algorithm in lte network		Corresponding Author: Nor Asilah Wati Abdul Hamid Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universtit Putra Malaysia, Malaysia Email: asila@upm.edu.my Abstract: At present, Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is the most popular Internet access technology because of its robust wireless connectivity that can support data, voice, video and messaging traffic. This advantage has significantly increased the number of users availing themselves of these services through various devices. Such an increase in the number of users has also increased network traffic. Thus, scheduling algorithms are needed to prioritize and distribute available resources among users to improve system performance. Researchers have proposed several algorithms that focus on meeting the Quality of Service requirement for different applications. The current study evaluates the performance of four scheduling algorithms for LTE downlink transmission, namely, proportional fair, exponential PF, exponential rule and log-rule algorithms, in a certain scenario. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated using an LTE-Sim simulator. Simulation results show that the log-rule algorithm outperforms other packet scheduling algorithms in terms of delay, throughput and packet loss ratio when serving Voice-overInternet Protocol packet data service on the LTE network.	algorithm;assistive technology;compaq lte;computation;computer science;exptime;email;futures studies;internet access;malaysian identity card;network packet;network traffic control;pf (firewall);private label rights;proportionally fair;public lending right;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;telecommunications link;throughput;time complexity	Alaa Omer Najim;Nor Asilah Wati Abdul Hamid;Zurina Mohd Hanapi;Idawaty Ahmad	2017	JCS	10.3844/jcssp.2017.756.766	computer science;proportionally fair;computer network;internet access;throughput;quality of service;scheduling (computing);packet loss;network packet;cellular network	Metrics	3.8208209015161696	96.46280199657441	123249
dc3f336791a719884af87f91c28fb2bc6063f232	medium access scheme with power control to improve performance of flashlinq		Device-to-Device (D2D) communications has been considered to reduce heavy traffic load on Base Station (BS) since it enables devices to directly communicate with each other without a relay of BS. Recently, Qualcomm Inc. introduced FlashLinQ (FLQ) for D2D communications, which has a radio frame based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM). In FLQ, D2D User Equipments (DUEs) distributively access to medium based on Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR). When DUEs operate on a real-time service such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or File Transfer Protocol (FTP), DUE with low link quality may cause excessive yielding for medium access of other links. Thus, the service requirements of the other links cannot be guaranteed. In order to solve this problem, we propose a medium access scheme including transmission power control for DUEs in FLQ. In the proposed scheme, DUEs determine their transmission power based on the number of neighbor DUEs, and try accessing to medium with the controlled transmission power. Through simulations, we evaluate performance of the proposed scheme by comparing those of the conventional FLQ and Probabilistic Medium Access Scheme (PMAS). We show that the proposed scheme can improve performance of FLQ by simulation results.

In the current network calculus literature, the behavior of a server is typically modeled with the cumulative amount of service it successfully delivers, and the successfulness of service delivery implies no error in the delivered service. However, there are many networks such as wireless networks, where, not only is the service error-prone due to multi-access contention and/or random error on the communication link, but different error handling methods may also be applied. In such cases, it is difficult to directly apply the existing network calculus results due to lack of server models taking error into account. In this paper, an error server model is proposed for stochastic network calculus, based on which, an analysis on error servers is performed. The corresponding concatenation property is derived, which shows that under some general conditions, the tandem of error servers can be treated as an equivalent error server. In addition, to demonstrate the use and implication of the proposed error server model, performance bounds are derived and compared for a simple network. The study of the simple network shows that error handling may have significant impact on the performance bounds, and the proposed error server model can facilitate the analysis.	access network;bitstream;cognitive dimensions of notations;concatenation;exception handling;exclusive or;itil;network calculus;queueing theory;server (computing)	Jing Xie;Yuming Jiang	2008	2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2008.4664168	stochastic process;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Metrics	1.711419229560282	98.70187432698856	123426

Previous approaches either use a concatenation of regulator and scheduler, which employs two set of queues and two management systems, or a policer in front of scheduler. The former requires extra management overhead and inaccuracy, and the latter causes bursty traffic as well as inaccuracy. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling algorithm, called WF/sup 2/Q-M (worst-case fair weighted fair queueing with maximum rate control), to simultaneously support maximum rate control and provide minimum service rate guarantee. WF/sup 2/Q-M has similar worst case time complexity with WF/sup 2/Q designed to provide accurate scheduling. WF/sup 2/Q-M employs virtual clock adjustment to distribute the excess bandwidth of saturated sessions to other sessions without recalculating their virtual starting and finishing times. WF/sup 2/Q-M performance is theoretically bounded by a fluid reference mode, and simulations show WF/sup 2/Q-M performs just as claimed.	best, worst and average case;fair queuing;weighted fair queueing	Jeng-Farn Lee;Meng Chang Chen;Yeali S.

In this paper, we study the benefits of such Multiple Packet Transmission/Reception (MPTR) approach, when it is used in combination with a CSMA/CA MAC protocol for fully interconnected networks, addressing the interactions between the two mechanisms and showing the performance gains that can be achieved. To this end, a new MAC protocol, called MACMA (MAC protocol for Multiple Antenna wireless objects), is introduced and formulated as a very basic MAC protocol that captures the fundamental properties of a CSMA/CA channel access protocol supporting MPTR. Using the MACMA protocol as a reference, a new mathematical model for CSMA/CA MAC protocols supporting MPTR is presented for the case of non-saturated traffic sources with finite buffer space. Simulation results show that the analytical model is able to accurately characterize MACMA's steady-state behavior for different number of antennas and different traffic loads, providing a useful tool to understand the performance gains that the proposed scheme can achieve.	network packet	Boris Bellalta;Azadeh Faridi;Dirk Staehle;Jaume Barceló;Alexey V.

Our proposal is designed to work over aggregated flows that bundle a varying number of user flows for common treatment between two nodes in a network. To regulate the user data transmission rate, a Vegas-like management connection is established between the two edges of each aggregate. This control connection injects control packets into the network to probe its congestion level. Thanks to this managing, Ping Trunking is able to fairly share the network bandwidth among competing aggregates in accordance with their subscribed target rates. In addition, it does not cause undesired sharp variations in the transmission rates of handled aggregates and avoids packet losses at the core nodes. We demonstrate analytically and through simulation experiments the effectiveness of our technique.	network congestion	Sergio Herrería-Alonso;Manuel Fernández-Veiga;Miguel Rodríguez-Pérez;Andrés Suárez-González;Cándido López-García	2006	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2005.08.002	active traffic management;network traffic control;telecommunications;computer science;transmission control protocol;tcp vegas;packet loss;network congestion;computer security;bandwidth;computer network;data transmission	Networks	-0.7116029404396742	101.94112109506928	123785

Furthermore, an approximate approach is developed to compare the mean access delay of a multicast packet between these networks and the TT-FR system [1]. The approach is based on the discrete Geom/Geom/1 queue [2] and on the computation of blocking probabilities. Moreover, the analysis is validated by simulations and the impact of self-similar traffic is shown. The presented methodology enables the comparison of performance of future wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) multicast-capable medium access (MAC) protocols, allowing destination stripping, in terms of effective transmission, and multicast throughput capacity in addition to the access delay.	approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);computation;load balancing (computing);multicast;network packet;self-similarity;simulation;throughput;token ring;transmitter;wavelength-division multiplexing	Mohamad Chaitou;Gérard Hébuterne;Hind Castel-Taleb	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.372	telecommunications;computer science;probability;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;channel capacity;xcast;wavelength-division multiplexing;statistics;computer network	Metrics	3.2104315914862944	94.29617124607256	123867

A bit in the IP header is used in PC-RED to label the packet with the current status of the QoS that the dataflow is being treated in. The status of the QoS is determined by the difference between the packet average-dropping rate and the fixed desired limit dropping rate of the dataflow. PC-RED would perform dissimilarly to every dataflow corresponding to the different QoS status throughout congestions. PC-RED has been modeled and the parameter setting has been studied. Simulations of a TCP/IP network are used to illustrate how PC-RED affects the transfer of dataflow. The result shows remarkable contrast between the high-priority and non-priority dataflow throughput under PC- RED mechanism.

With high speed Internet links, efficient and effective packet sampling techniques for traffic measurement are not only desirable, but increasingly becoming a necessity. Packet sampling has become an attractive and scalable means to measure flow data on high speed links. Passive traffic measurement increasingly employs sampling at the packet level and makes inferences from sampled network traffic. However, it meets difficulty in estimating the original flow distribution. To circumvent the problem, we propose and analyze a double sampling technique for flow measurement. In particular, we rewrite the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that estimates flow distribution for double sampling. Using real network traffic traces, we show that the proposed double sampling technique indeed produces the desired accuracy in estimating the flow distribution.	experiment;network packet;sampling (signal processing);scalability	W.

The model uses a well-known Markov-Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) to capture traffic burstiness and correlations. Extensive analytical results have indicated that exponential dropping function is a good choice for AQM to support efficient congestion control.	active queue management;control system;network congestion	Lan Wang;Geyong Min;Irfan-Ullah Awan	2005		10.1007/11557654_10	case-based reasoning;active traffic management;simulation;systems modeling;poisson process;telecommunications;computer science;exponential function;markov process;bellman equation;network congestion;queue;correlation;active queue management;statistics	Networks	-0.5130458456102847	101.8678369310808	124289

A WDM grooming network can handle different classes of traffic streams which differ in their bandwidth requirements. We assume that for each class, call interarrival and holding times are exponentially distributed. Using a Markov Decision Process approach, an optimal CAC policy is derived for providing fairness in the network. The Policy Iteration algorithm is used to numerically compute the optimal policy. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic decomposition algorithm with lower computational complexity and good performance. Simulation results compare the performance of our proposed policy with those of Complete Sharing and Complete Partitioning policies. Comparisons show that our proposed policy provides the best performance in most cases. Although this approach is motivated by WDM networks, it may be deployed to determine the optimal resource allocation in many problems in wireless and wired telecommunications systems.	differentiated service;fairness measure;wavelength-division multiplexing	Kayvan Mosharaf;Ioannis Lambadaris;Jerome Talim	2005	Optical Switching and Networking	10.1016/j.osn.2005.06.004	markov decision process;exponential distribution;real-time computing;traffic grooming;computer science;distributed computing;computational complexity theory;computer network	Networks	1.2377872469617357	97.10510318670444	124344

The dynamics of vehicle passing and queueing as well as high mobility create distinctive propagation characteristics of wireless medium and inevitable uncertainty in space-time patterns of the vehicle density on a road. It is therefore of great importance to integrate stochastic geometry of vehicle locations into V2V channel modeling. In this paper, we characterize intervehicle communication in a random field of vehicles, where a beacon or head vehicle (transmitter) geobroadcasts safety or warning messages to neighboring client vehicles (receivers) randomly located in a cluster on the road. To account for a doubly stochastic spatial property of the VANET, we first model vehicle's random locations as a stationary Cox process with Fox's H-distributed random intensity (vehicle concentration) and derive the distributional functions of the `th nearest client's distance from the beacon in such a Fox Cox field of vehicles. We then consolidate this spatial randomness of receiving vehicles into a path loss model and develop a triply-composite Fox channel model that combines key wireless propagation effects such as the distance-dependent path loss, large-scale fading (shadowing), and small-scale fading (multipath fading).	channel (communications);doubly stochastic model;hoc (programming language);multipath propagation;randomness;software propagation;stationary process;transmitter;vehicle-to-vehicle	Youngmin Jeong;Jo Woon Chong;Hyundong Shin;Moe Z.

26fad71076029b7e7c0995e9d0b39a264e4abaa9	software package for the active queue management module model verification		Self-oscillation modes in control systems of data transmission networks negatively affect the characteristics of these networks. To investigate the self-oscillation mode for systems with a control module, the analytical model of the active queue management module was developed. The problem of verification of the obtained theoretical results arises in the study. Previously, a software system was developed for software emulation of the router. However, its use has caused some difficulties. Alternatively, the simulation model of network with active queue management module was developed. The paper describes a software package for verifying theoretical calculations based on the NS-2 simulation system. For illustration, a numerical example is given. INTRODUCTION When modeling technical systems, there is often a question of verification of results. Either there is no access to data on the functioning of such systems, or the acquisition of data is associated with large resource and time costs. But some simulation experiments can be seen as a solution to this problem. The problem of the occurrence of self-oscillatory regime in systems with control is considered (see Lautenschlaeger and Francini (2015)). In particular, the active queue management modules with RED-like algorithms were studied. Based on the theoretical model (see Misra et al. (1999); Kulyabov et al. (2018)) of the functioning of the RED module, the parameters of self-oscillating regimes were investigated. However, for completeness of the study, the verification of the results is necessary. We have developed the installation for a full-scale experiment on the basis of emulation of images of network equipment (see Velieva et al. (2015)). However, this approach required some extra resources, which were not at authors disposal. So, as a substitute, it was suggested to use the simulation model. In this paper, the simulation model based on the NS-2 network protocol simulation tool is described. This approach proved to be more flexible in comparison with the full-scale experiment on the basis of emulation of network operating systems.

These different simultaneous communications are called multiple-pair communications. In multiple-pair communications, an identical link that is shared on paths of different communications may exist. The link is called a common link. A controller of multiple-pair communications needs to know the link available bandwidth of the common link, which may limits the available bandwidth in simultaneous multiple-pair communications, for scheduled communications. An objective of scheduling is to complete all required communications as quickly as possible when each traffic demand is given. A conventional scheme is not able to estimate the link available bandwidth of a common link. This paper proposes a scheme for estimating an available bandwidth in simultaneous multiple-pair communications, which is called a simultaneous available bandwidth. To achieve this, the proposed scheme estimates the link available bandwidth of a common link by synchronizing packet streams at the common link if any common link exists and the bandwidth limits the simultaneous available bandwidth. The proposed scheme employs the metrics that are used to estimate the path available bandwidth of a single-pair communication in the conventional scheme, to synchronize packet streams. This paper formulates an optimal adjustment width of transmission time of a packet stream to synchronize packet streams when a target synchronization ratio is given.	grid network;network packet;php development tools;scheduling (computing);shortest path problem	Yusuke Satoh;Eiji Oki	2011	The 17th Asia Pacific Conference on Communications	10.1109/APCC.2011.6152762	bandwidth management;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Mobile	3.3118973898244755	94.05694489623384	124902

Its performance depends mainly on how optical resource sharing, among different competing access nodes, takes place. This network architecture has mostly been explored in regard to synchronous transmission. However, in the present paper, we focus on the performance of asynchronous transmission-based metropolitan networks with variable packet sizes. An analytical model is presented in an attempt to provide explicit formulas that express the mean access delay of each node of the bus-based optical access network. In addition, we prove that in such a network, fairness problems are likely to arise between upstream and downstream nodes sharing a common data channel. Furthermore, we show that sharing the available bandwidth fairly and arbitrarily between access nodes, as in slotted WDM rings, doesn’t resolve the fairness problem in asynchronous system.	access network;asynchronous circuit;asynchronous system;bus network;channel (communications);downstream (software development);fairness measure;global variable;network architecture;network packet;synchronization (computer science);upstream (software development);wavelength-division multiplexing	Nizar Bouabdallah;André-Luc Beylot;Guy Pujolle	2004		10.1007/978-3-540-24693-0_75	asynchronous system;shared resource;shared memory;network architecture;telecommunications;computer science;access control;asynchronous communication;computer security;equity;bandwidth;ring;telecommunications network;smoothing;access network	Networks	0.9129477687452573	101.17211731660088	124981

Because the channel used by wireless devices is a time-varying broadcast medium, these devices need to have multi-rate and rate-adaptive capability to adapt to the changing channel so that better performance can be achieved. In this paper, we propose an analytical model, which we call Rate-Adaptive Markov Chains, to study the saturation throughput and delay performance of an 802.11 WLAN in which the mobile hosts have multi-rate support, will use the ARF protocol to adapt rates for different channel qualities, and follow the DCF protocol to contend for data transmissions in a slowly-varying channel. Simulation results are also provided to verify the correctness of the model.	acoustic radiation force;bit error rate;correctness (computer science);design rule for camera file system;markov chain;network packet;network performance;noisy-channel coding theorem;profiling (computer programming);simulation;throughput;wavelan	Weikuo Chu;Yu-Chee Tseng	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e90-b.10.2836	markov chain;active traffic management;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;specification;saturation;statistics;data transmission	Mobile	2.5138439031082043	101.48808158105474	125097
7712d8fd4fb8ff2750c431c6e4a7b876b1b6c53c	an interference avoidance mac protocol design in mobile ad hoc networks	ieee 802 11 dcf;bandwidth allocation;interference;transmission rate;multi rate	The multi-rate IEEE 802.11 DCF MAC protocol can transmit control signals at a basic transmission rate and data signals at various transmission rates. When the transmission rates of the control signals and the data signals differ, the transmission range of the lower transmission rate is larger than the transmission range of the higher transmission rate. Since a lower transmission rate increases the transmission range, it also increases the nodes in the Network Allocation Vector (NAV) status and decreases the network throughput. However, if a neighbor receiving the control signal of the ongoing communication pair communicates with another node, it may occur signal interference. This study proposes a Space Overlapping MAC (SO-MAC) protocol to increase the communication pairs and avoid interferences in single radio for multi-rate wireless network. The SO-MAC protocol uses a channel division mechanism to avoid interference between the data and control signals. This study also proposes a bandwidth allocation strategy for the sub-channels to maximize the utilization of the bandwidth of the divided sub-channels. To solve the interference between the data signals, SO-MAC allows a neighbor of the sender and the receiver to use the received signal strength to determine whether it can send or receive the data signal to increase the communication pairs. Simulation results show that, compared to the IEEE 802.11 DCF protocol and DCA protocol, the proposed SO-MAC protocol with the bandwidth allocation strategy can increase the communication pairs, achieve better throughput, reduce the number of handshake failures, and decrease the delay of transmitting a packet. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The capacity demands to handle these new services led to a new era of wireless technologies. cdma2000 1xEV-DV is considered to be the solution for the ever-growing demand of high-speed wireless packet data transmission. In this paper, we investigate several aspects related to resource management techniques over the cdma2000 1xEV-DV reverse packet data channel (R-PDCH). In particular, based on the developed rise over thermal (RoT) model, we provide an upper bound for the R-PDCH throughput as a function of the number of mobile stations (MSs) that are allowed to transmit instantaneously on each time slot. We also provide a lower bound for the average sector throughput based on the number of users per sector. We propose several autonomous rate assignment, and scheduling techniques that provide a significant throughput improvement relative to other published techniques.

In this letter, we propose Adaptive Basic Rate Set (ABRS) that uses the time gap between DIFS and EIFS for a prioritized channel access while minimizing starvation. ABRS requires the change in the firmware only at access points with no modification to the standard. Simulation results reveal that ABRS effectively prioritizes stations with higher bit rates; the aggregate uplink throughput is improved up to about 30-70% even in mobility scenarios.	aggregate data;brs/search;backward compatibility;firmware;multi-user;requirement prioritization;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;wireless access point	Nakjung Choi;Yongho Seok;Taekyoung Kwon	2013	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2013.080113.122866	firmware;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	7.35824816232713	94.65393730993016	125381

Both systems have been proposed as possible evolutionary paths for the 1.25-MHz cdma2000 system [I], and have been designed to enable high data rate packet transmission. Link-level performance is evaluated by chip-level time-domain simulation of the forward data traftlc channel in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise, and is then used in a system-level simulator modeling a network of 19 three-sector cells. The system-level simulator accounts for slow and fast fading and two types of multi-path channel profdes, as described by the pedestrian A and vehicular B ITU-R channel models. The packet scheduling is performed using a proportionally fair (PF) scheduler. The systems use bit rate adaptation and hybrid ARQ to achieve 1% packet error rate (PER). AU users in the system are assumed to always have data packets available for transmission. System performance is evaluated for an embedded sector in terms of average sector throughput as a function of the number of users, distributions of data rates, and individual throughputs over a set of users. Results show the benefits of multi-user diversity exploited by the PF scheduler, and present throughput and fairness comparisons for the two systems.

Both the cases of an ideal and a faded channel are considered in the analysis: the model allows the introduction of the wireless channel characteristics, in terms of received power statistics of the first and second order. To this aim, a proper channel model is also presented that takes the typical characteristics of the wireless indoor channel into account. The analytical model gives a closed form derivation of the maximum offered load which keeps the system stable, and, thus, allows the assessment of the number of users to be admitted in the system. Through simulation the impact of the channel conditions on the maximum token holding time is also shown. It is found that, depending on the average signal-to-noise ratio experienced by the wireless terminals, the optimum maximum token holding time can be finite or not.	network packet;token ring	Gianni Pasolini;Roberto Verdone	2001		10.1109/ICC.2001.936315	token passing;telecommunications;computer science;signal-to-noise ratio;computer network	Mobile	7.693425406004365	95.60330338575585	125631

Due to the fact that this type of traffic carries critical information regarding the patients’ condition, it is vitally important that multimedia telemedicine traffic has highest transmission priority in comparison to all other types of traffic in the cellular network. However, the need for expedited and correct transmission of telemedicine traffic calls for a guaranteed bandwidth to telemedicine users. This creates a tradeoff between the satisfaction of the very strict Quality of Service requirements of telemedicine traffic and the loss of the guaranteed bandwidth in the numerous cases when it is left unused, due to the infrequent nature of telemedicine traffic. In this paper, we propose a fair scheduling mechanism for telemedicine traffic transmission over wireless cellular networks. The mechanism achieves high channel bandwidth utilization while offering full priority to telemedicine traffic.	fair-share scheduling;non-functional requirement;quality of service;scheduling (computing)	Lu Qiao;Polychronis Koutsakis	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073552	cellular network;real-time computing;quality of service;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;operating system;scheduling;bandwidth;wireless;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	7.058689049977265	97.35854454344762	125783

Since the finite storage capability of gateways affects the throughput it has to be considered for the analysis of interconnected networks. Different configurations of networks are studied: (i) gateways and the channels of local area networks have no buffer capacity constraints; (ii) only gateways have buffer capacity constraints; (iii) only the channels of local area networks have buffer capacity constraints; (iv) both gateways and the channels of the local area networks have buffer capacity constraints, (iv) both gateways and the channels of the local area networks have buffer capacity constraints. An approximation method is introduced which allows computation of the throughput for the above network configurations. Examples are given to demonstrate the impact of gateway buffer capacity on the performance of the network. Approximate results are compared and validated by simulation.	profiling (computer programming)	Ian F.

In this paper, we study the problem of providing real-time service to either hard or soft real-time messages in conjunction with a normal transmission service to variable-length messages without time constraints in Wavelength-Division-Multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. We propose an adaptive scheduling algorithm to schedule and manage message transmissions in single-hop passive-star coupler based WDM optical networks. We have analyzed the complexity of the algorithm to show its feasibility. In addition, we have conducted extensive discrete-event simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. This study suggests that when scheduling message transmission in WDM networks, a differentiated service should be designed to benefit the transmission of both real-time and non-real-time messages so that the overall performance of the network could be improved.	algorithm;differentiated services;scheduling (computing);wavelength-division multiplexing	Maode Ma;Mounir Hamdi	2004	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2004.01.017	real-time computing;differentiated service;computer science;discrete event simulation;distributed computing;scheduling;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Theory	1.6055382086664947	100.52470211241695	125841

Over the past years, several algorithms have been presented with the aim of providing QoS support in these environments; specifically, a lot of work has been done in the creation of a reliable admission control mechanism since it has been proved to be a fundamental element for QoS support in ad-hoc networks. In this paper we present a real implementation of DACME, a distributed admission control system for mobile ad-hoc networks, and we test its effectiveness in an IEEE 802.11e enabled testbed. Experimental results show that the solution developed is able to achieve good QoS levels, offering sustained bandwidth and bounded delay. Also, since DACME operates on an end-to-end basis, no restrictions are imposed on intermediate nodes.	algorithm;control system;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);quality of service;scalability;simulation;streaming media;testbed;throughput	Alvaro Torres;Carlos Miguel Tavares Calafate;Juan-Carlos Cano;Pietro Manzoni	2011	2011 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2011.6098149	mobile qos;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-0.5724744096513061	89.73281916774575	125903

The model of differentiated services has been proposed to support quality of service (QoS) in the IP-based Internet. It is also very important to have differentiated service support in OBS networks. When the burst scheduling in an OBS network is set up appropriately, network can support differentiated services. In this paper, we proposed a new burst scheduling scheme, called differentiated scheduling with identical priority offset time (DSIPO). In DSIPO, the same priority offset time is used for all the bursts destined to the same edge node regardless of their priorities. Differentiated services in terms of burst loss probability are achieved by processing the control packets of higher priority class bursts, thus reserving resources for their data bursts, more promptly upon their arrival than those of lower priority class bursts. Each intermediate (core) node can adjust the burst loss probabilities of various burst classes by choosing its own differentiated processing delay value for each priority class or its own differentiated processing delay difference value between any pair of adjacent priority classes. We model and analyse DSIPO in terms of the burst loss probability for each priority class with simulation validation. The performance of DISPO is evaluated by simulation.

First, IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN operates based on CSMA/CA. Unlike cellular system, STAs can not scan other channels while exchanging data frames with currently associated AP, because it would directly cause frame loss. To attack this problem, related works have tried to utilize Power Saving Mode (PSM) or multiple NICs. Second, beacon interval is too far apart for fast handoff (100 msec by default). Since an STA lacks knowledge about which channel its nearby APs are operating on, it should redundantly scan every single channel regardless whether any AP exists on that channel. Though shorter beacon interval or active scan enable an STA to locate its nearby BSSs more quickly, these approaches increase extra traffic to the limited bandwidth. Previous works tried to provide an STA with nearby AP information approximated by APs collaboratively.	approximation algorithm;experiment;phy (chip)	Jaeouk Ok;Pedro Morales;Andreas Darmawan;Hiroyuki Morikawa	2006		10.1145/1368436.1368481	statistical classification;real-time computing;traffic classification;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.450289834330983	88.91368923456626	126027

In this paper, a comparative test-bed experiment on a set of high speed TCP variants has been conducted to show their differences in bandwidth utilization, loss ratio and TCP-Fairness. The involved TCP Variants in this experiment are: NewReno, STCP, HS-TCP, H-TCP and CUBIC. These TCP variants have been examined in both cases of single and parallel schemes. The core of this work is how to evaluate these TCP variants over a single bottleneck network using a new parallel scheme to fully utilize the bandwidth of this network, and to show the impact of accelerating these variants on bandwidth utilization, loss-ratio and fairness. The results of this work reveal that, first: the proposed parallel scheme strongly outperforms the single based TCP in terms of bandwidth utilization and fairness. Second: CUBIC achieved better performance than NewReno, STCP, H-TCP and HS-TCP in both cases of single and parallel schemes. Briefly, parallel TCP scheme increases the utilization of network resources, and it is relatively good in fairness.	bandwidth-delay product;fairness measure;performance evaluation;testbed	Mohamed A.

This combination has been proposed as an efficient multiple access protocol for transmitting variable-length messages on slotted, high-speed, fiber-optic, bus-structured local and metropolitan area networks (LANs/MANs). Specifically, our present work extends the previous static model on this approach to the dynamic case so that the protocol can be implemented. Now, the model considers network loading changes, changes in message length distributions, etc. in order to preserve the desired form of the protocol’s operation (fairness), by adaptively adjusting the nehvork operating parameters. A dynamic simulation model of the protocol using the continuation-bit approach has been formulat@ and channel feedback information as discussed above has been employed to calibrate the operating parameters in real time. Since the goal was to study the operation of the dynamic protocol with variable-length messages, variable-bit-rate (VBR) coded (i.e., compmsexl) video was chosen as the traffic to be carried by the network in the illustrative examples. The simulation model indicates that channel feedback is a good approach for dynamically adjusting the network pammeters as the network loading and the message lengths fluctuate.	continuation;fairness measure;optical fiber;scheduling (computing);simulation;transmitter;volume boot record	Subrata Banerjee;Biswanath Mukherjee	1991				Networks	3.347415089998152	94.29187564250086	126497
da28bf2909a339845ff7cfd24037adef61b0f671	enhancing transmission collision detection for distributed tdma in vehicular networks		The increasing number of road accidents has led to the evolution of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), which allow vehicles and roadside infrastructure to continuously broadcast safety messages, including necessary information to avoid undesired events on the road. To support reliable broadcast of safety messages, distributed time division multiple access (D-TDMA) protocols are proposed for medium access control in VANETs. Existing D-TDMA protocols react to a transmission failure without distinguishing whether the failure comes from a transmission collision or from a poor radio channel condition, resulting in degraded performance. In this article, we present the importance of transmission failure differentiation due to a poor channel or due to a transmission collision for D-TDMA protocols in vehicular networks. We study the effects of such a transmission failure differentiation on the performance of a node when reserving a time slot to access the transmission channel. Furthermore, we propose a method for transmission failure differentiation, employing the concept of deep-learning techniques, for a node to decide whether to release or continue using its acquired time slot. The proposed method is based on the application of a Markov chain model to estimate the channel state when a transmission failure occurs. The Markov model parameters are dynamically updated by each node (i.e., vehicle or roadside unit) based on information included in the safety messages that are periodically received from neighboring nodes. In addition, from the D-TDMA protocol headers of received messages, a node approximately determines the error in estimating the channel state based on the proposed Markov model and then uses this channel estimation error to further improve subsequent channel state estimations. Through mathematical analysis, we show that transmission failure differentiation, or transmission collision detection, helps a node to efficiently reserve a time slot even with a large number of nodes contending for time slots. Furthermore, through extensive simulations in a highway scenario, we demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly improves the performance of D-TDMA protocols by reducing unnecessary contention on the available time slots, thus increasing the number of nodes having unique time slots for successful broadcast of safety messages.	access control;channel (communications);channel state information;collision detection;deep learning;hoc (programming language);markov chain;markov model;simulation;software propagation	Sailesh Bharati;Hassan Aboubakr Omar;Weihua Zhuang	2017	TOMCCAP	10.1145/3092833	vehicular ad hoc network;collision;computer network;collision detection;time division multiple access;computer science;markov model;markov chain;wireless ad hoc network;communication channel	Mobile	6.230004259461598	89.02257968908195	126602

The buffer is divided into virtual queues, each of which is assigned to provide a guaranteed IP service. In such a system, strong correlation between the packet interarrival times and the service times exists in each virtual queue since each packet arriving through a link with finite bandwidth is transmitted only after the system receives the entire packet. We provide a framework, including an accurate analytical model and its solution, to compute the queue length distribution for each virtual queue and the total buffer requirement for the shared memory buffer in the MPLS LER system supporting multiple guaranteed IP services simultaneously. Some numerical results on the buffer requirement and the impact of correlation on the performance are considered.

A Markov Decision Problem with an average cost criterion is formulated where the possible actions are to either continue the retransmission process of an erroneous packet at the next time slot or to drop the packet and move on to the next packet awaiting for transmission. The cost per slot is a linear combination of the current queue length and a penalty term in case dropping is chosen as action. The investigation seeks policies that provide the best possible average packet delay-dropping trade-off for Quality of Service guarantees. An optimal deterministic stationary policy is shown to exist, several structural properties of which are obtained. Based on that, a class of suboptimal < L,K >-policies is introduced. These suggest that it is almost optimal to use a K-truncated ARQ protocol as long as the queue length is lower than L, else send all packets in one shot. The work concludes with an evaluation of the optimal delay-dropping tradeoff using dynamic programming and a comparison between the optimal and suboptimal policies.	automatic differentiation;channel state information;decision problem;dynamic programming;markov chain;network packet;optimal control;quality of service;retransmission (data networks);stationary process;transmitter	Anastasios Giovanidis;Gerhard Wunder;Jörg Bühler	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.080959	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;markov process;automatic repeat request;statistics;computer network	Metrics	2.650337917532968	100.276657675084	126794

In the standard, it defines three types of power saving classes (PSCs) for flows with different QoS characteristics. It allows a mobile device to turn off its wireless radio when all its PSCs are in sleep states. In this paper, we consider the scheduling of power saving classes of type II in an IEEE 802.16e network with a BS and multiple MSSs (mobile subscriber stations). Previous work proposes to enforce all MSSs to have the same sleep cycle, thus leading to higher energy cost for those MSSs with less strict delay bounds. We observe that if the sleep cycles of MSSs can be assigned according to their delay bounds, MSSs can significantly reduce their duty cycles. We propose an efficient tank-filling algorithm, which is standard-compliant and can allocate resources to MSSs according to their QoS characteristics with the least number of active frames. Simulation results verify that our algorithm incurs less power consumption and leads to higher bandwidth utilization than the previous schemes.	algorithm;ieee 1471;ieee 754-1985;moea framework;mobile device;national supercomputer centre in sweden;power management;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation	Jen-Jee Chen;Jia-Ming Liang;Yu-Chee Tseng	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502367	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;efficient energy use;computer network	Embedded	6.79744642973983	97.24894231962266	126832

This paper proposes an adaptive network resource management scheme in the popular IEEE 802.11 random access MAC by adaptively adjusting the minimum contention window sizes of traffic flows. First, a novel generalized processor sharing (GPS) model is presented for the IEEE 802.11 random access MAC revealing the relationship between the minimum contention window size of a traffic flow and the amount of network resource this flow can receive. Using this GPS MAC model, a feedback control system model for the proposed adaptive network resource management system is developed, by directly extending our previous work in wireline GPS networks. Based on the feedback control system model, adaptive P and adaptive PI controllers are designed, and their performances are studied in simulations. Simulation results show that by using the designed controllers, the proposed adaptive network resource management approach is able to provide guaranteed distinct QoS support to traffic flows.	control system;feedback;generalized processor sharing;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);performance;quality of service;random access;requirement;simulation;software deployment;throughput;wireless mesh network	Hao Wang;Changcheng Huang;James Yan	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.932	ieee 802.11s;wireless ad hoc network;service set;network allocation vector;real-time computing;adaptive control;computer science;resource management;feedback;distributed computing;wireless distribution system;computer network	Mobile	4.815277050576325	96.70220926839974	126942

In this paper, we first introduce the OCPS paradigm. Significantly, we present a QoS-enhanced traffic control scheme exerted during packet aggregation at ingress nodes, aiming at providing delay and loss class differentiations for OCPS networks. Serving a dual purpose, the scheme is called (/spl psi/,/spl tau/)-Scheduler/Shaper, where /spl psi/ and /spl tau/ are the maximum burst size and burst assembly time, respectively. To provide delay class differentiation, for IP packet flows designated with delay-associated weights, (/spl psi/,/spl tau/)-Scheduler performs packet scheduling and assembly into bursts based on their weights and a virtual window of size /spl psi/. The guaranteed delay bound for each delay class is quantified via the formal specification of a stepwise service curve. To provide loss class differentiation, (/spl psi/,/spl tau/)-Shaper facilitates traffic shaping with larger burst sizes assigned to higher loss priority classes. To examine the shaping effect on loss performance, we analytically derive the departure process of (/spl psi/,/spl tau/)-Shaper. The aggregate packet arrivals are modeled as a two-state Markov modulated Bernoulli process (MMBP) with batch arrivals. Analytical results delineate that (/spl psi/,/spl tau/)-Shaper yields substantial reduction, proportional to the burst size, in the coefficient of variation of the burst interdeparture time. Furthermore, we conduct extensive simulations on a 24-node ARPANET network to draw packet loss comparisons between OCPS and just-enough-time (JET)-based OBS. Simulation results demonstrate that, through burst size adjustment, (/spl psi/,/spl tau/)-Shaper effectively achieves differentiation of loss classes. Essentially, compared to JET-based OBS using out-of-band control and offset-time-based QoS strategy, OCPS is shown to achieve invariably superior packet loss probability for a high-priority class, facilitating better differentiation of loss traffic classes.	aggregate data;assembly language;best, worst and average case;city of heroes;classful network;coefficient;euler–bernoulli beam theory;formal specification;markov chain;microsoft windows;modulation;network calculus;network packet;noise shaping;optical burst switching;out-of-band agreement;packet switching;priority queue;programming paradigm;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;social inequality;stepwise regression;traffic shaping;wavelength-division multiplexing;weight function	Maria C.

In this paper, we propose results that can be used to improve the operation of link layer QoS mechanisms. We propose novel segmentation methods that decrease the delay of both low priority and high priority packets in a priority system.

In intelligent communication environments, the main difficulty arising in designing an efficient congestion control scheme lies in the large propagation delay in data transfer which usually leads to a mismatch between the network resources and the amount of admitted traffic. To attack this problem, this paper describes a novel congestion control scheme in intelligent communication environments, which is based on a Back Propagation (BP) neural network technique. We consider a general computer communication model with multiple sources and one destination node. The dynamic buffer occupancy of the bottleneck node is predicted and controlled by using a BP neural network. The controlled best-effort traffic of the sources uses the bandwidth, which is left over by the guaranteed traffic. This control mechanism is shown to be able to avoid network congestion efficiently and to optimize the transfer performance both by the theoretic analyzing procedures and by the simulation studies.

Closed-form expressions are obtained for the cases of exponentially distributed burst sizes, deterministic burst sizes and mixtures of deterministic burst sizes. The performance of asynchronous optical buffers shows the same characteristics as that of synchronous optical buffers: a reduction in throughput due to the creation of voids on the outgoing channel and a burst loss probability that is strongly influenced by the choice of fiber delay line granularity. The optimal value of the latter depends on the burst size distribution and the offered load.	analog delay line;approximation algorithm;gnu free documentation license;heuristic (computer science);numerical analysis;optical buffer;optimization problem;queueing theory;scheduling (computing);throughput	Wouter Rogiest;Koenraad Laevens;Dieter Fiems;Herwig Bruneel	2005	Perform.

This allows classic end-to-end congestion control algorithms to achieve acceptable throughput even in the presence of radio links. The present work investigates the performance of Westwood+ and NewReno TCP over a noisy wireless LAN channel. In particular, the effect of local error control persistency on the end-to-end performances of Westwood+ and NewReno TCP is addressed. The investigation has been carried out by using ns-2 computer simulation. Simulation results show that (1) in the presence of uniformly distributed packet losses a well tuned local error control leads both Westwood+ and NewReno TCP to full network utilization; (2) in the presence of bursty losses Westwood+ TCP improves the good-put with respect to NewReno TCP also in the presence of local error control; in particular, Westwood+ TCP requires a smaller number of retransmissions at the link layer than New Reno to achieve full utilization of the wireless channel.	error detection and correction;performance evaluation	Luigi Alfredo Grieco;Saverio Mascolo	2003		10.1109/LCN.2003.1243170	tcp westwood;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;computer science;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;wi-fi array;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;computer network	Vision	-2.245799004963429	92.08374755518349	128049

By means of a combination of analytic and simulation results, we will demonstrate that this parameter plays an important role in the calculation of the moments of the amount of work in a buffer, both in a scenario where (a superposition of) MPEG-4 video traces are used as input of the buffer, as well as when the (correlated) arrivals are generated by a stochastic model. As such, the burst factor is a key parameter for buffer dimensioning purposes.	brainfuck;numerical analysis;quantifier (logic);quantum superposition;scalability;simulation;traffic analysis	Bart Steyaert;Dieter Claeys;Herwig Bruneel	2013	Inf.

However, taking into account the cell irregular shape, the specific pdf may be unavailable while only the measured statistical moments are available. Moreover, the pdf function may not exist a closed-form LT, for example, lognormal distribution function. In this paper, based on the Central Limit Theorem and hyper-Erlang universal approximation property, we propose an approximation method applicable in the situations when only the statistical moments are available or LT of pdf does not exist. We then employ the technique in diverse applications, including the performance analysis of wireless network and the cost evaluation of mobility management. Extensive numerical examples demonstrate the good approximation capability to the exact formula and the simulation results.

To increase network capacity, channel assignment can be exercised in a hierarchical cellular network (HCN). By considering the speeds of MSs, we propose an HCN channel assignment approach called repacking on demand (RoD). A simulation model is developed to investigate the performance of RoD and some previously proposed approaches for HCN. Our study quantitatively shows that RoD significantly outperforms the previous proposed approaches. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that the throughput fairness criterion is easier to achieve than its delay counterpart. The delay fairness, when achieved, induces approximate throughput fairness. The current practice in the field of protocol design for unidirectional bus MANs appears to focus almost exclusively on the throughput fairness. For example, in the DQDB protocol, although a bandwidth balancing function exists, balancing delay performance has never been dealt with. >		Yu Gong;Michael Paterakis	1995	IEEE Trans.

MAC protocols for 4G mobile radio networks, also known as IMT-Advanced systems, will operate on high data rate channels resulting in short packet transmission duration. With the help of the FDT concept the resulting increased overhead can be reduced and thus the MAC protocol is able to work in a highly efficient way. To improve the multi-hop communication applied in mobile radio systems with RECs the minimization of overhead is of particular importance. Based on analytical calculations in this paper it is shown that FDTs are very well suited to minimize the overhead in RECs and therefore are a means to enable MAC protocols meeting the demands expected from 4G mobile radio networks.	data rate units;interactive machine translation;network packet;overhead (computing);powerflasher fdt;relay;requirement	Ole Klein;Michael Einhaus;Alexander Federlin;Erik Weiss	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394136	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	8.410646438283239	93.65975097422064	129048

When the message arrival rate including retransmissions exceeds the message serving capacity of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server, the queue size increases and eventually the SIP server can be crashed. In our previous studies, we proposed a priority based request scheduling mechanism (PRSM) to guarantee the survivability of SIP server under heavily loaded traffic conditions. In this paper, we introduce a fluid-flow analytical model to study the behavior of the overloaded SIP server with PRSM under various test scenarios. The experiments performed using both analysis and simulation tools indicate that the proposed model can accurately capture the dynamic behavior of a SIP server with the PRSM. The numerical results verify the effectiveness of the PRSM which provides consistently better scalability compared to the conventional SIP thus enable us to prevent server overload.	experiment;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;queueing theory;scalability;scheduling (computing);server (computing);server hog;simulation	Demir Y.

However, since the signals associated to collisions have important information concerning the packets involved, with proper retransmissions we can efficiently resolve collisions. In this paper we propose a multipacket detection technique for OFDM schemes (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) that allows an efficient packet separation in the presence of collisions. This technique allows high throughputs, since the total number of transmissions can be equal to the number of packets involved in the collision. By using different interleavers for different retransmissions we can successfully separate packets involved in a collision even when the channel remains fixed for the retransmissions.	access control;multiplexing;network packet;retransmission (data networks);throughput	Nuno M.

In this paper, we propose a new equivalent speed parameter and develop an analytical model to explain the effect of vehicle mobility on the connectivity of highway segments in a VANET. We prove that the equivalent speed is different from the average vehicle speed and it decreases as the standard deviation of the vehicle speed increases. Using the equivalent speed we derive a novel analytical expression for the average number of vehicles on a highway segment, which allows us to accurately predict the network 1 connectivity. We verify the correctness of our analytical approach by comparing the numerical results with simulations. The results show that increasing the average vehicle speed increases the equivalent speed, which leads to a decrease in the average number of vehicles on a highway segment and consequently degrades connectivity. On the other hand increasing the standard deviation of the vehicle speed decreases the equivalent speed, which leads to an increase in the average number of vehicles on a highway segment and consequently improves connectivity. The results also show that vehicles in a VANET can adaptively choose their transmission range to ensure network connectivity in highway segments while minimising power consumption.	correctness (computer science);hoc (programming language);numerical analysis;simulation	Salman Durrani;Xiangyun Zhou;Abhas Chandra	2010	2010 IEEE 72nd Vehicular Technology Conference - Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2010.5594505	vehicular ad hoc network;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Robotics	5.034525923553307	89.06391430203983	129679

It is basically a hybrid of carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) and the broadcast recognizing access method (BRAM). CSMA/CD, which is contention-based, works well under light traffic, but message collisions degrade system performance when the channel becomes heavily loaded. BRAM, which is collision-free, has no longer delays at low load, but its efficiency improves as the load increases. Performance models are developed for the hybrid protocol and for the Ethernet protocol, a proven commercial implementation of CSMA/CD-type protocols. It is found that the hybrid protocol gives better performance for a wide range of scenarios. >		Jason S. J. Chen;Victor O. K.

The presented model implements different transmission probabilities for the primary and alternate voice and video queues. Additionally, it includes such features as virtual collision handling, backoff differentiation, and Arbitration Inter-Frame Space differentiation. The presented results show the difference in the operation of IEEE 802.11aa intra-access category prioritization and EDCA inter-access category prioritization.

The first """"dual"""" control law is able to achieve the first three objectives for arbitrary networks and delays, but is forced to constrain the resource allocation policy. We subsequently develop a """"primal-dual"""" law that overcomes this limitation and allows sources to match their steady-state preferences at a slower time-scale, provided a bound on round-trip-times is known.We develop two packet-level implementations of this protocol, using 1) ECN marking, and 2) queueing delay, as means of communicating the congestion measure from links to sources. We demonstrate using ns-2 simulations the stability of the protocol and its equilibrium features in terms of utilization, queueing and fairness, under a variety of scaling parameters."""	approximation algorithm;distributed control system;explicit congestion notification;fairness measure;image scaling;item unique identification;network congestion;network packet;optimal control;queuing delay;router (computing);simulation;steady state	Fernando Paganini;Zhikui Wang;John Doyle;Steven H.

Tel.: +44 1782294027. E-mail address: c.mbarushimana@staffs.ac.uk (C With the increase of multimedia traffic over the Internet, current network protocols are largely concerned with the QoS requirements of delay-sensitive applications. In Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), the majority of protocols developed to date provide QoS mechanisms by assigning high priority to delay-sensitive applications. While today’s Internet traffic is still dominated by TCP-based applications, the negative effects of the IEEE 802.11e service differentiation scheme on TCP performance in the presence of high priority traffic have not been adequately addressed in the literature. In this paper we first evaluate the performance of TCP in 802.11e MANETs when competing with high priority VoIP traffic. We then propose a novel TCP-friendly scheme, called IEDCA, to improve IEEE 802.11e EDCA mechanism. Our simulation-based performance study demonstrates that our proposed scheme IEDCA not only improves the performance of TCP significantly, it also facilitates the voice traffic transmission. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although different types of QoS classes have been defined by the IEEE 802.16 standard, the scheduling architecture is left to be vendor specific. In this paper, new modifications are purposed, and a detailed simulation study is performed, for different scheduling algorithms which are: RR (Round Robin), WRR (weighted Round Robin) and DRR (Deficit Round Robin). Analysis and evaluation of the performance of each scheduler to support the different QoS classes have been performed. The simulation results show that the purposed channel aware modified DRR scheduler can provide higher service standards to support the QoS in terms of packet loss ratio and bounded delay, which is required by different types of traffic in a time varying channel.	algorithm;correctness (computer science);deficit round robin;high-dynamic-range rendering;itil;network packet;quality of service;requirement;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;weighted round robin	Mohamed Y.

In revision D, the reverse link peak data rate has been increased by an order of magnitude from 153.6 kb/s to 1.8 Mb/s, and the reverse link sector throughput has been improved significantly (from about 280 kb/s to 600 kb/s). The key enabling mechanisms to achieve these enhancements include a hybrid automatic repeat request protocol, adaptive higher order modulation and coding schemes, and advanced radio resource management schemes. It is well known that the reverse link is interference limited, so the system resource of interest is reverse link interference. cdma2000 Revision D introduces a variety of flexible medium access control mechanisms to allocate appropriate reverse link resources for mobile stations with various service requirements. Moreover, cdma2000 revision D greatly enhances quality of service support for the reverse link.	access control;control system;data rate units;extended validation certificate;hybrid automatic repeat request;interference (communication);mebibyte;modulation;network packet;quality of service;radio resource management;requirement;telecommunications link;throughput	David R.

In this paper we propose a Cognitive Radio Admission Control Scheme based on a Multilayer Feed-forward Neural Network. According to our scheme, the eNodeB performs Radio Admission Control using a cognitive engine that learns from the past experience how the admission of a new session would affect the QoS of all sessions in the future. We implemented our Radio Admission Control Scheme using a LTE-EPC simulator. Since our scheme is based on learning from the past experience, we expect that it will be able to satisfy QoS requirements, in a variety of realistic scenarios, which can not be accounted for in analytical models.	algorithm;artificial neural network;cognitive radio;compaq lte;quality of service;requirement;telecommunications network	Biljana Bojovic;Nicola Baldo;Paolo Dini	2012	2012 3rd International Workshop on Cognitive Information Processing (CIP)	10.1109/CIP.2012.6232936	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	5.690508734768534	97.81958833557776	130121

Real-time traffic usually utilizes a significant amount of resources while traversing through the network. To provide guaranteed service for delay-sensitive real-time applications, both resource reservation and effective traffic control are necessary. The resource reservation protocol (RSVP) was developed to deal with the former problem while various approaches have been proposed to solve the latter one. It is crucial for guaranteed services to maintain satisfactory performance through effective traffic control, which must be implemented in a feasible way and be able to work with RSVP. In this article, we present a flexible and effective traffic-control approach with a resource reservation scheme to accommodate delaysensitive services on the Internet. We demonstrate that our approach features proven bounded end-to-end queueing delay for delay-sensitive applications and good resilience for resource allocation. In addition, our packet transmission discipline achieves significant improvement in end-to-end delay control.	access control;data buffer;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;internet;network packet;quality of service;queuing delay;real-time clock;real-time transcription;resource reservation protocol	Pi-Chung Wang;Chia-Tai Chan;Yaw-Chung Chen	2000	J.

For cost efficiency and backward compatibility with legacy transceiver hardware, a simple approach to address interference is by appropriately configuring the carrier sensing thresholds in wireless CSMA protocols, particularly in dense wireless networks. Most prior studies of the configuration of carrier sensing thresholds are based on a simplified conflict graph model, whereas this paper considers a realistic signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio model. We provide a comprehensive study for two effective wireless CSMA protocols: Cumulative-interference-Power Carrier Sensing  and Incremental-interference-Power Carrier Sensing, in two aspects: (1) static  approach that sets a universal carrier sensing threshold to ensure interference-safe transmissions regardless of network topology, and (2) adaptive approach that adjusts the carrier sensing thresholds dynamically based on the feedback of nearby transmissions. We also provide simulation studies to evaluate the starvation ratio, fairness, and goodput of our approaches.	acknowledgement (data networks);backward compatibility;cost efficiency;fairness measure;goodput;interaction;interference (communication);network topology;norm (social);serializability;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;transceiver;transmitter	Chi-Kin Chau;Ivan Wang Hei Ho;Zhenhui Situ;Soung Chang Liew;Jialiang Zhang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2016.2557780	transmitter;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;interference;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;computer network	Mobile	9.805055854960194	90.73254298819417	130247

The call admission protocol must decide either to accept the call or reject it, Thus having an impact on both the quality of calls and the network revenues. The call admission protocol must deal with multiple classes of calls having different requirements, requesting different quality of service and with different priorities. In this paper, we propose a protocol for call admission control in cellular networks. Our protocol can effectively deal with multiple traffic classes each with different bandwidth requirements and different priorities. We also present simulation results for our protocol and compare it with existing protocols. Simulation results show that our protocol can give preferential treatment for high priority traffic without affecting the network utilization.	bandwidth (signal processing);communications protocol;fairness measure;newman's lemma;performance evaluation;priority queue;quality of service;requirement;simulation;throughput	Mokhtar Aboelaze;Ayman Elnaggar	2004			computer science;distributed computing;computer network;call admission control;cellular network;bandwidth allocation	Networks	0.9017854043215366	96.12421751951089	130252

As ATM Networks are more widely used, security services become a compelling requirement. Encryption in ATM Networks allows users to select an appropriate algorithm to implement security services for a given application. Algorithm-Agile-Encryptors (AAEs) implement multiple encryption algorithms in a single device. AAEs also reduce operational costs when they are shared among several users. However, algorithm agility may re-order cells belonging to different Virtual Circuits (VCs) and thereby affect the negotiated QoS. The two ways of scheduling the encrypted cells from the AAE are `FIFO queuing' and `Delay equalization'. This paper addresses the effect of the existing scheduling schemes on the QoS of ATM Networks. Further, a scheduling scheme called Partition Equalizer (PE) has been proposed and analyzed. It has been shown that the PE reduces both the Cell Transfer Delay and the Cell Delay Variation compared to the other existing schemes such as `FIFO queuing' and `Delay equalization'. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper, we investigate the properties of a Head-of-Line (HOL) delay based scheduling algorithm, and prove that it can achieve throughput-optimality with flow-level dynamics. The algorithm is easy to implement because it requires no prior knowledge of the statistics of the arrival traffic and channel state information. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the theoretical conclusion and evaluate the performance. It is shown that, at the presence of flow-level dynamics, the HOL delay based scheduling algorithm can outperform the classic queue-length based MaxWeight scheduling, and can achieve a similar performance as other known throughput-optimal scheduling while it is simpler and more practical to implement.	algorithm;channel state information;hol (proof assistant);hol light;microwave;multi-user;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Yi Chen;Xuan Wang;Lin Cai	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037581	fair-share scheduling;nurse scheduling problem;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;flow shop scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;genetic algorithm scheduling;operating system;two-level scheduling;deadline-monotonic scheduling;stride scheduling;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;gain scheduling;least slack time scheduling;lottery scheduling;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;wireless;proportionally fair;computer network	Mobile	4.033478682425369	96.05903645208565	130630

Among all service types, available bit rate (ABR) is used primarily for transferring data files. Flow control is essential in ABR service. In this paper, we propose a new hop-by-hop credit-based flow control scheme with shared buffers. In this scheme, we introduce the concept of request cells to let upstream stations request credits from downstream stations such that downstream stations know the transmission requirements of upstream stations in the early stages of transmission. This allows the downstream stations to arrange their buffer spaces for different virtual connections (VCs) according to real needs, priorities, and fair access of different VCs. Simulation results show that the scheme improves the total throughput compared to the traditional credit-based flow control scheme, flow controlled virtual connections, without shared buffers under the same conditions. In one simulation, the total throughputs are increased by as many as 16.4%.	flow control (data);hop-by-hop transport	Wei Kuang Lai;Duan Ruei Shiu;Mei Chian Liou;Jiunn-yih Tsai	1999	Computer Communications	10.1016/S0140-3664(99)00122-X	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;flow control;computer network	Networks	-1.144314899492597	95.01682193570356	130742

This has brought about the development of fair bandwidth sharing mechanisms at routers to deal with non-responsive flows. One such scheme that allocates bandwidth fairly to competing flows is core stateless fair queueing. This scheduling technique divides the network into edge routers that dominate the edge of the network and core routers that inhabit the interior of the network. However complexity contained at the edge of the network can prohibit the full-scale implementation of the scheme. We discuss the development of an alternative fair bandwidth-sharing mechanism that removes the edge router complexity imposed by CSFQ etc. and distributes bandwidth fairly amongst competing flows. To this end, we propose an algorithm known as source layered rate estimation (SLRE).	algorithm;fair queuing;full scale;internet;offset binary;router (computing);scheduling (computing);stateless protocol	Kon Papazis;Naveen K.

By block delivery delay, we mean how long it takes the destination to receive all the K information packets of a single block. Our work includes two parts. First, we give a general analysis of the dependency between packet spaces spanned by different nodes in a stochastic way. Then we simplify the result by means of the approximation. By the dependency analysis, we can accurately update nodes’ innovativeness rank. Second, via tracking the innovativeness ranks of all nodes, we develop an analytic framework to iteratively compute the cumulative distribution function of the block delivery delay. Our simulation results verify that both parts of our analysis are sufficiently accurate.

The proposed model employs modular concatenation of selected NC components to represent the effect of wireless links on the QoS performance at the link-layer. We present a mathematical analysis that applies the model to evaluate the performance of a wireless video streaming application, by deriving estimates of the playback delay and buffer size at the receiver side. Owing to the analytical strength of NC, the model offers an efficient way of deriving end-to-end QoS characteristics in wireless networks.	channel (communications);concatenation;end-to-end principle;markov chain;network calculus;performance evaluation;quality of service;streaming media;volume boot record	Farshid Agharebparast;Victor C.

Specifically, we compare a previously proposed algorithm, called parallel iterative matching (PIM)-which is a cell-based scheduling algorithm-with our newly proposed algorithm-which is a burst-based variation of the PIM scheduling algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that burst-based PIM scheduling outperforms cell-based PIM scheduling under a variety of realistic parameters.	atm turbo;blocking (computing);iterative method;network switch;non-blocking algorithm;scheduling (computing);simulation	Ge Nong;Mounir Hamdi	2000	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/4234.848413	computer simulation;fair-share scheduling;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;parallel computing;real-time computing;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;two-level scheduling;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;statistics;computer network;systems architecture	HPC	3.6974698269945345	101.67093496385064	131011

A dedicated number of GPRS channels plus idle periods between voice calls are used for GPRS data packet transfers. A simulator was developed in order to evaluate the HRRA algorithm, which provides a reasonable forecast on the voice blocking probability and on packet delay for a single cell system. Since the major issue is the correct resource allocation, results are shown for the influence of some choices and assumptions on the overall system performance. As expected, blocking probability can reach very high values if the number of dedicated channels increases too much. For the specific case of 4 carriers and traffic of 20 Erl, 4 channels dedicated to GPRS still enable an affordable blocking probability, leading to a mean packet delay of 15 s. The results can be used to illustrate the fundamental options that need to be taken by an operator, when implementing GPRS.	algorithm;blocking (computing);erlang (unit);network packet	Hugo Araújo;José Costa;Luís M.

The structures of these multiplexers are based on the newly proposed queueing, frame management, and integrated flow control methods. For the queueing purpose, two separate finite voice and data buffers are used to queue voice and data packets independently. For frame management, four versions of master frame management are considered. As for the integrated flow control algorithm, speech coding techniques such as variable rate coding and embedded coding are considered. To evaluate the performances of the multiplexers, analytical formulations are made from the equivalent queueing models of the proposed systems. Then, numerical results on the performance of the multiplexers are obtained by using the Gauss-Seidel iteration method. These results show that there exist tradeoffs between data and voice traffic performances for a given input traffic load and the output channel rate.	multiplexing;profiling (computer programming)	Hyeong Lee;Chong Kwan Un	1985	IEEE Trans.

To capture temporal and spatial localities, we use a modified version of Riedi et al.'s multifractal model [18], where we reduce the complexity of the original model from O(N) to O(1); N being the length of the synthetic trace. Our model has the attractiveness of being parsimonious and that it avoids the need to apply a transformation to a self-similar model (as often done in previously proposed models [2]), thus retaining the temporal locality of the fitted traffic. Furthermore, because of the scale-dependent nature of multifractal processes, the proposed model is more flexible than monofractal models in describing irregularities in the traffic. Trace-driven simulations are used to demonstrate the goodness of the proposed model.	multifractal system;occam's razor;www	Abdullah Balamash;Marwan Krunz	2002		10.1007/3-540-45745-3_1	active traffic management;the internet;simulation;systems modeling;cpu cache;fractal;self-similarity;computer science;stochastic modelling;world wide web	DB	-1.9378104541127525	101.3275664630558	131784

More specifically, we focus on a methodology, called the Least Upper Delay Bound (LUDB) method, which is based on Network Calculus. The latter has already been used for computing delay bounds in tandems in which the paths of the flows are subject to particular restrictions. In this paper we generalize and extend it to tandems traversed by flows following arbitrary paths. We show that such methodology yields better bounds than those obtained through both per-node analysis and comparable methods proposed in the literature.	end-to-end principle;fifo (computing and electronics);multiplexing	Luciano Lenzini;Enzo Mingozzi;Giovanni Stea	2008	Perform.

To take advantage of the new features, a shift of responsibility from transmitters to receivers is suggested. This paper proposes a novel receiver initiated multimedia access control (MAC) protocol and a distributed Generic Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (GAIMD) fair scheduling scheme to configure efficient transmissions in Ad Hoc networks. The schemes are very simple to implement. Simulation results demonstrate that the throughput can be significantly improved when compared to a transmitter initiated scheme [1] at the price of increased queueing delay of priority voice packets.	access control;additive model;fair-share scheduling;hoc (programming language);mud;multi-user;queuing delay;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;transmitter	Jinfang Zhang;Zbigniew Dziong;François Gagnon;Michel Kadoch	2008			telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	5.298748375330227	94.95492587507609	132095

The extent of performance improvement needs to be carefully investigated, especially for wireless sensor networks, due to the overhead and energy costs involved with cooperation and the dependency on energy consumption models. In this paper, we propose a cooperative medium access control protocol, COMAC that enables cooperation in a realistic scenario using 802.11g based radios and leverages cooperative communications by making use of the overheard packets from neighboring nodes of a sender node. In an effort to determine the conditions under which cooperation is preferable, we evaluate COMAC's performance in comparison with standard 802.11 through detailed simulations, considering different physical layer data rates, varying transmission ranges, networks of different sizes and various energy consumption models. COMAC is shown to provide robustness to the wireless channel impairments, resulting in increased transmission range and improved packet success ratio in point-to- point scenarios. Throughput and energy efficiency performance is also quantified for multi-point-to-point scenarios with varying number of contending nodes. It is shown that cooperation with COMAC can provide significant enhancement in throughput, up to 23 times non-cooperative 802.11, together with energy savings of 50% even for high circuit energy consumption cases.	access control;cooperative mimo;data rate units;network packet;overhead (computing);point-to-point protocol;profiling (computer programming);relay;simulation;throughput;transmission (bittorrent client)	M.

One key point in the definition of such a scheduling is the knowledge of the channel state: in fact on the basis of the adopted channel model a prediction criteria must be identified.	algorithm;chaos;channel (communications);network packet;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Francesca Cuomo;Cristina Martello	2001		10.1109/ICC.2001.936674	fair-share scheduling;code division multiple access;in situ resource utilization;real-time computing;td-cdma;quality of service;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;network interface;resource management;wireless network;two-level scheduling;predictive modelling;integrated services;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;fading;proportionally fair;computer network	Mobile	4.7230721749752895	97.51006644354575	132187

There are several backoff algorithms that have been proposed to avoid this problem. This paper proposes a new backoff algorithm called the Square Root Backoff (SRB). Moreover, it identifies that no algorithm can perform the best in all cases. Therefore, an adaptive strategy is proposed to choose the best backoff mechanism from a set of mechanisms based on network density and mobility parameters. The proposed adaptive algorithm is implemented in two phases: the offline phase and the online phase. Such design aims at reducing the time complexity of the algorithm by performing some of the computations prior to the actual deployment and of the network. Results from simulations demonstrate that the SRB algorithm achieved better performance than BEB and LB. Moreover, the adaptive backoff algorithm obtains the best throughput and end-to-end delay performance over the other backoff algorithms.

2ecc7b7a3377f91314ab8ed10083417dabe8977c	revisiting the modeling of user association patterns in a university wireless network		This paper presents an analysis of a large trace of user associations in a university wireless network, which includes around one thousand access points over five campuses. The trace is obtained from RADIUS authentication logs and its merit is in its recency, scale and duration. We propose a methodology for extracting association statistics from these logs, and look at visiting time distributions and processes of user arrivals to access points. We find that a large fraction of the network — around half of all access points — experiences time-varying Poisson arrival process, and association distributions can be modeled by two-stage hyper-exponential distributions at most of the access point. While network associations in campus wireless networks have been extensively studied in the literature, our study reveals changing patterns in user arrival processes and association durations, which seem to be characteristic for networks of predominantly mobile users, and allows the use of tractable network occupancy models.	authentication;cobham's thesis;mobile device;radius;time complexity;tracing (software);vii;wireless access point	Ljubica Pajevic;Viktoria Fodor;Gunnar Karlsson	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377143	wireless network;computer network;occupancy;correlation and dependence;poisson distribution;server;authentication;computer science	Mobile	9.872077856926117	100.28359419410992	132300

Based on the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifications, Online Charging System (OCS) has to determine the Granted Unit (GU) and create reservations per session before a service is delivered by the serving network to a User Equipment (UE). However, fixed GUs cannot adapt to dynamic consumer behaviors, which usually require dynamic GUs. Clearly, giving small GUs will incur too many signaling messages for making reservations, but giving excessive GUs will cause unbalanced distribution of resources, especially in FSP cases. How to determine GUs is an open issue that can be self-defined by telecommunications operators. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for dynamically assigning GUs to UEs belonging to the same FSP, based on their historical data usage and total monthly data allowance. Simulation results show that our scheme can substantially save signalings by at least 22% compared to fixed scheme under unpredictable behaviors.	electronic billing;gravis ultrasound;original chip set;simulation;unbalanced circuit	Huai-Sheng Huang;Tzu-Chung Su;Jia-Ming Liang;Yu-Chee Tseng	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127822	simulation;online charging system;telecommunications;operating system;computer network	Embedded	6.6710363347795205	98.78675451030152	132377

To study the throughput, we make a novel analytical model for the hybrid multiple access. Our throughput analysis shows that the throughput is highly affected by the access time of CSMA/CA. A larger access time of CSMA/CA will cause a lower data transmission time in TDMA, while a lower access time of CSMA/CA will also cause a higher collision that leads to increase the unused time for data transmission. This paper provides the approximated optimum access time of CSMA/CA maximizing the throughput. Furthermore, this paper introduces a private channel release time method for reducing collisions that highly improves the throughput of the mmWave-WPAN.	access time;approximation algorithm;ieee 1471;throughput	Chang Woo Pyo;Hiroshi Harada;Shuzo Kato	2009		10.1145/1582379.1582642	carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;real-time computing;channel access method;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;time division multiple access;computer network;data transmission	Mobile	7.760687590297658	93.10403371545335	132484

A source-destination point-to-point video communication is investigated. The control algorithm dynamically varies the encoder configuration on the base of some feedback information from the destination. The selection of the proper configuration is performed by a control block called smart coder which, after receiving the feedback information, can change the transmission rate to optimize the level of Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the user for a certain network status. The change of the transmission rate is performed by acting on coding parameters as the type of video coder, the spatial resolution, the frame rate and so on, formally defined in the paper. Feedback information is based on the measure of the average rate of the lost packets, but since this measure cannot give information about underload condition, a specifically designed probing mechanism, based on the introduction of a redundancy in the video flow, is used. A relevant part of the paper is dedicated to the analysis of the results: the efficiency of the control scheme is tested in a local environment based on the Ethernet protocol.	best-effort delivery;quality of service;shadow volume	Raffaele Bolla;Alessandro Iscra;Mario Marchese;Sandro Zappatore	1998		10.1007/3-540-64594-2_108	best-effort delivery;real-time computing;simulation;quality of service;image resolution;point-to-point;computer science;network congestion;computer security;service quality;telecommunications network;computer network	Theory	-3.5023915145871047	102.64358218245246	132870

The technique uses splitting based on direct probability redistribution (DPR). DPR has been shown to be a powerful technique for efficient simulation of a number of different network topologies. However, efficient simulation of delay in networks, especially those utilizing a transport layer protocol with feedback, such as TCP, has been elusive. The technique presented here solves this problem by modifying the subset indicator function associated with DPR.

However, wireless communication systems have different characteristics when compared to wired networks that include higher bit error rates, higher latency, limited bandwidth, multipath fading of the signals and handoff. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to TCP that we shall call ETCP, which improves upon conventional TCP when it is applied to the wireless environment. Our simulation results show significant improvements to TCP performance with respect to packet loss detection.	bit error rate;control system;elegant degradation;end-to-end principle;internet;internets;multipath propagation;network congestion;network packet;simulation;tcp congestion control	Deddy Chandra;Richard J.

Therefore, we can obtain an approximate solution by using the grey prediction model whenever the closed solution of an equation is of exponential form. In communication system, ALOHA protocol is a simple and premier communication protocol. As everyone knows that the throughput of an ALOHA system is related to the provided packet traffic. In fact, the relationship between the system throughput and provided packet traffic can be depicted as an exponential function. Therefore, in this paper, we establish a prediction model of the throughput based on the grey prediction model. This is the first achievement. The second achievement is to accomplish a modified GM(1, 1) prediction model to cope with the monotonically decreasing data sequence. This new development opens a virgin soil, so this modified GM(1, 1) prediction model is considered as a milestone for new applications.	algorithm;throughput	Chia-Chang Tong;Jiang-Whai Dai;Ting-Cheng Chang;Kun-Li Wen	2001		10.1109/ICSMC.2001.972866	communications protocol;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;predictive modelling;differential equation;communications system	ML	1.8407087192356202	98.2687557466064	133084

LTE is a way for cellular communications to operate at that high data rate. Routing is an important operation performed to route the data packets from the source node to destination node in any network. Hence there is a need for a protocol/algorithm to determine the best way to transfer the data. Routing protocols determine the best route to transfer data from one node to another. In this paper, a comparative study of the routing protocols for the application layer of LTE network is done. The protocols analyzed are Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Routing Information Protocol (RIP). A study and comparison of the parameters are done based on the simulation results. The different performance metrics analyzed are Packet delivery ratio, Throughput, Average end-to-end delay and Jitter. The simulation results show that the best routing protocol w.r.t all the parameters analyzed is RIP.	algorithm;compaq lte;data rate units;design review (u.s. government);distance-vector routing protocol;end-to-end principle;link-state routing protocol;megabit;network packet;optimized link state routing protocol;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	G.

A mathematical model that captures the dynamics of such adaptive problem is presented. This model formulates the problem as a multiple-choice multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem (MMKP), an NP-hard optimization problem. A heuristic algorithm is then proposed to solve the MMKP. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm finds 96% optimal solutions on average, and outperforms other heuristic algorithms for MMKP. Furthermore, the time required is on average 50% to 70% less than that required by other benchmark heuristics.

However there is no standard scheduling algorithm defined for LTE and the task of protecting end user satisfaction while maintaining service class restrictions is left upon the service provider and currently is an open issue. To address this challenge, in this work we proposed a two-level scheduler with a utility based game theoretic application in the first level that distributes physical resource blocks among classes with different QoS requirements and a delay based air interface scheduling algorithm in the second level that satisfies the strict levels of delay budget requirements defined for LTE classes. A cooperative game is formed between different service class flows by use of a sigmoid utility function that allows for distribution of resources. Lagrangian formulation is used to find the associated Pareto Optimality. The delay based scheduler checks each user's packet delay in its respective service class and makes scheduling decisions in the downlink direction utilizing current channel conditions. Simulation results carried out with key performance matrices including throughput, packet loss ratio, system delay and fairness index proved the usefulness and efficacy of the proposed approach as compared to existing Proportional Fair, Exponential Rule and M-LWDF algorithms.	algorithm;compaq lte;fairness measure;game theory;network packet;pareto efficiency;proportionally fair;requirement;scheduling (computing);sigmoid function;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;utility	Salman Ali;Muhammad Zeeshan	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214009	real-time computing;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Metrics	4.726043035853377	96.83869272129002	133531

Wireless networks play an increasingly important role at the edge of the Internet where they provide access to users on the move. Cellular networks are providing increasing data services to users, wireless LANs and mesh networks provide broadband network access to mobile users, and ad hoc and sensor networks allow a collection of wireless devices to self configure and communicate among each other. In all of these areas, we are experiencing a period of innovation and rapid progress: new ideas and improvements drive these fields towards ever more ambitious systems and solutions. The multitude of research and system ideas places special importance on high quality modeling and analysis, in order to enable effective performance evaluation and foster a deep understanding of the issues and trade-offs thatmake up the design space, which is the motivation for this special issue. We have restricted the scope of the special issue to networking protocols and services in non-cellular networks, to improve its focus. We invited extended versions of the best papers on these topics presented at the Tenth ACM/IEEE International Symposium onModeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems (MSWiM 2007). We ended up with nine excellent papers that were selected through this process. The first group of three papers derives new analytical results for problems in ad hoc and sensor networks. The first paper in this group is titled ‘‘Energy Optimization for Proactive Unicast Route Maintenance in MANETs under End-to-End Reliability Requirements’’, by TridibMukherjee, Sandeep K. S. Gupta and Georgios Varsamopoulos. In this paper, the authors analyze proactive routing protocols—an important class of routing protocols used in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). They construct a model of these protocols and use it to estimate the optimal timer periods that control when information is exchanged by these protocols. They use the analysis to develop an optimal version of the DSDV protocol, which minimizes the overhead required for the routing packets. The model results are validated against simulation. EsaHyytiä and JormaVirtamo contributed the paper ‘‘On theOptimality of Field-line Routing inMassively DenseWireless Multi-hop Networks’’. The paper considers the question of finding the optimal routes in amulti-hopwireless network under the asymptotic assumption of infinite node density. Interestingly, they discover that single-path routing is optimal from a load balancing perspective under these assumptions; this is a result that is quite useful if it holds in more conventional networks. The paper illustrates the results with a number of numerical examples. The final paper in this group is titled ‘‘Trend Forecasting based on Singular Spectrum Analysis of Traffic Workload in a Large-Scale Wireless LAN’’, by George Tzagkarakis, Maria Papadopouli and Panagiotis Tsakalides. The paper carries out a statistical analysis of traffic measured in a campuswideWLAN network. They discover that the time-series of the traffic load at each AP can be accurately modeled using a small number of principal components. The residual information captures the small irregular variations that are not part of the stable network traffic pattern. The paper then develops a traffic predictor by projecting the original time-series obtained from the traffic analysis. The next group of papers explores new ideas in services and protocols for emerging wireless networks.

We assume that the matrix of bandwidth demands is known and we use the now standard approach of decomposing this matrix into a convex combination of permutation matrices. Our problem therefore reduces to the problem of constructing a schedule for these permutation matrices. In this paper we derive delay bounds for four algorithms that are based on probabilistic techniques. For each algorithm we first place tokens randomly in continuous time for each permutation matrix. If the nth token that appears corresponds to permutation matrix Mk then we schedule matrix Mk in the nth time slot. The algorithms differ in how the random token processes are defined. For two of the algorithms we are able to perform a derandomization so as to obtain deterministic schedules. We show through numerical computation that in many situations the resulting delay bounds are smaller than the previously best-known delay bounds of Chang, Chen, and Huang [1].

In the homogeneous case (all nodes having the same capacity), many algorithms have been proposed, which have been proven almost optimal or optimal. On the other hand, the performance of heterogeneous systems is not completely understood yet. In this paper, we investigate the impact of heterogeneity on the achievable delay of chunk-based live streaming systems. We propose several models for taking the atomicity of a chunk into account. For all these models, when considering the transmission of a single chunk, heterogeneity is indeed a ``blessing'', in the sense that the achievable delay is always faster than an equivalent homogeneous system. But for a stream of chunks, we show that it can be a ``curse'': there is systems where the achievable delay can be arbitrary greater compared to equivalent homogeneous systems. However, if the system is slightly bandwidth-overprovisioned, optimal single chunk diffusion schemes can be adapted to a stream of chunks, leading to near-optimal, faster than homogeneous systems, heterogeneous live streaming systems.	algorithm;atomicity (database systems);chunking (computing);memory bandwidth;streaming media;system of linear equations	Fabien Mathieu	2009	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing	Metrics	0.5471673904723143	93.25911631790939	134142

This algorithm uses a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and a modified Elman neural network (MENN). The FIS adopts crucial criteria of the vertical handoff as the input variables and makes handoff decision based on the defined rule base. The MENN helps to do the prediction for number-of-users of the after-handoff network, which is a pivotal variable of the FIS. Simulation results show that compared with the conventional method, the AMVHO decision algorithm achieves better performance in guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) of the after-handoff communication.	algorithm;artificial neural network;bandwidth (signal processing);correctness (computer science);fuzzy logic;inference engine;network model;quality of service;rule-based system;semantic network;serial ata;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;velocity (software development);vertical blanking interval;x.690	Qiang Guo;Jie Zhu;Xianghua Xu	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

The PP discipline is based on the Strict Priority (SP) discipline with the difference that each priority queue is assigned a parameter as in Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) and Weighted Round Robin (WRR) disciplines. The parameter determines the probability with which its corresponding queue is served when it is polled by the server. Similar to WFQ and WRR, service differentiation as well as fairness among traffic classes can be achieved in PP by setting the assigned parameters properly. In addition, the PP discipline can be easily reduced to the ordinary SP discipline or to the reverse SP discipline. Moreover, the PP discipline can provide service segregation among groups of traffic classes while at the same time provide service differentiation among classes within each group. The proposed PP discipline may be used in controlling per-hop behavior in differentiated services networks.	scheduling (computing)	Yuming Jiang;Chen-Khong Tham;Chi Chung Ko	2002	Computer Communications	10.1016/S0140-3664(02)00005-1	weighted fair queueing;real-time computing;differentiated service;computer science;distributed computing;priority queue;computer network;weighted round robin	Networks	0.6234837884438982	96.11520267691607	134206

Accordingly, non-real-time applications are well supported in environments where there is ample storage available resulting in low losses. For an emerging class of applications such as prerecorded video - referred to as soft real-time applications there may be an increased role that storage can play - in addition to bandwidth - in their effective transport. A scheme is proposed in this paper that takes advantage of available storage within the network and the end users, to efficiently transport prerecorded continuous media traffic across a number of network nodes.#R##N##R##N#The scheme is based on a scheduling policy implemented within the network nodes called Deadline Credit (DC) policy. Its objectives are (a) to utilise all (if possible) of the available capacity by allocating bandwidth dynamically to a number of data streams, (b) to distribute the available bandwidth fairly between all competing data streams and (c) to maximise the number of Application Data Units (ADUs) that are served by always giving priority to the one with the shortest time to expiration. Numerical results are presented and the induced ADUs loss rates under the proposed policy are compared against those of some alternative schemes.	real-time transcription	Zoe Antoniou;Ioannis Stavrakakis	2000		10.1007/3-540-45551-5_40	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing	Embedded	-4.392820182339293	97.67586549183845	134215

In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol to provide real-time service for a CDMA wireless network. This protocol has been designed based on the distributed queuing random access protocol for CDMA wireless networks (DQRAP/CDMA). As real-time scheduling schemes have been introduced into the protocol design, the new protocol has an ability to accommodate real-time traffic in the CDMA wireless networks. A series of simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol. The results reveal that the proposed protocol can efficiently provide real-time service to the traffic composed of time constrained messages in the CDMA wireless networks.	real-time transcription	Maode Ma;Qichao Zhu	2007	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-006-9160-4	wireless routing protocol;wireless transport layer security;reverse address resolution protocol;code division multiple access;radio link protocol;real time streaming protocol;real-time computing;media access control;user datagram protocol;resource reservation protocol;inter-access point protocol;internet protocol control protocol;computer science;link control protocol;operating system;wireless network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;tunneling protocol;distributed computing;wireless lan controller;internet protocol suite;capwap;wi-fi array;scheduling;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;random access;computer network	Mobile	3.810247986360674	95.46145430818763	134395

By means of microscopic traffic simulations we study the problem of online estimation of the current traffic situation based on floating car data. Our focus is on the estimation on the upand downstream jam fronts determining the extension of traffic congestion. We study the impact of delayed information transmission by shortrange communication via wireless LAN in contrast to instantaneous information transmission to the roadside units by means of mobile radio. The delayed information transmission leads to systematic estimation errors which cannot be compensated for by a higher percentage of probe vehicles. Additional flow measurements from stationary detectors allow for a model-based prediction which is effective for much lower floating car percentages than 1%.	downstream (software development);jam;network congestion;sensor;simulation;stationary process	Arne Kesting;Martin Treiber	2010	CoRR		flow measurement;simulation;floating car data;telecommunications;engineering;data analysis;computer security;statistics;data collection	Mobile	-3.367881658606242	100.16119293272187	134488

The frequency-domain approach is used to combine the advanced techniques in two areas: signal processing and queueing analysis. Essentially, signal processing techniques are used to obtain the steady-state and second-order statistics of a traffic stream. The focus here is on the construction of a special class of Markov chains that can statistically match with each given traffic stream (or superposition of different traffic streams). The analytical queueing solutions can therefore be obtained by the folding-algorithm based on the Markov chain input modeling. Comprehensive numerical examples show the great potential of the SMAQ tool to solve measurement-based traffic management issues.

This paper completes the explanation of the Data Pendulum dynamics by elucidating on which side the backlog grows, while identifying the relevant parameters in the process. We also explain why and when the data backlog may switch sides without any packet loss. We propose a model for the dynamics of antiparallel TCP connections that effectively explains the throughput observed in real conditions. Moreover, the model is applicable to a more realistic case in which buffers are dimensioned in packets rather than bytes, the case that previous models could not capture.	acknowledgement (data networks);antiparallel (electronics);bottleneck (network);byte;download;fifo (computing and electronics);network packet;pipeline (computing);response time (technology);throughput;upload	Tristan Braud;Martin Heusse;Andrzej Duda	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7510930	real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;statistics;computer network	Embedded	-2.3583875924487994	93.26309654561132	134615

Therefore, an analytical model on link lifetime can be of great help for an efficient and effective vehicular communication protocol design. In this paper, the impact of mobility on link lifetime in the highway environment is modeled and analyzed by utilizing the discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). Specifically, two link lifetime theoretical models, the first-order Markov model and the second-order Markov model, are studied and analyzed for effectively predicting the proprieties of a vehicular communication link. It is shown that our proposed models, especially the second-order Markov model, can provide more accuracy in performance prediction. Additionally, extensive simulations are carried out to verify our analytical results on link lifetime.	channel (communications);communications protocol;first-order predicate;interference (communication);markov chain;markov model;multipath propagation;performance prediction;simulation;url shortening	Miao Hu;Zhangdui Zhong;Minming Ni;Ruifeng Chen;Hao Wu;Chih-Yung Chang	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127750	vehicular ad hoc network;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	5.399627156711735	89.76170510376849	134726

We show that the new protocol, called XCP, enables very large per-flow throughput (e.g., more than 1 Gb/s), which is unachievable using current congestion control. Additionally, we show via extensive simulations that XCP significantly improves the overall performance, reducing drop rate by three orders of magnitude, increasing utilization, decreasing queuing delay, and attaining fairness in a few RTTs. Using tools from control theory, we model XCP and demonstrate that, in steady state, it is stable for any capacity, delay, and number of sources. XCP does not maintain any per-flow state in routers and requires only a few CPU cycles per packet making it implementable in high-speed routers. Its flexible architecture facilitates the design and implementation of quality of service, such as guaranteed and proportional bandwidth allocations. Finally, XCP is amenable to gradual deployment.

A data access control scheme for combined voice-data CDMA systems has been proposed and studied in previous literature. The scheme aims to maintain a certain target voice SIR; this is achieved by controlling the data load according to the measured voice SIR. The data users are allowed to transmit in a radio-link time slot with a certain permission probability, which is determined by the base station based on the measured voice SIR in the previous slot. As per the IS-99 standards, however, data transmission operates under the framework of TCP, which is a higher level end-to-end protocol. The TCP data unit, called a segment, is typically equivalent to several tens of physical layer frames; hence, a segment transmission takes up several tens of slots. Due to changes in the number of voice users in talk-spurt (which occur on a time scale shorter than a segment transmission time), the slot level data access control scheme can introduce signiicant variability in the segment transmission time. The effect of such variability on the TCP timers, which operate at the segment level, is of interest. In this paper, an approximate upper bound on the data throughput, taking the presence of TCP into account , is computed. The results provide one with an insight into the interaction of the access control scheme with TCP; they also give practical pointers as to choosing suitable parameters and operating points for the scheme.	access control;approximation algorithm;data access;end-to-end principle;heart rate variability;interaction;link time;throughput;timer	Sudhir Ramakrishna;Jack M.

A major challenge in LR-PON is that the propagation delay between OLT and ONUs is increased by a very significant amount. We analyze the delay performance of fixed multi-thread algorithm, which is simple and efficient, for dynamic bandwidth allocation in long reach PON. Especially, the average packet delay of the expedited forwarding (EF) traffic class is analyzed. This performance analysis reveals that fixed multi-thread algorithm for DBA in long reach PON provides predictable packet delay and improved jitter performance for the EF traffic class without the influence of load variations.	10g-pon;access network;algorithm;entity framework;internet access;lr parser;network packet;passive optical network;propagation delay;software propagation	Nguyen Khac Binh;Byeong-Ho Kang;Su-il Choi	2018	2018 Tenth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)	10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8437005	computer network;dynamic bandwidth allocation;propagation delay;computer science;broadband;jitter;channel allocation schemes;algorithm;network packet;passive optical network;access network	HPC	2.0835931655637894	93.93245154542625	135102

Our mechanism is a new generic concept called: the multiple pushout. It is based on the utilization of both AAL and ATM features and on a particular definition of the priority bit. Whenever one cell of a message overflows the buffer of an ATM switch, the algorithm causes the switch to discard other cells of the message (including later arrivals). Such discarding frees buffer spaces for cells of other messages that have a chance of arriving at their destination intact. Our objective is to emphasize that in case of overload, with most of proposed mechanisms, cells are discarded without any semantic information about the type of cells. Therefore, at the destination, all the fragments of the corrupted messages will be discarded anyway. Finally, we present simulation results comparing cell loss rates and message loss rates of several space priority mechanisms.	atm turbo;atm adaptation layer;algorithm;network switch;simulation	Marc Lemercier;Guy Pujolle	1995	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/BF02110076	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing	Networks	-1.0100772426596334	93.14438762766059	135299

To maximize profit, the SON can continually adapt its leased bandwidth to traffic demand dynamics based on online traffic trend estimation. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for online traffic trend estimation that fits the SON capacity adaptation. In the first approach, the smoothing parameter of the exponential smoothing (ES) model is adapted to traffic trend. Here, the trend is estimated using measured connection arrival rate autocorrelation or cumulative distribution functions. The second approach applies Kalman filter whose model is built from historical traffic data. In this case, availability of the estimation error distribution allows for better control of the network Grade of Service. Numerical study shows that the proposed autocorrelation based ES approach gives the best combined estimation response-stability performance when compared to known ES methods. The proposed Kalman filter based approach improves further the capacity adaptation performance by limiting the increase of connection blocking when traffic level is increasing.	autocorrelation;autonomous system (internet);blocking (computing);coefficient;expectation–maximization algorithm;fits;kalman filter;numerical analysis;overlay network;performance;quality of service;queueing theory;simulation;smoothing;time complexity	Con Tran;Zbigniew Dziong	2011	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2011.110911.110116	kalman filter;simulation;computer science;statistics	Metrics	-3.584940281878359	98.69618688145131	135434

We propose then multi-decision criteria that improve the global aggregated quality of the communication in the multicast session.

Recognizing the need, Task Group e (TGe) is working towards 802.11e, an evolution of the standard that provides the means for defining desirable QoS requirements for the traffic streams as well as a framework for scheduling schemes to achieve them. In this paper we propose a scheduling scheme for QoS guarantees provisioning that exploits and is fully compliant with the specifications of 802.11e. The scheduler operates at the access point and relies on the measurement and control parameters available in the fields of the 802.11e header to determine access during the evolution of PCF called HCF. Our scheme takes channel conditions under consideration in making these decisions, since information about the channel state can be conveyed now with the recent modifications adopted by TGh. Evaluation of our algorithm through simulation study shows significant performance improvement compared to earlier schemes that couldn’t take channel conditions under consideration in making scheduling decisions.	algorithm;halt and catch fire;network packet;programming computable functions;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;wireless access point	Thanasis Korakis;Leandros Tassiulas	2005	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2004.07.007	real-time computing;quality of service;decision support system;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	1.643232289104894	102.2999242677942	135691

The proposed methods model the instantaneous resource demand directly. This differs from most existing methods that derive the demands from modeling the factors that impact the demands. As a result, the proposed methods allow new and handoff calls to: 1) follow non-Poisson and/or nonstationary arrival processes; 2) have arbitrary per-call resource demands; and 3) have arbitrarily distributed call and channel holding times. The first method is based on the Wiener prediction theory and the second method is based on time series analysis. Our simulations show that they perform well even for non-Poisson and nonstationary handoff call arrivals, arbitrary per-call bandwidth demands, and nonexponentially distributed call and channel holding times. They generate closely comparable performance with an existing local method and an existing collaborative method that uses information about mobiles in neighboring cells, under assumptions for which these other methods are optimized. The proposed methods are much simpler to implement than most other existing methods with fewer capabilities.	internet protocol suite;simulation;time series	Tao Zhang;Eric van den Berg;Jasmine Chennikara-Varghese;Prathima Agrawal;Jyh-Cheng Chen;Toshikazu Kodama	2001	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.957308	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;time series;statistics;computer network	Networks	-3.7665190368407546	98.82570540224401	135784

Trunk reservation is an easily implemented control mechanism which allows priority to be given to chosen traffic streams. It has the potential to be an extremely efficient control mechanism, but its use on any single link of a network has ramifications which may extend throughout the network, and it is important to take this into account. Using a simplified analytical model of a circuit-switched network incorporating trunk reservation, we show that there exist implied costs associated with the priority and nonpriority calls routed through a link, and shadow prices associated with the capacity for priority and nonpriority traffic through a link. Mathematically, this involves calculating derivatives of an implicitly defined function, and expressing these derivatives as simple functions of certain variables. These variables, the implied costs and shadow prices, are determined as solutions to a set of linear equations possessing a local or decentralized character, and can be used as a basis for routing and capacity allocation strategies.	routing	F.

This scheme is similar to a Go-Back-N protocol, but it presents higher performance. The throughput of the protocol is determined through a theoretical analysis. The results show that the proposed protocol maintains, as the Go-Back-N schemes, a simple implementation structure, but at the same time permits to achieve high throughput values. In particular, for high error rates in the communication channel the described protocol achieves performance comparable with that of the selective protocol with infinite buffer.	go-back-n arq	Giuliano Benelli	1990	European Transactions on Telecommunications	10.1002/ett.4460010605	sliding window protocol;real-time computing;selective repeat arq;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;go-back-n arq;computer network	Vision	6.739247023035787	94.44372693133771	135953

However, since the selection of an access network depends on several parameters with different relative importance, such as the network and the application characteristics, the user preferences, the service cost, etc, it is a difficult task to be achieved. In this paper an effective access network selection algorithm for heterogeneous wireless networks is proposed that combines two Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the fuzzy Total Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. More specifically, the AHP method is used to determine weights of the criteria, and the fuzzy TOPSIS method is used to obtain the final access network ranking.	access network;selection algorithm;user (computing)	Aggeliki Sgora;Periklis Chatzimisios;Dimitrios D.

One important realization for that purpose is admisson control, which decides to accept a new call or not dependent on current resource usage so that the network does not fall into congestion. In this paper, we model an ATM switch as a discrete-time single-server queue, at which the following three different kinds of arrival processes are allowed to join together: i) arrivals of cells with a general interarrival time distribution, ii) Bernoulli arrivals of cells in batches, and iii) interrupted Poisson processes. We offer an exact analysis to derive the waiting-time distributions and interdeparture-time distributions for arriving cells subject to admission control in ATM networks. Next, we extend the model to approximately obtain the end-to-end delay distributions for the designated traffic stream. Such an analysis is important for voice or coded video because they require a playout mechanism at the destination. Since the analysis is approximate, we also provide the simulation results to assess its accuracy. Numerical examples are also shown to investigate how the traffic characteristics of the designated traffic stream are affected by the total traffic load at the switching node, the number of other bursty traffic sources, and the degree of burstiness of the traffic source itself.	atm turbo;approximation algorithm;bernoulli polynomials;end-to-end principle;interrupt;network congestion;network traffic control;numerical method;playout;server (computing);simulation	Yoshihiro Ohba;Masayuki Murata;Hideo Miyahara	1991	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.76646	traffic generation model;discrete time and continuous time;real-time computing;systems modeling;poisson process;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous transfer mode;end-to-end delay;queueing theory;packet switching;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-0.6685363197166437	100.095501756571	136225

However, there is still considerable debate about how to model such processes and about their impact on network and application performance. In this paper, we argue that much recent modeling work has failed to consider the impact of two important parameters, namely the finite range of time scales of interest in performance evaluation and prediction problems, and the first-order statistics such as the marginal distribution of the process.We introduce and evaluate a model in which these parameters can be easily controlled. Specifically, our model is a modulated fluid traffic model in which the correlation function of the fluid rate is asymptotically second-order self-similar with given Hurst parameter, then drops to zero at a cutoff time lag. We develop a very efficient numerical procedure to evaluate the performance of the single server queue fed with the above fluid input process. We use this procedure to examine the fluid loss rate for a wide range of marginal distributions, Hurst parameters, cutoff lags, and buffer sizes.Our main results are as follows. First, we find that the amount of correlation that needs to be taken into account for performance evaluation depends not only on the correlation structure of the source traffic, but also on time scales specific to the system under study. For example, the time scale associated to a queueing system is a function of the maximum buffer size. Thus for finite buffer queues, we find that the impact on loss of the correlation in the arrival process becomes nil beyond a time scale we refer to as the correlation horizon. Second, we find that loss depends in a crucial way on the marginal distribution of the fluid rate process. Third, our results suggest that reducing loss by buffering is hard. We advocate the use of source traffic control and statistical multiplexing instead.	first-order predicate;hurst exponent;marginal model;modulation;multiplexing;network traffic control;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;queueing theory;relevance;self-similarity;server (computing);statistical model	Matthias Grossglauser;Jean-Chrysostome Bolot	1996		10.1145/248156.248159	statistical time division multiplexing;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;self-similarity;computer science;first-order logic;hurst exponent;queueing theory;self-similar process;correlation function;second-order logic;statistics;computer network;modulation	Networks	-1.4150725334517926	99.37681915157637	136271

However, in a microcell system, the number of handoffs is greatly increased. To solve this problem, a multitier cellular structure is proposed, in which high-speed mobile terminals (MTs) are serviced in macrocell and low-speed MTs are serviced in microcell to minimize the number of handoffs. In this system, it is important to precisely estimate the speed of the MT for the correct selection of the macrocell/microcell. We propose two macrocell/microcell selection schemes based on a new velocity estimation method in a multitier cellular system which uses the sojourn time in a microcell overlapping region. The proposed schemes have various advantages such as good performance when MT direction is varying, efficient user allocation to cells, quick velocity estimation capability, easy implementation, and low power consumption. We analyze and simulate the conventional and our proposed schemes in the Manhattan cell model, showing the proposed schemes have better performance than the conventional schemes.	ergodic theory;multitier architecture;simulation;velocity (software development)	Young-uk Chung;Dong-Jun Lee;Dong-Ho Cho;Byung-Cheol Shin	2002	IEEE Trans.

Its main goal is to allocate more bandwidth to nodes with QoS needs by giving them more channel access opportunities. An easy way to do this is by appropriately modifying the contention window size of the participants. The presented protocol considers both the QoS requirements of the upper-layer services and the physical layer restrictions. It is mathematically modeled and evaluated by means of a realistic simulator in an in-home scenario, showing that it significantly improves the system performance compared to the standard version of the protocol and to any other previously presented extension.	algorithm;norm (social);power-line communication;quality of service;requirement;simulation	Pedro Jose Piñero-Escuer;Josemaria Malgosa-Sanahuja;Pilar Manzanares-Lopez;Juan Pedro Muñoz-Gea	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.021814.132556	communications protocol;real-time computing;transform coding;jitter;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;particle detector;computer network	Embedded	4.96515674006845	95.06300159071547	136432

The authors formulate the stochastic model and apply an efficient approximation to compute the performance measures. The authors have previously shown that the analysis of a stochastic model of a maximum packing policy is equivalent to that of a fixed-route circuit-switched network. Thus, some of the performance measures in cellular communication systems can be obtained by using the well-developed exact simulation and approximation methods used in analyzing circuit-switched networks. Formal costs associated with each connection are used to show how dynamic channel assignment with maximum packing can improve the service and increase the total revenue. The results support an argument for the realization of the dynamic channel assignment and rearrangement in cellular communication systems. >	mobile phone;profiling (computer programming)	Wei-hsing Wang;Eugene Pinsky;Kelvin K.

If the data transfer starts to the destined IP, unaware of paths condition, that may result in packet loss and delay in data transfer. This is due to bursty conditions of IP traffic or physical damage. To overcome this, status of the network path is determined before transmission. In our new mechanism multipath state aware concurrent multipath transfer using redundant transfer (MSACMT-RT), status of multipath is determined, initially and periodically before transmission. MSACMT-RT begins immediately after determining the path status, for a particular interval of time and later transfers data with CMT only for predefined period. We demonstrate using simulation under assumption that both the sender/receiver have three paths for CMT. By using MSACMT-RT, it is inferred that our algorithm outperforms better than concurrent multipath transfer potentially failed (CMT-PF). MSACMT-RT mechanism in alternate paths increases the throughput. We present and discuss MSACMT-RT performance in asymmetric paths with the constrained receiver buffer (RBUF) value of 128 KB. We also discuss this scenario with no path failures, frequent and on more frequent path failures with regular and irregular intervals.	multihoming;multipath propagation	M. Subramaniam;D.

In recent years, there have been several IP header compression schemes developed in industry specifically for wireless networks including RObust Header Compression (ROHC) and IP Header Compression (RFC 2507). ROHC and IPHC (RFC 2507) have been adopted by several commercial cellular networks and military networks as one of the techniques for implementing IP header compression. In addition to ROHC and IPHC which were designed primarily for one-hop wireless networks, MANET IP Header Compression (MIPHC) was defined to help bridge the gap to multi-hop MANETs. To evaluate the effectiveness of IP header compression schemes on multi-hop MANETs and other networks, we implement simulation models of ROHC, IPHC, and MIPHC and evaluate their performance under various conditions in a mobile ad hoc network. The results show that although ROHC was designed specifically for one-hop cellular networks and context is required to be maintained per hop per IP flow, its performance is fairly good in multi-hop MANETs.	backoff;data compression;emulator;end-to-end encryption;hoc (programming language);linux;network packet;radio frequency;robust header compression;simulation;spectral efficiency;state (computer science);timer;van jacobson tcp/ip header compression	Bow-Nan Cheng;James Wheeler;Brian Hung;Scott Moore;Prasanna Sukumar	2013	2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)	10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742791	maintenance engineering;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;ad hoc wireless distribution service;routing protocol;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-1.1810386219285625	89.26391910061824	136975

With the rapid rise in link speeds, collecting all packets has become difficult, so packet sampling has been attracting attention as a scalable means of measuring flow statistics. In this paper, we firstly propose a method of estimating TCP flow rates of sampled flows through packet sampling, and then develop a method of detecting performance degradation at the TCP flow level from the estimated flow rates. In the method of estimating flow rates, we use sequence numbers of sampled packets, which make it possible to improve markedly the accuracy of estimating the flow rates of sampled flows. Using both an analytical model and measurement data, we show that this method gives accurate estimations. We also show that, by observing the estimated rates of sampled flows, we can detect TCP performance degradation. The method of detecting performance degradation is based on the following two findings: (i) sampled flows tend to have high flow-rates and (ii) when a link becomes congested, the performance of high-rate flows becomes degraded first. These characteristics indicate that sampled flows are sensitive to congestion, so we can detect performance degradation of flows that are sensitive to congestion by observing the rate of sampled flows. We also show the effectiveness of our method using measurement data.	elegant degradation	Ryoichi Kawahara;Tatsuya Mori;Keisuke Ishibashi;Noriaki Kamiyama;Hideaki Yoshino	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.5.1309	real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;accuracy and precision;statistics	Metrics	-1.982078115467755	100.93265951853733	137232

These bursts can be of variable length and are separated from their headers. The header, known as control packet, is sent through the network using a separate control channel, to reserve resources for the data burst that follows a short while later. This process demands efficient contention resolution, which can be done by optical buffering, wavelength conversion, deflection routing or burst dropping. The first three techniques, however, require additional resources in the network and/or nodes. In case additional resources are not available, or are scarce, it is beneficial to resolve contention using the burst dropping scheme. In this technique, whenever the transmission time of two or more bursts overlaps, one of the bursts needs to be dropped. In most of the cases, however, this overlap will only be partial, and it is more beneficial to drop only that part of the burst which overlaps with the other burst. This technique is known as segmentation-based dropping. This paper looks at burst dropping techniques in detail and compares their performance in terms of the burst blocking probabilities. Results show that segmentation-based dropping technique offers a significant improvement over the simple burst dropping technique.	optical burst switching	S.

Based on a finite state radio channel model for the physical layer of a wireless ATM link including the characteristics of the ATM and MAC layer, different packing schemes are evaluated for encapsulating MPEG-2 transport stream packets in ATM adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) PDUs. We analyze the performance with respect to both delay and visual quality in terms of PSNR based on a calculated cell error ratio (CER) for each given state of the radio model. The statistics show, that the 1TP (one MPEG-2 TS per AAL5 PDU) scheme outperforms all other packing schemes in terms of visual quality. At medium channel quality (38 dB), quality is judged to be good, although the CER may be as high as 25%.	atm turbo;mpeg transport stream;mpeg-2	Andreas Kassler;Oliver Schirpf;Peter Schulthess	1999		10.1109/ICASSP.1999.757486	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;atm adaptation layer;asynchronous transfer mode;physical layer;visual communication;computer network	Mobile	-3.769517886673498	100.31050682971772	137698

Simulation results substantiate that the proposed scheme can keep the total handoff delay as low as possible compared to the required delay while maintaining acceptable Received Signal Strength (RSS) to a Mobile Host (MH) and thus the Quality of Service (QoS) of the applications can be more guaranteed than the conventional and previous schemes.	elegant degradation;modified huffman coding;quality of service;rss;simulation	Yazan M.

Today’s wireless technology enables very high data rate up to hundreds of Megabits per second, which creates the high demand of supporting real-time multimedia applications over wireless mesh networks. Hence it is imperative to support quality of service (QoS) in wireless mesh networks. In this paper, we design a framework to provide parameterized QoS in 802.11e based wireless mesh networks. Our framework consists of admission control algorithms and scheduling algorithms, which aim at supporting constant bit-rate (CBR) traffic flows, as well as variable bit-rate (VBR) traffic flows. We first present deterministic end-to-end delay bounds for CBR traffic. We then prove that the delay of VBR traffic can be bounded if the traffic flow conforms to a leaky-bucket regulator. We further study different admission control algorithms for VBR traffic. Our simulation results show that, by taking advantage of statistical multiplexing, much more traffic flows can be admitted.	algorithm;case-based reasoning;data rate units;end-to-end principle;imperative programming;leaky bucket;megabit;mesh networking;multiplexing;provisioning;quality of service;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);simulation;volume boot record;wireless mesh network	Xiaowen Chu	2008	MONET	10.1007/s11036-008-0028-6	leaky bucket;wireless mesh network;switched mesh;statistical time division multiplexing;real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;shared mesh;traffic flow;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;order one network protocol;variable bitrate;constant bitrate;scheduling;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Metrics	-0.5181480730986746	95.85976565971998	137928

Assuming that all flows are subject to loss-based TCP congestion control, we quantify the effects of buffer capacity constraints on bandwidth utilization efficiency through contention-induced packet loss. The analysis shows that the ability of TCP flows to efficiently utilize successful reservations is highly sensitive to the available buffer capacity. Maximizing the bandwidth utilization efficiency under buffer capacity constraints thus requires decoupling packet loss from contention-induced blocking of transmission requests. We describe a confirmed (two-way) reservation scheme that eliminates contention-induced loss, so that no packets are dropped at the network's core, and loss can be incurred only at the adequately buffer-provisioned ingress routers, where it is exclusively congestion-induced. For the confirmed signaling scheme, analytical and simulation results indicate that TCP aggregates are able to efficiently utilize the successful reservations independently of buffer constraints.	aggregate data;blocking (computing);coupling (computer programming);expectation–maximization algorithm;network congestion;network packet;proactive parallel suite;router (computing);simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput	Mahmoud Elhaddad;Rami G.

INCP is designed with the concept of Layered Approach. It acts as a distinct layer above the MAC and has close cooperation with IP layer. INCP exploits the opportunities of network coding through multiple unicast sessions to decrease the number of transmissions, thereby increasing the aggregated throughput. Unlike most prior work that is mainly theoretical, INCP addresses the practical issues of network coding such as impact of lossy links, enabling/disabling RTS/CTS mechanism, packet size and its variation. We consider a retransmission mechanism to ensure a reliable broadcasting. We analyze the cost of this approach by providing a theoretical formulation for the amount of required bandwidth for successful broadcasting a coded packet to n neighbors. Further, we examine the coding gain for lossy networks by considering the ETX metric for routing in addition to traditionally shortest-path metric. The results, implemented in ns-3, show that not only INCP increases network throughput, but also improves the fairness of the IEEE 802.11 MAC. Moreover, the gain for real MAC is greater than the theoretical gain in most cases. The performance gain of INCP reaches up to several folds depending on the traffic model and congestion level.	linear network coding;unicast	Alireza Shafieinejad;Norooz Motamedi;Faramarz Hendessi;Mojtaba Mahdavi	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3484-5	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	1.1472817293253978	90.48593515354636	138155

First, the busy/idle patterns of optical spectrum in a stand-alone node are modeled by utilizing a continuous Markov chain. In the node-wise perspective, four operation scenarios are investigated, which are determined based on the spectrum allocation methods. We present an algorithmic procedure to derive the global balance equations of the corresponding Markov chains for all operation scenarios. Furthermore, the network-wise operation is assessed by analyzing the end-to-end blocking probability for two operation modes, with and without spectrum conversion capabilities at the intermediate nodes. Because the computational complexity of exact model increases exponentially versus the number of spectrum slots, we present two approximate alternatives. The results of the exact models, approximations, and verifying simulations are compared for small scale problem. Comparison reveals that the exact model and simulation match very well. In addition, the accuracy of both approximations is acceptable. The approximate solutions are also examined under large scale scenarios by considering simulation results as a benchmark. The accuracy of the first approximation is not degraded in large scale cases, as opposed to the second one, which is only applicable to small scale problems.	approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);blocking (computing);computational complexity theory;end-to-end principle;erlang (unit);frequency allocation;markov chain;order of approximation;performance evaluation;simulation;verification and validation	Hamzeh Beyranvand;Martin Maier;Jawad A.

The major reason is that the interference prediction by the filter may not be accurate enough due to little interference temporal correlation. In this paper, we enhance the power-control method by introducing an error margin in determining the transmission power. The error margin is obtained based on tracking of interference prediction error, which automatically captures the impacts due to short message length and control delay. Our performance results reveal that the enhanced power-control method is capable of providing a significant performance improvement even for short message and moderate control delay. Specifically, for the worst case where the message length L =1 (i.e., one packet per message), the 90 and 95 percentile signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR) by the enhanced method are 2.69 and 2.96 dB above those for no power control in a system of 4-sector cells with a frequency reuse factor of 2/8. In contrast, the original Kalman-filter method with no error margin yields no SINR gain for L =1. For L =10, we also observe similar improvement by the enhanced method for control delay up to 3 time slots.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;interference (communication);kalman filter;network packet;network performance;packet switching;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;smart antenna;spectral efficiency	Kin K.

We examine two different approaches. The first approach reduces the complexity of the DCA scheme by partitioning the total resource (either capacity or service class) into several mutually exclusive subsets and assigns each subset of resource to a group of users in proportion to the corresponding traffic load. The second approach reduces the complexity of the optimal CAC scheme with the Markov decision process over an infinite time horizon by a suboptimal CAC policy, which is designed by observing the behavior of system dynamics over only two consecutive stages upon the arrival of a call. It is demonstrated by numerical evaluation that the proposed schemes achieve an average data throughput close to that of the optimal DCA-CAC performance while demanding a much lower computational complexity in their design and implementation.	algorithmic efficiency;common access card;computational complexity theory;markov chain;markov decision process;numerical analysis;system dynamics;throughput	Lei Huang;C.-C.

A byproduct is a characterization of the worst case sources for mean delay, when they are leaky bucket regulated.	best, worst and average case;fifo (computing and electronics);fractional poisson process;leaky bucket;maximal set;multiplexing;network calculus;pollaczek–khinchine formula;server (computing);stochastic optimization	Fabrice Guillemin;Nikolay B.

Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol is promising for VANETs as many works have proven that it can provide reliable broadcast services without hidden terminal problem when properly designed. However, the high vehicle mobility, dynamic traffic density and changeable network topology make the TDMA scheduling very difficult. Therefore, the performance of TDMA-based MAC mechanism needs in-depth evaluation. In this paper, three performance metrics for TDMA protocols in VANETs, namely the average reservation delay, slot utility ratio and slot available duration, are introduced and evaluated analytically and by simulations. The expressions of these metrics are derived taking the impact of vehicle mobility and different network parameters such as transmission range, the number of available time slots, the traffic density, vehicle moving speed into account. The proposed analytical model is applied for two existing TDMA based protocols, ADHOC MAC and VeMAC, and the theoretical results are coherent with the simulation results. As a result, some important observations are obtained for the future design and enhancement of TDMA protocols.	access control;coherence (physics);delay slot;emergence;hoc (programming language);network topology;scheduling (computing);simulation	Lu An;Rui Zou;Zishan Liu;Zhirui Hu;Qin Niu	2014	2014 International Symposium on Wireless Personal Multimedia Communications (WPMC)	10.1109/WPMC.2014.7014889	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	5.9889636810390385	89.26519433261866	138965
f60a0ad16ba57a8319b6b3d6193546547e82cdf6	a threshold based dynamic routing for jobs with qos ranking		We consider a set of n heterogeneous servers which differ in processing time and Quality of Service (QoS). Jobs are divided into m levels with regard to their service ranks. We present a Threshold Policy (TP) depending on number of different jobs in the queues as a practical and flexible dynamic routing policy to control the QoS. Two performance measures are discussed: the QoS and the Average Waiting Time (AWT) in the queues. The TP is compared with both a static routing policy which maximizes the QoS level and the Minimum Expected Delay (MED) policy which minimizes the AWT. Numerical example validate that the proposed TP is more effective when both measures are considered. The TP balances the trade-off between QoS and AWT and therefore it is superior to the MED policy and any static routing which keeps the QoS in a certain level.	abstract window toolkit;algorithm;experiment;high-level programming language;job stream;quality of service;routing;server (computing)	Seyed Behrouz Khodadadi;Jafar Razmi	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-14341-0_16	static routing;dynamic source routing;operations management;data mining;computer security	Embedded	1.4785917614723285	95.53491084489983	139150

Due to long network delay of wireless link, the transaction will be a long-lived transaction. In such situation, the occurrence of handoff is inevitable, and thus wireless link held by the mobile unit crossing the cell boundaries might be forced to terminate. It is undesirable that an active transaction is forced to terminate. In this paper, we propose two guard channel schemes (GCS), static and dynamic, to reduce the probability of forced termination of transactions. In dynamic GCS, the number of reserved channels of a base station is dynamically assigned according to the number of transaction calls which may handoff to this cell while the number of guard channels is fixed in the static GCS. An analytic model based on Markov chain is derived to evaluate the system performance. The correctness of this model is verified by a simulation program. The experimental results show that a significant improvement is achieved by using the dynamic GCS.	blocking (computing);concurrency (computer science);concurrency control;correctness (computer science);erlang (unit);glossary of computer graphics;information system;long-lived transaction;markov chain;simulation;stationary process;terminate (software)	Guan-Chi Chen;Suh-Yin Lee	1998		10.1109/ICPADS.1998.741053	real-time computing;computer science;base station;operating system;database;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.118080092752706	100.32073843301376	139341

IEEE 802.16j Mobile Multihop Relay standard introduces multihop relaying to WiMAX system. Relay stations are used to extended network coverage and enhance system throughput. To reduce power consumption, an idle mode MS does not send location update messages while moving across cell borders. Paging mechanism is needed to wake up an idle mode MS. In the 802.16j multihop relay network, we investigate the performance of several location management schemes. In timer based scheme, an idle mode MS updates when the timer expires. In the paging area based scheme, an idle mode MS updates when moving to a new paging area. In the hybrid scheme, the paging area is recalculated when timer expires. An idle mode updates when it moves across the border of the MS-centric paging area. In this paper, comparative performance evaluation is conducted for these location management schemes with different IEEE 802.16j paging area topologies.	internet relay chat;mathematical optimization;paging;performance evaluation;throughput;timer	Kuan-Po Lin;Hung-Yu Wei	2008		10.1145/1554126.1554158	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;wireless network;computer network;paging	Visualization	9.447249063114073	96.47584767946887	139404

The approach is based on an imbedded two-dimensional Markov chain associated with the voice and data queueing processes, which accounts for their interaction. Using generating functions, a method for determining exactly the average data delay is given. As an application, an analytical expression for the average data delay is derived for the so-called single channel case. These results should be considered primarily as a theoretical contribution since the numerical difficulties involved in the solution procedure for the general case are formidable.	markov chain;multiplexing;numerical analysis;profiling (computer programming)	R.

In this paper our goal is to develop theoretical tools that will enable us to relax this assumption and obtain explicit expressions for the rate of growth of the number of connections at the system, the rate at which TCP connections leave the system, as well as the time needed for the completion of a connection. To that end, we model the system as a DPS (discriminatory processor sharing) system which we analyze under very mild assumptions on the probability distributions related to different classes of arrivals: we only assume that the arrival rates of connections exist, and that the amount of information transmitted during a connection of a given type forms a stationary ergodic sequence. We then proceed to obtain explicit expressions for the growth rate of the number of connections at the DPS system for several specific probability distributions. We check through simulations the applicability of our queueing results for modeling TCP connections sharing a bottleneck.	bottleneck (engineering);ergodic sequence;ergodicity;pictbridge;regular language description for xml;simulation;stationary process	Eitan Altman;Tania Jiménez	2004	IEEE INFOCOM 2004	10.1109/INFCOM.2004.1356984	probability distribution;stochastic process;real-time computing;computer science;layered queueing network;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-0.6791737727874231	98.37534593810892	139534

With the rapidly increasing number of users and bandwidth intensive applications, upgrading current PON architecture with the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology has become a natural choice. Multiple WDM PON architectures have been proposed, yet to the best of our knowledge none could support deterministic quality of service (QoS) so far. In this paper we propose a two-level WDM EPON solution which provides two main functions: efficient network scaling with bandwidth sharing at the wavelength level, and deterministic QoS provisioning at the EPON level. To guarantee deterministic QoS for multiple classes, an efficient admission control scheme based on network calculus has been developed in conjunction with the scheduling discipline.

Since IEEE 802.11 has been developed with omni antennas in mind, deploying IEEE 802.11 in a directional antenna environment leads stations to be conservative in blocking their own transmissions in favor of the ongoing transmissions. This conservative behavior conflicts with the main directional antennas' objective of increasing the spatial reuse channel by supporting simultaneous transmissions. In this paper, we analytically show that an IEEE 802.11 station with directional antenna is conservative in terms of assessing channel availability, with as much as 60% of unnecessary blocking assessments. This percentage increases up to 90% in case we allow the station to alter the way it accesses its media access control (MAC) data queue. Motivated with this analysis, we design and evaluate two enhancement schemes for IEEE 802.11 networks when using directional antennas. The first enhancement is to augment the IEEE 802.11 protocol with additional information (location of the stations) that gives a station the flexibility to transmit data while there are ongoing transmissions in its vicinity. The second enhancement, using the augmented protocol, alters the way the IEEE 802.11 accesses its data queue. Simulation shows improvement in network throughput of up to 40% in the case of applying the first enhancement and up to 60% in the case of applying the second enhancement.	access control;blocking (computing);fairness measure;ieee 1471;queue (abstract data type);sensor;simulation;throughput	Tamer Nadeem	2010	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2010.2046680	ieee 802.11s;station;network allocation vector;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;engineering;directional antenna;wireless network;ieee 802.11h-2003;ieee 802.11r-2008;computer security;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Visualization	9.86978806546268	92.75222439862428	139938

The performance of two variations of NSW BWB in the presence of erasure nodes and under one or multiple priority classes of traffic is studied by simulation. For both variations, the effect of the erasure mode locations on the throughputs of the various stations, as well as priority classes of traffic, is examined, and the performance of NSW BWB is compared with the corresponding performance of the bandwidth-balancing mechanism of the distributed queue dual bus. The simulation results reveal some very interesting properties for the first of the two NSW BWB variations that are used to derive analytic estimates of its throughput performance in the general case of arbitrary number of stations and arbitrary location of erasure nodes. >	profiling (computer programming)	Dennis Karvelas;Michail Papamichail	1993		10.1109/INFCOM.1993.253369	communications protocol;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Theory	5.20863787293074	94.14301742151166	140280

A novel stability determination method of channel allocation control was proposed in this paper, and shows that the average access delay of ongoing call or incoming call flow is much lower when using a proposed hand-off scheme than the diffserv/intserv mode in traditional hand-off schemes. According to the numerical simulations, the performances of mobility and channel utilization were improved compared to the traditional hand-off scheme.	semantic network	Dong Huang;Yong Yang;Lun Tang;Ju Zhang;Xiuli Wang	2016	Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing	10.1080/10798587.2015.1048966	real-time computing;heterogeneous network;stability;telecommunications;computer science;utilization;statistics;computer network;channel	Robotics	3.6546040935361415	95.81220885366328	140366

In this paper, we propose a novel token-based scheduling scheme for precise and quantitative service differentiation, which can provide great flexibility and facility to the network service provider for service class management. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively achieve proportional differentiation among different classes, while achieving fair resource sharing within the same class. In addition, compared with the contention based scheme and the centralized polling scheme, the proposed scheme significantly improves the channel utilization by avoiding collisions (with the contention based scheme) and the polling overhead (with the polling scheme). The performance analysis of the proposed scheme is also presented. The accuracy of the analytical results are verified by computer simulations.	centralized computing;computer simulation;network service provider;overhead (computing);polling (computer science);profiling (computer programming);scheduling (computing);throughput	Ping Wang;Weihua Zhuang	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.612	computer simulation;shared resource;metropolis–hastings algorithm;wi-fi;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	4.503419114517674	97.56971044211066	140563

Since classical congestion control algorithms work in short time scales and do not consider self similarity and long time dependency phenomenon of data, development of congestion control algorithms which be able to distinguish and manage of such traffic have been very important to researchers. Multiple time-scale congestion control is a method which has high performance reliance co-efficiency. In this research congestion control in large time scales has been implemented in fuzzy form. Simulation results show that fuzzy congestion controller will have better performance in comparison with a non-fuzzy two time-scale controller, if fuzzy rules are selected correctly.	algorithm;fuzzy rule;network congestion;network traffic control;router (computing);self-similarity;simulation;throughput	Mehdi Mohtashamzadeh;Mohsen Soryani;Mahmood Fathy	2009	2009 First International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks	10.1109/CICSYN.2009.43	throughput;probability density function;network traffic control;real-time computing;prediction;long-range dependency;computer science;fuzzy set;network congestion;correlation;active queue management;slow-start;bandwidth;fuzzy control system;statistics;computer network	HPC	-3.741576152815869	95.51115577231097	140755
68c191f4953999d33969542fcf46396f1cef980d	distributed control of networked unmanned aerial vehicles for valley area coverage		The paper provides a novel cooperative motion scheme for networked Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to fully sweep-cover a priori unknown elongated areas with curved borders, which are termed “valley areas.” The UAVs’ motion is confined between the borders. Different from former research on straight-corridor-sweep-coverage, in each valley area, the width of different portions varies dramatically: the UAVs need to line up across the valley area to achieve full coverage of the widest portions while they can only pass through the narrowest parts one by one in a queue. The UAVs are provided with barrier detection and interUAV communication. According to the scheme, a distributed control law has been offered for discrete-time multi-UAV systems, guaranteeing crash avoidance and full coverage while considering the constrained mobility of the UAVs. Regular and extreme simulations are carried out to verify the efficacy and stability of the proposed algorithm. Solutions to U-shaped valley coverage and the case of insufficient UAVs available are discussed with validation simulations. Comparison simulations are conducted with respect to a line-sweep-coverage algorithm developed by a closely related work, and differences in performance are revealed subsequently. Conclusions are drawn with possible directions of future research.

They are used to decide whether or not an incoming service request will be accepted according to an admission constraint as well as determining in which radio access technology among the available it will be connected. In this paper, we propose an adaptive bandwidth management and call admission control scheme for heterogeneous wireless networks. The proposed scheme takes into account the separation between the incoming traffic for each class and prioritizes handoff calls over the new calls. The objectives of the proposed adaptive CAC approach are to guarantee QoS requirements of all accepted calls, reduce new call blocking probability and handoff call dropping probability and maintain efficient resource utilization.	assistive technology;bandwidth management;blocking (computing);coexist (image);common access card;computation;control system;erlang (unit);quality of service;requirement;selection algorithm;semantic network;simulation	Nouri Omheni;Amina Gharsallah;Faouzi Zarai;Mohammad S.

The relation between the connection statistics of mobile users in a cell and the handoff number and new call number in next duration in each cell is explored. Based on the relation, statistic reservation tactics are raised. The amount of bandwidth for new calls and handoffs of each cell in next period is determined by using the strategy. Using this method can guarantee the communication system suits mobile connection request dynamic. The QoS parameters: forced termination rate and blocking rate can be maintained steadily though they may change with the offered load. Some numerical experiments demonstrate this is a practical method with affordable overhead.	bandwidth (signal processing);blocking (computing);experiment;final fantasy tactics:;library classification;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);requirement;velocity	Chuanlin Zhang;Kam-yiu Lam;Weijia Jia	2006	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/s11390-006-1031-7	cellular network;real-time computing;quality of service;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;communications system;computer network	Embedded	6.920823901654081	98.57067460320734	141054

We first propose and compare Call-Admission Control (CAC) algorithms based on the cell-dwelling time, by studying their impact on the handoff-call dropping and new-call blocking probabilities and the channel partitioning between the two tiers. Our results show that a simple, cell-dwelling-time-insensitive algorithm performs better under various mixes of user mobilities and call types. Moreover, there is an optimal channel partition of the overall spectrum between the tiers which minimizes the dropping and blocking probabilities for the two different CAC algorithms studied in this paper. Once the call is admitted into the network, we propose and compare various handoff-queuing strategies to reduce the call dropping probability. We show that implementing a queuing framework in one of the tiers (especially the upper, i.e., macrocellular, tier), results in a significant reduction in the dropping probability.	approximation algorithm;blocking (computing);common access card;communications of the acm;erlang (unit);fair queuing;gilbert cell;heuristic (computer science);i-frame delay;mobile phone;multitier architecture;network architecture;network performance;queue (abstract data type);scheme;simulation;unified framework	Vijoy Pandey;Dipak Ghosal;Biswanath Mukherjee;Xiaoxin Wu	2007	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-007-9307-y	spectrum;cellular network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;dwell time;computer network	Mobile	4.362755422831484	98.2062071865464	141061

Therefore, satellite Internet has received considerable attention over recent years. However, most standard implementations of TCP congestion control method perform poorly in satellite Internet due to its high bit error rate and long propagation delay. This paper proposes a new TCP congestion control method called TCP-STAR to improve the throughput over satellite Internet. TCP-STAR has three new mechanisms, namely Congestion Window Setting (CWS) based on available bandwidth, Lift Window Control (LWC), and Acknowledgment Error Notification (AEN). CWS can resist the reduction of the transmission rate when data losses are caused by bit error. LWC is able to increase the congestion window quickly based on the estimated available bandwidth. AEN can avoid the reduction of the throughput by mis-retransmission of data. The mis-retransmission is caused by ack losses or delay. Simulations show that TCP-STAR can obtain the best throughput comparing with other TCP variants (TCP-J and TCPWestwoodBR). Furthermore, we found that the fairness of TCP-STAR is a little lower than that of TCP-WestwoodBR. However, the fairness of TCPSTAR is equal to TCP-J. key words: TCP congestion control method, satellite Internet, throughput	acknowledgment index;bit error rate;chrome web store;fairness measure;internet protocol suite;network congestion;propagation delay;retransmission (data networks);software propagation;tcp congestion control;throughput;window function	Hiroyasu Obata;Kenji Ishida;Satoru Takeuchi;Shouta Hanasaki	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.6.1766	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;availability;throughput;active traffic management;the internet;tcp global synchronization;bit error rate;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;transmission control protocol;h-tcp;cubic tcp;satellite internet access;hstcp;tcp tuning;implementation;network congestion;tcp acceleration;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;equity;telecommunications network;computer network;data transmission	Networks	0.43383884402754436	102.61653629717672	141118

With different buffer storage, users thus have different tolerance to the network dynamics. In this paper, we exploit this feature for channel allocation in cognitive radio (CR) networks. We first model the channel availability as an on-off process which is stochastically known. Based on the bandwidth capacity and the specific buffer storage of users, we then intelligently allocate the channels to maximize the overall network throughput while providing users with the smooth video playback, which is formulated as an optimization framework. Given the channel conditions and the video packet storage in the playout buffer, we propose a centralized scheme for provisioning the superior video service to users. Simulation results confirm that by exploiting the playout buffer of users, the proposed channel allocation scheme is robust against intense network dynamics and provides users with the elongated smooth video playback.	centralized computing;cognitive radio;mathematical optimization;network packet;playout;provisioning;quality of service;requirement;scalability;simulation;streaming media;switch;throughput	Sanying Li;Tom H.

The delay and cell-loss requirements of the different classes of traffic are generally widely different and are achieved by assigning different buffers for different classes, and serving them in a strict priority order. We use results from the effective bandwidth of the output processes (see Chang and Thomas (1995)) to derive simple and asymptotically exact call-admission policies for such a system to guarantee the cell-loss requirements for the different classes assuming that each source produces a single class traffic. We compare the admission-control policies developed here with the approximate policy studied by Elwalid and Mitra (1995) for the case of two-class traffic.	approximation algorithm;requirement	Vidyadhar G.

Such services allow users to share novel multimedia applications without any geographical restrictions. However, since the mobile radio channel has a fixed limited bandwidth, the traditional SS-CDMA system may not be sufficient to accommodate the variable bit rate (VBR) multimedia services requested by multiple mobile users simultaneously. Moreover, the traffic load at the base station can change dynamically due to the time-varying throughput requirement of these requested multimedia services. To tackle this difficulty, a multicode CDMA (MC-CDMA) technique is proposed to provide multirate multimedia services by varying the number of spreading codes assigned to each user in order to meet its throughput requirement. In MC-CDMA, a spreading code can be used to transmit information at a basic bit rate. Users (video or data) who need higher transmission rates can use multiple codes in parallel. Meanwhile, the maximum available number of codes in the MC-CDMA system is still limited. Hence, a cost-effective dynamic code allocation scheme has then been proposed to dynamically assign an appropriate number of codes to each user for achieving the maximum resource utilization for multiuser multimedia services via the mobile radio channel. Finally, a number of real multimedia titles generated from the well-known MacroMind Director are conducted to evaluate performance.	atm turbo;code;multi-user;throughput;volume boot record;whole earth 'lectronic link	Po-Rong Chang;Chin-Feng Lin	2000	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/49.821724	multi-frequency network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;spread spectrum;computer network	Mobile	5.126787359426122	99.34978146523919	141555

The frame transmission mechanism of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which adopts the blind random backoff mechanism, was designed to minimize power consumption. However, it cannot provide satisfactory performance in a realistic hidden-node environment, because it may incur a hidden-node collision chain situation and unexpectedly limit the overall network capacity. For each successful data transmission, any inefficient transmission mechanism will incur prolonged access delay and will consume too much power. Moreover, the current design becomes inefficient as the number of devices significantly increases. As a solution, we propose a new multiple access protocol with improved efficiency at the sublayer between the media access control layer and the physical layer, i.e., a carrier sense multiple access with collision freeze (CSMA/CF) protocol, which comprises a collision resolving scheme and a P-frozen contention strategy. The CSMA/CF protocol can quickly alleviate aggravated collision situations in a hidden-node environment. Such a particular collision phenomenon is denoted as a collision chain problem (CCP). The impact from CCP is thoroughly discussed and analyzed. As confirmed by the results of analysis and performance evaluations, the proposed CSMA/CF protocol can achieve significant performance improvement in energy conservation, access delay reduction, and transmission reliability enhancement.	access control;backoff;communications protocol;data rate units;elegant degradation;ieee 1471;real-time data	Shiann-Tsong Sheu;Yun-Yen Shih;Wei-Tsong Lee	2009	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2008.928634	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	8.656507176014095	89.00083601613551	141557

The design against disturbance is separated from the design of setpoint response to enhance the abilities against disturbance and mis-modeling. The designed optimization controller can implement Dahlin algorithm approximately, which can overcome the adverse effect caused by time delay effectively. Moreover, the definite formula is given between the stable margin and parameters of the controller. The proposed scheme can make the buffer queue level in bottleneck node stabilized on a setpoint quickly and the link bandwidth shared weighted-fairly. A number of simulations are done to verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the performance of the designed controller. Besides, the relationship between the robustness and the transient response of the flow rate control system is analyzed qualitatively.	mathematical optimization	Wei Shen;Hui-he Shao	2004	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2003.11.003	control engineering;multidisciplinary design optimization;simulation;systems modeling;telecommunications;adverse effect;engineering;control system;bicarbonate buffering system;flow control;dual control theory;network congestion;volumetric flow rate;transient response;queue;bandwidth;robustness	Theory	-0.8846158732580333	102.14829621777297	141604

We use the new approach for modeling such arrival streams proposed by Cruz 8, 9], to obtain strict upper bounds on several performance measures. It is based on characterizing the inputs by bounds on the average arrival rate and the burstiness, and is especially useful in order to describe arrival streams that are ltered (policed) by Leaky Buckets.

The results for the rst three disciplines improve the general bounds obtained in 4, 5].

However, little works exist that aim to green Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) capable networks. Critically, no work has studied the performance of green label switched paths (LSPs) establishment methods in terms of energy savings and acceptance rates. Henceforth, we add to the current state-of-the-art by studying green online and offline (LSP) establishment methods. Online methods rely only on past and current LSP requests while offline ones act as a theoretical benchmark whereby they also have available to them future LSP requests. We introduce a novel metric that takes into account both energy savings and acceptance rates. We also identify a new simpler heuristic that minimizes energy use by routing source–destination demands over paths that contain established links and require the fewest number of new links. Our evaluation of two offline and four online LSP establishment methods over the Abilene and AT&T topologies with random LSP setup requests show that energy savings beyond 20 % are achievable with LSP acceptance rates above		Alejandro Ruiz-Rivera;Kwan-Wu Chin;Sieteng Soh;Raad Raad	2015	EURASIP J.

RPR is introduced to mitigate the underutilization and unfairness problems associated with the current technologies SONET and Ethernet, respectively. The key performance objectives of RPR is to achieve high bandwidth utilization, optimum spatial reuse on the dual rings, and fairness. The challenge is to design an algorithm that can react dynamically to the traffics in achieving these objectives. The RPR fairness algorithm (J. Kao et al., January 2002) is comparatively simple, but it poses some critical limitations that require further investigation and remedy. One of the major problems is that the amount of bandwidth allocated by the algorithm oscillates severely under the unbalanced traffic scenarios. These oscillations presents a barrier in achieving spatial reuse and high bandwidth utilization. We propose a low complexity fairness algorithm (LCFA) in allocating the bandwidth fairly to RPR nodes with a very low computational complexity O(1) that requires a simple hardware requirement similar to that of the RPR fairness algorithm.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);computational complexity theory;fairness measure;internet backbone;network packet;resilient packet ring;synchronous optical networking;unbalanced circuit	Fahd Alharbi;Nirwan Ansari	2004	The 13th IEEE Workshop on Local and Metropolitan Area Networks, 2004.

It is a distributed mechanism that takes account of priority and has a bounded packet delay. Nodes use energy signals to contend for the right to access the channel. Nodes, which have a packet to transmit, send energy signals or listen to the channel based on their binary frame. The node that has sent energy signals and has not heard any energy signals wins the right to access the channel. We use two schemes to determine the binary frame: at the beginning of a session, a node determines it based on its priority level and a random number; after successful transmission, based on a count of successful packet transmissions. With the first scheme, in order to reduce contention losses, the nodes that had won the right to access the channel but failed in transmission have priority over the other nodes. With the second scheme, the node that has the largest count, the one that has been waiting the longest, can send a packet without risking collision. The protocol provides higher probability of successful transmission and a limit on maximum packet delay. An analysis of the protocol provides conditions for the protocol to be stable. We evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol using simulations of a network with a mixed population of data and real-time nodes, whose source is constant bit rate (CBR) and a two state Markov on/off process.	hoc (programming language);quality of service	Kiyoshi Takahashi;Takuya Terasawa;Toshinori Tsuboi	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.10.3297	wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;transmission delay;computer network	Mobile	2.4668488050611126	102.08506326600346	141825

Aiming at the open problem, according to application characteristic of unilateral accelerated FAST TCP system, a novel two layers algorithm of the transport layer is proposed. In down layer, the history information of the active FAST TCP flows, such as the start-up time and the running time of FAST TCP flows, are gathered. When a new FAST TCP flow arrives, the upper layer algorithm can provide the current queue delay of the bottleneck link based on the earliest FAST TCP flow. For the first time in the calculation propagation delay, the down layer FAST TCP algorithm estimate the accurate propagation delay based on the current round trip delay minus the queuing delay provided by the upper algorithm. Finally, the NS-2 simulation results validate the effectiveness of this improved two layers algorithm.

Multirate transmission is assumed to be achieved through adaptive modulation, and fair rate allocation is based on the principle of generalized processor sharing to allocate the subcarriers adaptively among the users. The fair rate allocation problem is formulated as an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing system throughput while maintaining fairness (in terms of transmission rate) among the users. The """"optimal"""" fair rate allocation is obtained by using the """"Hungarian method."""" A heuristic-based approach, namely the """"iterative approach,"""" that is more implementation friendly is also presented. The throughput performance of the iterative fair rate allocation is observed to be as good as that of optimal fair rate allocation and is better than that of the static subcarrier allocation scheme. Also, the iterative fair allocation provides better fairness compared to that for each of the optimal and the static subcarrier allocation schemes. To this end, a queuing model is formulated to analyze radio link level performance measures such as packet dropping probability and packet transmission delay under the above rate allocation schemes. In this formulation, packet arrivals are modeled by the discrete Markov modulated Poisson process, which is flexible to model different types of traffic arrival patterns. The proposed framework for radio link level performance analysis of multirate OFDMA networks is validated by extensive simulations.

The access and total delays as well as the excess bandwidth are our performance metrics. Computer programs were used to compute the performance metrics for a system servicing two applications with different QoS requirements. The selected applications are internet video game, which is delay sensitive, and data transfer, which is delay tolerant. The performance metrics were computed for different offered loads. Results show our approach yields QoS complying delays while achieving high bandwidth utilization.	centralized computing;offset binary;point of view (computer hardware company);quality of service;requirement	César Heyaime-Duverge;Vasant K.

Such network takes burst loss as an important performance criteria in the design step. Network performance, however, cannot be captured efficiently using traditional queueing models, because they often ignore the impatience of messages traveling through optical switches which is one of the popular issues in communication networks. In this paper, we develop an analytic model for this system using queueing theory and considering special impatience features. Simulation results show that i the developed model with impatience features can decrease burst loss probability i¾?10% compared with other approaches, and ii applying that model, we demonstrate that shared buffer architecture in optical burst switching network with optical buffer often achieves lower burst loss probability than dedicated buffer way in several different scenarios.

Without any Poisson or renewal assumptions, two easily computable upper bounds on the time congestion in a finite buffer are derived. The first upper bound is valid for arbitrary peak and mean-rate-policed sources, whereas the second (and, in principle, tighter) bound is valid for sources of the on/off type. The tightnesses of the bounds are evaluated by a new periodic queuing model taking into account the maximum allowed burst duration. It is concluded that the bounds form a basis for a realization of a simple admission control algorithm. Furthermore, it is pointed out that the derivation of the on/off bound induces a decomposition of the queuing process into a cell-scale contribution and a burst-scale contribution, a decomposition which is superior to traditional Markov modulated approaches both in accuracy, and in offering insight into the queuing process. >	atm turbo	Carsten Rasmussen;Jens H.

This paper presents a new stochastic tool, called convex ordering, that provides an ordering of any convex function of transmission rates of two multiplicative-decrease protocols and valuable insights into high order behaviors of protocols. As the ordering determined by this tool is consistent with any convex function of rates, it can be applied to any unknown metric for protocol performance that consists of some high-order moments of transmission rates, as well as those already known such as rate variance. Using the tool, it is analyzed that a protocol with a growth function that starts off with a concave function and then switches to a convex function (e.g., an odd order function such as x3 and x5) around the maximum window size in the previous loss epoch, gives the smallest rate variation under a variety of network conditions. Among existing protocols, BIC and CUBIC have this window growth function.

Manufacturers can implement their own scheduling algorithms depending on their specific requirements. There are a lot of scheduling algorithms proposed in the literature. Several scheduling algorithms propose hierarchical structures with strict priority or one-level scheduling mechanism. They are based conceptually on the round-robin approaches. However, they don’t consider an important factor: fairness. In this paper we propose a fairness strategy algorithm for IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless access networks. The proposed algorithm applies a fairness strategy to utilize the system bandwidth, to achieve the QoS requirements of high priority service flows, and to reduce starvations of low priority service flows. The simulation studies show that the proposed scheduling algorithm provides a flexible way to utilize the system bandwidth.	access network;algorithm;fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;lookup table;requirement;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation	Sheng-Tzong Cheng;Bo-Fu Chen;Chih-Lun Chou	2009	2009 First International Conference on Networks & Communications	10.1109/NetCoM.2009.71	fairness measure;fair-share scheduling;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;quality of service;flow shop scheduling;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;genetic algorithm scheduling;operating system;two-level scheduling;deadline-monotonic scheduling;maximum throughput scheduling;fair queuing;distributed computing;least slack time scheduling;lottery scheduling;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;proportionally fair;computer network	Embedded	3.9481702475938	96.68102250088454	142958

Problems related to the control and management are of increasing interest. Howe ver, there is no satisfactory tool to study the behavior of such networks. The traditional event driven simulation is slow when the network speed is high. The time driven simulati on is against the nature of packet-switched networks. As Transmission Control Protoc ol (TCP) is the most widely used transport layer protocol, and it uses window based flow c ontrol mechanism, classic queuing theories involving Markov Chain assumptions are no t applicable. This thesis develops a model for the window based flow control packet-switched networks. The model attempts to provide a way to study large and h igh speed networks using TCP. In this thesis, we discuss in detail the construction, i mplementation and application of the model. This thesis also compares the results obtained fr om the model with those from the packet by packet event driven simulation. The compariso n sh ws the model is correctly modeling the networks.

Recently, a combination of ad-hoc direct communication and infrastructure based cellular networks are considered to enable seamless connectivity and sufficient Quality of Service (QoS) for all types of vehicular applications. Within this paper a novel algorithm to enable data traffic steering between ad-hoc IEEE 802.11p based dedicated short range communication and LTE for Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication is presented. Based on the system-level evaluation of cell loads and radio channel congestion the network based performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and compared to the conservative approach of using exclusively IEEE 802.11p for message dissemination. First simulation results in a realistic urban intersection scenario show significant improvement of the quality of service.	algorithm;compaq lte;emulator;hoc (programming language);hybrid system;network congestion;precondition;quality of service;requirement;seamless3d;simulation	Nils Dreyer;Andreas Moller;Zeeshan Hameed Mir;Fethi Filali;Thomas Kürner	2016	2016 IEEE 84th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2016.7880850	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;telecommunications link;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;engineering;vehicular communication systems;particle detector;computer network	Visualization	5.752072496290515	91.50226248036857	143156

CPSs are characteristically different from the traditional internetworked systems (e.g., Internet) due to the operating environment and their applications, which impose high reliability constraints on them. One of the fundamental considerations for enabling this technology is the medium access control (MAC). The traditional IEEE 802.11-based MAC layer solutions need to be revamped. In order to increase the efficiency of data transmission, we introduce a new approach, which argues the replacement of the traditional backoff algorithm of 802.11. The proposed approach attempts to address some of the obligations posed by CPS networks. At the core of the proposed solution is the introduction of the adaptability factor to the traditional backoff procedure, which can help CPS networks operate under diverse environmental conditions. In order to survive the high degrees of dynamism of these networks, each of the nodes is equipped with a learning automaton, which adapts to the changing environment and provides the node with the most optimized value. The consistent outperformance of the proposed approach when compared with similar existing approaches under different simulation scenarios exhibits its efficacy. The critical parameters, such as packet delivery ratio and delay, are improved by up to 40% and 27%, respectively, over the traditional protocols.	access control;algorithm;automaton;backoff;cyber-physical system;internet;network packet;operating environment;optimization problem;requirement;simulation	Sudip Misra;P.

In this paper, we present a sender-based approach for multicast congestion control targeted towards reliable bulk data transfer. We assume that there are a few bottleneck links in a large scale multicast group at any time period and these bottlenecks persist long enough to be identified and adapted to. Our work focus on dynamically identifying the worst congested path in the multicast tree and obtaining TCP-friendly throughput on this selected path. We device novel selection (amongst receivers) and aggregation (over time) methods to achieve our goal. The response time of our protocol is then compatible to TCP once the worst path is identified. Only when switching between worst paths, the protocol response time is relaxed to multiple RTTs (less than 10) for the reasons of scalability and stability. We use the network simulator (NS2) to validate and evaluate our congestion control algorithm with both drop-tail and RED gateways. ...

Since then several changes to the basic mechanism, attempting to adhere to different interpretations of the fairness concept and to match the needs of different categories of users, have been proposed. In this paper attention is focused on the adaptive class of fairness control mechanisms and two solutions are analysed and compared. In order to do this, analytical models suited to the study of DQDB networks under overload conditions are introduced. The models are also amenable to the evaluation of the transient behaviour of DQDB networks, thus enabling a thorough investigation of the performance that can be obtained by adopting different fairness control mechanisms. The analytical models have been validated through the use of a software simulator. Numerical indices measuring the performance of the balancing mechanisms mentioned above are also given.

Particularly for integrated voice and data networks, voice traffic results in call losses and data traffic suffers from longer delays should networks have insufficient bandwidth. The main goal of the paper is to analytically determine optimal bandwidth allocated to voice and data by means of a queueing model with heterogeneous arrivals and multiple designated channels. The accuracy of analytical results is confirmed by simulation results. On the basis of the analysis, the paper proposes a bandwidth assignment paradigm for the assignment of network bandwidth to voice and data in an effort to guarantee minimal data delay and voice call blocking probability. The run time complexity of the bandwidth assignment computation and paradigm construction is shown to be polynomial bounded. Consequently, the resulting bandwidth assignment assures QoSs in terms of data delay and voice call blocking probability under various network loads.		Maria C. Yuang;Yieh R.

Especially, we note that in the idle state, a mobile device with dual interfaces needs to receive periodic beacons from the access point and downlink control information from the base station, resulting in significant power consumption. To save the power, we propose a power saving scheme with Hibernation mode to completely turn off the WLAN interface during the idle state, instead of entering Power Save (PS) mode and turn it on only when there is a need to receive data. However, if the WLAN interface is turned on even for a momentary traffic, it must repeat turning on and off continuously, dissipating power. Thus, we also develop a Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)-based signaling to turn on the WLAN interface for long-lived traffic. It is shown via simulations that the proposed power saving scheme results in better power efficiency.

Although the IEEE 802.16j network has been identified as a promising solution to broadband wireless access, the deployment of such networks in a maritime environment faces significant challenges because the natural movement of the ocean surface often causes the motion of stations and further leads to the variation in quality of communication channels. To tackle with these challenges and facilitate channel exploitation for deploy ing 802.16j based maritime communication networks, we first propose a novel scheme to specify the communication channel state between different maritime stations, based on which a new adaptation scheme is developed to exploit the ptimal channel transmission capacity. Moreover, an adaptive traffic scheduling scheme is proposed to fully utilize the channel transmission bandwidth in 802.16j maritime networks. Simulation experiments have shown that the proposed schemes can fully exploit the maritime channels to achieve both satisfactory QoS performance and system throughput for maritime users.	algorithm;channel (communications);channel capacity;experiment;maximal set;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;telecommunications network;throughput	Hanwu Wang;Weijia Jia;Geyong Min	2011	2011 31st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2011.14	wimax;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;operating system;network simulation;scheduling;channel capacity;computer network;channel	Mobile	5.774094714908829	96.20005314478011	144238

Specifically, Quality of Service (QoS) has become an important support mechanism in the context of a variety of applications which utilize network resources. The IEEE 802.16 standard for Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (Wireless MAN) provides a complete QoS control structure designed to enable flow isolation and service differentiation over the common wireless interface. Although the media access control (MAC) mechanisms defined in this standard can offer predefined QoS provisioning on a pre-connection basis (additionally, many algorithms have been addressed to support QoS guarantees for various kinds of applications), the design for a stable, efficient and flexible MAC scheduling algorithm for such QoS provisoning still remains to be discovered. In this paper, we propose a QoS control scheme, Efficient Bandwidth Allocation (EBA), for the Wireless MAN system. Notably, this schedule enables predefined service parameters to control the service provided for each uplink connection. Through MAC layer resource allocation, the proposed scheme enables dynamic allocation in different distances for a particular wireless connection.	access control;algorithm;control flow;fairness measure;memory management;provisioning;quality of service;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link	Da-Nung Lai;Tsung-Chuan Huang;Hung-Yi Chi	2011	2011 International Conference on Parallel Processing	10.1109/ICPP.2011.81	network allocation vector;real-time computing;mobile qos;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Embedded	4.632670065900737	96.48779494160463	144323

These packets may arrive at a node D out of sequence if sent from a node S with multiple links connecting it to D. Consequently, packets may experience resequencing delay at D to put them back in sequence. The objective of this paper is to study the relationship between the mean resequencing delay and variations in packet transmission times. Assuming a Poisson stream of packets, a Kstage hyperexponential transmission time distribution, and an infinite number of equal capacity links connecting S and D, we derive a9 expression for the mean resequencing delay. This result provides an upper bound on the mean resequencing delay for nodes connected by finitely many links. We observe that, for the two-stage and three-stage hyperexponential distribution, the mean resequencing delay varies almost perfectly linearly with the squared coefficient of variation. An asymptotic bound analysis can explain this behavior. Index Terns-Asymptotic bound analysis, computer networks, performance evaluation, queueing theory, resequencing delay, virtual circuits. I . INTRODUCTION In some computer network architectures, a process communicates with another process across the network by establishing a virtual circuit. A virtual circuit is assigned a route through zero or more intermediate nodes at the time the circuit is established. This route is fixed during the lifetime of the virtual circuit. An important property of a virtual circuit is that it delivers packets at the destination in the same order as they are received at the source. Examples of networks using virtual circuits are IBM’s SNA and French PTT’s public network TRANSPAC [ 11. Consider a virtual circuit passing through two adjacent nodes S and D connected by multiple links in parallel (Fig. 1). Packets sent from S to D can amve out of sequence at D because of three reasons: l) packets may have different lengths, 2) the parallel links may have different capacities, and 3) some packets may be lost on the way and may need to be retransmitted. Hence, it is necessary to resequence packets at node D to put them back in order. The distribution of the time to resequence (also known as refifo delay) has been studied under various assumptions about link transmission time [2]-[4]. Bharath-Kumar and Kermani [2] assume that each virtual circuit passing through S and D constitutes a Poisson arrival process at node S. They analyze the resequencing problem assuming that packets belonging to various virtual circuits have an exponentially distributed length with the same mean 1 / p . They consider m links connecting S and D. Thus, using notations from queueing theory, Manuscript received November 27, 1988; revised May 2, 1989. Recommended by P. A. Ng.

Two consecutive nodes connected by multiple links. Packets sent from S (source) to D (destination) may go out of sequence if they have different lengths or links have different capacities. In virtual circuit level resequencing, packets belonging to various virtual circuits ( VC ) are resequenced at D with respect to other packets belonging to the same virtual circuit. Thus, packets belonging to the same virtual circuit are put back in sequence. their model can be called an M / M / m resequencing model. The researchers consider two strategies for resequencing. In channel level resequencing, all the packets are assigned sequence numbers at S. The packets are resequenced at D according to the sequence numbers as a single stream regardless of which virtual circuit they belong to. Virtual circuit level resequencing differs from the channel level resequencing in that a packet is resequenced at D only with respect to packets belonging to the same virtual circuit. In [2], expressions are derived for mean resequencing delay in the two strategies. Also, [2] reports simulation studies of resequencing for virtual circuits of different average packet lengths and parallel links of different capacities. Yum and Ngai [3] generalize [2] by considering links of different capacities. In their model, packets are transmitted on the fastest available link. However, they assume the same average packet length for packets from different virtual circuits. Agrawal and Ramaswamy [4] present a simplified analysis of resequencing. For an M / M / m resequencing system model, they derive the distribution, mean, and coefficient of variation of the resequencing delay for channel level resequencing. It has been proved in [4] that the mean resequencing delay of the M / M / m resequencing system is a monotonic, increasing function of the number of links m, and the mean resequencing delay of the M / M / w resequencing system is an upper bound on the mean resequencing delay of any M / M / m resequencing system. This result can be explained as follows. As the number of links connecting the two nodes S and D is increased, it is expected that the mean resequencing delay will increase since there are more ways for packets to go out of sequence. Studying networks with two nodes connected by an infinite number of links will result in an upper bound on mean resequencing delay for nodes connected by finitely many links. In Chowdhury [5], Poisson packet streams of rate A, arriving at node S from virtual circuit VC, are considered. It is assumed that packets belonging to VCj have an exponentially distributed service (transmission) time with mean 1 /pJ . The packet transmissions are assumed to be error free. For an infinite number of parallel links of equal capacity connecting S and D, expressions for the mean resequencing delay for both the channel level and virtual circuit level resequencing strategies are derived. Comparing the two strategies, it is concluded that channel level resequencing is inferior to virtual circuit level resequencing. 0098-5589/89/1200-1633$01.00	assignment zero;coefficient;computer science;fastest;ibm notes;machine learning;network architecture;network packet;packet switching;performance evaluation;precomputed radiance transfer;queueing theory;simulation;virtual circuit	Shyamal K.

In contrast, in a wireless network, signal transmissions are intrinsically broadcast, and suffer from mutual interference. In several physical layer technologies, a wireless signal is decoded by treating the sum of all the other on-going signal transmissions as noise. Hence, from a networking standpoint, there is a need to model wireless channel interference. An accurate interference model is especially important in a multi-hop network context, since there could be several simultaneous wireless transmissions. Several works in the literature have made use of simplified interference models. Some works assume a fixed range for communication and interference, while others are based on concepts like capture threshold where the desired signal strength is compared with interference from a single node at a time, rather than cumulatively. In particular, the latter model is used in ns2 which is the most common simulation tool. Under isotropic pathloss, the capture threshold model is also equivalent to the protocol model proposed by Gupta and Kumar, which is now the subject of a lot of analytical activity notably through conflict graph based problem formulations. We investigate the accuracy and appropriateness of the capture threshold based interference model, by comparing it with one based on the SINR (signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio) with additive interference calculation. We find that both in the case of random access networks, as well as in the case of scheduled networks (where node transmissions are scheduled to be completely conflict-free), a simplified interference model such as the capture threshold model, can produce significantly different results compared to an additive interference based model. Therefore, a lot of caution should be exercised before accepting or interpreting results based on simplified interference models.	access network;capture effect;catastrophic interference;interference (communication);norm (social);random access;random-access memory;serializability;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;threshold model;utility functions on indivisible goods	Aravind Iyer;Catherine Rosenberg;Aditya Karnik	2006	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1145/1185373.1185376	signal strength;interference;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;zero-forcing precoding;threshold model;physical layer;random access;computer network;cumulant	Mobile	9.99694961381517	91.37821188298656	144659

This paper introduces a resource reservation-based label switch path, Label Switch Path with guaranteed Quality of Service (LSPQS) that provides end-to- end quality of service support, in terms of bandwidth, link loss ratio and end-to-end delay, in mobile ad hoc networks. The establishment of LSP allows for forwarding of data below IP layer and encapsulation of variety of MAC protocols. To provide guaranteed QoS along LSP detailed working out is presented to allow estimation of available bandwidth, link loss ratio and end-to-end delay in unsynchronized wireless environment. LSPQS also includes efficient mechanisms for QoS maintenance, including temporary reservation and fast recovery processes.	control flow;dataflow;encapsulation (networking);end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);quality of service	Mehwish Jabeen	2006	2006 International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications (ICWMC'06)	10.1109/ICWMC.2006.58	mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	-3.576572577264675	90.60588368895233	144712

Briefly, the ACK implosion problem refers to the significant overhead incurred by the sending host due to the processing of ACKs from each receiver. A potential solution to this problem is to shift the burden of providing reliable data transfer to the receivers—thus resulting in a receiver-initiated multicast error control protocol based on the use of negative acknowledgments (NAKs). In this paper we determine the maximum throughputs of the sending and receiving hosts for generic sender-initiated and receiver-initiated protocols. We show that the receiver-initiated error control protocols provide substantially higher throughputs than their sender-initiated counterparts. We further demonstrate that the introduction of random delays prior to generating NAKs coupled with the multicasting of NAKs to all receivers has the potential for an additional substantial increase in the throughput of receiver-initiated error control protocols over sender-initiated protocols.	acknowledgement (data networks);error detection and correction;multicast;overhead (computing);throughput	Sridhar Pingali;Donald F.

The architecture comprises of a QoS management and control module which is implemented both at node level and at the sink for a system level QoS administration. The QoS module implemented at sensor node forms a subset of the larger QoS Management and Control module implemented for the system wide information, so as not to encumber the resource constrained wireless sensor network While much research has been conducted in wireless sensor network, little attention has been given to a holistic QoS approach for WSN. Energy efficiency has been the main QoS metric in research efforts. In this paper, we present a congestion estimation model for QoS in wireless sensor network, and implement it using fuzzy logic with fuzzy set variables. Simulations are conducted for our scheme which shows that with increased network dynamics and with increased packets generation rate, our implementation efficiently sorts out the traffic and minimizes the packet loss for prioritized event-driven traffic.	algorithm;computer simulation;control unit;event-driven programming;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;goto;holism;network congestion;network packet;quality of service;sensor node;x image extension	Saad Ahmed Munir;Yu Wen Bin;Biao Ren;Ma Man	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.791	real-time computing;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;fuzzy set;computer network	Embedded	-1.448721277615658	90.08520367567827	145280

Differentiated services architecture (DiffServ), which forwards packets based on their per-hop behaviours, is known as a promising way for supporting QoS in a high-speed backbone network scenario. Motivated by the load-balanced Birkhoff-von Neumann switch, which has received much attention recently because of its outstanding extensibility performance, in this study, the authors propose a new switch architecture called load-balanced DiffServ support switch (LBDS). LBDS consists of pipeline traffic bandwidth control, priority-based load balancing, and bandwidth-based priority scheduling to implement fast forwarding for expedited forwarding (EF) traffic and assured forwarding for AF classes of traffic. The authors evaluate LBDS by extensive theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations. As expected, LBDS can provide bandwidth guarantees for both EF and AF traffic. We also show that under burst traffic arrivals, especially when the traffic arrival pattern is non-uniform and the load is above 0.6, LBDS performs much better delay performance than existing DiffServ support schemes.	anisotropic filtering;bandwidth management;birkhoff interpolation;differentiated services;entity framework;extensibility;fast forward;internet backbone;load balancing (computing);pipeline (computing);quality of service;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation	Hongchao Hu;Yunfei Guo;Peng Yi;Shuqiao Chen	2011	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2010.0543	real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-0.29321767100133034	95.07296480301031	145414

First the client buffer information such as the fullness of the buffer and the playback information is easily obtained at the client. Based on the buffer information, the continuous playback time interval that the completely received segments in the client buffer can support is calculated. To keep continuous playback, the remaining packets of the un-completely received segment should arrive at the client during the time interval. Considering the video information in MPD from the HTTP server and the buffer information about the un-completely received segment, the sum size of the remaining packets in MAC queue can be obtained. From the time interval and the sum size, the transmission rate requirement that the MAC layer should satisfy can be acquired. For a scheduling period with fixed duration called TTI, the transmission capacity at the MAC layer can be easily acquired. Then a new mathematical model is proposed to maximize the system throughput subject to the transmission capacity requirements of the clients and the total RB constraint of the physical layer. Then a resource allocation scheme with low complexity is developed to solve the proposed problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently improve the playback continuity compared with other existing algorithms.	algorithm;business continuity;compaq lte;hypertext transfer protocol;mpd (programming language);mathematical model;mouse phenome database;numerical analysis;push technology;requirement;scheduling (computing);scott continuity;server (computing);simulation;streaming media;throughput	Lijun He;Guizhong Liu;Xin Chen	2014	Proceeding of IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks 2014	10.1109/WoWMoM.2014.6918999	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;lte advanced;operating system;computer network	Embedded	3.990129663232282	95.02385835540302	145424

In particular, wireless environments and datacenters are envisioned to become largely dependent on the power of multipathing for seamless handovers, virtual machine (VM) migration and in general, pooling less proficient resources together for achieving overall high proficiency. The transport layer, with its knowledge about end-to-end path characteristics, is well placed to enhance performance through better utilization of multiple paths. Realizing the importance of transport-layer multipath, this paper investigates the modernization of traditional connection establishment, flow control, sequence number splitting, acknowledgement, and flow scheduling mechanisms for use with multiple paths. Since congestion control defines fundamental feature of the transport layer, we study the working of multipath rate control and analyze its stability and convergence. We also discuss how various multipath congestion control algorithms differ in their window increase and decrease functions, their TCP-friendliness, and responsiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth survey paper that has chronicled the evolution of the transport layer of the Internet from the traditional singlepath TCP to the recent development of the modern multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol. Along with describing the history of this evolution, we also highlight in this paper the remaining challenges and research issues.	acknowledgement (data networks);algorithm;control theory;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;fault tolerance;internet protocol suite;load balancing (computing);mathematical model;multipath propagation;network congestion;open research;responsiveness;scheduling (computing);seamless3d;telecommunications network;throughput;virtual machine	Sana Habib;Junaid Qadir;Anwaar Ali;Durdana Habib;Ming Li;Arjuna Sathiaseelan	2016	J.

CFCA not only assigns bandwidth dynamically to different flows but also determines those appropriate OVSF codes whose assignment results in the minimum overhead for code reassignments during dynamic bandwidth allocation. To reduce the overhead of code reassignments, this paper introduces the concept of affinity-mate and enables bandwidth allocation and code placement to interact with each other. A new performance metric, called class-based rate degradation ratio (CRD), is introduced to ensure fairness in providing rate and delay guarantees by measuring the rate degradations of flows based on their traffic types. The simulation results show that code reassignment overhead can be reduced by up to 60% for high network loads. For low network loads, fairness is achieved fully, but for high network loads the average rate requirement is met fairly for 95% of the flows.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;blocking (computing);case-based reasoning;code;data rate units;elegant degradation;fairness measure;flow network;interference (communication);mate;maxdiff;microsoft windows;neural coding;overhead (computing);processor affinity;qr code;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;simulation;telecommunications link	Narasimha Challa;Hasan Çam	2010	EURASIP J.

In this paper, we propose a fully distributed medium access control (MAC) adaptation method for service differentiation. It is implemented by dynamically updating the MAC layer parameters (such as contention window) to adapt to the network conditions in a class-based fashion. In this sense, the QoS classes are differentiated and the system performance is significantly improved in terms of delay, packet loss and throughput while ensuring fairness and stability. The key idea of our scheme is the introduction of a mapping function and a target contention window. It is demonstrated that our proposed adaptive MAC can outperform both the basic 802.11 MAC and the fixed differentiation scheme with very low complexity.	access control;best-effort delivery;fairness measure;network packet;quality of service;scheme;throughput	Jun Zhao;Zihua Guo;Qian Zhang;Wenwu Zhu	2003		10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258874	best-effort delivery;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;packet loss;computer network	Mobile	3.407767372744229	95.94639304385362	146398

Unfortunately, the 802.11 protocol poorly behaves under congested scenarios and cannot guarantee the reliability and timeliness demands of massively transmitted broadcast messages, leading to the severe degradation of safety. Recently, there has been a consensus from academia, automotive industries and standardization bodies in adapting transmission parameters (e.g., rate, transmission power) according to the channel load status. Although the objective of controlling channel load can be met with local load measurements only, the participation and fairness principles require the dissemination and sharing of load information among vehicles. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the dynamics of the channel busy ratio (CBR) metrics (locally measured and shared over one/two hops), commonly used in the literature and at the basis of the Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) standard, under different density and mobility settings.	broadcast domain;case-based reasoning;elegant degradation;fairness measure;futures studies;galileo (satellite navigation);network congestion;propagation constant;simulation	Alessia Autolitano;Massimo Reineri;Riccardo Scopigno;Claudia Campolo;Antonella Molinaro	2014	2014 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)	10.1109/ICCVE.2014.7297644	telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.600037232902855	89.19945423567654	146445

This behavior is not optimal for TCP because TCP is designed only to handle a contiguous flow of messages efficiently. This behavior anomaly is well-known, but fixes are not integrated into today's TCP implementations, even though performance is seriously degraded, especially for MPI applications. This paper proposes three improvements in the Linux TCP stack: i.e., pacing at start-up, reducing Retransmit-Timeout time, and TCP parameter switching at the transition of computation phases in an MPI application. Evaluation of these improvements using the NAS parallel benchmarks shows that the BT, CG, IS, and SP benchmarks achieved 10 to 30 percent improvements. On the other hand, the FT and MG benchmarks showed no improvement because they have the steady communication that TCP assumes, and the LU benchmark became slightly worse because it has very little communication	anomaly detection;benchmark (computing);cg (programming language);computation;fairness measure;financial times;linux;message passing interface;mg (editor);nas parallel benchmarks;network congestion	Motohiko Matsuda;Tomohiro Kudoh;Yuetsu Kodama;Ryousei Takano;Yutaka Ishikawa	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing	10.1109/CLUSTR.2005.347034	compound tcp;parallel computing;message passing;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp pacing;computer science;bic tcp;message passing interface;tcp hole punching;operating system;distributed computing;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;transport layer;computer network	HPC	-4.154951688291405	92.91382392137191	146455

One of the most constructive tools employed by the traffic engineering concept is the traffic prediction. Having in mind the heterogeneous traffic patterns originated by various modern services and network platforms, the need of a robust, cognitive, and error-free prediction technique becomes even more pressing. This work focuses on the prediction concept as an autonomous, functional, and efficient process, where multiple cutting-edge methods are presented, modeled, and thoroughly assessed. To this purpose, real traffic traces have been captured, including multiple multimedia traffic flows, so as to comparatively assess widely used methods in terms of accuracy.	automata theory;autonomous robot;extrapolation;free software license;learning automata;markov chain;mathematical optimization;network packet;network performance;performance evaluation;time of arrival;tracing (software)	Panagiotis G.

Conventional approaches to solving this problem consider the existing best-effort class as the low-priority class, and attempt to develop mechanisms that provide “better-than-best-effort” service. In this paper, we explore the opposite approach, and devise a new distributed algorithm to realize a low-priority service (as compared to the existing best effort) from the network endpoints. To this end, we develop TCP Low Priority (TCP-LP), a distributed algorithm whose goal is to utilize only the excess network bandwidth as compared to the “fair share” of bandwidth as targeted by TCP. The key mechanisms unique to TCP-LP congestion control are the use of one-way packet delays for congestion indications and a TCP-transparent congestion avoidance policy. Our simulation results show that: (1) TCP-LP is largely non-intrusive to TCP traffic; (2) both single and aggregate TCP-LP flows are able to successfully utilize excess network bandwidth; moreover, multiple TCP-LP flows share excess bandwidth fairly; (3) substantial amounts of excess bandwidth are available to low-priority class, even in the presence of “greedy” TCP flows; (4) the response times of web connections in the best-effort class decrease by up to 90% when long-lived bulk data transfers use TCP-LP rather than TCP.	acknowledgement (data networks);aggregate data;best-effort delivery;distributed algorithm;experiment;file transfer;future internet;greedy algorithm;internet protocol suite;linux;network congestion;network packet;offset binary;one-way function;router (computing);simulation;tcp congestion control;testbed;web traffic	Aleksandar Kuzmanovic;Edward W.

In order to keep balance between sampling data frequency of labels’ effective positioning and increasing the utilization rate of time slot in each time frame as far as possible, we will construct dynamic time slot that is based on the algorithmic label numbers. Flight experiments were carried out to verify the result. We take a rectangle envelope as a multiple base station area for an example. Data processing and analysis are proved to optimize the positioning rate of each UWB label and to reduce the formation of large sparse time slot and empty slots, which is compared to a primary model of the fixed time slot in the fixed time frame.	algorithm;markov chain;markov model;ultra-wideband	Li Li;Fa-zhong Li;Zhi Kun Liu	2016		10.1007/978-981-10-2663-8_37	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;telecommunications	NLP	6.803625613532726	90.06804369320001	146695

In order to deal robustly with the unreliable wireless nature, the 802.11 medium access control protocol has a relatively large overhead and hence, the throughput performance is much worse than the underlying physical layer rate. Moreover, along with many emerging applications and services over WLANs, the demand for faster and higher capacity WLANs has been growing recently. In this paper, a new MAC protocol, Aggregated MAC scheme (AMAC), is proposed wherein, multiple packets are aggregated into and transmitted in a single large frame in order to reduce the overhead. In the Network Layer, a routing protocol, MRTP (Multimedia Route Repair Routing Protocol), is proposed to find reliable links and to provide an efficient route repair mechanism. The implementation of these protocols reduces the number of Access Points required in the network.	access control;overhead (computing);routing;throughput	K. Kathiravan;R.

d54e2adcbfbb60dea1a1a2ef32f15679b5a591b3	end-to-end backlog and delay bound analysis using martingale for internet of vehicles		Internet of vehicles (IoVs) emerges as a promising technology to facilitate vehicular wireless communication by approving vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services for intelligent transportation systems including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) services. V2V networks have been rapidly developed to support short distance data transmission among vehicles on the road. By analyzing the Markov arrival process and the service effect on the IEEE 802.11p enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism, the multi-hop service process can be modelled into a virtualized single service in a min-plus convolution form. In this paper, we employ the stochastic network calculus (SNC) and the martingale theory to investigate the multi-hop end-to-end (E2E) backlog and delay bounds under the first-in firstout (FIFO) scheduling policy in IoVs. In the simulation, we use three types of real wireless data traces, i.e., VoIP, gaming and UDP, to evaluate the proposed algorithm by considering double Nakagami-m fading channel. We can easily find that the supermartingale multi-hop E2E backlog and delay bounds are tight to the real data trace simulation results. Moreover, our study also presents the impact of the number of vehicles on the multi-hop E2E queueing performance.	academy;algorithm;convolution;end-to-end principle;fifo (computing and electronics);ibm notes;internet;markov chain;maxima and minima;network calculus;queueing theory;relay;sap netweaver;scheduling (computing);simulation;systems design;tracing (software);vehicle-to-vehicle	Yun Hu;Hongyan Li;Zheng Chang;Ronghui Hou;Zhu Han	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Standards for Communications and Networking (CSCN)	10.1109/CSCN.2017.8088605	scheduling (computing);fifo (computing and electronics);computer network;network calculus;real-time computing;queueing theory;markov process;voice over ip;computer science;martingale (probability theory);communication channel	Mobile	3.137027857331564	97.03772930267874	146781

In this scheme, a mobile user located in dual coverage area randomly selects WLAN with probability of ω when there is a need for downloading a chunk of data. The value of ω is optimised according to the status of both networks in terms of network load and signal quality of both cellular and WLAN networks. An analytical model, based on Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) is proposed to optimise the value of ω and compute the performance of proposed scheme in terms of energy efficiency, throughput, and call blocking probability. Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to the mainstream network selection schemes, namely, WLAN-first and Load Balancing.	blocking (computing);chunking (computing);download;erlang (unit);load balancing (computing);markov chain;randomness;simulation;throughput	Shobanraj Navaratnarajah;Chong Han;Mehrdad Dianati;Muhammad Ali Imran	2016	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2015.1084	throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;continuous-time markov chain;mathematics;efficient energy use;statistics;computer network	Mobile	5.988582637382429	97.6228144698816	147017

In IMS, the presence server is responsible for notifying an authorized watcher of the updated presence information. If the updates occur more frequently than the accesses of the watcher, the presence server will generate many notifications. This paper uses a weakly consistent scheme (called delayed update) to reduce the notification traffic. In this scheme, a delayed timer is defined to control the notification rate. We propose an analytic model and simulation experiments to investigate the performance of delayed update. The study indicates that delayed update can effectively reduce the notification traffic without significantly degrading the valid access probability.	authorization;experiment;glossary of computer graphics;ip multimedia subsystem;presence information;server (computing);simulation;timer	Whai-En Chen;Yi-Bing Lin;Ren-Huang Liou	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.081433	universal mobile telecommunications system;core network;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;system;mobile computing;computer security;umts frequency bands;telecommunications network;server;computer network	Mobile	1.6244504662537211	101.86789658652086	147273
8e6d544796df51de6181fcef6cf2dbdc06ef3c70	harmonising coexistence of machine type communications with wi-fi data traffic under frame-based lbt		The existence of relatively long LTE data blocks within the licensed-assisted access (LAA) framework results in bursty machine-type communications (MTC) packet arrivals, which cause system performance degradation and present new challenges in Markov modeling. We develop an embedded Markov chain to characterize the dynamic behavior of the contention arising from bursty MTC and Wi-Fi data traffic in the LAA framework. Our theoretical model reveals a high-contention phenomenon caused by the bursty MTC traffic, and quantifies the resulting performance degradation for both MTC and Wi-Fi data traffic. The Markov model is further developed to evaluate three potential solutions aiming to alleviate the contention. Our analysis shows that simply expanding the contention window, although successful in reducing congestion, may cause unacceptable MTC data loss. A TDMA scheme instead achieves better MTC packet delivery and overall throughput, but requires centralized coordination. We propose a distributed scheme that randomly spreads the MTC access processes through the available time period. Our model results, validated by simulations, demonstrate that the random spreading solution achieves a near TDMA performance, while preserving the distributed nature of the Wi-Fi protocol. It alleviates the MTC traffic contention and improves the overall throughput by up to 10%.		Gordon J.

The heterogeneous services include constant bit rate (CBR), variable bit rate (VBR) and available bit rate (ABR) services. Multiple access control is handled by a polling-based scheme with non-preemptive priority. Tight delay variation (jitter) bounds for CBR connections and delay bounds for VBR connections are derived. A CAC scheme based on the derived bounds is developed. The CAC makes use of user mobility information to reserve an appropriate amount of system resources for potential handoff connections to achieve low handoff connection dropping rate (HCDR). Simulation results show that the proposed CAC scheme can achieve both low HCDR and high resource utilization.	access control;access network;best, worst and average case;case-based reasoning;common access card;preemption (computing);provisioning;quality of service;simulation;stochastic gradient descent;volume boot record	Dongmei Zhao;Xuemin Shen;Jon W.

In practice, IPA derivatives may be computed either from simulation runs or from empirical field data (when the formulas are non-parametric). Nonparametric IPA derivatives in fluid-flow queues have been recently derived for the loss volume and time average of buffer occupancy, with respect to buffer size, and arrival-rate or service-rate parameters. Additionally, these IPA derivatives have been shown to be unbiased in the sense that their expectation and differentiation operators commute, while their discrete counterparts have long been known to be generally biased. Recent work has further shown how to map the computation of IPA derivatives from a fluid-flow queue to its discrete counterpart without an appreciable loss of accuracy in performance measures. Thus, this work holds out the promise of potential applications of IPA derivatives to gradient-based optimization of objective functions involving performance metrics parameterized by settable parameters in queueing network context. This paper is an empirical study of IPA derivatives for individual queues within queueing systems which model telecommunications networks and some of their protocols. As a testbed, we used HNS (Hybrid Network Simulator) -a hybrid Java simulator of queueing networks with traffic streams subject to several telecommunications protocols. More specifically, the hybrid feature of HNS admits models with mixtures of discrete (packet) flows and continuous (fluid) flows, and collects detailed statistics and IPA derivatives for all flow types. The paper outlines the mapping of IPA derivatives from the fluid domain to the packet domain as implemented in HNS, and studies the accuracy of IPA derivatives in compatible fluid and packet queueing models, as well as the stabilization of their values in time. Our experimental results lend empirical support to the contention that IPA derivatives can be accurately computed from discrete versions by adopting a fluid-flow view. Furthermore, the long-run values IPA derivatives are empirically shown to stabilize quite fast. Finally, the results provide the basis and motivation for IPA applications to optimization of telecommunications network design and to potential new open-loop protocols that take advantage of IPA information.	computation;gradient;java;mathematical optimization;network packet;network planning and design;perturbation theory;queueing theory;simulation;stochastic process;telecommunications network;testbed	Benjamin Melamed;Shuo Pan;Yorai Wardi	2007	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2006.12.032	design;mathematical optimization;simulation;performance;control theory;mathematics;algorithm;fluid dynamics	Metrics	-1.630098905682768	97.76076622367795	147467

The considered QoS negotiation system implements a timeslot division strategy to allocate the negotiated bandwidth to users. We claim that an efficient scheduling strategy is essential to exploit the features of mobile computers equipped with multiple wireless interfaces, which can be used simultaneously for transmission of data belonging to a single application, while minimizing the reordering delay at the receiver side due to transmission of data via multiple-paths with varying characteristics. A new scheduling mechanism is developed by taking into consideration such QoS systems. The effectiveness of the scheme is verified and compared with the most popular scheduling schemes through extensive simulations. The results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the former scheduling algorithms effectively.	algorithm;computer;mobile computing;quality of service;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);simulation;streaming media	Juan Carlos Fernandez;Nei Kato	2008	IJBDCN	10.4018/jbdcn.2008100102	real time streaming protocol;real-time computing;wireless wan;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;computer network	Embedded	2.8551585389385377	94.406632363284	147468
537c708b8db6e23b4d3de213cba94b6af9826cc5	lte_ficc: a new mechanism for provision of qos and congestion control in lte/lte-advanced networks	conference proceeding	In Long Term Evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced architecture, the basic schedulers allocate resources without taking congestion at the Evolved NodeB (eNodeB’s) output buffer into account. This leads to buffer overflows and deterioration in overall Quality of Service (QoS). Congestion avoidance and fair bandwidth allocation is hardly considered in existing research for the LTE/ LTE-Advanced uplink connections. This paper introduces a mechanism for LTE and LTE-Advanced, LTE Fair Intelligent Congestion Control (LTE_FICC), to control congestion at an eNodeB. LTE_FICC jointly exists with the scheduler at the eNodeB to guarantee efficient traffic scheduling, in order to make the output buffer operate around a target operating point. LTE_FICC also overcomes the problem of unfair bandwidth allocation among the flows that share the same eNodeB interface. LTE_FICC is simple, robust and scalable, as it uses per queue rather than per flow accounting. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, simulations were performed in Opnet using LTE module. The results demonstrated that LTE_FICC controls the eNodeB buffer effectively; prevents overflows; and ensures the QoS of flows in terms of fair bandwidth allocation, improved throughput and reduced queuing delay.

Hence, automated and objective techniques that provide real-time or online VVoIP QoE estimates are vital. Objective techniques developed to-date estimate VVoIP QoE by performing frame-to-frame peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) comparisons of the original video sequence and the reconstructed video sequence obtained from the sender-side and receiver-side, respectively. Since processing such video sequences is time consuming and computationally intensive, existing objective techniques cannot provide online VVoIP QoE. In this paper, we present a novel framework that can provide online estimates of VVoIP QoE on network paths without end-user involvement and without requiring any video sequences. The framework features the """"G AP-model"""", which is an offline model of QoE expressed as a function of measurable network factors such as bandwidth, delay, jitter, and loss. Using the GAP-model, our online framework can produce VVoIP QoE estimates in terms of """"Good"""", """"Acceptable"""", or """"Poor"""" (GAP) grades of perceptual quality solely from the on-line measured network conditions."""	acoustic cryptanalysis;codec;cognitive model;elegant degradation;emoticon;emulator;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;iptv;loss function;mpeg-2;network performance;online and offline;packet delay variation;peak signal-to-noise ratio;real-time clock;test case;testbed;video clip;viz: the computer game	Prasad Calyam;Eylem Ekici;Chang-Gun Lee;Mark Haffner;Nathan Howes	2007	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2007.6182880	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;multimedia;computer network;broadband networks	Metrics	-3.3802685883732915	102.64145385891551	148032

Performances of low priority traffics (FTP) with higher CWmin values are suppressed even during absence of high priority traffics (video and voice). In this paper, we propose a modified backoff scheme called Dynamic Offset Contention Window (DOCW) algorithm, which dynamically adjusts CW values of traffics to network conditions. It is shown by simulations that the proposed algorithm enhances throughputs of low priority traffics where QoS is provided as well.	algorithm	Tae-Hyung Kim;Ludger Marwitz;Dong Ku Kim	2002		10.1007/3-540-36555-9_18	real-time computing;telecommunications;differentiated service;computer science;service quality;algorithm;computer network	Mobile	1.471056420146381	102.38965473195762	148219

The basic channel access mechanism, i.e. distributed coordination function (DCF), of IEEE 802.11 networks employs the exponential backoff scheme to alleviate the channel contention, which works efficiently in practice with small number of stations and traditional human-centric traffic. However, the emerging Machine-Type Communications (MTC) is bringing new challenges on IEEE 802.11 networks due to its massive access and special traffic pattern. Therefore, in this paper, we address the collisional collapse problem in the MTC scenario where the efficiency of DCF is extremely low because of high-level collision. To solve this problem, we propose a Barring-Enhanced Distributed Coordination Function (BE-DCF) at each Machine-Type Device (MTD) to coordinately restrict the contention to a reasonable low level by randomly barring its transmit attempt. Simulation results show that, the proposed BE-DCF achieves higher and stable throughput and lower frame drop ratio than legacy DCF mechanism at the cost of a slight increase on channel access delay in MTC scenario, especially when the MTC traffic is highly correlated.Japan	design rule for camera file system;elegant degradation;exponential backoff;high- and low-level;mtd-f;randomness;simulation;throughput;time complexity	Lei Zhong;Yozo Shoji;Kiyohide Nakauchi;Suyong Eum	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops (ICC)	10.1109/ICCW.2014.6881242	ieee 802.11s;ieee 802.11g-2003;real-time computing;ieee 802.11w-2009;ieee 802.1x;ieee 802;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;ieee 802.11u;ieee 802.11h-2003;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Mobile	7.222437481030842	92.74055153512212	148281

This paper presents a discrete-time 4-D Markov chain model that integrates in addition to the data and control retransmission limits, the finite load, finite buffer capacity, and quality of the received data into a one model. Specifically, the additional two dimensions model the data retransmission limit and buffer capacity. Moreover, a single state, the idle state, is added to model the unsaturated condition. The 4-D model provides a new insight into QoS performance and queueing behavior of the IEEE 802.11 system. Simulation results also indicate that the analytical analysis is fairly accurate.	carpal tunnel syndrome;design rule for camera file system;download;markov chain;network packet;quality of service;rs-232;retransmission (data networks);retry;simulation;throughput	Ahed Alshanyour;Anjali Agarwal	2010	2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2010	10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5684057	data modeling;markov chain;discrete time and continuous time;two-dimensional space;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;markov process;queueing theory;specification;statistics;computer network	Embedded	2.0202544914544567	98.64768722111549	148807

To solve the conflict between the capability limitations of existing systems and the ever-growing demands of roadway safety oriented communication applications, we propose a novel system design and implementation for realtime reliable roadway communications, aiming at providing safety messages to users in a realtime and reliable manner. In our extensive experimental study, the latency is well controlled within the hard realtime requirement (100ms) for roadway safety applications given by NHTSA [2], and the reliability is proved to be improved by two orders of magnitude compared with existing experimental results [1]. Our experiments show that the proposed system for roadway safety communications can provide guaranteed highly reliable packet delivery ratio (PDR) of 99% within the hard realtime requirement 100ms under various scenarios, e.g., highways, city areas, rural areas, tunnels, bridges. Our design can be widely applied for roadway communications and facilitate the current research in both hardware and software design and further provide an opportunity to consolidate the existing work on a practical and easy-configurable low-cost roadway communication platform.	design review (u.s. government);experiment;network packet;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement;software design;systems design	Kai Xing;Tianbo Gu;Zhengang Zhao;Lei Shi;Yunhao Liu;Pengfei Hu;Yuepeng Wang;Yi Liang;Shuo Zhang;Yang Wang;Liusheng Huang	2013	2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6566746	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;mobile telephony;computer science;software design;reliability;packet loss;computer security;rural area;wireless;computer network;systems design	Embedded	3.9279156473199093	89.0012083502377	148914

However there is one significant drawback in existing CCN, which is that interest packets are broadcasted to all over the network. This may not only result in slow in delivery of data but it is also causing a lot of network traffics due to a large number of interest packets. For this reason, it is obviously not suitable in a large-scale network. To address the problem we propose a novel packet forwarding strategy using Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller and application. There mainly consists of two processes in CCN. One is for interest packets and the other is for data packets. In this paper, we show how the forwarding mechanisms for the two types of packets are operated under SDN-based CCN in order to improve the efficiency of content delivery and utility of network resources.	cyclomatic complexity;digital distribution;network packet;programming paradigm;software-defined networking	Jae Hyeok Son;DoHyeon Kim;Hyo Sung Kang;Choong Seon Hong	2016	2016 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427118	network packet;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;packet forwarding;computer network;out-of-order delivery	Networks	-3.322632085683363	91.01127073960022	149037

The main problem concerning IQ switches is scheduling the switching fabric in order to transfer packets from input ports to output ports. Scheduling is relatively easier when all packets are of the same size. However, in practice, packets are of variable length. In the current implementation of switches, variable length packets are segmented into fixed length packets--also knowns as cells--for the purpose of scheduling. However, such cell-based switching comes with some significant disadvantages: (a) loss of bandwidth due to the existence of incomplete cells; and (b) additional overhead of segmentation of packets and re-assembly of cells. This is a strong motivation to study packet-based scheduling, i.e., scheduling the transfer of packets without segmenting them.The problem of packet scheduling was first considered by Marsan et al. They showed that under any admissible Bernoulli IID (independent and identically distributed) arrival traffic, a simple modification of the Maximum Weight Matching (MWM) algorithm achieves 100% throughput. In this paper, we first show that no work-conserving (i.e., maximal) packet-based algorithm is stable for arbitrary admissible arrival processes. Thus, the results of Marsan et al. are strongly dependent on the arrival distribution. Next, we propose a new class of """"waiting"""" algorithms. We show that the """"waiting""""-MWM algorithm is stable for any admissible traffic using the fluid limit technique.We would like to note that the algorithms presented in this paper are distribution independent or universal. The algorithms and proof methods of this paper may be useful in the context of other scheduling problems."""	algorithm;bernoulli polynomials;cell relay;emoticon;matching (graph theory);maximal set;motif window manager;network packet;network switch;overhead (computing);packet switching;scheduling (computing);switched fabric;throughput	Yashar Ganjali;Abtin Keshavarzian;Devavrat Shah	2005	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2005.852884	independent and identically distributed random variables;fair-share scheduling;cell relay;job shop scheduling;real-time computing;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;distributed computing;queueing theory;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;packet switching;statistics;computer network	Metrics	0.3966893554524744	94.2075479285072	149238
2f4b333b25643bfb5497fa315b752c5640a3830b	distributed scheduling algorithms for crosspoint-buffered switches		Given the rapid increase in traffic, greater demands have been put on high-speed switching systems. Such systems have to simultaneously meet several constraints, e.g., high throughput, low delay and low complexity. This makes it challenging to design an efficient scheduling algorithm, and has consequently drawn considerable research interest. However, previous results either cannot provide a 100% throughput guarantee without a speedup, or require a complex centralized scheduler. In this paper, we design a distributed 100% throughput algorithm for crosspoint buffered switches, called DISQUO, with very limited message passing. We prove that DISQUO can achieve 100% throughput for any admissible Bernoulli traffic, with a low time complexity of O(1) per port. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first distributed algorithm that can provide a 100% throughput for a crosspoint buffered switch.	bernoulli polynomials;centralized computing;computational complexity theory;crossbar switch;distributed algorithm;electronic switching system;euler–bernoulli beam theory;message passing;network packet;network switch;queuing delay;scheduling (computing);simulation;speedup;systems design;throughput;time complexity	Shunyuan Ye;Yanming Shen;Shivendra S.

Based on previous work in this area [8], we search for an optimal combination of scheduler and drop strategy for different end-to-end streaming options including timestamp-based streaming and ahead-of-time streaming, both with variable initial playout delay. We will show that a performance gain versus the two best drop strategies in Liebl et al. [8], i.e. drop the HOL packet or drop the packet with the lowest priority starting from HOL, is possible: Provided that some basic side-information on the structure of the incoming video stream is available, a more sophisticated drop strategy removes packets from an HOL group of packets in such a way that the temporal dependencies usually present in video streams are not violated. This advanced buffer management scheme yields significant improvements for almost all investigated scheduling algorithms and streaming options. In addition, we will demonstrate the importance of fairness among users when selecting a suitable scheduler, especially if ahead-of-time streaming is to be applied: Given a reasonable initial playout delay at the streaming media client, both the overall achievable quality averaged over all users, as well as the individual quality of users with bad channel conditions can be increased significantly by trading off fairness with maximum throughput of the system.	ahead-of-time compilation;algorithm;end-to-end encryption;fairness measure;hol (proof assistant);maximum throughput scheduling;network packet;playout;scheduling (computing);streaming media	Günther Liebl;Hrvoje Jenkac;Thomas Stockhammer;Christian Buchner	2005	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-005-4328-x	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Metrics	2.2032828844412236	96.59264947884061	149385

The ATM multiplexor must convert native protocol frames on the access lines (typically hundreds of bytes in length) into ATM cells on the trunks (of fixed length 53 bytes) at the network access and the corresponding ATM (de)multiplexor must reassemble these multiple ATM cells into a bit continuous synchronous native protocol frame at the network egress. In one service discipline, the multiplexor (hereafter referred to as a terminal adaptor, or TA) pipelines one synchronous frame at a time onto the high speed trunk, waiting, if it needs to, for the successive ATM cells from this one synchronous frame to accumulate. This scheme introduces a larger queueing delay at the ingress TA but no playout delay is required at the egress TA. In the other scheme the TA interleaves the ATM cells from the various synchronous frames arriving concurrently over the low speed lines. An interleaving scheme has a smaller queueing delay, but introduces a large variability in the network insertion times of the ATM cells corresponding to a native protocol frame. Hence the egress TA must enforce a delay before playing out the original bit-synchronous native frame over a low speed line, so as to increase the probability that the ATM cells are available when required to properly reassemble the native synchronous frame into a bit continuous stream. Using an analytical model for the first scheme and a simulation model for the second scheme we analyze the end-to-end delay of a synchronous frame, and compare the mean end-to-end delay for various trunk speeds (TA-to-network switch) to “access” line speed ratios. We conclude that, for the cases studied in this paper, if this ratio is greater than or equal to 4 then, over the range of useful loading, interleaved pipelining typically yields smaller mean delays than noninterleaved pipelining. If the ratio is less than 4 then interleaving typically yields larger mean delays for native protocols due to increased playout delays at the egress TA.	atm turbo;access network;byte;egress filtering;end-to-end principle;erewhon;forward error correction;graphics pipeline;http pipelining;multiplexer;multiplexing;network switch;pipeline (computing);playout;queuing delay;simulation;spatial variability	Anurag Kumar;Robert G.

In this paper, an analytic study of the multiclass model is proposed by using the concept of virtual queue that we have presented [Comput. Commun., 23 (2000) 912] and a multi level aggregation technique. The arrival process in each buffer is assumed to be arbitrary, and possibly auto-correlated, stochastic process. By using the large deviation principle to study the buffers' congestion, we provide a lower upper bound on the buffers overflow probabilities. We also consider the problem of finding a most likely sample path that leads to an overflow control problem, and give some applications of these results in the traffic engineering of high-speed networks.

The most well-known fairness criterion (max-min fairness) gives priority to the minimum-rate session. Kelly questioned its appropriateness in his works on the bandwidth sharing among the end-to-end flows and proposed another fairness criterion preferring short-distance flows to enhance the overall throughput, which is called the proportional fairness (PF). A simple scheduler achieving this objective was introduced in wireless access networks and revealed that it can achieve a good compromise between cell throughput and user fairness. Although it has received much attention for some time, research on its performance mainly depended on computer simulations. In this paper, we analyze the PF scheduler to obtain the cell throughput, which is a primary-performance metric, and extend the result to analyze the capacity of multiple-input-multiple-output systems. We evaluate the effect of various parameters on the throughput of the PF scheduler through the numerical analysis	access network;algorithm;cell (microprocessor);computer simulation;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;kelly criterion;mimo;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;norm (social);numerical analysis;proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);throughput	Jin-Ghoo Choi;Saewoong Bahk	2007	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2006.889570	computer simulation;fairness measure;real-time computing;max-min fairness;telecommunications;numerical analysis;computer science;operating system;maximum throughput scheduling;scheduling;computer network	Networks	3.495943569732191	102.35347268676902	149610

High-priority packets are assumed to have a more restrictive delay requirement than low priority ones. For such a system, the authors propose a class of synchronous random-access algorithms which use a small portion of the channel capacity for the announcements of the existence of high- or low-priority packets. The stability and throughput-delay performances of the algorithms are determined analytically for the cases when one or two minislots are used. Representative performance results are given and compared with a similar algorithm which does not use minislots. The algorithms give a delay advantage to the high-priority packet class without adversely affecting the delays of the low-priority packets. The algorithms use binary C-NC (collision versus noncollision) feedback, and the maximum throughput is 0.487 when two minislots are used. >	profiling (computer programming);random access	Michael Paterakis;Yu Gong	1990		10.1109/INFCOM.1990.91298	communications protocol;von neumann stability analysis;real-time computing;stability;computer science;feedback;distributed computing;channel capacity;bandwidth;random access;packet switching;statistics;computer network;out-of-order delivery	Theory	5.802868292860696	94.64276633110026	149954

However, the delivery delay performance in such networks is still largely unknown by now. This paper studies the delivery delay performance in 3D MANETs, which adopts two hop relay scheme with packet redundancy for packet routing. In particular, we develop a general Markov chain model to depict packet delivery process under such a routing scheme. An analytical expression is further derived for delivery delay. Simulation and theoretical results are conducted to validate the accuracy of theoretical delivery delay analysis and to illustrate the impacts of network parameters on delivery delay performance in 3D MANETs.	computer simulation;hoc (programming language);markov chain;network packet;relay;routing	Wu Wang;Bin Yang;Osamu Takahashi;Xiaohong Jiang	2015	2015 Third International Symposium on Computing and Networking (CANDAR)	10.1109/CANDAR.2015.77	optimized link state routing protocol;routing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;transmission delay;computer network	Arch	2.6879368582629772	89.89132092599611	150082

The data queueing model is represented in the discrete-time domain with multiple servers and voice is given a higher priority than data. The data arrival process is assumed to be Poisson and the voice arrival process is characterized by a Markov chain. The correlation coefficient of the number of on voice calls between consecutive frames is used to measure the correlation behavior of the voice process. While the generating function approach may be used to analyze the queueing process, it involves the evaluation of a large number of boundary terms. On the assumption that the voice traffic consists of N i.i.d. two-state Markov chains, we derive a simple expression for the mean queue size as a function of two variables in the form of the traffic departure processes. The results clearly reveal a significant influence of the correlation coefficient on the data queueing process. Then, an approximate analysis based on the departure processes is introduced. The numerical and simulation results indicate that this approximate approach yields reasonably accurate results.	toad data modeler	San-Qi Li;Jon W. Mark	1985	IEEE Trans.

This packet reordering problem tends to induce spurious fast retransmissions and unnecessary reduction of the congestion window in the mSCTP vertical handover. To solve this problem, we propose a simple and novel scheme in which the correspondent node (CN) will retransmit the outstanding data chunks just before transmission of the newly generated data chunks over the new primary address. From the simulation results, we can see the proposed scheme could significantly improve the transmission performance during handover, compared with the existing mSCTP handover scheme, by avoiding spurious fast retransmission and unnecessary reduction of the congestion window.	discrepancy function;network congestion;network packet;network switch;retransmission (data networks);simulation;tcp congestion control	Dong Phil Kim;Seok Joo Koh;Victor C.

329a453ca5cc7b717a2e172e15045c6e8540b643	stochastic guarantees for rate-adaptive streaming		A major challenge in mobile video streaming applications is the variability of the wireless channel. Techniques like Apple's HLS and MPEG-DASH typically offer the video in chunks where each chunk is made available with different levels of quality and bitrate. Adaptive clients use estimates of the past network conditions to select the source bitrate of the next chunk accordingly. Frequently, this selection is based on the average performance and does not consider the variability of the channel. In this work, we present a method for bitrate adaptation that uses the distribution of the past throughput to provide statistical performance guarantees obtained by the stochastic network calculus. We show how to select the bitrate so that a certain, small probability of buffer underflow is not exceeded. Theoretical results are derived for the general case of an arbitrary throughput distribution. Numerical results are included for the example of a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we present simulation results that show the relevant performance metrics like average bitrate and buffer level of a system that adjusts its bitrate as suggested by our method. Generally, the method presented in this paper can achieve a bitrate that is close to the average available throughput with little variability of the source bitrate, while limiting the probability of buffer underflow to a predefined level.	arithmetic underflow;best, worst and average case;boulder dash;buffer overflow;high-level synthesis;maximal set;moving picture experts group;network calculus;queueing theory;simulation;spatial variability;stationary process;streaming media;throughput	Mark Akselrod;Markus Fidler;Ralf Lübben	2018	2018 30th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC 30)	10.1109/ITC30.2018.10056	real-time computing;throughput;network calculus;computer science;buffer underrun;limiting;gaussian;communication channel;average bitrate	Metrics	-4.481135269395331	101.25633080892919	150513

Although previous work pointed out such shortages are due to the limitation of radio propagation models in the simulators, it is still unclear how these imperfect models affect network behavior and to what degree. In this paper, we quantify network behavioral differences between simulations and real-world testbed experiments. We compare and analyze the experimental results from indoor and outdoor experiments with the results from NS-2 and Qualnet simulations. We find that in the PHY layer, the distribution of received signal strength in experiments is usually different from simulation due to the antenna diversity. However, path loss, which is regarded as a dominating factor in simulator channel modeling, can be configured to match the real-world behavior. For the MAC layer, increasing traffic load on a flow may cause significant performance degradation in experiments, but it is not the case in simulations. Interference is inadequately captured in simulations and cannot show the flow level unfairness phenomenon. In the network layer, a few dominant routes exist in testbed experiments while routes in simulations are less stable. These findings give the wireless research community an improved overview about the differences between simulations and testbed experiments. They will help researchers to choose between simulations and experiments according to their particular research requirements.	elegant degradation;embedded system;experiment;interference (communication);laptop;line-of-sight (missile);mesh networking;phy (chip);persistent data structure;requirement;routing;simulation;software propagation;testbed;transceiver;wireless mesh network	Kefeng Tan;Daniel Wu;An Chan;Prasant Mohapatra	2010	"""2010 IEEE International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534917	wireless mesh network;antenna diversity;telecommunications;computer science;path loss;radio propagation;traffic flow;signal-to-noise ratio;wireless;computer network	Mobile	3.7777099400086276	89.93848637774911	150542

More importantly, we must enforce available bandwidth fairness among nodes. Bandwidth sharing is fair if a node's available bandwidth is proportional to its forwarding contribution. In this paper, we achieve fair bandwidth sharing through a new packet scheduling algorithm, called cooperative queueing, on each node. In cooperative queueing, which is analogous to fair queueing, packet scheduling is based on a new abstraction that we call cooperation coefficient (CC). The CC quantifies how much a given node contributes to and consumes from the ad-hoc network; the larger the CC, the more bandwidth a node can obtain. We exploit the widely used dynamic source routing information to obtain the CC. We evaluate the effectiveness of cooperative queueing with different parameters and network configurations. We demonstrate that our algorithm is able to encourage cooperation and ensure fair sharing of bandwidth between nodes. We show that cooperative queueing is simple and has little overhead.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);coefficient;cooperative mimo;cooperative multitasking;fair queuing;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);network packet;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);source routing	Haijin Yan;David K.

Under the condition of heavy load, BS will take effective measure to guarantee QoS requirements of high priority traffics. In addition, the article introduces a statistical model to estimate system load, which is one of the features of the protocol. The simulation results fully indicate that the proposed random access protocol is efficient and reliable at conditions of both high and low load, and not only provides excellent transmission quality guarantee for higher priority traffics, but also supports lower priority traffics transmission efficiently in the integration traffic environment.	algorithm;load (computing);quality of service;random access;random-access memory;requirement;simulation;statistical model;throughput	Lei Sun;Youjun Gao;Hui Tian;Haibo Xu;Ping Zhang	2007	2007 IEEE 66th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2007.385	statistical model;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;priority ceiling protocol;random access;statistics;computer network	Embedded	4.806643424956684	97.49007011398535	150991

It allows handoff calls to (1) follow non-Poisson and/or non-stationary arrival processes, (2) have arbitrary resource demands, and (3) have arbitrarily distributed call and channel holding times in any cell. A statistical model, based on Wiener prediction theory, that uses only local information is developed. Our simulations show that it performs well under the above conditions as designed. Furthermore, for Poisson handoff call arrivals, identical per-call bandwidth demands and exponential call and channel holding times, it generates comparable performance with an existing method optimized only for these conditions.

For this purpose, we propose a novel switching architecture called a multiple input/output-queued (MIOQ) switch that requires no speedup for providing sufficient switching bandwidth. To operate an MIOQ switch in a practical manner, we also propose a multi-token-based arbiter which schedules the switch at a high operation rate and a virtual FIFO queueing scheme which guarantees the departure order of cells belonging to the same traffic flow at output. Additionally, we show that the proposed switch can naturally provide symmetric bandwidth for dealing with the links with different bandwidth demands. Finally, we compare the performance of an MIOQ switch with that of an output-queued switch and discuss the design criteria to match the performance of an output-queued switch.

In order to ensure that ongoing calls are not dropped while the owner mobile stations roam among cells, handoff calls may be admitted with a higher priority than newly generated calls. Predictive channel reservation (or pre-reservation) schemes allow the reservation of a channel for an ongoing call in an adjacent cell before its owner MS moves into that cell, so that the call is sustained when the MS moves into the adjacent cell. Pre-reservations are made when the MS is within some distance of the new cell boundary. This distance determines the area in which the MS can make channel reservations. In this paper, we study the effect of the pre-reservation area size on handoff performance in wireless cellular networks. Our studies show that if the reserved channels are strictly mapped to the MSs that made the corresponding reservations, as we increase the prereservation area size, the system performance (in terms of the probability that the handoff calls are dropped) improves initially. However, beyond a certain point, the performance begins to degrade due to a large number of false reservations. The optimal pre-reservation area size is closely related to the traffic load of the network and the MSs’ mobility pattern (moving speed). We provide an analytical formulation that furthers understanding with regard to the perceived behavior in onedimensional networks (in which all cells are along a line). With the objective of improving handoff performance and alleviating this sensitivity to the area size, we propose an adaptive channel pre-reservation scheme. Unlike prior pre-reservation methods, the key idea in our scheme is to send a channel pre-reservation request for a possible handoff call to a neighboring cell not only based on the position and orientation of the owner MS, but also as per its speed towards the target cell. The newly proposed scheme uses GPS measurements to determine when channel pre-reservation requests are to be made. Simulation results show that the adaptive channel pre-reservation scheme performs better in all typical scenarios than a previously proposed popular pre-reservation method that does not take mobility into account. 1389-1286/$ see front matter 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V. doi:10.1016/j.comnet.2006.06.007 * Corresponding author.

Inevitably, efficient resource allocation strategies have to exploit information laying in different OSI layers, allowing for a cross-layer design. In this work we evaluate current static resource allocation schemes (PHY layer) and extend them to incorporate MAC layer information. Furthermore, we enhance current schemes with SNR scheduling in time-domain, achieving near optimum system performance. The evaluation is based on our joint MAC-PHY layer system model. Scheme's performance is evaluated in terms of average throughput-delay through simulations.	algorithm;marginal model;network packet;osi model;phy (chip);scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system	Antonis G.

Resource  Managament in UMTS networks with the enhanced uplink has to consider the requirements of the dedidated channel users and the  enhanced uplink users on the shared resource, i.e. the cell load.

It uses several propagation models which are available for various networks such as ad hoc networks, cellular networks, etc. Path loss is the significant concept to design and investigate the efficient signal propagation mechanism. In this paper, we give the analysis results about signal variation concerning with path loss over the LTE network. The analysis is based on an analytical model which is the use of processor sharing queuing theory. The analysis mainly considers at non-Guaranteed Bit Rate (non-GBR) such as FTP or HTTP. This paper also presents the work on the investigation of some parameter settings of the analytical model. Finally, the analysis of signal variation concerned with analytical model will be proved by comparing with the simulation result.	compaq lte	Zin Mar Myo;Myat Thida Mon	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-23204-1_21	computer network	ML	4.708874454512606	95.55494356884937	151291

The objective of the algorithm is to help restart suspended streams as quickly as possible in cooperation with network administrators, mechanisms to change routes, etc. The algorithm handles traffic data of a number of streams all together to detect one or more suspended streams without using the information on the number of streams and on each stream's data rate. It works with the same parameter values for both LAN and WAN traffic streams, even if their packet interarrival-time distributions are different. Experiments with 41 live TV streams showed that suspension is detectable when the traffic rate decrease caused by the suspension is 1.6%.	algorithm;autocorrelation;computation;encapsulation (networking);encryption;experiment;network packet;object composition;sampling (signal processing);sensor;streaming media;time complexity;time series;uncompressed video	Kazumasa Oida	2009	IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management	10.1109/TNSM.2009.090305	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;time series;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-2.816877929147036	98.9289085002164	151385

In particular, it is important that the network does not commit to an additional service unless throughput and timeliness guarantees can be provided for both the new and existing connections. However, as both hardware changes and applications diversify, the forms of traac patterns and of guarantees are impossible to predict a priori. In this paper, we provide a general model of traac ows, and a schedulability test for a set of such ows on a packet-switched virtual-circuit xed-packet network, together with a set of rules designed to make evaluation of the schedulability conditions feasible and eecient. An experimental study is presented which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed rules and ooers recommendations for building actual networks. We also derive testing sets for some standard traac models and discuss issues of eecient implementation of the schedulability test.	commit (data management);experiment;network packet;packet switching;scheduling (computing);throughput;virtual circuit	Sergey Gorinsky;Sanjoy K.

The proposed MAC protocol provides proportional service differentiation to various classes of traffic based on their respective bandwidth demands. It exploits the spatial multiplexing and interference suppression capability of MIMO links in order to activate multiple links in the same collision domain. Simulation results show that the proposed MAC protocol achieves strict fairness in maintaining the proportional service differentiation among contending links. Then we introduce the concept of proportional fairness deviation which can be used as a tuning knob for assigning the leftover bandwidth to different traffic classes in proportion to their differentiation parameters. This tuning knob will adjust the quality of service assigned to users in a particular traffic class for a specific cost.	collision domain;control knob;differentiated service;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mimo;proportionally fair;provisioning;quality of service;simulation;spatial multiplexing;zero suppression	Amrit Kumar;Aura Ganz	2007	2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317912	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	8.261455621165988	93.07195649931495	151429

Many methods have been proposed by researchers is used to decision in handover only based on Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP). GM (1, N) can employ in two or more input data, thus process of handover not only consider RSRP but also Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ). In handover procedure, at least required two measurement reports, RSRP and RSRQ. By using both of them can guarantee the QoS of handover procedures. Due to the handover procedure in LTE belongs to a kind of hard Handover procedures, handover decision-making should be in early step, and then can get low failure rate. Therefore, we proposed Handover Decision-making Algorithm Based on Grey Model, GM (1, N). Via this method, signal received strength from eNodeB can be predicted the value for th-(n+1) measurement time, where the current measurement time is n. It can achieve better handover decision-making for in Long Term Evolution (LTE) for High Speed Railway.	algorithm;compaq lte;failure rate;hysteresis;quality of service	Hsing-Chung Chen;Yagus Cahyadi	2012	2012 Seventh International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2012.103	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;handover;lte advanced;operating system;computer network	EDA	7.954577563482909	98.33067555571793	151461

Our model of the problem is derived from a scheduling problem present in data over CATV networks, where a slotted TDMA channel is used to carry both real-time and best-effort traffic. Packets of real-time flows have high priority and are allocated in fixed, periodically located slots. Best-effort packets have lower priority and must therefore use the remaining slots. The scheduling problem tackles the assignment of variable size best-effort packets into the free slots which are left between successive allocation of real-time packets. One of the capabilities of the system is the ability to break a packet into several fragments. But, when a packet is fragmented, extra bits are added to the original packet to enable the reassembly of all the fragments. We transform the scheduling problem into a variant of bin packing where items may be fragmented. When an item is fragmented overhead units are added to the size of every fragment. The overhead associated with fragmentation renders the optimization problem NP-hard; therefore, an approximation algorithm is needed. We define a version of the well-known Next-Fit algorithm, capable of fragmenting items, and investigate its performance. We present both worst case and average case results and compare them to the case where fragmentation is not allowed.	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;best-effort delivery;bin packing problem;fork (software development);fragmentation (computing);mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network packet;optimization problem;overhead (computing);real-time clock;regular expression;rendering (computer graphics);scheduling (computing);segmentation and reassembly;set packing;time complexity;whole earth 'lectronic link	Nir Naaman;Raphael Rom	2002		10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019285	internet protocol;best-effort delivery;job shop scheduling;bin packing problem;real-time computing;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;cable modem;computer science;distributed computing;television;time division multiple access;packet switching;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;approximation theory	Theory	3.2110910179764165	94.00354666908872	151538

In this paper the HAWAII micro-mobility protocol is analyzed by means of an analytical model. A detailed description of the hando procedure is given and illustrated by means of traces obtained from simulation. Several of the system details are taken into account in the analytical model. This allows us to investigate the in uence of various system parameters (e.g. cell overlap area, beacon latency, forwarding bu er capacity, etc.) on the system performance for constant bit rate (UDP) traÆc.

Aggregation mechanisms need to address two main performance concerns. Naive aggregation schemes can wait to aggregate until enough data for pre-decided aggregated frame lengths is available, which can result in delay penalties due to variations in traffic type or load levels. The second possible performance side effect is that the increase in the aggregated frame length may result in an increased packet error rate in noisy environments. Adaptive aggregation methods have previously been proposed to deal with the above problems independently. In this study, a backlogged queue (BQ) aggregation approach is proposed that considers both these aspects, and also ensures inter-operability with other WLAN devices that are not capable of frame aggregation. The length of the backlogged queue is used as an indicator for delay-optimal framing, and, using modeling, the study shows that it is always beneficial to perform BQ frame aggregation up to the wireless MTU even in the presence of noise. Performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm on the ORBIT testbed shows throughput improvements of up to 56% in the presence of channel noise and 25% in scenarios with high contention over using a simple 802.11e based TxOP. An experimental case study shows improvement in FTP file transfer times of up to 11% while preserving performance for real-time traffic.		Gautam D.

7eb80e7287bf01ed3eafd3825c290edcf80a2ba1	micro-burst in data centers: observations, implications, and applications		Micro-burst traffic is not uncommon in data centers. It can cause packet dropping, which results in serious performance degradation (e.g., Incast problem). However, current solutions that attempt to suppress micro-burst traffic are extrinsic and ad hoc, since they lack the comprehensive and essential understanding of micro-burst’s root cause and dynamic behavior. On the other hand, traditional studies focus on traffic burstiness in a single flow, while in data centers micro-burst traffic could occur with highly fan-in communication pattern, and its dynamic behavior is still unclear. To this end, in this paper we re-examine the micro-burst traffic in typical data center scenarios. We find that evolution of micro-burst is determined by both TCP’s self-clocking mechanism and bottleneck link. Besides, dynamic behaviors of micro-burst under various scenarios can all be described by the slope of queue length increasing. Our observations also implicate that conventional solutions like absorbing and pacing are ineffective to mitigate micro-burst traffic. Instead, senders need to slow down as soon as possible. Inspired by the findings and insights from experimental observations, we propose S-ECN policy, which is an ECN marking policy leveraging the slope of queue length increasing. Transport protocols utilizing S-ECN policy can suppress the sharp queue length increment by over 50%, and reduce the 99 percentile of query completion time by ∼20%.	bottleneck (network);clock rate;data center;elegant degradation;explicit congestion notification;fan-in;hoc (programming language);item unique identification;micro isv;network packet;self-clocking signal	Danfeng Shan;Fengyuan Ren;Peng Cheng;Ran Shu	2016	CoRR		real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer network	Metrics	-4.303860732835748	92.96274533607499	151902

In this paper, we first propose a continuous-based adaptive rate control mechanism, which employs, logically, an infinite number of thresholds. Each node periodically determines the precise permitted rate of immediate upstream nodes based on a simple fluid model aimed at satisfying both loss-free and starvation-free criteria. The scheme, as will be shown, achieves high utilization and low (zero) cellloss probability under highly bursty (deterministic) traffic, but at the expense of a drastic increase in signalling overhead due to frequent adjustment of permitted rates. To reduce overhead, we further propose a so-called stepwise-based rate control mechanism adopting a limited number of movable thresholds, referred to as the threshold set. The threshold set shifts up (down) reflecting the increase (decrease) in departure rates. Compared to continuous-based control via simulation, stepwise-based control is shown to be efficient and accurate using a reasonably low number of thresholds. Moreover, we also display simulation results, which demonstrate that the stepwise-based mechanism outperforms existing single-static-threshold-based schemes in terms of cell-loss probability and link utilization.	atm turbo;control system;network congestion;overhead (computing);simulation;stepwise regression	Pau-Chuan Ting;Maria C.

Channel reservation schemes are used to give high priority to more important soft handoff attempts over new call attempts. However, since the number of soft handoff attempts varies according to environmental conditions, fixed reservation schemes for handoff attempts can be inefficient. An adaptive channel reservation scheme is herein proposed to control the size of reservation capacity according to varying the number of soft handoff attempts. The proposed scheme also includes a balancing procedure between soft handoff failure and new call blocking to maximize the system capacity. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, a Markovian model is developed that considers the interference-limited capacity effect of DS-CDMA systems. Analytical result shows that the proposed scheme yields a considerable enhancement in terms of new call blocking and soft handoff failure probabilities when compared with the conventional fixed channel reservation scheme.	blocking (computing);channel capacity;interference (communication);seamless3d	Jin Weon Chang;Dan Keun Sung	2001	IEEE Trans.

bf7aefb74a21fa8e52f9a3164caf56903348a56d	analysis of the random direction mobility model with a sense-and-avoid protocol		Random mobility models (RMMs) capture the random movement patterns of mobile agents, and have been widely used in the evaluation and design of mobile networks. Existing RMMs (e.g. random walk and random direction) assume every mobile agent to move independently. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs), on the other hand, need to maintain a separation distance for the safety of the airspace, and hence their mobility patterns violate the independent movement assumption of existing RMMs. In this paper, for the first time in the literature per knowledge of authors, we enhance the Random Direction RMM through equipping it with a commonly used decentralized sense and avoid protocol-- sense-and-stop (S&S). We provide analytical results on critical networking statistics such as stationary node distribution and inter-vehicle distance distribution in a two-dimensional (2-D) space using the Markov type of analysis. The analysis and simulation studies lead to interesting insights such as that the commonly used S&S protocol is not effective when the randomness of UAV mobility is high, as it increases the probability for a UAS to stay within the collision distance.	aerial photography;markov chain;mobile agent;randomness;simulation;stationary process;usb attached scsi;unmanned aerial vehicle	Mushuang Liu;Yan Wan;Frank L.

As a result, rate-adaptation for wireless multicast has not been considered either. In this paper, a novel rate-adaptive Medium Access Control protocol is proposed to allow dynamic rate-adaptation for wireless multicast transmission over MANETs by utilizing the orthogonality of the subcarriers in an Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing system. In the proposed rate-adaptation method, each member station is assigned a unique subcarrier and by using this subcarrier, its preferred data rate in the current channel condition is reported to the multicast source. Due to their orthogonality, the feedbacked packets simultaneously transmitted by the group members can be distinguished at the source. Therefore, the source chooses the most appropriate data rate for all member stations. By using this method, the data rate for wireless multicast is able to be adaptively changed, so that the overall network performance is improved.	algorithm;carpal tunnel syndrome;data rate units;hoc (programming language);multicast;multiplexing;network packet;network performance;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);subcarrier;uncompressed video;unicast	Sung Won Kim;Byung-Seo Kim	2011	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-009-9839-4	multicast;mobile ad hoc network;ip multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;network performance;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Mobile	8.173860466978248	91.02054673385788	152458

They have presented convincing evidence that the traffic exhibits self-similarity in nature. Generating self-similar traffic traces is increasingly important to research on characterization of self-similar processes and their impacts on network performance. However, self-similar traffic traces are difficult to be generated due to their long-range dependence. No matter fractional Gaussian noise model or fractional autoregressive integrated motion average model suffers from that computation efforts, they are proportional to the length of the traces that we want to generate. In this paper, we propose two new trace-generating schemes, whose computation efforts are independent of the length of the trace: autoregressive Gaussian processes with trends and autoregressive Gaussian processes with aggregations. The results show that it is effective to generate the long-range dependence with these two schemes. The autocorrelations and queuing performance of traces generated from these two approaches are close to those of the empirical trace.	autoregressive model;gaussian process;self-similarity	Jung-Shian Li	2002	Computer Communications	10.1016/S0140-3664(01)00432-7	self-similarity;computer science;machine learning;star model;gaussian process;autoregressive model;network performance;self-similar process;nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model;statistics	ML	-2.1753305240226526	99.45641833895118	152741

Our long-term goal is to develop a unified mathematical model. This paper is a first step towards this ambitious goal. The most widespread models for network QoS are network calculus and queueing theory. While the strength of queueing theory is its proven applicability to a wide area of problems, Network calculus can offer performance guarantees. We analyse by simulation the benefit of bringing the two of them together, i.e., bounding the stochastic processes of a queue with methods from network calculus. A basic result from network calculus is that enforcing traffic shaping and service curves bounds the buffer. This leads to denying buffer states in queues with infinite buffer. Specifically, we analyse what happens with the probability mass of such buffer states. Finally, we discuss how our results can be used for dimensioning buffers for multiplexed traffic.	mathematical model;multiplexing;network calculus;noise shaping;quality of service;queueing theory;simulation;stochastic process;traffic shaping	Krishna Pandit;Jens B.

Facing the challenge, several algorithms have been proposed. Two good representatives are the Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) framework defined by ETSI and LIMERIC, a linear control algorithm. Both algorithms control message transmission rate as a function of channel load (i.e., channel busy percentage, CBP). In this work, DCC is assumed to be deployed for day one applications and LIMERIC is introduced into the network afterwards. Given such a mixed vehicular network with vehicles running either DCC or LIMERIC, we evaluate the performance of the two algorithms in the mixed scenario and study the impact of such mixed network operation on the performance through ns-2 simulations. It is observed that converting some CAM-DCC vehicles to LIMERIC vehicles will not lead to any significant performance degradation of either CAM-DCC or LIMERIC vehicles. Any observed performance degradation is small enough so that we would expect typical DSRC applications to still be feasible. Performance differences between DCC and LIMERIC exist but they can be reduced through careful selection of the specific parameters of LIMERIC and DCC, respectively.	algorithm;bit error rate;coexist (image);control system;day one;elegant degradation;function overloading;hoc (programming language);lookup table;network congestion;network packet;openbsm;performance evaluation;simulation;vii	Bin Cheng;Ali Rostami;Marco Gruteser;John B.

We first tackle the issue of stability for networks with arbitrary topologies. We prove that the max-min fair RCP fluid model is globally stable in the absence of propagation delays, and also derive a set of conditions for local stability when arbitrary heterogeneous propagation delays are present. The network delay stability result assumes that, at equilibrium, there is only one bottleneck link along each route. Lastly, in the simpler setting of a single link, single delay model, we investigate the impact of the loss of local stability via a Hopf bifurcation.	bifurcation theory;bottleneck (network);hopf bifurcation;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;propagation delay;software propagation	Thomas Voice;Gaurav Raina	2009	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2009.2022115	communications protocol;propagation delay;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;systems modeling;max-min fairness;stability;bicarbonate buffering system;resource management;control theory;feedback;mathematics;distributed computing;equity;network delay;network topology;hopf bifurcation;smoothing	Networks	-1.2367569433192642	102.35157677889705	152817

5237969b13ec9f89964e73ca10466444c831604a	a handoff algorithm of dynamic decisions with extenics for wireless cellular networks	wireless cellular network	A traditional handoff algorithm always adopts stationary channel preservation schemes that cause the increase of call blocking probability (CBP) and the decrease of system utilization to reduce the call dropping probability (CDP) for handoff call. In this paper, the extension theory is introduced and applied to the handoff algorithm for participating handoff decisions and channel preservation. The mobile can perform handoff by predicting user mobility in advance based on extension-based derivation. By using the simple extension-based derivation, the required channels can be reserved for handoff call beforehand, and the required quality of service (QoS) is preserved during handoff occurring. Furthermore, both the QoS issue and the efficiency of channel allocation are considered simultaneously for the proposed algorithm. The extension and accumulation concepts are combined for reducing the number of guard channels in the proposed scheme, so the CBP does not reduce too much and the utilization of channel is more efficiency.	algorithm	Chen-Feng Wu	2010	J.

363c2963c7acbeac708d28293de238eb1d060015	tfrc friendliness and the case of ecn	ecn;tcp;congestion control;fairness index;tcp friendly	The TFRC protocol has been proposed as a TCP-friendly protocol to transport streaming media over the Internet. However, its deployment is still questionable because it has not been compared to other important protocols, analysed in the presence of important mechanisms, such as the explicit congestion notification (ECN), and studied under more realistic network conditions. In this paper, we address these three aspects, including other congestion control protocols not considered before in the same investigation, such as TCP Tahoe, Reno, Newreno, Vegas, Sack, GAIMD, and the Binomial algorithms, the effect of using ECN in the friendliness of the protocols, and the fairness of the protocols under static and dynamic network conditions. We found that TFRC can be safely deployed in the Internet if competing with TCP Tahoe, New Reno and SACK since fairness is achieved under all scenarios considered. We also found that ECN actually helps in achieving better fairness. However, fairness problems arise when TFRC competes with TCP Reno, GAIMD, SQRT or IIAD in static or dynamic conditions, or both. We used normalized throughput, fairness index, and convergence time as the main performance metrics for comparison.

It has been suggested that this dependence is so strong as to be well-modeled by long-range dependent processes. The fact that no finite process can be said to be truly long-range dependent poses potentially serious obstacles to simulation modeling. In this paper, we explore some of these obstacles and propose practical methods for obtaining useful results with simulations of manageable duration.	network packet;network traffic control;simulation	Robert Geist;James Westall	2000			traffic generation model;gaussian noise;stochastic process;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;simulation modeling;distributed computing;packet switching;statistics;network traffic simulation	HPC	-1.060698041657251	98.97426151948318	153322

A group of consecutive packets forms a frame (or a message) and one then considers not only the quality of service of a single packet but also that of the whole message. In order to improve required quality of service, either on the frame loss probabilities or on the delay, discarding mechanisms have to be used. We analyze in this paper the performance of the Early Message Discard (EMD) policy at the buffer, which consists of (1) rejecting an entire message if upon the arrival of the first packet of the message, the buffer occupancy exceeds a threshold , and (2) if a packet is lost, then all subsequent arrivals that belong to the same message are discarded.	network packet;quality of service	Parijat Dube;Eitan Altman	2002		10.1109/ICC.2002.997279	stochastic process;real-time computing;index term;quality of service;poisson process;telecommunications;bulk queue;computer science;probability;layered queueing network;queueing theory;packet switching;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-0.2709040727737777	97.61899660476026	153576

AP selection is a crucial issue because the performance achieved by a user heavily depends on the AP selected. A received signal strength (RSS)-based association mechanism is specified by the IEEE 802.11 standard. However, this does not consider the channel conditions and AP load, which leads to a low throughput and a low user transmission rate. An alternative to using the RSS is to exploit the airtime metric, which provides users with information on how busy the channel is, but the results of our simulations show that the airtime metric cannot indicate the exact status of the channel. In this paper, we present a new association framework using channel occupancy in order to provide users with exact channel status information of APs. Via the proposed scheme, users can compare the achievable throughput provided by each AP and select the best AP. We validate our proposed association method via simulation results, which show that the throughput improvement of the method is worthy of notice.	airtime;load testing;rss;simulation;throughput;user agent	Byunghyuk Jung;Wonjun Lee;Sangheon Pack;Dingzhu Du	2009	2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449783	atmospheric model;throughput;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;measurement;computer network	Mobile	7.871416966901356	96.33879073689829	153594
1a362522eafb75a7957b59c181d7641fcfa5d430	adaptive two-level frame aggregation for fairness and efficiency in ieee 802.11n wireless lans		This paper deals with the problem of performance degradation in wireless local area networks (WLANs) based on IEEE 802.11n. When a wireless channel is shared by heterogeneous stations that have different data rates and packet sizes, each station occupies a different amount of airtime because the basic channel access mechanism of WLAN was originally designed to provide fair chance of channel access, regardless of packet size and data rate. This leads to the degradation of overall network throughput and airtime fairness among stations, which is known as performance anomaly. To resolve this problem, we firstly formulate an optimization problem for a generalized two-level frame aggregation whose objective is to maximize the achievable throughput under the constraint of airtime fairness. Then, we propose a frame size adaptation scheme that controls the number of packets in an aggregated frame. The proposed scheme is fully compatible with the IEEE 802.11 standard and works in a distributed manner, which neither modifies the channel access mechanism nor resorts to a centralized scheduling algorithm. The extensive simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme tightly regulates the airtime usage of each station to be almost the same and significantly improves the overall network throughput compared to other existing schemes.	aggregate data;airtime;algorithm;anomaly detection;centralized computing;computational complexity theory;data rate units;effective method;elegant degradation;fairness measure;high-level programming language;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimization problem;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Minho Kim;Eun-Chan Park;Chong-Ho Choi	2015	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2015/548109	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;maximum throughput scheduling;computer network	Mobile	7.459993384787017	92.76305332740175	153601

In order to solve the issues, a multicode-reception spread-spectrum (MCR-SS)-CSMA/CA scheme is proposed as multiple access scheme for layered-tree networks. This scheme is further improved by adding a time group access (TGA) technique to gain higher interference reduction between nodes. The proposed TGA scheme divides the layered-tree network into upper subnets group and lower subnets group, thus reducing collision probability among subnets. Network throughput and data delivery ratio for the proposed scheme are analyzed by simulations based on the IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee specification. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can improve packet delivery ratio and network throughput remarkably.	hoc (programming language);memory card reader;throughput;tree network	Naoto Kobatake;Yasushi Yamao	2013	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/s11235-011-9596-z	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;spread spectrum;computer network	Mobile	7.953348555815453	90.51839412765526	153634

Encapsulation efficiency is improved by deferring transmissions based on the estimation of packet inter-arrival times and by performing early discarding of packets for which delay violations are anticipated. The scheme supports both real-time and non-real-time traffic types.

72681b7a0b189233bb530228838f4c260dec6851	scheduling mix-flows in commodity datacenters with karuna	datacenter networks;deadline;flow scheduling	Cloud applications generate a mix of flows with and without deadlines. Scheduling such mix-flows is a key challenge; our experiments show that trivially combining existing schemes for deadline/non-deadline flows is problematic. For example, prioritizing deadline flows hurts flow completion time (FCT) for non-deadline flows, with minor improvement for deadline miss rate.  We present Karuna, a first systematic solution for scheduling mix-flows. Our key insight is that deadline flows should meet their deadlines while minimally impacting the FCT of non-deadline flows. To achieve this goal, we design a novel Minimal-impact Congestion control Protocol (MCP) that handles deadline flows with as little bandwidth as possible. For non-deadline flows, we extend an existing FCT minimization scheme to schedule flows with known and unknown sizes. Karuna requires no switch modifications and is back- ward compatible with legacy TCP/IP stacks. Our testbed experiments and simulations show that Karuna effectively schedules mix-flows, for example, reducing the 95th percentile FCT of non-deadline flows by up to 47.78% at high load compared to pFabric, while maintaining low (<5.8%) deadline miss rate.	experiment;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;internet protocol suite;network congestion;non-deterministic turing machine;non-functional requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;testbed	Li Chen;Kai Chen;Wei Bai;Mohammad Alizadeh	2016		10.1145/2934872.2934888	real-time computing;earliest deadline first scheduling;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-2.6872849135684778	93.53756496759607	153717

However, DRX in connected mode has not been optimized for real time applications such as Mobile TV and Video on Demand (VoD) which require strict latency and QoS uarantees. This paper presents a novel mechanism, La VoLTE, based on time series prediction and enhanced eNodeB architecture to determine DRX opportunities during video streaming over Real Time Protocol (RTP) in a TDD-LTE network without compromising the QoS. Through extensive simulations, it is found that the proposed mechanism can result in 30-80 percent power saving over the video transmission duration depending on video data for different video quality and bandwidth requirements.	access network;compaq lte;discontinuous reception;encapsulated postscript;linear algebra;mobile television;multi-user;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;streaming media;test-driven development;time series;uncompressed video;www	Ritesh Kumar Kalle;Amar Kumar Nandan;Debabrata Das	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240102	communications protocol;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;time series;mathematics;statistics;computer network	Mobile	5.815564439866696	97.14740799333451	153741

The mechanism is built upon hierarchical user nodes priorities and service classes priorities. And it uses a dynamic bandwidth algorithm to maximize the bandwidth allocation efficiently at the base station. In this paper, we use average polling delay and scheduling efficiency as the performance measurements. Our simulation is performed for comparisons of the proposed CAC mechanism with a conventional bandwidth-based CAC. The simulation results show that our CAC algorithm guarantees that the average polling delay is smaller and the scheduling efficiency is higher when we comparison it with the conventional bandwidth-based CAC.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);common access card;dynamic problem (algorithms);fairness measure;scheduling (computing);simulation	Luo Sida;Zisu Li	2008	2008 IEEE Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application	10.1109/PACIIA.2008.107	wimax;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;base station;operating system;scheduling;bandwidth;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Embedded	4.27371190086588	97.13588099170492	153754

The scheme provides worst case guarantee on the drop probability of higher priority classes. In existing literature, there are very few contributions that support efficient absolute QoS guarantee in OBS networks, which is critical for burst drop sensitive applications. The service differentiation among each priority class in VCR is achieved by applying the concepts of virtual channel reservation and pre-emption, rather than by implementing optical buffer or extra offset time. Pre-emption in OBS literature often means the discard of a scheduled burst or a burst in service. One potential side effect of pre-emption, however, is bandwidth under utilization in multi-node scenarios. To address this problem, we also contribute a new informing header (i-header) mechanism. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of VCR, both with and without i-headers. Results show that VCR without i-headers is able to meet the absolute QoS requirements in both single-node and multi-node scenarios. In addition, the introduction of i-header effectively reduces downstream bandwidth wastage caused by pre-emption in the multi-node scenario. The contribution of VCR and i-header are significant for the following practical reasons. First, VCR does not use optical buffers or extra offset time to achieve service differentiation; hence long end-to-end delay problems will not arise. Second, VCR conforms theoretically to the Conservation Law; hence as far as overall drop probability is concerned, VCR will outperform other QoS techniques like Guard Channel (GC) and JET QoS schemes. The last statement will be verified both theoretically and by the many simulation scenarios presented in the paper.	optical burst switching;quality of service;virtual channel	Xin Guan;Ian Li-Jin Thng;Yuming Jiang;Hailong Li	2005	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2004.11.002	internet protocol;practical reason;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;end-to-end delay;computer security;service quality;conservation law;side effect;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Networks	0.49665562210753933	101.50240245615184	153832

The analysis follows a network calculus approach where traffic is characterized by envelope functions and service is described by service curves. A key contribution of this paper is the derivation of a probabilistic sample path bound for heavy-tailed self-similar arrival processes, which is enabled by a suitable envelope characterization, referred to as htss envelope. We derive a heavy-tailed service curve for an entire network path when the service at each node on the path is characterized by heavy-tailed service curves. We obtain backlog and delay bounds for traffic that is characterized by an htss envelope and receives service given by a heavy-tailed service curve. The derived performance bounds are non-asymptotic in that they do not assume a steady-state, large buffer, or many sources regime. We also explore the scale of growth of delays as a function of the length of the path. The appendix contains an analysis for self-similar traffic with a Gaussian tail distribution.

However, wireless losses may be misinterpreted as congestive losses and induce spurious backoffs. In this paper, we raise the basic question: Can AQM maintain a stable, small backlog under wireless losses? We find that the representative AQM, random early detection (RED), fails to maintain a stable backlog under time-varying wireless losses. We find that the key to resolving the problem is to robustly track the backlog to a preset reference level, and apply the control-theoretic vehicle, internal model principle, to realize such tracking. We further devise the integral controller (IC) as an embodiment of the principle. Our simulation results show that IC is robust against time-varying wireless losses under various network scenarios.	active queue management;algorithm;network congestion;onset (audio);random early detection;router (computing);simulation;theory	Chengdi Lai;Ka-Cheong Leung;Victor O.

This paper describes a robust video transmission system over wireless LAN utilizing layered and prioritized transmission mechanisms. Specifically, a single layer coded video is first organized into multiple layers of different importance. The different layers are then packetized and transmitted with different priorities to ensure that vital video information is sent with higher priority while the rest (enhancement layer(s)) are sent with only best effort. Realtime streaming tests show that our streaming system can effectively minimize the video quality degradation under channel throughput variation.	best-effort delivery;elegant degradation;mpeg-2;network packet;quality of service;software deployment;throughput	Yingwei Chen;Carles Ruiz Floriach;Jong Chul Ye;Kiran S.

This paper describes the development and implementation of a split-functionality architecture for a contention-based carrier sensing MAC, in which some of the functions reside on an field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and others reside in the GPP. We provide an FPGA-based implementation of a carrier sensing block and develop two versions of a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) MAC protocol based upon this block. We experimentally test the performance of the resulting protocols in a multihop environment in terms of end-to-end throughput and required frame retransmissions. We cross-validate these results with a network simulator with modules modified to reflect the mean and variance of delays measured in components of the real software-defined radio system.	access control;complex network;computation;etsi satellite digital radio;embedded system;end-to-end principle;experiment;experimental system;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;graph partition;network topology;radio frequency;random access;signal processing;simulation;throughput;universal software radio peripheral;windows metafile;xojo	Paolo Di Francesco;Séamas McGettrick;Uchenna K.

Synchronized nodes follow a Frequency-Time Division Multiple Access (FTDMA) schedule, but even using channel-hopping to mitigate interference, the radio links suffer packet losses. Resource allocation algorithms must consider the requirements of the applications in terms of delivery and allocate extra resource to compensate for anticipated losses. We propose a hop-by-hop allocation mechanism that extends the Traffic-Aware Scheduling Algorithm (TASA) by enabling retransmissions. We give each flow on the network the possibility to satisfy its applicative end-to-end delivery constraint. We keep the amount of resource allocated for retransmissions low, and balance the allocations on the relay nodes. By means of simulations, we show the gain in terms of reliability, and the cost in terms of number of allocations.	algorithm;applicative programming language;end-to-end principle;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hop-by-hop transport;interference (communication);internet of things;memory management;network packet;parameter (computer programming);provisioning;quality of service;relay;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation	Guillaume Gaillard;Dominique Barthel;Fabrice Theoleyre;Fabrice Valois	2016	2016 IEEE 27th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794839	real-time computing;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;operating system;reliability;distributed computing;scheduling;internet of things;computer network	Embedded	6.2144335298774065	91.7834740960377	154677

In CR networks, spectrum access should not interfere the colocate incumbent networks. Due to the requirement above, common control channel approaches, which are widely used in traditional multichannel environments, may face serious CR long-time blocking problem and control channel saturation problem. Although channel-hopping-based approaches can avoid these two problems, existing works still have significant drawbacks including long time-to-rendezvous, unbalance channel loading, and low channel utilization. In this paper, we introduce three channel-hopping approaches, RCCH, ARCH, and SARCH for synchronous and asynchronous environments, respectively. Compared with previous works, our schemes outperform the state of the art in terms of these metrics.	blocking (computing);cognitive radio;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;mean time to repair;regular expression;throughput	Guey-Yun Chang;Wen-Hung Teng;Hao-Yu Chen;Jang-Ping Sheu	2014	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2012.260	wireless ad hoc network;cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;sensor;operating system;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	9.121400058069	90.70349657023158	154700

We also explore algorithms to implement the various intrinsic features of the FRR scheme. Linear predictive filter (LPF)-based methods are investigated and demonstrated to be effective for dynamic burst-length prediction. An aggressive resource reservation algorithm is proposed to deliver a significant performance improvement with controllable bandwidth cost. By reserving resources in an aggressive manner, an FRR system can reduce both the signaling retransmission probability and the bandwidth wastage as compared with a system without the aggressive reservation. An FRR-based QoS strategy is also proposed to achieve burst delay differentiation for different classes of traffic. Theoretical analysis and simulation results verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithms and show that our FRR scheme yields a significant delay reduction for time-critical traffic without incurring a deleterious bandwidth overhead.	algorithm;burst transmission;optical burst switching;overhead (computing);provisioning;quality of service;retransmission (data networks);simulation;window of opportunity	Jingxuan Liu;Nirwan Ansari;Teunis J.

The goal of these schemes is to provide tight QoScon trol on a per connection basis by means of measurements taken by the edge nodes and priority based forwarding procedure at internal nodes. Since the additional flows handling procedures are implemented at the border routers and the forwarding mechanisms are for flows aggregates only, the approach is fully scalable and compatible with the IETF Differentiated Service proposal. The aim of this paper is to propose specific schemes and to investigate the advantages and limits of the approach by analyzing the basic mechanisms and evaluating its performance. As a results, the paper shows that end-to-end measurements taken over a low priority probing packet stream is an effective and robust way to guarantee bandwidth and delay for real-time services characterized by fast traffic dynamics, such as Voice over IP.	internet protocol suite;real-time transcription	Giuseppe Bianchi;Flaminio Borgonovo;Antonio Capone;Luigi Fratta;Chiara Petrioli	2001		10.1007/3-540-44554-4_26	real-time computing;the internet;telecommunications;differentiated service;computer science;voice over ip;telephony;service quality;bandwidth;computer network	Embedded	-3.3338047821599526	96.84820166288468	154887

However they have to deal with a lack of bandwidth which prevents the deployment of applications with strict constraints (e.g. VoIP, streaming video, etc.). To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel WMN model which integrates a bandwidth-based admission control scheme with an efficient transmission scheduling algorithm. The proposed admission control is based on an accurate new method to calculate link's bandwidth considering link's length and on a transmissions scheduling algorithm which favors parallel transmission, thus optimizing network's bandwidth.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);fairness measure;interference (communication);internet access;last mile;network topology;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment;streaming media;throughput;wireless mesh network	Juliette Dromard;Rida Khatoun;Lyes Khoukhi	2013	2013 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2013.268	fair-share scheduling;bandwidth throttling;switched mesh;bandwidth management;real-time computing;the internet;quality of service;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation;broadband networks	Mobile	-1.8853252560127363	95.23664266242919	155039

This study shows that delays much smaller than the deterministic bound can be guaranteed with probabilities close to one. An admission control derived from these results is then proposed, providing a probabilistic QoS guarantee to EF flows.	best, worst and average case;differentiated services;earliest deadline first scheduling;end-to-end principle;entity framework;fifo (computing and electronics);mathematical model;multiprotocol label switching;network packet;quality of service;real-time clock;response time (technology);scheduling (computing)	Leïla Azouz Saïdane;Pascale Minet;Steven Martin;Inès El Korbi	2005	13th IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems	10.1109/MASCOT.2005.26	real-time computing;computer science;computer security;computer network	Embedded	-0.2880006241061394	95.55238204850995	155078

72f5c435ec3ac2cd7c2e3d1d6edb8df82e446d17	an irregularly slotted ring scheme for contention-free optical burst switching	optical burst switching;ring network;contention free;obs	Optical burst switching (OBS) is a promising way to efficiently use the massive bandwidth in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks. However, the problem of contention between bursts is hard to be solved in OBS networks with general topology. For that reason, the conception of contention-free OBS ring is proposed. In recent years, several OBS ring schemes have been designed. According to the number of transceivers installed at each node, the schemes can be roughly divided into two classes: single-transceiver schemes and multi-transceivers schemes. Among which, multi-transceivers schemes are more efficient than single-transceiver ones. There are two existing multi-transceivers schemes, LightRing and SWING, yet both of them have disadvantages. The LightRing scheme has a high queuing delay and needs large buffers, while the SWING scheme not only needs a large number of fiber delay lines but also has a specific requirement to the girth of the ring. In this paper, we design another multi-transceivers OBS ring scheme named irregularly slotted OBS ring (IS-OBS-Ring). In the IS-OBS-Ring scheme, all data wavelengths are slotted and slots on different wavelengths are not synchronously but irregularly distributed. Simulation results show that the performance of IS-OBS-Ring is further better than the LightRing scheme and similar to the SWING scheme. However, the IS-OBS-Ring scheme can overcome the disadvantages of both the LightRing scheme and the SWING scheme.

A model of the WCDMA access control algorithm was developed and used to investigate network performance under jamming and various loading conditions. Jamming effectiveness was found to become less predictable as the load was increased. Increased loading levels were also found to generally increase the range to target at which jamming occurs. The viability of utilizing high-speed, constant bit rate, circuit-switched data calls as surrogates for multiple low-rate voice calls in a test environment was investigated. High-speed, circuit-switched data calls were determined to be a poor surrogate for multiple low-rate voice calls.	access control;algorithm;broadcast television systems inc.;circuit switching;deployment environment;kerrison predictor;logistic regression;network performance;radio frequency;radio jamming;simulation;spatial variability;surrogates;telecommunications link;zero suppression	Benjamin A.

DCF operates with binary exponential backoff (BEB) in order to avoid frame collisions. However it may waste wireless resources because collisions occur when multiple stations are contending for frame transmissions. In order to solve this problem, a binary negative-exponential backoff (BNEB) algorithm has been proposed that uses the maximum contention window size whenever a collision occurs. However, when the number of contending stations is small, the performance of BNEB is degraded due to the unnecessarily long backoff time. In this paper, we propose the adaptive BNEB (A-BNEB) algorithm to maximize the throughput regardless of the number of contending stations. A-BNEB estimates the number of contending stations and uses this value to adjust the maximum contention window size. Simulation results show that A-BNEB significantly improves the performance of IEEE 802.11 DCF and can maintain a high throughput irrespective of the number of contending stations.	algorithm;exponential backoff	Bum-Gon Choi;Jae Hyun Lee;Min Young Chung	2010	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2010.10.011	ieee 802.11;real-time computing;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;exponential backoff;computer network	Vision	7.698603533570865	92.68887150321217	155509

The IEEE 802.16 standard defines the specification for Metropolitan Area Networks. However, it does not define the scheduling schemes for different service classes. In this paper, we propose an uplink scheduling scheme called Adaptive Deficit Priority Queue (ADPQ) for IEEE 802.16 networks. ADPQ is based on one QoS parameter called Maximum Latency defined for Real-Time Polling Service (rtPS) in the standard. Our proposed scheme improves the transmission quality of rtPS by decreasing the transmission delay of rtPS packets and enhancing the throughput for rtPS in IEEE 802.16 networks. In addition, our scheme avoids the starvation of lower priority service classes due to the protection of rtPS. Our simulation results show that ADPQ reduces the delay and improves the throughput of rtPS and avoids the starvation of lower priority service classes compared with other scheduling schemes.	interrupt latency;priority queue;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput	Chia-Yu Yu;Sherali Zeadally;Naveen K.

The basic control mechanism uses rate-based control, closely resembling the one specified by the ATM Forum for the Available Bit Rate (ABR) service category. Fuzzy logic is utilised in the network elements to enhance the required control decisions with the general aim of fair and optimal utilisation of the available bandwidth. The control protocol adapts to the changes of the load produced by CBR and VBR connections, and shares the available capacity of the network fairly between ABR connections. Simulations have been carried out to test the performance of the control system in the presence of several VBR and ABR connections with statistical traffic distributions and with varying buffer sizes of the network elements. Results of the tests show the adaptability and efficiency of the control system.	control system;fuzzy concept;mathematical optimization;network congestion	Jarmo Harju;Kimmo Pulakka	1999		10.1109/PCCC.1999.749438	fuzzy logic;communications protocol;real-time computing;adaptability;optimal control;computer science;control system;asynchronous transfer mode;network congestion;system testing;transport layer;bandwidth;computer network	Robotics	-3.389677476952991	96.03261406862545	155550

To better serve these two classes of applications, the DSRC standard divides the bandwidth into seven channels. One channel, called control channel (CCH) to serve safety applications and the other six channels, called service channels (SCHs) to serve non-safety applications. The DSRC standard specifies a channel switching scheme to allow vehicles to alternate between these two classes of application. The standard also recommends that vehicles should visit the CCH every 100ms, called Synchronization Interval (SI), to send and receive their status messages. It is highly desirable that these status messages be delivered to the neighbouring vehicles reliably and within an acceptable delay bound. It is obvious that increasing the time share of the CCH from the SI will increase the reliability of safety applications. In this paper, we will optimize the control channel access such that safety applications have a high successful transmission rate within their share of the SI interval. Moreover, a new algorithm, called Optimal Channel Access (OCA), will be introduced to enhance the performance of the DSRC while keeping the CCH I as small as possible. Hence non-safety applications will have a fair share of the DSRC bandwidth.	algorithm;coexist (image);delay-gradient congestion control;hoc (programming language);marker (telecommunications);simulation;window function	Khalid Abdel Hafeez;Alagan Anpalagan;Lian Zhao	2014	2014 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2014.7063643	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;dedicated short-range communications;reliability;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	6.501603129093887	90.32855830572316	155591

The mandatory certification implies a worst-case delay analysis of all the flows transmitted on the AFDX network. Up to now, this analysis is done thanks to a tool based on the Network Calculus approach. This existing approach considers that all the flows transmitted on the network are asynchronous and it does not take into account the scheduling of output flows done by each end system. The main contribution of this paper is to extend the existing Network Calculus approach by introducing the offsets associated to the different periodic flows into the computation. The resulting approach is evaluated on an industrial AFDX configuration with an existing offset assignment algorithm. The obtained upper bounds are significantly reduced.	algorithm;applicative programming language;asynchronous i/o;avionics full-duplex switched ethernet;best, worst and average case;computation;duplex (telecommunications);end system;end-to-end principle;network calculus;scheduling (computing)	Xiaoting Li;Jean-Luc Scharbarg;Christian Fraboul	2010	2010 IEEE 15th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA 2010)	10.1109/ETFA.2010.5641178	local area network;avionics;frequency modulation;embedded system;job shop scheduling;benchmark;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;operating system;end-to-end delay;upper and lower bounds;scheduling;computer network	Embedded	1.6770045164366176	94.49593744720092	155883

We show that, in addition to loss rates, temporal characteristics of losses can also be estimated. Knowledge of temporal loss characteristics has applications for services such as voip which are sensitive to loss bursts, as well as for bottleneck detection. Under the assumption of mutually independent, but otherwise general, link loss processes, we show that probabilities of arbitrary loss patterns, mean loss-run length, and even the loss-run distribution, can be recovered for each link. Alternative estimators are presented which trade-off efficiency of data use against implementation complexity. A second contribution is a novel method of reducing the computational complexity of estimation which can also be used by existing minc estimators. We analyse estimator performance using a combination of theory and simulation.	computation;computational complexity theory;end-to-end principle;intranet;marginal model;multicast;network congestion;run-length encoding;simulation;tomography;tree (data structure);tree rearrangement;zipf's law	Vijay Arya;Nick G.

Studies prove that the mobility pattern followed have a strong impact on performance metrics (i.e., handoff (HO) rate, cell residence time). Recently, some key aspects of the Random Waypoint mobility model have been studied in depth, but relating those studies with different cellular layouts has not been reported. Interest in forecasting the cell to which a device may be handed off depending on the movement pattern is twofold. First, it gives insight into properties and statistics of the mobility model. Second, and from a more practical perspective, it is useful to manage resource allocation and reservation strategies in order to smooth the HO process. The goal of this article is to provide an analytical framework for these predictions in a simple layout. Given a node’s current location and the timestamp and location of the last waypoint, an approximation for HO during time Δt is derived. The analysis is provided along with numerical examples and simulations for a symmetrical layout and uniform speed distribution. Results shed light on how useful more advanced strategies can be.

Our models take into account sub-band selection and the case of sub-band combining. Our numerical evaluations consider specifically the European ISM band, but the analysis is applicable to any coherent band. Protocol simulations are used to validate the proposed models. We find that sub-band selection and combining have a large effect on the quality of service (QoS) experienced in an LoRaWAN cell for a given load. The proposed models allow for the optimization of resource allocation within a cell given a set of QoS requirements and a traffic model.	canonical account;coherence (physics);duty cycle;implicit shape model;mathematical optimization;noise shaping;numerical analysis;quality of service;requirement;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;time complexity;traffic shaping	Ren&#x00E9; Brandborg S&#x00F8;rensen;Dong Min Kim;Jimmy Jessen Nielsen;Petar Popovski	2017	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2017.2716932	throughput;quality of service;collision;computer network;latency (engineering);telecommunications link;cycling;real-time computing;resource allocation;computer science;wide area network	Embedded	3.6931369576467703	97.12395538359027	156144

In this paper, we propose a novel handshaking-based MAC protocol, called as sender and receiver concurrent reservation (SRCR) protocol, for multi-hop UASNs. The key idea of the proposed protocol is to adopt a concurrent reservation mechanism to allow the sender's neighbors and the receiver's neighbors to transmit packets during the communication between the sender and the receiver without collision. Simulation results have confirmed that the proposed protocol can offer good performance of both throughput and delay in multi-hop UASNs with high channel utilization.	access control;acoustic cryptanalysis;handshaking;propagation delay;simulation;software propagation;throughput	Jin Yang;Peng Guo;Tao Jiang;Kui Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363852	underwater acoustic communication;wireless ad hoc network;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	8.676375592175601	90.21616922847849	156170

Bufferbloat is now (almost?) everywhere. Today's routers, switches, gateways, broad-band gear, and so on have bloated buffer sizes to where we often measure latency in seconds, rather than microseconds or milliseconds. Telephone standards for maximum desirable latencies are in the 150–200 ms range, and human perception for some latency is as low as 10 ms. You can never get that time back. Any unnecessary latency beyond the minimum imposed by the speed of light is too much. Although some buffering is required to smooth bursts in communications systems, we've lost sight of fundamentals: packet loss is (currently the only) way to signal congestion in the network, and congestion-avoiding protocols such as TCP rely on timely congestion notication to regulate their transmission speeds.

This technique integrates the centralization approach of cluster management and the universal way of forwarding data, where the farthest vehicle forwards data in an effort to maximize the opportunity of advanced notification. This method leverages contention-free and contention-based MAC, to support the different requirements of safety and non-safety messages. Inter-cluster interference avoidance is also supported. The analysis and simulation show that using this scheme, for inter-cluster communications, provides an early notification compared to other existing clustering methods.	algorithm;ch c/c++ interpreter;cluster analysis;cluster manager;interference (communication);requirement;simulation	Zaydoun Yahya Rawashdeh;Syed Masud Mahmud	2008	2008 IEEE 68th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2008.448	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;communications protocol;media;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;interference;computer security;computer network	EDA	6.97356803231379	89.77338726697431	156227

Based on CR, the unlicensed users will utilize the unused spectrum of the licensed users in an opportunistic manner. Therefore, the average spectrum usage will be increased. However, the sudden appearance of the licensed users forces the unlicensed user to vacate its operating channel and handoff to another free one. Spectrum handoff is one of the main challenges in cognitive ad hoc networks. In this paper, we aim to reduce the effect of consecutive spectrum handoff for cognitive ad hoc users. To achieve that, the licensed channels will be used as operating channels and the unlicensed channels will be used as backup channels when the primary user appears. Therefore, the number of spectrum handoff will be reduced, since unlicensed bands are primary user free bands. A Markov chain model is presented to evaluate the proposed scheme. Performance metrics such as blocking probability and dropping probabilities are obtained. The results show that the proposed scheme reduces all the aforementioned performance metrics.	hoc (programming language)	Mohamed Abd rabou Kalil;Hassan Al-Mahdi;Andreas Mitschele-Thiel	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02205-0_2	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;markov chain;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;mathematics;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	7.341648091215382	91.0340474640978	156302

For current aircrafts, it implements a FIFO scheduling policy and allows the transmission of sporadic flows between avionics functions distributed on a set of end systems. The certification imposes to guarantee that the end-to-end delay of any frame transmitted on the network is upper-bounded and that no frame is lost due to buffer overflow. This guarantee is obtained thanks to a worst-case analysis which is based on either network calculus or trajectory approach. However it leads to an over-dimensioning of the network. For future aircraft, it is envisioned to use a Fixed Priority scheduling policy in order to better use network resources (QoS AFDX). Existing AFDX switches implement two priority levels. A worst-case analysis of such a network exists, based on the Trajectory approach. Thus, the remaining issue is to assign efficiently the available priorities to the flows. The contribution of this paper deals with this issue. It proposes to assign the priorities to the flows using the well-know Optimal Priority Assignment algorithm (OPA) which was first defined for monoprocessor preemptive systems. The proposed solution is applied on two case studies. The overall worst-case delay is reduced by 30 % on a small configuration and 20 % on a realistic one.	algorithm;avionics full-duplex switched ethernet;best, worst and average case;buffer overflow;computation;duplex (telecommunications);end-to-end principle;fifo (computing and electronics);fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;network calculus;network switch;opa;quality of service;scheduling (computing);von luschan's chromatic scale;whole earth 'lectronic link	Tasnim Hamza;Jean-Luc Scharbarg;Christian Fraboul	2014	2014 10th IEEE Workshop on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS 2014)	10.1109/WFCS.2014.6837580	embedded system;real-time computing;engineering;deadline-monotonic scheduling;computer network	Embedded	1.7312877136237896	94.52544997421144	156372

We demonstrate that the root cause of these problems is that existing techniques are unable to maintain self-clocking or to achieve accurate and rapid packet loss notification. We present cutting payload (CP), a mechanism that simply drops a packet’s payload at an overloaded switch, and a SACK-like precise ACK (PACK) mechanism to accurately inform senders about lost packets. Experiments demonstrate that CP successfully addresses the root cause of TCP performance issues. Furthermore, CP works well with other TCP variants used in data center networks.	acknowledgement (data networks);clock rate;data center;network packet;outcast;self-clocking signal	Peng Cheng;Fengyuan Ren;Ran Shu;Chuang Lin	2014			radio link protocol;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp sequence prediction attack;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Networks	-3.626506706289646	92.56679229811198	156783
a5107f057d21838ee9bf7197719edf0dd13dc25d	buffer management in opportunistic networking		Opportunistic Networks are a powerful tool for deploying a class of delay tolerant network applications in zones with scarce communications infrastructure. Unfortunately, these networks are highly stochastic and very sensible to changes in the nodes movement patters, as well as to changes in the data-flow patterns. On the other hand, opportunistic algorithms, while conceptually simple, are highly configurable and plastic but, for the same reason, many examples of such networks are notoriously hard to model and simulate. Thus, the algorithm's calibration is a challenging task. In this paper, we show how a combination of a synthetic mobility pattern, combined with simulation and a careful implementation permits to identify potentially disruptive behaviors and find solutions. In particular we show how a quite probable mobility pattern (i.e., data-carrying nodes converging to a data receiver simultaneously) has very bad performance when using a wide family of buffer management policies, FIFO among them. Furthermore, we propose and test an alternative buffer management policy which shows very encouraging results.	algorithm;dataflow;delay-tolerant networking;fifo (computing and electronics);simulation;synthetic intelligence	Jorge Visca;Matias Richart;Juan Saavedra;Javier Baliosian;Eduardo Grampín	2014		10.1145/2684083.2684085	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;operations management	Metrics	-1.7206522794757175	90.13068648076575	156806

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel loss recovery approach fast multi-path loss recovery FUSO that exploits multi-path diversity in DCN for transport loss recovery. In FUSO, when a multi-path transport sender suspects loss on one sub-flow, recovery packets are immediately sent over another sub-flow that is not or less lossy and has spare congestion window slots. FUSO is fast in that it does not need to wait for timeout on the lossy sub-flow, and it is cautious in that it does not violate the congestion control algorithm. Testbed experiments and simulations show that FUSO decreases the latency-sensitive flows’ $99^{th}$ percentile FCT by up to ~82.3% in a 1-Gb/s testbed, and up to ~87.9% in a 10 Gb/s large-scale simulated network.	algorithm;data center;dynamic circuit network;experiment;gigabyte;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;lossy compression;network congestion;network packet;optical switch;powerbuilder foundation classes;remote direct memory access;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;tcp congestion control;testbed	Guo Wei Chen;Yuanwei Lu;Yuan X Meng;Bojie Li;Kun Tan;Dan Pei;Peng Cheng;Layong Luo;Yongqiang Xiong;Xiaoliang Wang;Youjian Zhao	2018	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2018.2830414	lossy compression;computer network;path loss;packet loss;computer science;timeout;network packet;testbed;network congestion;data center	Networks	-3.511411273196088	92.51777041218006	156861

However, traditional utility functions cannot support attributes that affect the resource allocation, such as mobility or more advanced traffic models. Especially in the context of a heterogeneous wireless network, transient parameters can have varying effects on each access network type. This work proposes a new utility function that can support multiple design requirements for mobile networks including advanced traffic models, user classes, handover and session priorities. We integrate the new utility function with the Super Base Station framework and devise a novel trigger-based network and resource assignment framework that efficiently copes with the complexity of a heterogeneous wireless network. Our simulation results show that the proposed sub-optimal trigger-based framework performs equally well as the complex optimal scheme.	access network;centralisation;mathematical optimization;network utility;requirement;scalability;simulation;systems design	Ilias Tsompanidis;Ahmed H.

a43ba6f306b28e94641b864623856db8e249bca7	multi-hop lora networks enabled by concurrent transmission		In this paper, we strive to construct an efficient multi-hop network based on the sub-GHz low-power wide-area technology. Specifically, we investigate the combination of LoRa, a physical-layer standard that can provide several-kilometer outdoor coverage, and concurrent transmission (CT), a recently proposed multi-hop protocol that can significantly improve the network efficiency. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) Since the CT enhances the network efficiency by allowing synchronized packet collisions, the performance of the physical-layer receiver under such packet collisions needs to be carefully examined to ensure the network reliability. We first extensively evaluate the LoRa receiver performance under CT to verify that LoRa is compatible to CT. Specifically, we find that, due to the time-domain and frequency-domain energy spreading effect, LoRa is robust to the packet collisions resulting from CT. 2) We further find the receiver performance under CT can be further improved by introducing timing offsets between the relaying packets. In view of this, we propose a timing delay insertion method, the offset-CT method, that adds random timing delay before the packets while preventing the timing offset from diverging over the multi-hop network. 3) We conduct proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of CT-based LoRa multi-hop network and the performance improvement brought by the proposed offset-CT method.	experiment;hop;low-power broadcasting;network packet	Chun-Hao Liao;Guibing Zhu;Daiki Kuwabara;Makoto Suzuki;Hiroyuki Morikawa	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2755858	computer network;spread spectrum;hop (networking);reliability (computer networking);computer science;performance improvement;real-time computing;offset (computer science);network packet;frequency-shift keying;transmission (mechanics)	Mobile	9.271464320060888	88.72690134737728	157024

Exchanging information among the vehicles is imperative due to the ever-changing network topology in vehicular networks. However, random transmitter selection in traditional CSMA based channel access mechanism limits the delay performance. Data, such as state information, is often time critical, and hence, efficient information dissemination techniques to improve delay performance are essential. In this work, we aim to minimize the average system age which is the mean number of time slots old a vehicle’s information is at all other vehicles in the network. To achieve this, we explore the benefits of simultaneous transmission along with piggybacking of information for multi-hop communication. While allowing simultaneous transmission guarantees faster dissemination of information, piggybacking facilitates dissemination of more information per transmission, thereby keeping the network more updated. We have also analysed the relationship between piggybacked information and number of vehicles in the network. Simulation results show improvement in network performance. Our analytical results are in good agreement with the simulation results.	algorithm;heuristic;hoc (programming language);imperative programming;network performance;network topology;piggybacking (security);round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation;system information (windows);transmitter	Moumita Patra;Anik Sengupta;Chebiyyam Siva Ram Murthy	2016	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-015-1056-3	piggybacking;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;computer security;computer network	Mobile	7.445238454994482	90.61969520397928	157031
a3ab99e9f2ce6e389410368827921b24a3d7c62d	adaptively scaled back-off (asb) mechanism for enhanced performance of csma/ca in ieee 802.11ax high efficiency wlan		This paper proposes an adaptively scaled back-off (ASB) mechanism to mitigate the performance degradations in the Binary Exponential Back-off (BEB) of IEEE 802.11 CSMA/CA in the highly dense environment such as IEEE 802.11ax high efficiency WLAN (HEW). The proposed ASB mechanism selects the optimal CW size to achieve maximized network performance adaptively based on the measured conditional collision probability (pc) and the estimated number of contending stations. The ASB protocol can provide higher efficiency than the legacy Binary Exponential Back-off (BEB) that simply adjust the back-off contention window (CW) size by blind exponential increase at repeated collision avoidance and resetting to the minimum value (CWmin) at successful transmission. The performance analysis of the proposed ASB scheme with ns-3 network simulation shows that the proposed ASB scheme can achieve 21.14% higher throughput and take 32.45% less average interval between successful transmissions than the BEB mechanism in highly dense WLANs with saturated traffic environment.1	fairness measure;image scaling;network congestion;network performance;simulation;steady state;tcp congestion control;throughput;time complexity;window function	Nurullah Shahin;Rashid Ali;Sung Won Kim;Young-Tak Kim	2018	NOMS 2018 - 2018 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium	10.1109/NOMS.2018.8406219	throughput;computer network;computer science;collision;ieee 802.11ax;carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;network simulation;network performance	Mobile	7.1183971317613715	92.86172844417366	157189

One of the key issue is how to account for the characteristics of the time-varying wireless channel and for the impact of link-layer error control in the provisioning of packet-level QoS. In this paper, we accommodate both aspects in analyzing the packet loss performance over a wireless link. We consider the cases of a single and multiplexed traac streams. The link capacity uctuates according to a uid version of Gilbert-Elliot channel model. Traac sources are mod-eled as on-oo uid processes. For the single-stream case, we derive the exact packet loss rate (PLR) due to buuer overrow at the sender side of the wireless link. We also obtain a closed-form approximation for the corresponding wireless eeective bandwidth. In the case of multiplexed streams, we obtain a good approximation for the PLR using the Chernoo-Dominant Eigenvalue (CDE) approach. Our analysis is then used to study the optimal FEC code rate that guarantees a given PLR while minimizing the allocated bandwidth. Numerical results and simulations are used to verify the adequacy of our analysis and to study the impact of error control on the allocation of bandwidth for guaranteed packet loss performance.	approximation;channel (communications);code rate;error detection and correction;forward error correction;gilbert cell;mod database;multiplexing;network packet;numerical linear algebra;provisioning;public lending right;quality of service;simulation;user interface design	Jeong Geun Kim;Marwan Krunz	2000	IEEE/ACM Trans.

In this paper, we study the limitations of existing call admission control (CAC) algorithms for voice and data traffic having different delay tolerances. We propose an efficient hierarchical access control scheme to administer call admission as well as channel access at the slot level by exploiting disparity present in delay tolerances of voice and data users. Compared to the existing CAC algorithms, the proposed scheme improves the channel utilization by 5%-20%, depending on the packet arriving rates, for traffic with single packet delay tolerance.	access control;approximation algorithm;binocular disparity;channel capacity;common access card;network packet;quality of service;throughput	Zhihui Chen;Ashfaq A.

The communication channel witnesses significant network load generated by frequently exchanged beacons. Under high-density situations, it leads to a serious scalability problem in VANETs. Moreover, contention-based medium access control (MAC) protocols suffer from a great number of packet collisions, and as a result, the reliability and latency of safety messages are severely affected. Because of the periodic nature of beacons, time-division multiple access (TDMA) can be a good choice over contention-based MAC. In this paper, we propose congestion-controlled-coordinator-based MAC (CCC-MAC), which is a time-slot-based medium access protocol that addresses beacons and emergency messages. Basically, the network is virtually partitioned into a number of segments. Within a segment, medium access is accomplished by using a time-slot-scheduling mechanism supervised by a local coordinator vehicle. A significant number of vehicles can be supported under the proposed configuration. In fact, the proposed scheduling mitigates channel congestion by reducing the transmission time of beacons through the use of multiple data rates. Bandwidth utilization is also improved by reusing the unoccupied time slots. Finally, CCC-MAC ensures fast and reliable propagation of emergency messages by employing a pulse-based reservation mechanism. In the simulations, we demonstrate the ability of CCC-MAC to scale well in different vehicular density scenarios. Moreover, it outperforms existing MAC-layer protocols with respect to packet reception probability and latency of safety messages.	access control;channel (communications);hoc (programming language);network congestion;network packet;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;software propagation	Jagruti Sahoo;Eric Hsiao-Kuang Wu;Pratap Kumar Sahu;Mario Gerla	2013	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2013.2264320	vehicular ad hoc network;media access control;telecommunications;computer science;dedicated short-range communications;probability;scheduling;computer security;time division multiple access;statistics;computer network	Mobile	6.47067309834913	88.69029750532897	157714

According to the IEEE 802.11 standard, the multicast service is defined as an unreliable service, that is, it does not include the use of ACK frames. Furthermore, different to the unicast service, the multicast service makes use of a single rate out of the various rates included in the basic service set defined by the IEEE 802.11 standard. Even though various proposals have recently appeared in the literature addressing these issues, none of them has come out with a structured set of control mechanisms taking into account the varying conditions characterising the wireless channels as well as the requirements of various applications. A novel cross-layer auto rate selection multicast mechanism for multi-rate wireless LANs, namely auto rate selection for multicast, capable of adapting the data transmission to the varying conditions of the channel and taking into account the characteristics of various applications, is introduced. The simulation results show that our proposal outperforms the IEEE 802.11 standard and the mechanisms recently proposed in the literature.	acknowledgement (data networks);control system;multicast;programming paradigm;requirement;simulation;transmitter;unicast	Jose Miguel Villalón Millán;Pedro Cuenca;Luis Orozco-Barbosa;Yongho Seok;Thierry Turletti	2007	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com:20060249	multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;addressing mode;reliable multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;computer security;xcast;computer network;multicast address;data transmission	Mobile	2.301858596906257	102.56001795619545	157775

The essence of this behavior can be captured by several classes of stochastic processes. The M/G/infin process plays a key role for this purpose. In addition to its theoretical simplicity, it has been successfully used to model widely different traffic sources. In this letter, we obtain the parametric form of the spectral density of an M/G/infin-based process, able to model both the long-term and the short-term correlation behavior of traffic, and we check the robustness of the Whittle estimator taking this process as the underlying one.	autocorrelation;computational complexity theory;converge;queueing theory;simulation;spectral density;stochastic process	Maria Estrella Sousa Vieira;A.

WiMAX employs a contention based method with exponential backoff to facilitate multiple access. A two-dimensional Markov chain can be used to accurately model the backoff procedure. From this we derived expressions for channel access probability, access delay, system throughput and resource usage. The accuracy of the model and its results are validated by simulations carried out on an IEEE 802.16d simulator. Constraints and limitations of the model are also discussed. Insight from this model can be used to optimize bandwidth usage and channel partitioning.	access control;best-effort delivery;exponential backoff;markov chain;simulation;throughput;time complexity	Shehan Perera;Harsha Sirisena	2007	2007 Fourth International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems (BROADNETS '07)	10.1109/BROADNETS.2007.4550482	wimax;best-effort delivery;job shop scheduling;markov chain;throughput;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;base station;exponential backoff;bandwidth;computer network	EDA	3.97536223991018	97.48189717057441	158214

Packet errors are modeled by a two-state Markov chain, and batch packet arrivals are allowed. Packets are dropped at the sender if their delays exceed a time limit, possibly after a number of retransmissions. Using the delay-model approach, a closed-form expression of packet-loss probability (PLP) and an approximate formula of wireless effective bandwidth (WEB) satisfying the quality of service requirements have been derived. If Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquengem codes are used, an expression estimating the number of correctable bits to minimize the PLP has also been obtained. Moreover, the WEB is found to be independent of the packet size, and the PLP decreases exponentially as the WEB increases.	hybrid automatic repeat request	Kelvin K. Lee;Samuel T.

In particular, a significant impact on data network performance has been shown in several papers. Congested Internet situations, where TCP/IP buffers start to fill, show long-range dependent (LRD) self-similar chaotic behaviour. The exponential growth of the number of servers, as well as the number of users, causes the performance of the Internet to be problematic since the LRD traffic has a significant impact on the buffer requirements. The Internet is a large-scale, wide-area network for which the importance of measurement and analysis of traffic is vital. The intensity of the long-range dependence (LRD) of communications network traffic can be measured using the Hurst parameter. A variety of techniques (such as R/S analysis, aggregated variance-time analysis, periodogram analysis, Whittle estimator, Higuchi's method, wavelet-based estimator, absolute moment method, etc.) exist for estimating Hurst exponent but the accuracy of the estimation is still a complicated and controversial issue. Earlier research (Rezaul et al., 2006) introduced a novel estimator called the Hurst exponent from the autocorrelation function (HEAF) and it was shown why lag 2 in HEAF (i.e. HEAF (2)) is considered when estimating LRD of network traffic. HEAF estimates H by a process which is simple, quick and reliable. In this research we extend these concepts by introducing a novel algorithm for controlling the long-range dependence of network traffic, named CoLoRaDe which is shown to reduce the LRD of packet sequences at the router buffer.	algorithm;autocorrelation;chaos theory;hurst exponent;internet protocol suite;network packet;network performance;network traffic control;requirement;router (computing);self-similarity;server (computing);spectral density estimation;telecommunications network;time complexity;wavelet	Karim Mohammed Rezaul;Vic Grout	2007	Sixth International Conference on Networking (ICN'07)	10.1109/ICN.2007.29	long-range dependency;telecommunications;computer science;hurst exponent;computer security;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-2.4297851767667717	99.13409569364502	158233

While any shortest-path algorit hm can be used to select a feasible path, additional constraints th at limit resource consumption and balance the network load are neede d to achieve efficient resource utilization. We present a syst ema ic evaluation of four routing algorithms that offer different tradeoffs between limiting the path hop count and balancing the networ k load. Our evaluation considers not only the call blocking ra te but also the fairness to requests for different bandwidths, rob ustness to inaccurate routing information, and sensitivity to the r outing information update frequency. It evaluates not only the per formance of these algorithms for the sessions with bandwidth guarant ees, but also their impact on the lower priority best-effort sess ion . Our results show that a routing algorithm that gives prefere nc to limiting the hop count performs better when the network load is heavy, while an algorithm that gives preference to balancin g the network load performs slightly better when the network load is light. We also show that the performance of using pre-comput ed paths with a few discrete bandwidth requests is comparable t o that of computing paths on-demand, which implies the feasibility o f classbased routing. We observe that the routing information upda te interval can be set reasonably large to reduce routing overh ead without sacrificing the overall performance, although an in creased number of sessions can be misrouted.	algorithmic efficiency;bandwidth (signal processing);best-effort delivery;blocking (computing);dijkstra's algorithm;dynamic problem (algorithms);fairness measure;network performance;network topology;re-order buffer;requirement;routing;shortest path problem;simulation;verse protocol;widest path problem	Qingming Ma;Peter Steenkiste	1997		10.1109/ICNP.1997.643714	routing table;routing domain;routing;static routing;real-time computing;zone routing protocol;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;resource management;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;geographic routing;routing information protocol;computer network	Networks	-1.8577842612940891	94.84778243923992	158530

There are several reasons, the main one being the lack of a scalable, simple, fast and low cost QoS solution. A new QoS-framework, called resource management in differentiated services (RMD), aims to correct this situation. This framework has been published in recent papers and is extending the IETF differentiated services (diffserv) architecture with new admission control and resource reservation concepts in a scalable way. This paper focuses on proposing and investigating two resource reservation solutions on the problem of severe congestion situation within a diffserv-aware network utilizing an admission control scheme called Resource Mananagement in Diffserv (RMD). The different severe congestion solutions are compared using extensive simulation experiments.	differentiated services;network congestion	András Császár;Attila Takács;Róbert Szabó;Vlora Rexhepi;Georgios Karagiannis	2002		10.1007/3-540-47906-6_35	the internet;quality of service;differentiated service;resource allocation;computer science;access control;resource management;computer security;service quality;computer network	HPC	0.3102055040209256	101.96302855912182	158596

In particular, TCP interprets packet loss as a signal of congestion. However there are many new non-cooperative protocols in use which attempt to exploit the network aggressively and do not reduce their demands when the network signals congestion. We propose the aggregate control of ‘‘fluxes” defined by policies at individual routers. Each router can then calculate an optimal allocation of bandwidth to each flux contending for a given output link. We propose a combined hill climbing and convex programming method for this optimization, which we call HCCP. HCCP is designed to punish greedy fluxes rather than just regulating them: such fluxes may find their bandwidth allocation reduced to zero if they are sufficiently aggressive. Our results show that HCCP is effective at regulating a wide range of rather generally characterized transport protocols. We explore the use of both throughput maximization and proportionally fair allocation and recommend the latter because the former often leads to the situation where one or more fluxes receive zero bandwidth. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The moment at which a user should switch from the current network to another where better resources can be provided is still a hot research topic. This work studies a new criterion for triggering the vertical handoff process. The suggested criterion is a collective one where the received signal strength (RSS), the available bandwidth and the type of running applications are all combined together to obtain a better decision. The goodness of the decision is measured against two metrics: the Wrong Decision Probability (WDP) and the Missing Handoff Probability (MHP). In this paper, we study three algorithms for handover using RUNE simulator where a detailed cellular wireless network is built under realistic channel and mobility assumptions. The simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach.	algorithm;network architecture;performance evaluation;rss;requirement;seamless3d;simulation	Uthman A. Baroudi;Faisal A.

Among them, the tight- coupled WLAN/UMTS architectures promise seamless service continuity to users and enhanced network performance. Most of these solutions assume that only one interface is active at a time, while much fewer consider the concurrent use of both WLAN and UMTS interfaces as this is expected to consume more energy. This paper presents a detailed description of power consumption for the two different tight-coupled WLAN/UMTS approaches based on the states of the wireless devices. A simple analytical model is provided for estimating the power consumption in each approach, while a simulation model measures the power needs for more complicated cases. Moreover, the enhancement due to a power-saving mechanism in WLAN is also assumed in the system and useful deductions are provided about the average power consumption per mobile terminal.	file allocation table;mobile phone;network performance;overhead (computing);scott continuity;seamless3d;simulation	George Lampropoulos;Alexandros Kaloxylos;Nikos I.

6efb9e6aae76fb88dc6cac5d78947488126d6a1c	optimizing service differentiation scheme with sized-based queue management in diffserv networks		In this paper we introduced Modified Sized-based Queue Management as a dropping scheme that aims to fairly prioritize and allocate more service to VoIP traffic over bulk data like FTP as the former one usually has small packet size with less impact to the network congestion. In the same time, we want to guarantee that this prioritization is fair enough for both traffic types. On the other hand we study the total link delay over the congestive link with the attempt to alleviate this congestion as much as possible at the by function of early congestion notification. Our M-SQM scheme has been evaluated with NS2 experiments to measure the packets received from both and total link-delay for different traffic. The performance evaluation results of M-SQM have been validated and graphically compared with the performance of other three legacy AQMs (RED, RIO, and PI). It is depicted that our M-SQM outperformed these AQMs in providing QoS level of service differentiation.	differentiated service;differentiated services;experiment;explicit congestion notification;network congestion;network packet;optimizing compiler;performance evaluation;simulation;software quality management	Nadim K.

To do this, we developed a tool that sends and receives UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets. Our measurements showed that long burst losses are more likely when the packet loss ratio is high. We then examined two models for calculating the burst packet loss, an independent loss model and a Markov-chain model, to see whether they explain the packet loss characteristics we measured. They did not, so we developed a sine model, in which the packet loss probability depends on the time of day.

Performance is measured in terms of the competitive ratio, the proportion of the maximum congestion to the best possible congestion. In this paper, we take the first steps towards extending this worst-case characterization to a more revealing statistical one. We define new performance metrics and we present numerical evaluations showing that, in statistical terms, oblivious routing is not as competitive as the worst-case performance characterizations would suggest.	best, worst and average case;competitive analysis (online algorithm);network congestion;numerical analysis;routing	Gábor Németh;Gábor Rétvári	2012		10.1145/2254756.2254806	competitive analysis;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing	Theory	0.510115144080855	92.79583894757747	159042

It became very interesting and important research area in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) as the channel allocation procedure needs to be efficient as the frequency of handoff is high because of the high mobility of the nodes. So, the authors propose a channel allocation algorithm that utilises channel reuse technique, channel borrowing process and the speed of the vehicle to reserve the channel for handoff calls to improve quality of service (QoS) in VANET. The calls are categorised as real-time originating calls, real-time handoff calls, non-real-time originating calls, non-real-time handoff calls and non-real-time transfer calls, and queue is maintained for non-real-time originating calls, which leads to nonreal-time transfer calls. The channel borrowing process is incorporated only for real-time originating calls and real-time handoff calls. The proposed system is modelled using two-dimensional Markov model. The proposed algorithm is simulated and evaluated in terms of QoS parameters as blocking probability, dropping probability and handoff latency. The performance is tested with varying system load, varying number of channels and is compared with legacy systems like cooperative reservation of service channels, CRaSCH, and a new dynamic channel allocation strategy which combines channel reservation with new call queuing, RQS.	algorithm;blocking (computing);erlang (unit);hoc (programming language);interrupt latency;legacy system;load (computing);markov chain;markov model;next-generation network;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;system call	V.

Arriving calls are granted service based on specific service class, required maximum and minimum bandwidth, and available network resources. Performance of priority-based dynamic capacity allocation, suitable for the wireless system supporting ATM-like traffic is analysed. Scheduling of the ATM cell transmission in each uplink TDMA frame is based on a priority scheme. GoS (blocking probability) and QoS (throughput) parameters for bandwidth sharing policy (BSP) are considered, and partial overlapped transmission link (POL) is implemented. In the modelling, the clustering procedure is developed based on Markov reward models (MRM), enhanced by the self-organizing vector quantification (VQ) and neural modelling. The optimal link occupancy probability distribution is calculated using the neural network, trained with Kohonen rules. Simulation and numerical results are shown. The efficiency of the link occupancy probability density function, applied for the network performance analysis, is confirmed by obtained numerical results. The approach proved to be useful and practical, allowing the simulations to be performed faster, easier, and less costly in resources. Although in this work we analyse performance of priority-based dynamic capacity allocation, suitable for the wireless network carrying ATM traffic, the results can be easily extended to ATM-like traffic, i.e. traffic of a similar nature and with comparable GoS/QoS parameters.	atm turbo;artificial neural network;blocking (computing);cluster analysis;emulator;erlang (unit);markov chain;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;network performance;numerical analysis;organizing (structure);profiling (computer programming);quality of service;randomness;register machine;scheduling (computing);self-organization;self-organizing map;simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;vector quantization	Izabella Lokshina	2012	Wireless Telecommunications Symposium 2012	10.1109/WTS.2012.6266075	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	4.565692550216629	98.18699396106074	159324

The reliability related QoS metrics in both the MAC-level and the Application-level including packet reception ratio, T-window reliability, and awareness probability are derived. Inspired by the correlation between road traffic and vehicle speed revealed by Greenshields model, we observe that the current reliability related QoS requirements for safety applications are set without considering change of road traffic. Based on the observation, a new reliability requirement setting is proposed to tune tolerance time for various safety applications with different road traffic. The QoS requirements for the three typical safety applications that are believed to have the most stringent QoS requirements are specified and discussed. Taking velocity, density and time into account, application-level reliability metrics are improved for high vehicle density. From the results obtained under worst case with different vehicle density, we can observe the feasibility of our proposed reliability requirement setting.	best, worst and average case;glossary of computer graphics;network packet;norm (social);numerical analysis;openbsm;quality of service;requirement;telecommunications network;velocity (software development)	Wenfeng Li;Jun Wu;Xiaomin Ma;Zhifeng Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium Proceedings	10.1109/IVS.2014.6856434	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;engineering;computer security;computer network	Embedded	5.49467503610495	89.65001112091865	159353

These protocols often use congestion signals whose computation requires an estimate of link capacity. Such estimates are not available in networks where capacity varies over time. This paper studies the impact of inaccurate capacity estimates on the performance of congestion control protocols over variable capacity links. As a case study, we focus on 802.11 WLANs. We show that such estimates can lead to either under-utilization or unfairness and network overload. Using a model, we characterize the available capacity of a node in a 802.11 WLAN and then study a method for capacity estimation. Using simulations, we show that the method leads to high utilization and fairness over shared, multi-access networks.	access network;computation;fairness measure;ibm notes;mesh networking;network congestion;router (computing);simulation;wireless mesh network	Ihsan Ayyub Qazi;Taieb Znati;Daniel Mossé	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6363981	telecommunications;computer science;feedback;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;transport layer;computer network	Robotics	-2.240347788646301	91.31488157677785	159605

a255126e4031f14431a5259ee81b9561f6eddb4f	on-line scheduling with hard deadlines (extended abstract)	resource utilization;admission control	We study non-preemptive, online admission control in the hard deadline model: each job must be either serviced prior to its deadfine, or be rejected. Oar setting consists of a single resource that services an online sequence of jobs; each job has a length indicating the length of time for which it needs the resource, and a delay indicating the maximum time it can wait for the service to be started. The goal is to maximize total resource utilization. We obtain a series of results, under varying assumptions of job lengths and delays. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Online scheduling is an important problem area, with diverse applications. In this paper, we consider a scheduling framework where jobs have a hard deadline, meaning any job not serviced by its deadline is lost. Jobs arrive online, and must be scheduled non-preemptively. While much of the classical work on scheduling has been done in an offline setting, online scheduling is becoming especially important in high-speed network applications. The scheduling with hard deadlines models some interesting problems in providing Quality-of-Service (QoS) in shared packet-switched networks, as welt as high bandwidth multimedia applications. For instance, in a packet-switched network such as the Internet, multiple traffic streams pass through a network of switching nodes (touters). Each node implements a service discipline (scheduling algorithm) for forwarding the incoming packets to outbound links. Due to the highly variable traffic rates (fl'om few bits to several megabits per second) and packet sizes (from few bytes to several kilobytes), simple schedulers such as FIFO and round robin can fail miserably and fail to provide the bandwidth fairness and worst-case latency bounds. Packets in a latency-sensitive traffic stream such as video must be delivered within a small window, or else be dropped--the latency window corresponds to the maximum permissible delay at a router. (In these applications, delivering packets late has a worse effect than simply dropping the packets.) Similarly, in such emerging applications as video-on-demand, a useful model for requests is where users specify a window of time during which the delivery is acceptable. * Supported in part by NSF Grant CCR-9110108 and NSF National Young Investigator grant CCR-9357707 with matching funds provided by Xerox PARC and WUTA. ** Research supported in part by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under contract DABT-63-95-C-0083. *** Research supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant CCR-9501494	algorithm;best, worst and average case;byte;data rate units;fifo (computing and electronics);fairness measure;hyperlink;ibm notes;internet;job (computing);job stream;kilobyte;megabit;network packet;online and offline;packet switching;preemption (computing);quality of service;round-robin scheduling;router (computing);scheduling (computing)	Sally A.

a68a77b048cb9d7ba41025901a146718c59f5109	bias based general framework for delay reduction in backpressure routing algorithm		In queueing networks, it is well known that the throughput-optimal backpressure routing algorithm results in poor delay performance for light and moderate traffic loads. To improve delay performance of backpressure routing algorithm, available works exploit various information of queueing networks, such as queue length, shortest path and packet delay, to direct packets to shorter routes to their destinations. Despite different forms of these works, they share the common characteristic: using bias to help backpressure routing to reduce packet delay. From this observation, we propose in this paper a bias based general framework to reduce packet delay of backpressure routing algorithm. Our framework is general in the sense that it not only covers many bias based variants of backpressure routing algorithm as special cases but also enables machine learning based methods to be adopted to further improve delay performance. Based on the general framework, we propose a specific Q-learning based backpressure routing algorithm to reduce packet delay.	backpressure routing;deep learning;dijkstra's algorithm;machine learning;network packet;q-learning;shortest path problem;simulation;throughput	Juntao Gao;Yulong Shen;Minoru Ito;Norio Shiratori	2018	2018 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2018.8390362	computer network;shortest path problem;backpressure routing;exploit;queueing theory;network packet;queue;computer science	EDA	2.6635277229008767	90.4859090018888	159752

Advance reservation for global grids becomes an important research area as it allows users to gain concurrent access for their applications to be executed in parallel, and guarantees the availability of resources at specified future times. But performance of reservation for grid was seldom considered. In this paper, an adaptive advance reservation is introduced. It can modify not only the parameters of latest request but also that of admitted requests because sometimes the latest request is fixed with parameters. Particular admission control algorithm for this new type of reservation is provided too. Simulation shows that it can improve performance of resource reservation in terms of both call acceptance rate and resource utilization when the percentage of fixed requests is not very high.	algorithm;concurrency control;grid computing;simulation	Libing Wu;Jianbing Xing;Chanle Wu;Jianqun Cui	2005	Sixth International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'05)	10.1109/PDCAT.2005.67	availability;in situ resource utilization;real-time computing;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;bandwidth;grid computing;computer network	HPC	1.2313265600999606	96.06305049470835	159875

Cooperative communication, on the other hand, can enhance the reliability of communication links in VANETs, thus mitigating wireless channel impairments due to the user mobility. In this paper, we present a cooperative scheme for medium access control (MAC) in VANETs, referred to as Cooperative ADHOC MAC (CAH-MAC). In CAH-MAC, neighboring nodes cooperate by utilizing unreserved time slots, for retransmission of a packet which failed to reach the target receiver due to a poor channel condition. Through mathematical analysis and simulation, we show that our scheme increases the probability of successful packet transmission and hence the network throughput in various networking scenarios.	access control;hoc (programming language);hop-by-hop transport;network packet;network topology;programming paradigm;relay;retransmission (data networks);sensor;simulation;throughput	Sailesh Bharati;Weihua Zhuang	2013	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP.0513042	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	6.615281837470178	89.65883507237922	160229

This paper studies such a collocated multiradio system: collocated LTE and HSDPA. Firstly, we investigate the potential gain by using a shared transport network to carry different radio technologies. Furthermore, this paper proposes analytical models to dimension the shared transport network for elastic traffic (TCP-based traffic) from the different radio technologies, by taking traffic characteristics, QoS requirements of each radio technology and the deployed transport QoS function and packet scheduling into considerations. The proposal for modeling the shared transport network is to apply the M/G/R-PS model per QoS class while taking the potential multiplexing gain of bandwidth sharing among the different QoS classes into account. For validating the analytical models, a system simulation model is developed. The analytical results derived from the proposed dimensioning models are validated by comparing with the simulation results for various traffic and network scenarios. Presented results demonstrate that proposed analytical models are well suitable for dimensioning of the shared transport network. With the help of the proposed analytical models, we analyze the potential sharing gain of such a shared transport system under different traffic loads and mix of different radio technologies.	coexist (image);compaq lte;multiplexing;network packet;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation	X.

Each message is addressed to k randomly chosen nodes. Since optimal message scheduling in a WDM network is known to be very difficult, we study two simple scheduling schemes: in the first, a message is continuously retransmitted until it is received by all of its intended recipients; and in the second, a random delay is introduced between retransmissions of the same message. We develop a throughput analysis for both schemes using methods from discrete-time queueing systems and show that the algorithm with random delays between retransmissions results in higher throughput. We also consider a number of receiver algorithms for selecting among multiple simultaneous transmissions and show, through simulation, that an algorithm where the receiver selects the message with the least number of intended recipients performs better than a random selection algorithm. Finally, we show that channel utilization can be significantly increased with multiple receivers/node.	multicast;randomness;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;simulation;throughput;wavelength-division multiplexing	Eytan Modiano	1999	IEEE/ACM Trans.

The performance models studied differ primarily in the manner in which the superposition of the voice sources (i.e., the arrival process) is modeled. The first approach models the superimposed voice sources as a renewal process, and performance calculations are based only on the first two moments of the renewal process. The second approach is based on modeling the superimposed voice sources as a Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP). The choice of parameters for the MMPP attempts to capture aspects of the arrival process in a more intuitive manner than previously proposed approaches for determining the MMPP parameters and is shown to compute loss more accurately. Finally, a fluid flow approximation for computing packet loss is evaluated. For all three approaches, a unifying example, the case of multiplexing voice sources over a T1-rate link is considered. The main conclusion is that both the MMPP model and the fluid flow approximation can provide accurate loss predictions for parameter ranges of practical interest. >	approximation;multiplexer	Ramesh Nagarajan;James F.

To cope with the heterogeneity in Internet congestion control, we propose a new TCP protocol known as INVS that contains three key components: 1) INVS employs an exponential-function-based growth function of the congestion window, which is more efficient than the cubic function in CUBIC; 2) INVS introduces an adaptive increase factor into the growth function to ensure that the window growth rate matches the path condition, and this increase factor measures the path condition using a custom function of the available bandwidth and minimum RTT; 3) INVS adopts an adaptive queue threshold in the loss classification scheme to improve the performance of TCP over lossy links. In addition, INVS requires modification only on the TCP sender and traces the path capacity to enable quick convergence of the congestion window. The performance analysis and evaluation show that INVS achieves good throughput, fairness, RTT-fairness and utilization in heterogeneous networks.	algorithm;cellular automaton;cubic function;fairness measure;internet;lossy compression;network congestion;network packet;semantic network;tcp congestion control;throughput;time complexity;tracing (software)	Zhiming Wang;Xiaoping Zeng;Xue Liu;Man Xu;Ya Wen;Li Chen	2016	J.

However, in most infrastructure-based WLANs, it is turned off with the belief that the benefit it brings might not even be able to pay off the transmission overhead it introduces. While this is often true for networks using fixed transmission rate, our investigation leads to the opposite conclusion when multiple transmission rates are exploited in WLANs. In particular, through extensive simulations using realistic channel propagation and reception models, we found out that in a heavily loaded multi-rate WLAN, a situation that we call rate avalanche often happens if RTS/CTS is turned off. The rate avalanche effect could significantly degrade the network performance even if no hidden node presents. Our investigation also reveals that, in the absence of effective and practical loss-differentiation mechanisms, simply turning on the RTS/CTS could dramatically enhance the network performance in most cases. Various scenarios/conditions are extensively examined to study their impact on the network performance for RTS/CTS on and off respectively. Our study provides some important insights about using the RTS/CTS exchange in mutlirate 802.11 WLANs.	avalanche effect;carpal tunnel syndrome;design rule for camera file system;elegant degradation;network performance;overhead (computing);rs-232;simulation;software propagation;zhi-li zhang	Liqiang Zhang;Yu-Jen Cheng;Xiaobo Zhou	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing	10.1109/IPDPS.2008.4536148	real-time computing;degradation;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;network performance;signal-to-noise ratio;access method;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;physical layer;hidden node problem;computer network	Mobile	8.83788678854322	91.41153004395433	160791

While access network capacity continues to increase, simultaneous operation of multiple wireless access networks presents an opportunity to increase the data rates available to end-users even further using intelligent cross-network resource sharing. This paper introduces a new Integrated Mobility and Resource Management (IMRM) framework for automatic execution of policies for cross-network resource sharing using traffic offload and pre-emptive resource reservation algorithms. The presented framework enables both mobile-initiated and network-initiated resource sharing policies to be executed. This paper presents the framework in detail and analyses its performance using extensive ns-2 simulations of the operation of a set of static policies based on measured signal strength, and dynamic pre-emptive network-initiated policies in a WiFi/WiMAX scenario. The detailed evaluation of the static policies clearly shows that the quality of voice applications shows large deviation, mostly due to very different levels of delay in access networks. Based on these conclusions, this paper presents a design of two new dynamic policies and shows that such policies, when efficiently implemented using the new IMRM framework can greatly improve the capacity of the network to serve voice traffic with a minimal impact on the data traffic and with a very low signalling overhead.	access network;algorithm;intelligent network;network performance;overhead (computing);simulation;wireless access point	Dmitry Sivchenko;Veselin Rakocevic;Joachim Habermann	2015	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-014-0826-7	real-time computing;heterogeneous network;quality of service;computer science;resource management;operating system;voice over ip;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.7344045285776777	96.53697754597357	160932

The performance of a non-blocking ATM switch can usually be improved by increasing the switching speed. Also, the performance of a switch can be improved using a window scheme by relaxing the first-in-firstout (FIFO) queueing discipline in the input queue. Thus, one can expect that a combined scheme of windowing and a speed constraint can improve further the performance of the packet switch. Here, we analyze the maximum throughput of the input and output queueing switch with a speed constraint combined with windowing, and show that it is possible to obtain high throughput with a small increment of speed-up and window size. For analysis, we model the HOL queueing system as a virtual queueing system. By analyzing the dynamics of HOL packets in this virtual queueing model, we obtain the service probability of the HOL server as a function of output contention capabilities. Using the result, we apply the flow conservation relation to this model and obtain the maximum throughput. The analytical results are verified by simulation.	atm turbo;input/output	Jin Seek Choi;Chong Kwan Un	1996	Telecommunication Systems	10.1007/BF02114299	high-throughput screening;real-time computing;computer science;layered queueing network;distributed computing;computer network	Metrics	-0.11979745815779118	95.02513501769458	160970

Since efficiency at the medium access control (MAC) layer decreases with increasing the physical rate, few researches have used aggregation, as a compensatory method, to improve efficiency. They have, however, underscored scalability in terms of parameters such as physical rate or number of users. Thus, providing a more scalable MAC protocol has become as issue of paramount concern. In this paper, we propose the Dual-channel Token-based MAC (DT-MAC) protocol that can provide scalability and improve efficiency especially for a large number of users and high physical rates. Then, DT-MAC is analytically evaluated in saturated conditions, and a predictable and optimal bandwidth allocation scheme to sub-channels is proposed. Simulation results for various parameters show that DT-MAC can approximately improve throughput 68% and decrease transmission delay and jitter nearly 90% compared with IEEE 802.11n for a dense high-data-rate single-hop network and operates well under low load.	access control;channel (communications);frame (networking);multi-channel memory architecture;overhead (computing);quality of service;routing;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Peyman Teymoori;Nasser Yazdani;Ahmad Khonsari	2013	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2012.010913.120698	network allocation vector;throughput;real-time computing;scalability;jitter;telecommunications;computer science;multi-channel memory architecture;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	9.323239294729035	89.0975033792838	161133

We propose a generalized analytical approach to evaluate the efficiency of the broadc asting protocols and derive the theoretical lower bandwidth requirement bound for any periodic broadcasting protocols. By means of the proposed ana lytical tool temporal-bandwidth map, the approach can be used to direct t he design of periodic broadcasting protocols to achieve different goal s,e.g., server bandwidth requirement, client waiting time, client I/O bandwid th requirement etc. As the most important performance index in VOD system isthe required server bandwidth, we give the solution to achieve theoptimal bandwidth efficiency given client waiting time requirement and the length of the video. To take into account the popular compressed video wit h variable bit rate, the optimal approach is applied readily to the VBR videos and can achieve zero loss and best bandwidth efficiency. We give proo f why existing techniques such as smoothing and prefetching is not necessa ry nd in some cases inefficient in broadcasting protocols. We also discus s how broadcasting schemes can be tailored to support true and interactive V OD service.

The intrinsic fairness of single-hop wireless networks can be used to model the network as a processor sharing system with multiple queues, one for each node, and a fair scheduling regime. In the multi-hop scenario, the queuing performance depends on the access protocol, the network topology and the traffic profiles on all links. In a previous paper a model is introduced which allows the calculation of the saturation throughput of nodes in multi-hop CSMA-CA networks with RTS/CTS enabled access. A simplified version of the method is used to estimate the resources of the servers in a many-sources large deviations analysis of a queuing system with multiple coupled servers. The queuing performance of wireless networks can be evaluated by mapping the different servers to the nodes in the network. The cumulative complementary distribution function of the buffer occupation of a node for different topologies is calculated by a novel method and compared to the results of an event-driven simulation with the same settings. A good fit between the semi-analytical model and the simulation is obtained.

The HWMP protocol is more adapted for best effort traffic that is why its usage is not suitable for real time multimedia applications. The goal of our proposed mechanism is to take into account multicast communication under QoS constraints for the IEEE 802.11s mesh networks where no QoS multicasting has been defined. Our multicasting scheme handles QoS guarantee for real time applications. Indeed, our scheme is based on finding the QoS multicast tree thanks to an end-to-end delay evaluation to cover multicast services. A QoS multicast tree is constructed based on the proactive tree HWMP mechanisms. Simulations results, using Network Simulator 3 (NS 3), show that our scheme improves data multicast transmission overhead as well as network throughput.	access control;mesh networking;multicast;new media;quality of service;wireless mesh network	Mohamed Guesmia;Mustapha Guezouri;Nader Mbarek	2014	IJCNDS	10.1504/IJCNDS.2014.063969	ieee 802.11s;real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;inter-domain;quality of service;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;internet group management protocol;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network;multicast address	Visualization	-0.3577729208871342	89.94262796319488	161316

In this paper we present a comparison among three different monitoring functions to be used in a dynamic bandwidth renegotiation scheme. These functions aim at detecting the amount of unused resources in the network, which can be allocated to low priority data flows. These applications are not delay-sensitive and can be admitted by the call admission control with a bandwidth smaller than the nominal one. Simulation results comparing the performance of the three monitoring functions are presented, as well as an overhead analysis. Finally, we discuss the performance/complexity trade-off considering the three functions and determine the most viable one.	overhead (computing);packet switching;qualitative comparative analysis;sensor;simulation	Hermes Irineu Del Monego;Luiz Nacamura;Richard Demo Souza;Anelise Munaretto Fonseca;Marcelo Eduardo Pellenz	2006			qualitative comparative analysis;data flow diagram;cellular network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;access control;resource management;wireless network;packet switching;telecommunications network;computer network	Metrics	0.7336639273441043	96.50907343009291	161520

In this paper, exploiting inter-layer and inter-session network coding, we address the distributed control problem in heterogeneous-service networks (HSNs) with booming multi-rate multicast (MRM) and unicast (UC) services. Different from the literatures on inter-layer/inter-session schemes, heterogeneity and fairness among MRM users and between different services are jointly considered. With the Lagrangian and subgradient method, a decentralized rate control algorithm is developed with little coordination among intermediate nodes, in which only local information is needed to achieve rate, congestion, and fairness balance control. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance improvement and implementation advantages of the proposed algorithm compared with the previous solutions considering layered coding for an MRM service or inter-session coding limited for UC services.	computer simulation;distributed algorithm;distributed control system;fairness measure;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;multicast;network congestion;numerical analysis;numerical method;register machine;subgradient method;uc browser;unicast;zentropy partners	Zhihui Liu;Junyi Wang;Wenjun Xu;Shengyu Li;Jiaru Lin	2014	2014 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2014.6953060	network traffic control;linear network coding;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HPC	-1.9639555942391824	96.86443998555853	161554

As part of our ongoing research program focusing on the development of intelligent control techniques for ATM networks, in this paper, we present a regulator based on Fuzzy Logic control techniques for controlling congestion in broadband networks by keeping the ABR queue length around a reference value. Our simulations show that the controller is quite effective especially under network overload conditions.	atm turbo;audio control surface;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;intelligent control;logic control;mathematical model;network congestion;network switch;nonlinear system;simulation	Y.

The network uses radio channels as the broadcast medium to interconnect nodes to offer flexibility for the change of network specifications. The time division multiple access (TDMA) technology has been used to share a radio channel among many users where a channel is divided into synchronized data packet transmission called “time slots.” A time slot has a unit time to transmit one data packet per one node. The packet radio network has the following constraints. First, the network has symmetric connectivity between nodes where any two connected or neighboring nodes can communicate with each other. Second, transmitted data packet may be received by all the neighboring nodes. Third, a node cannot send and receive a packet simultaneously. Fourth, a node cannot receive more than one packet simultaneously. If two or more nodes transmit packets to a node simultaneously, the node cannot receive any of them successfully. Network connectivity is described in an n x n, symmetric binary matrix for an n-node network where an element N73 is 1 if node i is a neighbor of node j ; 0 otherwise. Fig. 1 shows a seven-node network where the edges represent the connectivity and the network matrix. The broadcast scheduling problem in packet radio networks has been studied extensively. Baker et al. [l], [2] first formulated the problem and proposed some ad hoc algorithms. The problem of finding a TDMA cycle where all nodes can broadcast packets has been studied most intensively. Even et al. [3] proved that the TDMA-cycle minimization problem is NP-complete. In 1989, Cidon and Sidi [7] proposed two distributed algorithms: the round-robin algorithm where	broadcast domain;distributed algorithm;download;hoc (programming language);np-completeness;network packet;packet switching;parallel algorithm;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing)	Nobuo Funabiki;Yoshiyasu Takefuji	1993	IEEE Trans.

Two important performance metrics, i.e. queuing delay and packet drop, are approximately modeled and derived for the QoS control at the base stations using a simplified queuing model. Based on it, the performance comparison between the approaches of application-based QoS control and the conventional class-based one is also presented. In order to have a more accurate performance evaluation, simulations are conducted for both approaches to verify the pervious analysis by using synthetic traffic of two different applications of Web browsing and video streaming. From the results of analysis and simulations, it is shown that the application-based QoS control indeed improves the QoS performance to certain extent than the class-based approach, in two kinds of typical traffic patterns.	approximation algorithm;network packet;performance evaluation;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;queueing theory;queuing delay;simulation;streaming media;synthetic data	Lei Zhong;Kiyohide Nakauchi;Yozo Shoji	2014	2014 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906401	real-time computing;mobile qos;traffic classification;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Embedded	-4.001827393053987	92.07316043199674	161850

A migration to microcells will increase the number of hando s, and require faster hando algorithms – in terms of decision making. In the case of line-of-sight transmission, it is important that the hando algorithm detects the cell boundary early enough, otherwise this will lead to channel dragging into the new cell subsequently increasing the chance of co-channel interference. In the case of non-line-of-sight transmission, a mobile station on turning a street corner will experience a phenomenon known as the Manhattan corner e ect that causes the received signal level to drop by 20–30 dB in 20–30m. This corner e ect problem can lead to a loss of communication if not identi ed early enough. This paper presents two new hando techniques using fuzzy logic as possible solutions to microcellular hando . The rst algorithm uses an adaptive fuzzy predictor, while the second uses a fuzzy averaging technique. The results of the simulation show that fuzzy is a viable option for microcellular hando . c © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Flow termination is a new flow control function that terminates some admitted flows when the network capacity does not suffice, such as in the case of unexpected failures. Admission control and flow termination are useful to protect QoS for inelastic flows that require a minimum bit rate. Examples are real-time applications like voice and video. Precongestion notification (PCN) provides feedback about load conditions on the path to boundary nodes. They use this information to implement lightweight admission control and flow termination without per-flow state on interior nodes of a domain. These mechanisms are significantly simpler than explicit reservation schemes. In the context of DiffServ, IP, MPLS, and Ethernet networks, we explain the concept of PCN-based admission control and flow termination, present recent standards of the IETF, and discuss benefits and limitations.	differentiated services;flow control (data);multiprotocol label switching;program composition notation;quality of service;real-time transcription	Michael Menth;Bob Briscoe;Tina Tsou	2012	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2012.6163587	local area network;multiprotocol label switching;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;differentiated service;computer science;flow control;computer network	Networks	-4.391275137896465	95.72783495287248	162011

The main problem to implement a wireless network is the high and variable bit error rate in the radio link, making it necessary to use an additional error control mechanism. The traditional techniques for error control are ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) and FEC (Forward Error Correction). The ARQ technique works better than FEC, if the bit error rate in the channel is low, and worse, if the bit error rate is high. Thus, hybrid ARQ/FEC techniques can improve the performance. In this paper, a novel hybrid ARQ/FEC scheme is analyzed in an environment of real-time applications. We focus in a simple FEC scheme which has been standardized by IETF [11]. It consists in adding a low quality copy of the original packet n to the packet n + ø. If packet n is lost in the network, it can be correctly recovered if packet n +ø is correctly received. The effect of link layer (LL) parameters like the number of LL transmission attempts, offset ø , LL packet size, and FEC code rate on the TFRC (TCP Friendly Rate Control)and UDP performance is evaluated. We show that the combination of FEC and ARQ reduces the number of retransmissions and the time spent by a packet in the buffer at the output of the wireless link.

A multi agent system based approach is proposed by taking into consideration the concurrent nature of services and involvement of number of participants in cellular network. This work emphasizes on enhancement of QoS using fundamental mechanism of call admission control as well as resource allocation as a additional measure. The Quality of Service (QoS) parameters are often measured in terms of call dropping probability, call blocking probability and failure rate. To meet this achievement, this work proposes soft computing approach for implementation of multi agent system to increase system capacity to accommodate the calls and to reduce failure rate. The results are produced using simulation model for microcellular network for two different traffic scenarios and fuzzy approach has shown the enhancement.	fuzzy logic;multi-agent system	Megha Kamble;Roopam Gupta	2011		10.1007/978-81-322-0487-9_50	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;operations management	Robotics	8.396127400466481	98.68240239729884	162502

Recent work has demonstrated that cooperative congestion control strategies between flows can improve performance for a variety of applications, ranging from aggregated TCP transmissions to multiple-sender multicast applications. However, in order for this cooperation to be effective, one must first identify the flows that are congested at the same set of resources. In this paper, we present techniques based on loss or delay observations at end hosts to infer whether or not two flows experiencing congestion are congested at the same network resources. Our novel result is that such detection can be achieved for unicast flows, but the techniques can also be applied to multicast flows. We validate these techniques via queueing analysis, simulation, and experimentation within the Internet. In addition, we demonstrate preliminary simulation results that show that the delay-based technique can determine whether two TCP flows are congested at the same set of resources. We also propose metrics that can be used as a measure of the amount of congestion sharing between two flows.	end-to-end encryption;internet;multicast;network congestion;sensor;simulation;unicast	Dan Rubenstein;James F.

478e2061fcf75f67b9d23ac7425cc73c175a7303	distributed priority algorithms under one-bit-delay constraints	ring network;distributed computing	The paper deals with the issue of station delay in token-ring networks. It explains why one-bit-delay is the minimum possible delay at every station and shows that the station delay depends on the distributed computations performed in the ring. Then, the paper introduces the distributed priority mechanism for token-rings, as approved by the IEEE-802.5 standard. This mechanism attaches to the token, that circulates around the ring and controls the access to the shared medium, a priority field P and a reservation field R. These two fields work together in an attempt to match the service priority of the ring to the highest priority message that is waiting to be sent. It is shown that due to the computation restrictions imposed by the one-bit-delay requirements, this priority mechanism has a grave deficiency as follows. When the token priority is higher than the maximum reservation (P > R), the token should make up to P round-trips, where P is the number of priority levels, before P is reduced to R. During this time period, no station may seize the token and send a message. This leads to loss of bandwidth. The paper presents a new priority mechanism that retains the desired properties of the standard. However, in the new protocol when P > R holds, P is reduced to R in at most 1 round-trip rather than in up to P round-trips.	algorithm;angular defect;bandwidth (signal processing);computation;p (complexity);requirement;token ring	Reuven Cohen;Adrian Segall	1992		10.1145/135419.135422	priority inheritance;token bus network;ring network;real-time computing;priority call;computer science;distributed computing;priority queue;priority ceiling protocol;computer network	Networks	0.7238704272489446	94.90464917287875	162943

52fd510eb1c3277763b67d0c1bf57b78d0340748	scheduling streaming flows on the downlink shared channel of umts	stream flow	In Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems (UMTS), the Downlink Shared Channel (DSCH) may be used to provide streaming services. The traffic model for streaming services is different from the continuously-backlogged model used in much of the literature. Each connection specifies a required service rate over an interval of time. In this paper, we are interested in determining how k DSCH frames should be allocated among a set of I connections. We need a scheduler that is channel-aware, so that channels presently enjoying low fading losses can be exploited to achieve higher aggregate throughput. On the other hand, the scheduler is also required to be fair, so that each connection obtains a throughput as close as possible to what it requires. We introduce the notion of discrepancy to capture the inherent trade-off between aggregate throughput and fairness. We show that the discrepancy criterion provides a flexible means for balancing efficiency, as measured by aggregate throughput, and fairness. Our problem, then, is to schedule mobiles so as to minimize the discrepancy over the control horizon. We provide a simple low-complexity heuristic called ITEM that is provably optimal in certain cases. In particular, we show that ITEM is optimal when applied in the UMTS context. Next, we compare the performance of ITEM with those of other algorithms, and show that it performs better in terms of both fairness and aggregate throughput. Thus, ITEM provides benefits in both dimensions — fairness and efficiency — and is therefore a promising algorithm for scheduling streaming connections.	aggregate data;algorithm;discrepancy function;fairness measure;heuristic;scheduling (computing);telecommunications link;throughput	Joy Kuri;R.

Consequently, network architectures have been proposed that employ multiple wireless hops in route to and from the wired Internet. Unfortunately, use of current media access and transport protocols for such systems can result in severe unfairness and even starvation for flows that are an increasing number of hops away from a wired Internet entry point. Our objective is to study fairness and end-to-end performance in multihop wireless backhaul networks via the following methodology. First, we develop a formal reference model that characterizes objectives such as removing spatial bias (i.e., providing performance that is independent of the number of wireless hops to a wire) and maximizing spatial reuse. Second, we perform an extensive set of simulation experiments to quantify the impact of the key performance factors towards achieving these goals. For example, we study the roles of the MAC protocol, end-to-end congestion control, antenna technology, and traffic types. Next, we develop and study a distributed layer 2 fairness algorithm which targets to achieve the fairness of the reference model without modification to TCP. Finally, we study the critical relationship between fairness and aggregate throughput and in particular study the fairness-constrained system capacity of multihop wireless backhaul networks."""	aggregate data;algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);cable modem;call stack;channel capacity;digital subscriber line;end-to-end principle;entry point;experiment;fairness measure;network architecture;network congestion;reference model;serial experiments lain;simulation;throughput	Violeta Gambiroza;Bahareh Sadeghi;Edward W.

5d6e04ff1a9472c3b3f73c99e936a51202ad83ea	efficient interference-aware power control in wireless ad hoc networks		Interference management through power control in wireless ad hoc networks has both the hidden terminal problem which induces collisions, and the exposed terminal problem which prohibits concurrent transmissions. Both problems are caused by the varied interference range induced by the adjusted transmission power. Through observing that the nodes adopt the power control mechanism induces collisions in one scenario and miss concurrent transmission opportunities in two scenarios, this paper presents IAPC (Interference-Aware Power Control), a novel protocol to improve the network throughput from these aspects. IAPC makes the interference range of each link covered by its CTS (Clear-To-Send) transmission through utilizing a signature detection process, so as to avoid interference. Meanwhile, it lets CTS convey the transmission power information of this link to make the neighboring node determine a limited transmission power, which tries to make the neighboring node outside the interference range of the ongoing link, thus can exploit concurrent transmissions. Simulation results based on ns-2 show that IAPC can outperform the other protocols significantly.	carpal tunnel syndrome;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);rs-232;simulation;throughput	Junmei Yao;Wei Lou;Chao Yang;Kaishun Wu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2017.7997363	exposed node problem;power control;throughput;real-time computing;hidden node problem;computer network;computer science;exploit;interference (wave propagation);signal-to-noise ratio;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	8.85427591289155	90.97720939884101	163588
599d85a6e69ac8bc3d036e3b1ad3cbd8d1f6c3cb	hmac: enabling hybrid tdma/csma on ieee 802.11 hardware		We present our current work-in-progress on the design and implementation of a hybrid TDMA/CSMA medium access architecture, hereafter referred to as hMAC, which can be used on top of commercial IEEE 802.11 off-the-shelf hardware. The software only solution is based on the popular Linux ATH9K softMAC driver and hence can be used with standard Linux systems using Atheros based wireless network devices. The proposed hMAC exploits the standard 802.11 power saving functionality present in the ATH9K device driver to enable control of the software packet queues. This allows the assignment of TDMA time slots on wireless link and traffic class basis. While the solution is placed only in the device driver, the CSMA/CA functionality on hardware level is still active. This enables inter-working with standard unmodified 802.11 devices. We tested our prototypical hMAC implementation in a small test-bed. Therefore, we implemented a centralized interference management scheme in which pairs of links suffering from a hidden node problem are assigned to TDMA time slots on a per-link basis. To show the benefits of the proposed hMAC approach we compared the results with standard 802.11 DCF and classical, i.e. per-node, TDMA.

For engineering purposes, there is a need for very simple, explicit, yet accurate, models that predict the performance of WLANs under anticipated load conditions. In this context, several detailed packet-level models have been proposed, based on fixed-point equations. Despite the fact that these models generally lead to accurate performance predictions, they do not lead to simple explicit expressions for the performance of WLANs. Motivated by this, we propose a new analytic model that captures the highly complex combined dynamics and protocol overhead of the 802.11 MAC, IP, TCP and application-layer into an explicit expression for a single parameter which will be called the effective service time. Based on the effective service time, we define the effective load to describe the flow-level performance of file transfers over WLANs with an M/G/1 Processor Sharing (PS) model. Using the M/G/1 PS model properties we propose a simple analytic model to obtain WLAN AP buffer content distribution. Despite the fact that PS models are heavily used in modelling flow-level performance in communication networks, an extensive validation of such models has not been published in the field, or context, of WLAN. To this end, our model is validated extensively by comparing the model-based average response times against simulations. The results show that the model leads to highly accurate predictions over a wide range of parameter combinations, including lightand heavy-tailed file-size distributions and light-	digital distribution;glossary of computer graphics;internet access;ising model;network packet;overhead (computing);simulation;telecommunications network;wireless router	Geert Jan Hoekstra;Robert D. van der Mei	2010	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2010.06.026	internet protocol;shared resource;input/output;power-flow study;the internet;simulation;systems modeling;relevance;telecommunications;heavy-tailed distribution;content management;computer science;wireless network;response time;computer security;telecommunications network	Metrics	-0.4684503775644024	101.40546693386571	163736

In the random waypoint model, each node selects a target location (i.e., waypoint) to move at a speed selected from an interval. Once the target is reached, the node pauses for a random time and then selects another target with another speed to move again. The movement between two waypoints is referred to as an epoch. In this paper, we derive the probability distribution of the epoch distance for the random waypoint model. Such a study is important as the epoch length distribution may be required for the derivation of the link duration distribution or node spatial distribution for mobile ad hoc networks. The analytical result is then verified via simulation.	epoch (reference date);hoc (programming language);simulation;waypoint	Yueh-Ting Wu;Wanjiun Liao;Cheng-Lin Tsao	2005	CCNC 2006. 2006 3rd IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.	10.1007/11562436_37	wireless ad hoc network;formal methods;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;mobile computing	Mobile	4.715058104195524	89.3062966542225	163745

Simulation-based techniques provide assessment of communication quality in complex and realistic working conditions. This paper introduces a novel and unique simulation technique, by merging QualNet simulator and SDL protocol developer. Many complex modifications of the QualNet nodes can be efficiently implemented, which is very difficult by a straightforward re-coding of QualNet components. The proposed methodology was utilized in the development of a wireless heterogeneous IEEE 802.21-based network. The paper provides a detailed insight of the model's three basic parts: QualNet environment, SDL resource manager and the novel SDL2QualNet interface. We present useful information for 802.21 simulation implementation, data acquisition from QualNet and calculation of dynamic network parameters, information and buffer management, methods for improvement of simulation efficiency, and many other modeling hints which enable a comprehensive simulation platform.	simulation	Pero Latkoski;Valentin Rakovic;Ognen Ognenoski;Vladimir Atanasovski;Liljana Gavrilovska	2010			real-time computing;simulation;systems modeling;heterogeneous network;computer science;operating system;computer network	Mobile	0.08878495169392013	89.00899660116886	163818

As a characteristic, the smaller the slope, the better the resulting QoS. Users are sensitive to their average throughput and to the price they pay. Since the study of the noncooperative game played is rendered difficult by the discrete nature of the strategy sets, and since it is not likely that users have a perfect knowledge of the game but only know their experienced utility, we introduce a decentralized learning algorithm to progressively reach a Nash equilibrium over time. We examine the effect of prices on the final game outcomes.	active queue management;algorithm;approximation;nash equilibrium;network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);simulation;throughput	Patrick Maillé;Bruno Tuffin;Yiping Xing;Rajarathnam Chandramouli	2007	2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317843	price of stability;non-cooperative game;implementation theory;game theory;epsilon-equilibrium;minimax;simulation;best response;quality of service;extensive-form game;computer science;normal-form game;price of anarchy;nash equilibrium;computer network	Metrics	-2.5205217729187166	95.13002020456561	163841

This is due to due to its better adaptability to unevenly-distributed and changing traffic load. However, it is observed that in DCA with the soft handoff policy, a handoff call will suffer a higher dropping probability than the blocking probability of a new call in the case of no handoff prioritization. This is definitely undesirable from the user's point of view. The channel carrying approach, which allows a mobile station to continue to use its currently occupied channel when it handoffs to a new cell, can easily change the stated situation above.

In some of these applications, the exchange of SIP messages is time-critical, for instance when SIP is used to handle mobility for voice over IP sessions. SIP may however introduce significant delays when it runs on top of UDP over lossy (wireless) links. These delays are the result of the exponential back-off retransmission scheme that SIP uses to recover from packet loss, which has a default back-off time of half a second.In this paper, we empirically investigate the delay introduced by SIP when it runs on top of UDP over IEEE 802.11b links. We focus on the operation of SIP at the edge of an 802.11b cell (e.g., to update a mobile host's IP address after a handoff) as this is where SIP's retransmissions scheme is most likely to come into play. We experiment with a few 802.11 parameters that influence packet loss on the wireless link, specifically with different link-level retransmission thresholds, signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs), and amounts of background traffic. We conduct these experiments in a controlled environment that is free from interfering 802.11 sources.Our results indicate that (1) SIP usually introduces little delay except for an SNR range of a few dBs at the very edge of an 802.11 cell in which the delay increases sharply, and (2) that a maximum of four 802.11 retransmissions suffices to limit the delay introduced by SIP retransmissions. The first result is of interest to developers of SIP applications who have to decide at which SNR to initiate a handoff to another network. The second result allows network providers to optimize their 802.11b networks for delay sensitive SIP applications.	experiment;exponential backoff;lossy compression;network packet;retransmission (data networks);signal-to-noise ratio;signaling protocol;time complexity;window of opportunity	Cristian Hesselman;Henk Eertink;Ing Widya;Erik Huizer	2005		10.1145/1080730.1080743	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Networks	-4.3260171135136245	91.25989781286766	164119

Analysis shows that the performance of packet queueing delay at switch input, as well as the entire throughput of the switch, can be adversely affected by such imbalances. The work is then extended to examine a transient imbalance case, where the switch experiences the alternation of two transient periods, each at a different traffic imbalance mode. The alternation is modeled by a two state Markov chain. Both balanced and imbalanced cases can be viewed as the two extremes of the transient case. We observe that the system throughput and the queueing performance in the transient case heavily depend on both mean sojourn time and steady state probability at each imbalance mode.	ergodic theory;input/output;markov chain;network packet;packet switching;queuing delay;steady state;throughput	San-qi Li;Myung J.

This paper describes the combination of the active network concept with swarm based control method for optimized multiclass QoS priority routing. This hybrid scenario uses the bandwidth clustering approach (triggered clusters). The packets follow a predetermined path initialized and allocated by swarm based packets, blindly and without any global knowledge of network conditions. In this work, this mechanism is associated with the triggered pheromone explored at different simulation sessions and does not require message brokers to fulfil multiclass QoS demands. The pheromone enforcement model that is indicated increases the overall response of the system. Simulation results depict the performance and robustness of the scheme in terms of the end-to-end delay, available bandwidth and packet loss under different traffic measures.	cluster analysis;end-to-end principle;network packet;overhead (computing);quality of service;routing;simulation;swarm;type enforcement	Constandinos X.

Medium-utilisation state tracking (MUST) is a novel technique which achieves fair round-robin access in CANs and requires few changes to the original protocol. Furthermore, it preserves full compatibility with the existing devices and applications developed for CANs. In this paper, the combined use of conventional CAN and MUST devices is analysed, and the performance improvements which can be obtained have been evaluated. In addition, some hints are given on possible implementations of the MUST technique in real CAN controllers.	can bus;fieldbus;real-time clock;repetitive strain;round-robin scheduling	Gianluca Cena;Adriano Valenzano	2001	ETFA 2001. 8th International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation.

Coordination itself needs consume communication resource and thus competes with data transmission for the limited wireless radio resources. In traditional approaches, control frames and data packets are transmitted in an alternate manner, which brings a great deal of coordination overhead. In this paper, we propose a new communication model where the control frames can be """"attachedâ to the data transmission. Thus, control messages and data traffic can be transmitted simultaneously and consequently the channel utilization can be improved significantly. We implement the idea in OFDM-based WLANs called hJam, which fully explores the physical layer features of the OFDM modulation method and allows one data packet and a number of control messages to be transmitted together. hJam is implemented on the GNU Radio testbed consisting of eight USRP2 nodes. We also conduct comprehensive simulations and the experimental results show that hJam can improve the WLANs efficiency by up to 200 percent compared with the existing 802.11 family protocols."""	attachments;control theory;elegant degradation;forward error correction;gnu radio;interference (communication);modulation;network packet;new star games;overhead (computing);radio jamming;simulation;testbed;throughput	Kaishun Wu;Haochao Li;Lu Wang;Youwen Yi;Yunhuai Liu;Qian Zhang;Lionel M.

Previous schemes, however, still suffer from enormous collisions of emergency messages or the large overhead of control messages in CCH, leading toward poor bandwidth usage. This paper develops group reservation MAC (GRMAC) to minimize the number of collisions in CCH to increase its overall goodput. GRMAC allows vehicles to reserve the CCH bandwidth while they stay in SCHs in order to reduce the number of collisions in CCH. Also, GRMAC migrates the CCH bandwidth scheduling mechanism from CCH to SCHs to reduce the burden on CCH bandwidth resources. The simulation results under heavy load reveal that GRMAC achieves two times the goodput achieved by the conventional IEEE 802.11p/1609 mechanism.

When vehicle density is low, the idle time slots of a licensed VANET channel are used for cooperative transmission through a relay. When the vehicle density is high, cognitive radio technique is applied to seek additional time slots available on the cognitive channels for opportunistic transmission.

Simulation results show 10%-50% higher throughput than distributed coordination function (DCF), depending on the number of nodes, while maintaining nearly perfect fairness. Furthermore, we also show how PC-MAC can successfully be applied to complex networks.	access control;backoff;complex network;design rule for camera file system;fairness measure;simulation;throughput	Minsik Lee;Youngjip Kim;Chong-Ho Choi	2011	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2011.2107332	wireless ad hoc network;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;particle detector;complex network;computer network	Mobile	8.174429523196864	91.65022317148704	165657

To provide bounded delay service, networks must use admission control to regulate their load. Previous work on admission control mainly focused on algorithms that compute the worst case theoretical queueing delay to guarantee an absolute delay bound for all packets. In this paper, we describe ameasurement-based admission control algorithm (ACA) for predictive service, which allows occasional delay violations. We have tested our algorithm through simulations on a wide variety of network topologies and driven with various source models, including some that exhibit long-range dependence, both in themselves and in their aggregation. Our simulation results suggest that measurement-based approach combined with the relaxed service commitment of predictive service enables us to achieve a high level of network utilization while still reliably meeting delay bound.	algorithm;american cryptogram association;best, worst and average case;delay-gradient congestion control;group delay and phase delay;high-level programming language;integrated services;network packet;network topology;queuing delay;real-time clock;simulation	Sugih Jamin;Peter B.

f6816b5f6ad270ad2ebb9a3a3fe298fb374b7c21	dimensioning the packet loss burstiness over wireless channels: a novel metric, its analysis and application	wireless channels;packet loss burstiness;correlation analysis	The packet loss burstiness over wireless channels is commonly acknowledged as a key impacting factor on the performance of networking protocols. An accurate evaluation of the packet loss burstiness, which reveals the characteristics and performance of the wireless channels, is crucial to the design of wireless systems and the quality-of-service provisioning to end users. In this paper, a simple yet accurate analytical framework is developed to dimension the packet loss burstiness over generic wireless channels. In specific, we first propose a novel and effective metric to characterize the packet loss burstiness, which is shown to be more compact, effective, and accurate than the metrics proposed in existing literature for the same purpose. With this metric, we then develop an analytical framework and derive the closed-form solutions of the packet loss performance, including the packet loss rate and the loss-burst/loss-gap length distributions. Lastly, as an example to show how the derived results can be applied to the design of wireless systems, we apply the analytical results to devise an adaptive packetization scheme. The proposed packetization scheme adaptively adjusts the packet length of transmissions based on the prediction of the packet loss rate and loss-burst/loss-gap lengths of the wireless channel. Via extensive simulations, we show that with the proposed packetization scheme, the channel throughput can be enhanced by more than 10% than the traditional scheme.

The control goal is the full utilisation of network links without incurring cell losses. A fluid model approximation of cell flows is assumed and linear differential equations are used to model the dynamics of network queues in response to ABR traffic and quality constrained (CBR+VBR) traffic. The available ABR bandwidth is modelled by means of an unknown and bounded disturbance function. A general end to end control algorithm that feeds back to the source the space that is free in the network buffers is included in the model and a particular one is proposed which is based on Smith’s principle. The linearity and the simplicity of the proposed control law allow us to prove, via mathematical analysis, that the algorithm always guarantees no cell losses whereas full utilisation of network links is ensured if the capacity of per-VC buffers is at least equal to the VC bandwidth-delay product. Moreover, per-VC queuing easily allows switches to enforce fairness. Finally, it is shown how performance evaluation can be easily carried out using SIMULINK for MATLAB, which is a software tool widely used by control engineers to simulate dynamic systems. In this way, the effort to develop discrete event simulations is saved.	atm turbo;algorithm;control theory;network congestion;performance evaluation	Saverio Mascolo	1997			control engineering;real-time computing;control theory	Networks	-2.8453756502224947	95.6714644774553	166037

An application of particular interest is platooning of trucks, where it has been shown that keeping a minimum inter-vehicle distance results in considerably reduced fuel consumption. This, however, puts high requirements on timeliness and reliability of the underlying exchange of control messages between platoon members. The European profile of IEEE 802.11p, recently adopted by ETSI, defines two message types to this end, periodic beacons for basic cooperative awareness (CAM) and event-triggered decentralized environmental notification messages (DENM), both of which will use one common control channel. IEEE 802.11p employs a random medium access protocol, which may experience excessive delays during high network loads. To mitigate these effects, ETSI standardizes a decentralized congestion control algorithm to, e.g., lower the CAM update frequency during high loads. However, this may prevent proper functionality of a platooning application. In this paper we propose a solution that instead uses a dedicated service channel for platooning applications and compare its performance to standard-compliant IEEE 802.11p inter-platoon communication on the control channel. Service channels typically have less strict requirements on send rates, data traffic types and medium access methods. Our service channel solution combines a random access phase for DENM with a centralized, scheduled access phase for CAM. Using a service channel enables us to guarantee timely channel access for all CAM packets before a specified deadline while still being able to provide a reasonable DENM dissemination delay.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;centralized computing;control system;event-driven programming;marker-and-cell method;network congestion;random access;requirement;scheduling (computing);time of arrival;transceiver	Annette Böhm;Magnus Jonsson;Elisabeth Uhlemann	2013	2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2013.6673411	telecommunications;computer science;computer security;communications system;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Mobile	5.891002256586155	90.92244601373348	166051

However, these contention-based MAC protocols do not coordinate between nodes at different hops within a multi-hop flow. This results in channel resource and node transmission power wastage and overall system throughput degradation. In this paper we present a novel distributed flow-based scheduling (DFBS) scheme that coordinates between neighbor links of a multi-hop flow. As demonstrated by the simulation results, DFBS achieves higher throughput and improves the transmission efficiency when traffic load is relatively high.	algorithm;bottleneck (network);downstream (software development);elegant degradation;hoc (programming language);scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Daiqin Yang;Victor O.

A few analytical studies carried out in NoC modeling have been adopted assumptions such as exponentially-distributed packet inter-arrivals, and conclusions reached under such assumptions may be inappropriate in the presence of self-similar traffic. Through mathematical analysis this paper predicts the optimal buffer size under self-similar traffic using Discrete Poisson Pareto Burst Process (DPPBP). The validity of the mathematical expressions is demonstrated through simulation experiments.	algorithm;deterministic routing;experiment;function overloading;network congestion;network on a chip;pareto efficiency;rendering (computer graphics);router (computing);self-similarity;simulation;spatial variability	Ahmad Khonsari;Mohammad R.

Type-1 flow is assumed to have a higher priority than type-2 flow thus, it is never rejected upon arrival. Type-2 flow, on the other hand, may be denied admission to the queue. Once accepted to the system, a packet joins queue 1 and is guaranteed service independent of its type. Instead of being rejected from service, packets have the option to be served at a slower server behind a second queue (queue 2) at node A. The slow server is intended mostly to serve low priority packets, therefore, type-1 packets are charged a switching cost in the event they are sent to queue 2. Transmitted packets receive a reward depending on which queue they were served at. The reward represents the resources saved for making that decision. A good path-scheduling policy at node A can reduce resource consumption at node A, extend the life of the efficient path, maximizes the service of both flows and guarantees the service of at least the high priority flow to the full extent. We propose and solve the path-scheduling problem for node A, which maximizes the average reward of successfully transmitting flows to a given sink, by dynamically assigning packets to one of the queues based on the packet type, the instantaneous queue lengths and the average reward for the associated path. We formulated the path-scheduling problem as a Markov decision process and show that the optimal policy is threshold-type.	computation;markov chain;markov decision process;multipath routing;network packet;priority queue;quality of service;retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);server (computing);transmitter	Essia Hamouda Elhafsi;Nathalie Mitton;David Simplot-Ryl	2012	2012 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer & Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)		real-time computing;multilevel queue;double-ended priority queue;computer science;distributed computing;queue management system;fork–join queue;run queue;queue;priority queue;computer network	Metrics	3.095671458886742	93.17609015041938	166499
70881ffcad5e90936457cd565a23c8653faf32ff	supporting multimedia streaming and best-effort data transmission over ieee 802.11e edca	data transmission;multimedia streaming;best effort	As demand for broadband multimedia wireless services increases, improving quality of service (QoS) of the widely deployed IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN (WLAN) has become crucial. To support the QoS required by a wide range of applications, the IEEE 802.11 working group has defined a new standard: IEEE 802.11e. In this paper, we propose a measurement-based dynamic media time allocation (MBDMTA) scheme combined with a concatenating window scheme to support real-time variable bit rate (rt-VBR) video and best-effort (BE) data transmission using IEEE 802.11e enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA). To provide the QoS guarantee for rt-VBR video, the proposed MBDMTA scheme dynamically assigns channel time to the rt-VBR video based on the estimate of the required network resources. On the other hand, the concatenating window scheme controls the contention window (CW) ranges of different priority flows such that real-time services always have higher channel access probability, thus achieving the capability of preemptive priorities. In addition, the concatenating window scheme preserves fairness among flows of the same class and attains high channel utilization under different network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the throughput and delay performance improve significantly for the transmission of rt-VBR video and BE traffic as compared to those for the 802.11e EDCA specification. It is also revealed that combining the two proposed schemes provides seamless integration and reliable transmission of digital video and data service within the 802.11e EDCA framework.

Most previous work and studies have focused only on the real-time support imposed by the isochronous requirements of the video or audio sources. This paper reports the results of our early study on how ATM can support real-time and prioritized traffic. We describe some basic approaches in handling real-time quality of service parameters within the context of ATM, and observe from simulation experiments that simple priority-based scheduling approaches at the virtual circuit level provides improvement in the deadline guarantee for all real-time traffic, especially the burst traffic. We believe that additional techniques such as deadline-based scheduling will be necessary to provide better real-time support.	atm turbo;distributed computing;experiment;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;virtual circuit	Aloke Guha;Allalaghatta Pavan	1994		10.1109/ICDCS.1994.302424	communications protocol;real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;atm adaptation layer;asynchronous transfer mode;distributed computing;variable bitrate;virtual circuit;scheduling;computer network	Embedded	-4.434043732930951	97.91467198744077	166574

The key idea is to maintain the history of channel utilization in each node and based on the recorded information the node router can predict the current load of the network and route packets through less trafficked or more appropriate channels to avoid congestion. Three dynamic channel selection policies, DCS-I, DCS-II and DCS-III, have been designed, each with specific advantages, to fit different situations. Performance of six established adaptive routing algorithms with five channel selection policies are evaluated through simulation. The results exhibit that when network traffic gets heavy, the proposed DCS-II and DCS-III yield constantly better performance in terms of throughput and communication latency than the other selection policies. DCS-II and DCS-III are also shown to bring about more even buffer utilization - manifesting the important link between balanced network traffic and desired performance.

In this paper, a contention-based slotted Aloha random access procedure for M2M network is first analyzed using different performance metrics. The impact of massive M2M traffic over cellular traffic is studied based on different arrival rate, random access opportunity and throughput. Then, an analytical model of selecting a base station (eNB) along with load balancing is developed. Finally, a dynamic access class barring method and RAN level congestion control mechanism by selecting the appropriate eNB is presented and evaluated with M2M traffic.	access control;load balancing (computing);m2m (eclipse);network congestion;numerical method;queueing theory;radio access network;random access;throughput	Lilatul Ferdouse;Alagan Anpalagan	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343496	database index;throughput;real-time computing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;computer network	Metrics	5.393940236706533	98.08563154609324	166812

However, the setting of the queue thresholds is problematic because the required buffer size for good sharing among TCP connections is dependent on the number of TCP connections using the buffer. This paper describes an improved active queue management scheme which dynamically changes its threshold settings as the number of connections and system load changes.

However, it is challenging to adapt AQM parameters in response to dynamic network scenarios with varying round-trip time, link capacity and traffic load. In order to maintain a stable queue with desired performance such as high link utilization and low queuing delay, this paper proposes a Statistical Adapting RED (SA-RED) to dynamically tune RED parameters based on the standard deviation of instantaneous queue size, which can be readily measured in practice. The proposed mechanism and corresponding algorithms can be implemented easily because they avoid the problem of measuring network parameters, such as the round-trip time and number of TCP flows. In addition, they are effective in achieving high performance, i.e., maintaining low queuing delay while providing the desired transient and steady-state performance under widely varying network conditions. These advantages are demonstrated by extensive NS-2 simulation experiments.	active queue management;algorithm;experiment;queuing delay;simulation;steady state;telecommunications network	Wu Chen;Geyong Min;Honggang Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503502	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;queue management system;active queue management;queuing delay;computer network	Metrics	-2.731573534693163	95.19929259847187	166849

Following the guidelines detailed in RFC 2990, we recently proposed an admission control function, named Gauge & Gate Reservation with Independent Probing (GRIP), through which we are able to provide QoS guarantees by means of stateless procedures compliant within the Differentiated Service (DiffServ) paradigm, which is the de facto standard for QoS provisioning in Internet. The main goal of this paper is to present a specific implementation of GRIP optimized for supporting voice over IP (VoIP) services within a DiffServ cloud. In particular, we propose and analyze a simple measurement-based call admission control procedure for carrying VoIP traffic in a DiffServ environment. We assume voice sources are leaky bucket controlled with known leaky bucket parameters. We analyze the leaky bucket to derive the distribution of the times over which voice sources generate traffic at peak and regulated rates. We use the results of that analysis, which provides complete knowledge of the traffic generation characteristics of a single source, to derive a Markov chain model that characterizes the voice packet generation process of a single voice source. We then derive a simple stateless threshold policy for admission control; that is, our policy is of the form if, at admission request time, x 6 xthreshold , admit the call; else reject the call. Finally, we show, via simulation, that the QoS achieved using the threshold-based admission control policy is very close to that achieved by a stateful admission control policy even at very high traffic utilization. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To provide services anywhere and anytime in such a diverse networking environment, vertical handoff is still a crucial target. In this paper we propose non-real time services vertical handoff decision algorithm NRS-VDA. NRS-VDA is an intelligent vertical handoff decision algorithm that can manage efficient vertical handoff initiation and decision procedure between UMTS and WL AN networks. NRS-VDA ensures the avoidance of unnecessary and detrimental vertical handoffs and provides high throughput and low blocking probability. NRS-VDA is defined for upward and downward vertical handoff scenarios. The proposed algorithm takes several metrics into account such as velocity of mobile terminal, bandwidth, and Received Signal Strength (RSS) of the network. It is suggested that NRS-VDA will improve the overall efficiency of vertical handoff in Next Generation Networks (NGN).	anytime algorithm;blocking (computing);decision problem;erlang (unit);mobile phone;next-generation network;rss;throughput;vda-fs;velocity (software development)	Safdar Rizvi;Asif Aziz;Naufal M.

Thus, a main requirement for future networks is high reliability and efficiency to cope with the associated quality of service demands. Hence, a vital interaction between error-correction, network technologies and suitable network resource utilization constitute a hard challenge for traffic engineers. In prior work it has been shown that the data distribution with traditional endto-end schemes is less optimal compared to multi-hop schemes, that is treating network segments individually. In this paper we present a theoretical analysis based on Shannon's coding theorem that concludes a promising data-rate reduction from the segmentation approach. Additionally, we propose a transparent protocol termination mechanism for software-defined networks (SDN) that allows to segment an end-to-end transmission path without any modification at the sending or receiving devices. Eventually, a detailed implementation approach for SDNs running Open Flow is given.	data rate units;end-to-end principle;error detection and correction;exabyte;multicast;openflow;quality of service;shannon (unit);shannon–hartley theorem;software-defined networking;unicast;zettabyte	Michael Karl;Thorsten Herfet	2014	2014 IEEE 28th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2014.35	openflow;communications protocol;channel code;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;software-defined networking;redundancy;computer security;computer network	Mobile	-4.1218030922633035	90.61665683458885	167336
ec55cf079e1d5a3d0e653e51fc60cfe4d4807acd	bridging inter-flow and intra-flow network coding for video applications: testbed description and performance evaluation	protocols;network coding;reliability	Network Coding (NC) for Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) has received a lot of attention from the research community in recent years due to its ability to provide higher throughput, reliability, and efficiency in the use of the available wireless spectrum. NC has had two main research lines focused on inter-flow and intra-flow coding. However, these two domains have historically been studied separately. This paper proposes a testbed implementation of CORE, the first protocol to bridge both approaches such that the structure of intra-flow coding can be exploited during inter-flow coding to both enhance reliability, common of the former, while maintaining an efficient spectrum usage, typical of the latter. This paper uses the intuition provided in [1] to propose a practical implementation of the protocol leveraging Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) for intra-flow coding, a credit based packet transmission approach to decide how much and when to send redundancy in the network, and a minimalistic feedback mechanism to guarantee delivery of generations of the different flows. Given the delay constraints of video applications, we proposed a simple yet effective coding mechanism, Block Coding On The Fly (BCFly), that allows a block encoder to be fed on-the-fly, thus reducing the delay to accumulate enough packets that is introduced by typical generation based NC techniques. Our measurements and comparison to forwarding and COPE show that CORE not only outperforms these schemes even for small packet losses, but that the gains can be of five fold and two orders of magnitude, respectively, for higher packet losses.	bridging (networking);encoder;feedback;flow network;fold (higher-order function);linear network coding;multi-core processor;network packet;on the fly;performance evaluation;testbed;throughput;wireless mesh network	Jonas Hansen;Jeppe Krigslund;Daniel Enrique Lucani;Frank H.

To provide high throughput in UWB networks, we proposed a general framework for CSMA/CA based MAC protocol previously [17]. In this framework, multiple upper layer packets can be assembled into a single burst frame at the MAC layer, which can significantly improve the throughput performance by reducing overheads. Nevertheless, the burst assembly procedure may introduce extra packet delay, which is undesirable for some applications. In this paper, we address the performance issue in the burst-frame-based MAC protocol. In particular, we develop an analytical model to evaluate the delay performance of the burst-frame-based MAC protocol under unsaturated conditions. Our delay analysis is unique in that we consider the end-to-end packet delay, which is the duration from the epoch that a packet enters the queue at the MAC layer of the transmitter side to the epoch that the packet is successfully received at the receiver side. The analytical results give excellent agreement with the simulation results, which represents the accuracy of our analytical model. The results also provide important guideline on how to set the parameters of the burst assembly policy. Based on these results, we develop an efficient adaptive burst assembly policy so as to optimize the throughput and delay performance of the burst-frame-based CSMA/CA protocol.	data rate units;end-to-end principle;network packet;simulation;throughput;transmitter;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video	Kejie Lu;Jianfeng Wang;Dapeng Wu;Yuguang Fang	2006		10.1145/1185373.1185388	high-throughput screening;real-time computing;quality of service;network analysis;telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband;transmission delay;computer network	Mobile	8.411951738856635	93.34369282773602	167461

The LP formulation is attractive in the present and future communication networks, which support an increasing number of classes of service, since it can be used to explicitly control class-level requirements, such as class blocking probabilities. On the other hand, the LP formulation suffers from scalability problems as the number C of classes increases. This article proposes a new LP formulation, which, even if it does not introduce any approximation, is much more scalable: the problem size reduction with respect to the standard LP formulation is O((C + 1)2/2C). Theoretical and numerical simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.		Antonio Pietrabissa	2011	Int. J.

The end-to-end filetransfer delay depends on both logical and physical topologies resulting from overlay routing. In this paper, we focus on six types of four-terminal four-router physical network, and investigate the impact of topology inconsistency on the file-transfer delay. The analysis model is based on a two-layer queueing network, taking into account both logical and physical topologies. The model is validated in comparison with ns-2 simulation. Numerical examples show that the end-to-end file-transfer delay is small when both logical and physical topologies are the same. It is also observed that the end-to-end delay significantly depends on the traffic intensity for some logical topologies, regardless of physical topology.	end-to-end principle;file transfer;overlay network;queueing theory;router (computing);routing;simulation	Yasuo Tamura;Shoji Kasahara;Yutaka Takahashi;Satoshi Kamei;Ryoichi Kawahara	2008	Perform.

The objective is to propose an effective paging procedure whose performance is measured in terms of paging load, average paging delay, and paging success probability. In the paging procedure, paging signals are transmitted via group simulcasting, for which the control channel is allocated dynamically. The performance of the procedure is analyzed in an approximate queueing network model. The proposed procedure is then compared in performance with a simulation approach, from which the procedure is found to outperform any previous methods in the literature.	approximation algorithm;load (computing);memory management;network model;page replacement algorithm;paging;queueing theory;simulation;simulcast	Chang Sup Sung;Hyoun Chul Rim;Jung Sup Lee	2003	IEEE Trans.

As most data-link layer protocols, it does not have a recovery feature as data integrity is supervised by the connection-oriented transport protocols. Nevertheless, VST-TDMA possesses the flexibility to easily incorporate a retransmission feature that allows the users to experience higher throughput when using applications that use the Transmission Control Protocol, which transports approximately 90% of all Internet traffic. Results show that depending on the wireless link reliability, i.e., the frame loss rate, the throughput can be improved by a factor of ten.	centralized computing;connection-oriented communication;data integrity;decade (log scale);retransmission (data networks);serial experiments lain;throughput;x10	Vanessa Quintero;Claudio Estevez	2017	2017 IEEE 9th Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)	10.1109/LATINCOM.2017.8240173	throughput;internet traffic;wireless network;picocell;retransmission;computer network;time division multiple access;data integrity;transmission control protocol;computer science	Mobile	-3.2215499868406283	90.53568326859836	168788

The proposed protocol is applicable for contention-based MACs and is therefore compatible with most of the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) protocols. The protocol has a locally centralized control for managing data flows, which either reserve a fixed bandwidth or are weighted by fair scheduling. The protocol reduces transmission collisions, thus improving the overall throughput. IEEE 802.11 adhoc WLAN has been taken as a platform for simulations and prototyping for evaluating the protocol performance. Network Simulator Version 2 (NS2) simulations show that the CoS protocol efficiently differentiates bandwidth, supports bandwidth reservations, and reaches less than 10 ms transfer delay on IEEE 802.11b WLAN.

We present HiPeR-`, a new reservation protocol speciically designed to overcome the potential ineeciencies of operating in environments with non-negligible processing, tuning, and propagation delays. HiPeR-` diiers from previous reservation protocols in that each control packet makes reservations for all data packets waiting in a node's queues, thus signiicantly reducing control overhead. Packets are scheduled for transmission using algorithms that can eeectively mask the tuning times. HiPeR-` also uses pipelining to mask processing times and propagation delays. We use Markov chain theory to obtain a necessary and suucient condition for the stability of the protocol. The stability condition provides insight into the factors aaecting the operation of the protocol, such as the degree of load balancing across the various channels, and the quality of the scheduling algorithms. The analysis is fairly general, as it holds for MMBP-like arrival processes with any number of states, and for non-uniform destinations.	algorithm;load balancing (computing);markov chain;network packet;overhead (computing);pipeline (computing);propagation delay;scheduling (computing);software propagation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Vijay Sivaraman;George N.

The main advantage of OBS is that it allows for dynamic allocation of resources at sub-wavelength granularity. Nevertheless, the burst contention problem, which occurs frequently inside the network, has to be addressed before OBS can be really deployed as the next generation optical transport network. Recently a lot of attention is devoted to different approaches for resolving contentions in OBS networks. Although performance analysis of these approaches is strongly dependent on the traffic characteristics in the network, the majority of the studies is so far based on very hypothetical traffic assumptions. In this study we use traces of real measurements in the Internet to derive realistic data about the traffic that is injected into the OBS network. Specifically, we investigate the marginal distributions of burst size, burst interdeparture time, assembly delay and number of packets per burst as well as the burstiness of the burst traces. We demonstrate that the performance of an OBS core node using the real traces is pretty similar to the results obtained when the traffic arriving to the core node is assumed to be Poisson. In fact, usage of the Poisson as the process of burst arrival to the core node leads in all the investigated cases to an upper bound on the burst drop rate at that node.

MFCR overcomes the """"integer nature"""" of traditional channel reservation schemes (also referred to as guard channel, trunk reservation, or cutoff priority) that precludes them to achieve maximum system capacity in single- and multiservice environments. Contrary to the rest of the channel reservation schemes previously proposed in the literature on the topic, MFCR reserves, on average, real numbers of channels to prioritize new and/or handoff calls in multiple service environments. Given a set of requirements on new call blocking and forced termination probabilities for each service type, MFCR maximizes system capacity while meeting the quality of service (QoS) constraints in multiservice mobile cellular networks. It finely controls the communication service quality, by varying the average numbers of reserved channels by a fraction of one. Determining the right amount of resources (cutoff threshold or number of reserved channels) to prioritize each call type and to satisfy all QoS constraints in multiservice environments, however, is a difficult task. Selecting the optimal prioritization order is not an easy process either, as it is affected by QoS constraints, system characteristics, and resource sharing. Thus, an heuristic algorithm to determine the optimum numbers of reserved (resources) channels to achieve maximum system capacity when using the MFCR is also proposed. To our knowledge, the capacity optimization problem considering individual QoS constraints had only been addressed in single service environments. Also, a comprehensive survey on channel reservation strategies proposed in the literature has been included."""	capacity optimization;mathematical optimization;mobile phone	Heraclio Heredia-Ureta;Felipe A.

Still a reasonable high bandwidth is required for achieving high quality streaming. Instead of using hard reservations to guaranty the quality of the video transmissions we present an adaptive streaming algorithm based on adaptive packet marking which provides soft guarantees. A prototype streaming server and client have been developed supporting RTP-encapsulated MPEG-2 transmission, into which the adaptive streaming algorithm has been integrated. The software has been successfully used in a testbed, demonstrating that the algorithm is effective and has very promising properties.	adaptive filter;bandwidth (signal processing);best-effort delivery;differentiated services;display resolution;ip camera;ip traceback;internet protocol suite;item unique identification;mpeg-2;network packet;prototype;quad flat no-leads package;server (computing);streaming algorithm;streaming media;testbed	Sebastian Zander;Georg Carle	2002		10.1007/3-540-45859-X_7	internet protocol;active traffic management;real-time computing;the internet;telecommunications;differentiated service;computer science;streaming algorithm;service quality;algorithm;computer network	Networks	-3.074927299617353	102.6212719493043	169869

We study two types of buffering policies that are used in network switches supporting QoS. In the FIFO type, packets must be transmitted in the order they arrive. In the uniform bounded delay type, there is a maximal delay time associated with the switch and each packet must be transmitted within this time, or otherwise it is dropped. In both models the buffer space is limited, and packets are lost when the buffer overflows. Each packet has an intrinsic value, and the goal is to maximize the total value of transmitted packets. Our main contribution is an algorithm for the FIFO model with arbitrary packet values that for the first time achieves a competitive ratio better than 2, namely 2-ε for a constant ε gt; 0. We also describe an algorithm for the uniform bounded delay model which simulates our algorithm for the FIFO model, and show that it achieves the same competitive ratio.	algorithm;buffer overflow;competitive analysis (online algorithm);differentiated services;fifo (computing and electronics);maximal set;network packet;network switch;quality of service	Alexander Kesselman;Yishay Mansour;Rob van Stee	2005	Algorithmica	10.1007/s00453-005-1158-x	competitive analysis;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;end-to-end delay;computer network	Theory	0.48486444819025415	101.17259585697386	170032

cd2d9b4e690101a063cc22d8f2b6be8f2b0a0aef	credit based fairness control in wireless sensor network		Fairness is an essential problem in congestion control, which is to ensure all data sources have equal or weighted access to end-to-end network bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a practical fairness model CFRC to allocate congested bandwidth based on the credit of each sensor source instead of uniformly. Credit represents the effective amount of sensed information of packet generated in sensor source. In CFRC, a low-cost credit computation method ACCA is proposed for each source node to compute its credit locally based on the sensed area of it and its neighbors; Aggregation node computes the credit of aggregated packets using simple sum operation. Furthermore, an interferer aware fair rate allocation algorithm IFRA is proposed in CFRC to allocated bandwidth not only among all upstream neighbors, but also among congested nodes and its interferers. Simulation results verify the performance of CFRC.	algorithm;computation;end-to-end encryption;fairness measure;network congestion;network packet;simulation	Shanshan Li;Xiangke Liao;Shaoliang Peng;Peidong Zhu;Jie Jiang	2007	Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2007)	10.1109/SNPD.2007.286	fairness measure;network traffic control;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;max-min fairness;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Embedded	2.780312687057783	92.34727963104113	170341

The smallest logical bandwidth allocation unit in OFDMA-based WiMAX is a slot. In this article, we use the term slot to introduce a new performance criterion, called multicast gain, which can be used for computing multicast efficiency. We analyze multicast transmission for delivery of live TV channels in WiMAX-based access networks, and determine the gain to be expected for access links in order to quantify the benefits of multicasting. We show that for unpopular TV channels, using unicast flows can be a better choice.	access network;data compression;digital distribution;iptv;join (sql);multicast;overhead (computing);provisioning;requirement;scalability;scalable video coding;scheduling (computing);signal-to-noise ratio;television channel;uncompressed video;unicast	Alireza Abdollahpouri;Bernd E.

The focus is on optimal tradeoffs between energy efficiency and TCP throughput over burst-error correlated fading channels. The channel model is adopted for low mobility PA applications. Both high-speed PA (HSPA) and low-speed PA (LSPA) with radio-link retransmission-and-error-control protocols are studied. By theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that in HSPA adapting the radio-packet retransmission period to the channel conditions significantly reduces the number of retransmissions while maintaining adequate TCP performance. This method is referred to as smart packet dispatching (SPD). In LSPA, adapting the length of radio packets to the channel conditions significantly increases the effective TCP throughput. This method is referred to as smart packet length (SPL). The SPD and SPL, commonly called smart packet access (SPA), are capable of avoiding burst-error states of correlated fading channels and therefore enhance the robustness of radio transmissions and allow the system to operate with much lower fade margin or transmit-power. Furthermore, the SPA schemes improve energy efficiency and system performance without need of excessive signal processing.	burst error;channel (communications);internet protocol suite;network packet;pa-risc;retransmission (data networks);signal processing;simulation;throughput	Vinh Van Phan;Savo Glisic;Dung Dinh Luong	2005	Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2005.238	real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;telecommunications;computer science;signal processing;efficient energy use;zeta-tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;computer network	Mobile	8.440602762863053	95.177713305233	170606

However, ECCP uses a self-induced congestion probing model which can cause queue length fluctuation in addition to the network bandwidth wastage due to the probes. Therefore, we propose enhancements to the algorithm used by ECCP to reduce probe packet overhead. In our solution NoP-ECCP (ECCP with no probes), we use a link utilization estimation technique instead of the estimation of the available bandwidth. The results obtained through simulations show that NoP-ECCP outperforms ECCP in terms of fairness, link utilization and queue length.	algorithm;backplane;computation;dpdk / dpdk.org;experiment;fairness measure;forwarding plane;nop slide;network congestion;network packet;network switch;network topology;overhead (computing);proactive parallel suite;quantum fluctuation;router (computing);scalability;simulation;universal conductance fluctuations	Mahmoud Mohamed Bahnasy;Bochra Boughzala;Halima Elbiaze;Brian Alleyne;André Béliveau;Chakri Padala	2016	2016 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2016.7440620	embedded system;real-time computing;ethernet flow control;engineering;network congestion;computer network	Metrics	-3.529569926196503	93.190944943832	170631

The purpose of this research was to construct a simulation study to determine whether the communications architecture of Land Warrior was sufficiently scalable to use in large Army units. This paper describes the input analysis conducted to determine probability distributions used to generate message traffic.

7e98cbfe7705c4acd5beb31ec6a6caa4a139e253	on minimizing the completion times of long flows over inter-datacenter wan		"""Long flows contribute huge volumes of traffic over inter-datacenter WAN. The flow completion time (FCT) is a vital network performance metric that affects the running time of distributed applications and the users’ quality of experience. Flow routing techniques based on propagation or queuing latency or instantaneous link utilization are insufficient for minimization of the long flows’ FCT. We propose a routing approach that uses the remaining sizes and paths of all ongoing flows to minimize the worst case completion time of incoming flows assuming no knowledge of future flow arrivals. Our approach can be formulated as an NP-Hard graph optimization problem. We propose <italic>BWRH</italic>, a heuristic to quickly generate an approximate solution. We evaluate <italic>BWRH</italic> against several real-WAN topologies and two different traffic patterns. We see that <italic>BWRH</italic> provides solutions with an average optimality gap of less than 0.25%. Furthermore, we show that compared with other popular routing heuristics, <italic>BWRH</italic> reduces the mean and tail FCT by up to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$1.46\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$1.53\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula>, respectively."""

ff0b98fd3d9ee7807255df9aec27b3f6f2b62d84	optimal redundancy control strategy for fountain code-based underwater acoustic communication		In this paper, a transmission redundancy optimization strategy for fountain codes that uses an adaptive filtering technique as well as recent results concerning the upper bound of the source packet erasure probability for fountain codes over finite fields is proposed. The performance of the proposed strategy was evaluated in static and simulated realistic underwater acoustic channel environments simulated by a recently proposed statistical underwater acoustic channel model. The goal of this investigation is to improve the communication efficiency of underwater acoustic sensor networks that use communication protocols based on fountain codes. The performance of the proposed strategy is compared with the recently proposed approaches of discrete stochastic approximation (DSA) and the joint power and rate control (JPR) schemes. The simulation results demonstrate that the strategy proposed in this paper performs better than the existing schemes in both static and simulated realistic environments. The proposed strategy is 4.75 times better than the DSA in the static convergence performance evaluation. Further analysis shows that in the presence of a simulated realistic environment, compared to DSA and JPR, the strategy proposed in this paper reduces the overall transmission redundancy by approximately 11.4% and 52.6%, respectively. It also improves the average communication efficiency by 1.3% and 12.5%, respectively. The average optimization error relative to optimal redundancy is improved by approximately 62.1% and 92.5%, respectively. These numerical results are obtained by employing the specific simulation parameters and the simulated environment mentioned in this paper.

In this paper we propose a resource allocation algorithm for scalable video broadcast over such wireless networks. Our algorithm allocates time slots among the video layers of a scalable video and applies adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) to each video layer to maximize the sum of utilities for heterogeneous users with varying QoS requirements. It also considers competing video sessions and allocates time slots among them according to user preferences. Additionally, its polynomial time-complexity allows for online resource allocation that is necessary for real-time video services. Simulation experiments show that our algorithm outperforms a single-layer video broadcast with fixed modulation and coding (FMC), used in broadcast and multicast services (BCMCS) in the CDMA2000 system, and produce a near-optimal allocation.	advanced mezzanine card;algorithm;data rate units;experiment;flight management system;mathematical optimization;modulation;multicast;network packet;polynomial;real-time clock;requirement;scalability;simulation;time complexity;user (computing)	Junu Kim;Jinsung Cho;Heonshik Shin	2005	WiMob'2005), IEEE International Conference on Wireless And Mobile Computing, Networking And Communications, 2005.	10.1109/WIMOB.2005.1512867	time complexity;broadcast radiation;real-time computing;atomic broadcast;index term;quality of service;link adaptation;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;wireless network;broadcasting;computer network	Mobile	5.240072755444821	99.54559187071717	171474

It is an extension of the basic distributed queue protocol defined in the IEEE 802.6 DQDB MAN Standard. The extended distributed queueing protocol differs from the basic protocol in allowing more than one outstanding request in the distributed queue at any one time. Used at the high priority and in conjunction with segment stream shaping and subscribed service limiting, the extended protocol provides bearer services with guaranteed bandwidth and bounded delays. Bearer services with fair but nonguaranteed bandwidth shares, suitable for nnontimeconstrained applications, are provided by the same protocol and bandwidth balancing operating at the lowest priority. A number of the desirable attributes of the proposed scheme are identified including the optimality of the delay variance introduced by the access protocol. An approximate analysis of the access delay experience by time-constrained streams is presented.	approximation algorithm;bus network;integrated services;noise shaping	Guven Mercankosk;Zigmantas L.

Previous work either considers open-loop traffic or only analyzes persistent TCP flows. This paper differs in two ways. First, it considers the more realistic case of nonpersistent TCP flows with heavy-tailed size distribution. Second, instead of only looking at link metrics, it focuses on the impact of buffer sizing on TCP performance. Specifically, our goal is to find the buffer size that maximizes the average per-flow TCP throughput. Through a combination of testbed experiments, simulation, and analysis, we reach the following conclusions. The output/input capacity ratio at a network link largely determines the required buffer size. If that ratio is larger than 1, the loss rate drops exponentially with the buffer size and the optimal buffer size is close to 0. Otherwise, if the output/input capacity ratio is lower than 1, the loss rate follows a power-law reduction with the buffer size and significant buffering is needed, especially with TCP flows that are in congestion avoidance. Smaller transfers, which are mostly in slow-start, require significantly smaller buffers. We conclude by revisiting the ongoing debate on ldquosmall versus largerdquo buffers from a new perspective.	router (computing)	Ravi S.

Consequently, demand of delay and throughput sensitive services, like audio/video is also increasing. Information Centric Networking (ICN) is proposed as an architecture for the future Internet to meet the modern users and application requirements. In ICN users send requests (Interest Packets) for the Data they need. Interest packet is assigned a lifetime, which greatly affects the Quality of Experience (QoE) because user needs to resend the Interest, when the lifetime expires. Interest lifetime may be expired because of congestion, or Interest lifetime is shorter than the network delay, etc. Waiting for the expiration of an Interest lifetime to resend it is merely appropriate for best effort traffic, rather than services which require high throughput and are delay sensitive. In this paper, we propose Network-Assisted Congestion Control mechanism in ICN, which detects the congestion before it happens, and provides notification to downstream node. On reception of the notification, downstream node continuously reduces the traffic rate. However, when the downstream node fails to adjust the sending rate, the same procedure continues, until the sending node reduces the traffic rate through adjusting its congestion window. We have intensively evaluated our proposal by comparing it with similar proposal using ndnSIM. The experimental results show that our proposal achieves up to 59 percent performance improvement over other proposal in the literature.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;buffer overflow;downstream (software development);future internet;icn gps;network congestion;network packet;requirement;retransmission (data networks);simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput;token bucket;traffic exchange	Anselme Ndikumana;Saeed Ullah;Rossi Kamal;Kyi Thar;Hyo Sung Kang;Seung Il Moon;Choong Seon Hong	2015	2015 17th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)	10.1109/APNOMS.2015.7275367	face;throughput;network traffic control;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;bismuth;network congestion;computer security;slow-start;computer network	Networks	-3.791072040979872	92.4778920233361	172047
3e4cba995de36713842f439333a5aca48fa6a10a	drone-based highway-vanet and das service		Wireless communications between vehicles are a focus of research in both the academic research community and automobile industry. Using unmanned aerial vehicles or drones in wireless communications and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have started to attract attention. This paper proposes a routing protocol that uses the infrastructure drones for boosting VANET communications to achieve a minimum vehicle-to-drone packet delivery delay. This paper also proposes a closed-form expression for the probability distribution of the vehicle-to-drone packet delivery delay on a two-way highway. In addition, based on that closed-form expression, we can calculate the minimum drone density (maximum separation distance between two adjacent drones) that stochastically limits the worst case of the vehicle-to-drone packet delivery delay. Moreover, this paper proposes a drones-active service that is added to the location service in a VANET. This service dynamically and periodically obtains the required number of active drones based on the current highway connectivity state by obtaining the maximum distance between each two adjacent drones while satisfying a probabilistic constraint for vehicle-to-drone packet delivery delay. Our analysis focuses on two-way highway VANET networks with low vehicular density. The simulation results show the accuracy of our analysis and reflect the relation between the drone density, vehicular density and speed, other VANET parameters, and the vehicle-to-drone packet delivery delay.	best, worst and average case;hoc (programming language);location-based service;network packet;routing;simulation;television antenna;unmanned aerial vehicle	Hafez Seliem;Reza Shahidi;Mohamed Hossam Ahmed;Mohamed S.

Voice over IP (VoIP) applications are widely spread due to their relatively low cost. Applying VoIP traffic on IEEE 802.11 WLANs introduces significant delays in the wireless medium due to the small size of voice packets. In this paper, we develop an analytical model for the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) considering voice and data stations transmitting simultaneously. Our new model calculates IEEE 802.11 DCF performance in terms of average delay, delay variation (jitter) and drop probability for voice packets. Metric values that constitute good voice quality are identified and based on these we develop a methodology for assessing the network's capacity in terms of good quality voice calls. The proposed analytical model is validated by comparing analytical results against simulation outcome. Finally, we study the impact of data transmissions on voice capacity and show that for every data session (a data station and a TCP-ACK station) added to a 802.11b WLAN, its voice capacity drops by 2 voice sessions (4 voice stations).	acknowledgement (data networks);carpal tunnel syndrome;codec;design rule for camera file system;network packet;overhead (computing);packet delay variation;rs-232;simulation;transmitter	Charisis Brouzioutis;Vasileios Vitsas;Periklis Chatzimisios	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502124	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;voice over ip;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Visualization	-2.290719661583266	92.77966508363825	172127

Different types of traffic information could be delivered through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to- infrastructure communications. This paper proposes a Quality-of-Service (QoS) supported multi-channel MAC scheme for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), which can adaptively tune the contention window for different services at each node, and dynamically adjust the intervals of the Control Channel (CCH) and the Service Channels (SCHs) working in multi-rate. Theoretical model is proposed to obtain the contention window and optimize the intervals based on traffic conditions. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed MAC is able to help IEEE 1690.4 MAC support QoS services, while ensuring the high saturation throughput and the prioritized transmission of critical safety information.	experiment;hoc (programming language);markov chain;microsoft windows;quality of service;simulation;stochastic process;system controller hub;throughput;vehicle-to-vehicle	Qing Wang;Supeng Leng;Yan Zhang;Huirong Fu	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956230	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;markov process;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.693986122219961	91.69478449648149	172128

Essentially, this is a multi-session multi-server problem, which so far has received little research. The above problem becomes more complicated in CDMA2000 1xEV-DV networks, where Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) schemes are employed for a higher network resource utilization. This means that the underlying service data rate of each code channel will be dynamically changing with the current perceived channel quality and the current number of available code channels. However, current research on packet fair queueing in wireless networks mostly use fixed service data rates. Therefore, how to design a packet fair queueing scheme with multiple servers and time-varying service data rates is very important for QoS provisioning in CDMA2000 1xEV-DV networks. In this paper, we propose a new packet fair queueing algorithm, where it seamlessly integrates the fair queueing with the CDMA2000 1xEV-DV AMC scheme. Both theoretical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed fair queueing algorithm can provide fairness among different sessions as well as satisfy their QoS requirements.	advanced mezzanine card;algorithm;data rate units;fair queuing;fairness measure;modulation;network packet;network scheduler;provisioning;requirement;server (computing);simulation	Song Ci;Mohsen Guizani;Xi Zhang;Hsiao-Hwa Chen	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2006.255532	weighted fair queueing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;wireless network;fair queuing;layered queueing network;network congestion;computer network	Mobile	3.815702166550728	97.34826133145911	172402

Due to the delay-heterogeneity in uplink traffic, we classify it broadly into delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive traffic. We then map the diverse delay requirements of each class to sigmoidal functions of packet delay and formulate a utility-maximization problem that results in a proportionally fair delay-optimal scheduler. We note that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to solving for the optimal fraction of time each class is served with (preemptive) priority such that it maximizes the system utility. Using Monte-Carlo simulations for the queuing process at AS, we verify the correctness of the analytical result for optimal scheduler and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art packet schedulers such as weighted round robin, max-weight scheduler, fair scheduler and priority scheduling. We also note that at higher traffic arrival rate, the proposed scheduler results in a near-minimal delay variance for the delay-sensitive traffic which is highly desirable. This comes at the expense of somewhat higher delay variance for delay-tolerant traffic which is usually acceptable due to its delay-tolerant nature.	application server;correctness (computer science);dynamic priority scheduling;entropy maximization;fairness measure;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;network packet;network scheduler;optimization problem;packet delay variation;preemption (computing);proportionally fair;queueing theory;requirement;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);server (computing);sigmoid function;simulation;telecommunications link;time-sharing;weighted round robin	Akshay Kumar;Ahmed Abdel-Hadi;T.

4f592284fc12e027fc930b15af600647b66c2461	trade-off analysis of a service-oriented and hierarchical queuing mechanism		This paper sketches a service-oriented and hierarchical queuing mechanism designed to manage radio buffers while delivering web services. The goal is avoid buffer overflow implementing a three-level queuing mechanism. The first level is the message queue which stores messages from user-facing services. At the second level, the messages are fragmented into IP packets which are stored in the packet queue. Finally, the third level is the radio buffer itself. As a result, a multi-homed node has queues for each radio, capturing the likely differences of data rate, buffer size and current usage. A prototype based on web services was tested using real military radios; VHF radios with large coverage (∼20 km) but very low data rate (2.4–9.6 kbps). We analyzed the trade-offs within the system configuration, targeting at an optimal and robust radio buffer management.	buffer overflow;data rate units;message queue;multihoming;network packet;prototype;service-orientation;service-oriented device architecture;system configuration;uncompressed video;web service	Roberto Rigolin F.

Unfortunately, parallel download protocols are also inherently unfair towards single-flow downloads and may even starve them. This paper presents TCP-ROME, a parallel download protocol that allows a dynamic mitigation of throughput and fairness. The key novelty is a receiver-based framework that allows a dynamic adjustment of the congestion and rate control of each subconnection. TCP-ROME offers two usage modes: a binary mode where the congestion control of each subconnection can be switched between a TCP-fair rate (high priority) and at a TCP-LP fair rate (low priority), and a more complex range mode where the aggregated throughput aims at meeting a specified target rate. Apart from the protocol specification, this paper develops novel analytical throughput models for TCP-LP and for TCP-ROME. The models are validated via simulations. Extensive simulation scenarios show the flexibility of TCP-ROME in mitigating performance for fairness.	download;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;internet protocol suite;load balancing (computing);network congestion;server (computing);server-side;simulation;throughput	Ju-Won Park;Chan Kyou Hwang;Jae-Hyoung Yoo;Roger P.

Its performance depends mainly on how optical resource sharing takes place among the different competing access nodes. This network architecture has mostly been explored with regard to synchronous transmission, i.e., slotted wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) ring. However, in this paper, we focus on the performance of asynchronous transmission-based networks with variable packet sizes. Analytical models are presented in an attempt to provide explicit formulas that express the mean access delay of each node of the bus-based optical access network. We prove that in such a network, fairness problems are likely to arise between upstream and downstream nodes sharing a common data channel. Furthermore, we show that sharing the channel's available bandwidth fairly but arbitrarily between access nodes, as in slotted WDM rings, does not resolve the fairness problem in asynchronous system. In this regard, we exhibit the inherent limitations of the token bucket access rate-based algorithm once applied to asynchronous transmission bus-based networks. To alleviate the aforementioned problem, we device a new strategy called traffic control architecture using remote descriptors. The proposed solution is based on a preventive mechanism to grant access to the shared resource. As illustrated in this paper, the proposed solution alleviates the performance degradation and the resource underutilization, while achieving fairness among bus nodes.	access network;algorithm;asynchronous system;best-effort delivery;bus network;channel (communications);downstream (software development);elegant degradation;fairness measure;global variable;network architecture;network packet;quality of service;real-time transcription;requirement;simulation;terabyte;token bucket;upstream (software development);wavelength-division multiplexing	Nizar Bouabdallah;André-Luc Beylot;Emannuel Dotaro;Guy Pujolle	2005	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2005.851779	asynchronous system;shared resource;network architecture;channel access method;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;distributed computing;bus network;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network;access network	Metrics	-1.198605509296556	95.19510614197867	172674

It is shown that under fixed routing, the end-to-end delay of messages belonging to a particular source-destination node pair is given by a sum of independent and exponentially distributed random variables. The generalization of this basic result to random routing and to messages belonging to a group of a source-destination pairs is also considered. Numerical examples based on a hypothetical network are presented.		J. W.

The tradeoff between call blocking probability and LSPN is investigated and an objective function of maximizing LSPN is proposed. To solve the optimal problem, the system is modeled as a 2K-dimensional Markov process with following features. The multiclass service system can provide multiple service classes using either multicast traffic or unicast traffic and each service class has call level QoS requirements. A static channel allocation model is adopted as the multicast traffic integration scheme. By solving the objective function, an optimal proportion of multicast traffic to unicast traffic can be identified to maximize the service provision capacity while satisfying QoS constraints.	blocking (computing);erlang (unit);loss function;multicast;optimization problem;quality of service;requirement;unicast	Yi Huang;Lin Tian;Yubo Yang;Jinglin Shi;Eryk Dutkiewicz;Shuwei Yang	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.912	cellular network;real-time computing;multicast;ip multicast;computer science;resource management;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;markov process;source-specific multicast;xcast;statistics;computer network;multicast address;unicast	Metrics	5.442811283461405	98.8374248717455	173042

The OPC method imposes a preemptive priority regime in a non-priority system to capture the traffic load dependence among VoD servers. Comparison between OPC and EFP reveals that OPC is more accurate. The comparison is made with respect to two quality of service (QoS) measures, the loss probability and the probability that a video request is not served by the preferred VoD server given that it is not lost.	algorithm;approximation;erlang (programming language);fixed point (mathematics);network topology;open platform communications;preemption (computing);quality of service;routing;server (computing)	Eric Wing Ming Wong;Michael Y.

We develop and solve functional equations for various performance metrics of the system and apply the “Moving Server” technique to calculate the main component of the delay.

In a previous work, we proved that WAVE faces a spectrum scarcity problem which hinders reliable exchange of safety information. To overcome this problem, we proposed a system that applies cognitive networks principles to WAVE as to increase the spectrum allocated to the control channel (CCH) by the IEEE 802.11p amendment, where all safety information is transmitted. However, the decision making process in our previous work did not utilize the extra spectrum efficiently as it was not allocated according to the contention level experienced by the vehicle. In this paper, we suggest a system that employs a fuzzy logic system (FLS) to dynamically assign additional spectrum from the ISM band to the CCH. This system, which we call FCVANET, assigns the minimum necessary additional bandwidth to relieve the contention. The FLS takes as input 2 parameters, the message delay and the un-transmitted packets and utilizes a feedback loop. Our simulations show that the proposed system allocates bandwidth more efficiently in accordance with the contention level faced by the vehicles. The system succeeds to relieve contention by reducing delay and the number of un-transmitted packets.	cognitive network;computer simulation;feedback;free library of springfield township;fuzzy logic;hoc (programming language);implicit shape model;network packet;protocol stack;vehicle-to-vehicle	Ali J.

CS are modeled in Network Simulator 2 (NS-2), allowing the quantification of irregularities, including delays and dropped packets. The overall information is obtained combining SCADA measurements with phasor measurement unit (PMU) derived data, where time stamping (based on GPS or an equivalent local clock) for all measurements is assumed. To fully analyze the effects of irregularities, a detailed analysis of sensitivities to different communication system parameters is provided as well.

617f35633e7a865e2ccd828fe9b4a4c8a0823265	user profile based proportional share scheduling and mac protocol for manets		Quality of Service(QoS) in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) though a challenge, becomes a necessity because of its applications in critical scenarios. Providing QoS for users belonging to various profiles and playing different roles, becomes the need of the hour. In this paper, we propose proportional share scheduling and MAC protocol (PS2-MAC) model. It classifies users based on their profile as High Profiled users (HP), Medium Profiled users (MP) and Low profiled users (LP) and assigns proportional weights. Service Differentiation for these three service classes is achieved through, rationed dequeuing algorithm, variable inter frame space, proportionate prioritized backoff timers and enhanced RTS/CTS control packets. Differentiated services is simulated in ns2 and results show that 9.5% control overhead is reduced in our proposed scheme than the existing scheme and results also justify that, differentiated services have been achieved for the different profiles of users with proportionate shares and thereby reducing starvation.	algorithm;backoff;carpal tunnel syndrome;differentiated services;fairness measure;overhead (computing);proportional share scheduling;quality of service;rs-232;scheduling (computing);simulation;timer;user profile	J.

For example, non-real-time polling and best-effort services mainly rely on the contention-based mechanism to submit bandwidth requests to the base station (BS). However, the performance degrades considerably when the number of requests is high and they collide with each other. To avoid collision, the standard supports a truncated binary exponential backoff resolution. Nevertheless this resolution is inefficient in dispersing the requests when the network traffic is overloaded. In order to improve the efficiency of the random-access mechanism in the standard, the authors propose a new mechanism that aids mobile stations (MSs) in sending bandwidth requests more efficiently and also avoiding peak traffic. By using the mechanism, MSs send bandwidth requests under low loads, thus avoiding collisions.		Jen-Yi Pan;Shih-Chin Shiu;W.-S. Lee;S.-W.

Algorithms based on dynamic resource reservation depend on complex measurement, calculation and information exchange between cells. Recently, adaptive service has been proposed to protect the QoS of mobile users and increase the capacity of mobile network. A new sliding window based CAC algorithm specially designed for adaptive service is introduced in this paper. This algorithm can avoid the complex estimation of the handoff probability in dynamic algorithm, and simulation results show that this algorithm can reduce the HDR to nearly zero and can also get a higher accept ratio than dynamic algorithm.	algorithm;common access card;dynamic problem (algorithms);information exchange;simulation	Peng Zhao;Hui-Min Zhang	2002		10.1109/PIMRC.2002.1046527	sliding window protocol;cellular network;real-time computing;quality of service;information exchange;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;probability;estimation theory;statistics;computer network	Mobile	6.305994310595749	98.94556924018289	173772

The resources needed for handoff calls are estimated by calculating the probability of visiting particular cells during the call lifetime based on the call duration and residence time statistics. This information is then communicated to the base stations in the S surrounding rings. The amount of reserved resources is updated at handoffs and call termination which involves simple arithmetic operations only. The admission algorithm also maintains the tuning parameters by which hard constraints on handoff dropping probabilities can be met.

This paper proposes S-shaped TCP (SS-TCP). The window growth function of SS-TCP is, in the steady state condition, S-shaped, and it can be divided into three regions. In region I, the window growth rate of SS-TCP is the same as that of standard TCP (STD-TCP). In region II, the window of SS-TCP grows faster than that of STD-TCP. In region III, SS-TCP decreases its window growth rate as the network is becoming congested. This paper also proposes SS-TCPW, an enhanced version of SS-TCP. It makes an end-to-end estimation of the available bandwidth as TCP Westwood+. Based on the estimation, SS-TCPW determines the boundary of region III, and decreases its window size. We evaluate the performance of SS-TCP and SS-TCPW in terms of the metrics that are important for high speed transport protocols; buffer requirement, TCP friendliness, RTT fairness and convergence time. The results showed that SS-TCP has much better performance than HighSpeed TCP (HS-TCP) in terms of buffer requirement and RTT fairness. SS-TCPW has better performance than HS-TCP and SS-TCP in all metrics. The results also clarified that SS-TCP and SS-TCPW have much better TCP friendliness than FAST-TCP.	bandwidth-delay product;bottleneck (network);computer simulation;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;internet;std bus;slow-scan television;steady state;throughput	Masayoshi Nabeshima	2006	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2006.07.008	tcp westwood;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;transmission control protocol;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;computer network	Metrics	-0.17870729000649085	102.28028770189722	174341

These multi channel MAC protocols aim at improving the performance of unicast communication, and multicast data are generally transmitted through broadcast. So multicast can’t benefit from the multi -channel technique. This paper proposes a multi channel media access control protocol for multicast(MCMAC) which uses multi-channel techniques to improve multicast performance. MCMAC and multicast routing protocols can cooperate well through some simple interfaces and each protocols keeps its independence. To improve the reliability of MAC layer, we also developed a reliable multi -channel MAC protocol for multicast(RMCMAC). Taking ODMRP[2] as an example of multicast routing protocols, we evaluate the multicast performance of MCMAC and RMCMAC for ad hoc networks via detailed simulation.

The GW server plays a critical role in the overall WLAN IP (WIP) mobility architecture (IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, WCNC, Atlanta, GA, 21 March 2004; Int. J. Wireless Inf. Networks 2006; 13(3):173–192). This paper provides a comparison of WIP with cellular IP (CIP) and mobile IP (MIP), and identifies the main requirements for a broadband-accessed network-based GW that supports WIP mobility. The paper then evaluates GW-contributed handoff message processing delay in the WIP architecture through an analytical system model and OPNET simulation model, and provides a comparison of the GW-contributed handoff message processing delays for non-preemptive vs preemptive queuing schemes. Both analytical and simulation results show that WIP handoff message processing delay at the GW has negligible impact on the overall system delay. Finally, this paper presents the simulation results of the fast routing table lookup and forwarding speed on the GW overall performance, which can assist service providers in the challenging implementation issues that they face.

In this paper, we made a large amount of field investigations on link quality of HSR network, and built a practical model to reflect the changing pattern of link quality along HSR lines in terms of round trip time (RTT) and packet loss rate (PLR). After analyzing a great number of collected dataset of RTT and PLR we excitedly found that their behaviors presented an obvious two-scale time- varying phenomenon. To this end, we analyzed the potential reasons and further characterized link quality of HSR network using a generalized reference model based on hidden Markov chain. An improved forward induction algorithm was proposed to simulate the two-time-scale phenomenon of RTT and PLR. Evaluation results show that the proposed model is able to well reflect the network link quality varying along the HSR line with accuracies of 71.2% and 63.5% in terms of PLR and RTT. The proposed model can be used to guide the HSR link quality prediction and evaluation.	algorithm;hidden markov model;hierarchical state routing;markov chain;network packet;public lending right;reference model;simulation	Jiayang Song;Huachun Zhou;Wei Quan;Tao Zheng;Ping Dong	2016	2016 IEEE 83rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2016.7504349	telecommunications;computer science;engineering;radio propagation;hidden markov model;wireless;computer network	Metrics	3.5429054921616285	90.4273776942499	174459

In this paper we propose a dynamic and user-centric network selection and decision process which optimizes handover across heterogeneous networks. A satisfaction degree function (SDF) is used to evaluate, according to user's predefined criteria, available networks and select the best one(s) according to such criteria. The criteria consider incorporating user policies and information from several OSI layers, including dynamic network status and application requirements. Numerical results show that the proposed network selection process results in the choice of the best network according to the user's choices.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;network performance;numerical analysis;osi model;requirement;seamless3d;semantic network;user requirements document	Xuejun Cai;Ling Chen;Rute C.

This network enables a secondary user (SU) to use the frequency spectrum opportunistically when the primary user (PU) does not utilize it. CRAHNs can be deployed ubiquitously, and SUs of any CRAHN could co-exist when utilizing the spectrum. This situation leads to the fairness issue of spectrum resource sharing between SUs. CRAHN deployment is a large challenge in the medium access control (MAC) protocol design in which it must actively encourage each SU to operate for a high fairness. Most of the developed multichannel MAC protocols for CRAHN have not deliberated a fair resource sharing mechanism between co-existing SUs. Therefore, we propose an efficient multichannel (FMC) MAC protocol to address the dynamic availability of the spectrum and which orientates to the fairness in resource sharing. In this proposed protocol, the SU keeps the current backoff (KCB) counter when a PU appears to claim the intended channel. We compare the proposed fair protocol to the renewal backoff (RB) counter approach and the modified existing 802.11 protocol. The performance evaluation exhibits our protocol by providing a higher fairness than others while maintaining a high throughput.	access control;autonomous robot;cognitive radio;communications protocol;exponential backoff;ftc fair information practice;fairness measure;flight management system;hoc (programming language);ibm systems network architecture;multichannel multipoint distribution service;performance evaluation;simulation;software deployment;spectral density;superuser;three-state logic;throughput;traffic message channel	Aghus Sofwan;Salman A.

The systematic properties of single physical layer and medium access control (MAC) layer protocol have been studied through the techniques based on mathematical models or experiment-based approaches. However, It is insufficient to evaluate network performance on the basis of existing single layer model or cross-layer model with stationary parameters, especially for the multi-variable parameters-based wireless network environment. In this paper, we propose an enhanced stack cross-layer analytical model based on the comprehensive combination and interaction between PHY layer propagation model and MAC layer Markov chain model. Dynamic interaction between sublayer models achieve adaptive performance estimation with hyperparameters sets. Cross-layer performance degradation is analyzed under the varying inputs of multi-parameters vectors, several Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and effective energy consumption metric are proposed and evaluated, respectively. From the simulation results compared with benchmark models, stack cross-layer model offers more comprehensive performance analysis with different cross-layer parameters sets which include distance, transmit power, noise power, and information loads, etc.	access control;benchmark (computing);elegant degradation;low-power broadcasting;markov chain;mathematical model;network performance;noise power;phy (chip);profiling (computer programming);quality of service;simulation;software propagation;stationary process	Zongyi Liu;Daniela Dragomirescu;Georges Da Costa;Thierry Monteil	2017		10.1145/3018896.3065839	wireless sensor network;carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;wireless network;computer network;quality of service;mathematical model;physical layer;computer science;ieee 802.15;network performance	Mobile	4.839496950573056	91.42267477299903	175055

This call admission policy can be considered 118adaptive nniform fractional guard channel policy. In order to study the performance of the proposed call admission policy, the computer simulations are conducted. The simulation results show that for some range of input traffics, the performance of the proposed approach is close to the performance of the uniform fractional guard channel policy.

Consequently, the media access control (MAC) layer influences the fairness and robustness of the wireless network. According to the current MAC protocok, stations are not able to gain access equdy to the shared wireless medium. This problem is conunody known as the fairness problem. The fairness problem occurs mostly bemuse of the existence of hidden stations and the presumption of a non-Wy connected wird=s network topology. This paper addresses solutions to the fairness problem in wireless networks. persistent carrier sense mdtiple access based dg~ rithms are proposed in which a fair wirel=s access for each user is accomplished using a precsdtiated N acce~ Probabfity, Pij, . . that represents the Eti access probabtity horn station i to j. Lii access probabfities are dcdated at the source station in two ways using connection-based and time-based media access methods. According to the used methods, each active user broadcasts information on either the number of Iogicd connections or the average cent ent ion time to the stations within the communication reach. This information exchange provides partird understanding of the topology of the network to the stations. Each station reserves a specific priority for itse~ to gain access to the shared medium. It is suggested that the information is exchanged during the W access discovery procedure for the connection-based method, and periodidy for the time-based method. Link access probabtit ies are modified every time the exchanged information is received. The proposed algorithms are dynamic and sensitive to the changes in the network topology. The sdgoritb have been implemented in a specific media access control protocol [1], but they are app~mble to d media access control protocok. Simdation restits show that the algorithms restit in an order of magnitude performance improvement in terms of throughput in a wirel= network.	access control;algorithm;emoticon;fairness measure;information exchange;mac address;network topology;throughput	Timuçin Özugur;Mahmoud Naghshineh;Parviz Kermani;C.

There is a need to have an evaluation of the SCPS protocol in a realistic space environment with a large bandwidth- delay product (BDP). An experimental evaluation of SCPS-TP was done by transferring user files using the SCPS protocol over the NASA's Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) links. However, the user files were so small that the steady performance of the protocol could not be accurately evaluated. This paper describes an experimental evaluation of SCPS-TP over high-speed, asymmetric space links by transferring a large user file over asymmetric ACTS link, leading to its steady performance.	bandwidth-delay product;communications protocol;communications satellite;performance evaluation	Ruhai Wang;Stephen Horan	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.475	communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	-1.1146065691468354	91.24852837270953	175458

By recording the lost service and compensating flows after an error period, long-term throughput and long-term fairness can be maintained. This paper stresses that what is most pertinent to current wireless QoS however, is the preservation of delay guarantees for sessions in the face of channel errors. A traffic profile and priority based wireless fair queuing (TPP-WFQ) scheduling approach is proposed, which utilizes all available residue bandwidth in the system to allow sessions to catch up to their error-free service as quickly as possible. In addition, a bandwidth management platform that adjusts session weights for use by the scheduler is presented. Priority is given to real-time traffic with strict delay bounds for both bandwidth utilization and compensation. Simulated results illustrate how maintaining short-term delay guarantees in this way does not affect long term fairness and throughput guarantees for other sessions more tolerant to delay.	bandwidth management;fair queuing;fairness measure;network packet;packet analyzer;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;relevance;scheduling (computing);tpp;throughput;weighted fair queueing;wireless access point	Steven Walsh;Emi Garcia-Palacios;Sakir Sezer	2006		10.1145/1292331.1292375	fairness measure;bandwidth management;real-time computing;quality of service;computer science;processing delay;operating system;maximum throughput scheduling;end-to-end delay;fair queuing;distributed computing;transmission delay;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;wireless;computer network	Networks	-1.1787622472419514	95.38636647989003	175812

A rate allocation algorithm must balance the available resources among the video streams in a fair and efficient manner. In addition, it is desirable to have a distributed solution so that nodes do not need to collect global information of the network and that the computational burden can be shared. We propose a distributed rate allocation algorithm which minimizes the total distortion of all video streams. Based on the subgradient method, the proposed scheme only requires link price updates at each relay node based on local observations and rate adaptations at each source node derived from rate-distortion (RD) models of the video. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve the same optimal rate allocation as that obtained from exhaustive search.	algorithm;brute-force search;hoc (programming language);rate–distortion theory;relay;ruby document format;simulation;streaming media;subgradient method;total distortion	Xiaoqing Zhu;Bernd Girod	2005	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2005	10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530015	wireless ad hoc network;distributed algorithm;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;computer science;theoretical computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	1.569646722448079	90.27093829619257	176034

We observe that messages in vehicular networks are usually subject to both time and space constraints, and therefore should be disseminated during a specified duration and within a specific coverage. Since vehicles are moving in and out of a region, dissemination of a message should be repeated to achieve reliability. However, the reliable dissemination for some messages might be at the cost of unreliable or even no chance of dissemination for other messages, which raises tradeoffs between reliability and fairness. In this paper, we study the scheduling of data dissemination in vehicular networks with mesh infrastructure. Firstly, we propose performance metrics for both reliability and fairness. Factors on both the time and space dimensions are incorporated in the reliability metric and the fairness in both network-wide and Mesh Roadside Unit-wise (MRU-wise) senses are considered in the fairness metric. Secondly, we propose several scheduling algorithms: one reliability-oriented algorithm, one fairness-oriented algorithm and three hybrid schemes. Finally, we perform extensive evaluation work to quantitatively analyze different scheduling algorithms. Our evaluation results show that 1) hybrid schemes outperform reliability-oriented and fairness-oriented algorithms in the sense of overall efficiency and 2) different algorithms have quite different characteristics on reliability and fairness.	algorithm;fairness measure;scheduling (computing)	Zhongyi Liu;Bin Liu;Wei Yan	2009	Wireless Sensor Network	10.4236/wsn.2009.13020	vehicular ad hoc network;fairness measure;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;scheduling;dissemination;computer network	Mobile	7.093094816883919	89.04201015326444	176227

Using various key metrics of interest including node degree, number of clusters, link duration and link quality, we provide a realistic analysis of the VANET topology characteristics. In this analysis, we integrate real-world road topology and real-time data extracted from Freeway Performance Measurement System database into the microscopic mobility model in order to generate realistic traffic flows along the highway. Moreover, we use more realistic, recently proposed, obstacle-based channel model and compare the performance of this sophisticated model to the most commonly used more simplistic channel models including unit disc and log-normal shadowing model. Our investigation on the key system metrics reveal that largely used unit disc model fails to realistically model communication channel, while parameters of simplistic models like log normal can be adjusted to match the corresponding system metrics of more complex and hard to implement obstacle based model.	channel (communications);freeway;hoc (programming language);interpretation (logic);key;mathematical model;network topology;norm (social);real-time clock;real-time data;routing;sensor;the turk;tracing (software);transmitter	Nabeel Akhtar;Öznur Özkasap;Sinem Coleri Ergen	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554832	vehicular ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;log-normal distribution;routing protocol;computer security;computer network	Mobile	3.6901957787514186	88.71183625559087	176251

The algorithm favored the delay sensitive applications. Indirectly, this infers that the assignment of priorities practiced in the algorithm is static. In redesigning the algorithm, priority assignments should be able to be implemented dynamically. Thus, enabling an embedded element to provide implementation mobility. This would depend upon the current status of the classified buffers and the tolerance level of the delay sensitive traffic. Integrating control parameters to enable alternation in scheduling priorities is an option to resolve the element of partiality present in the M-Tier algorithm. Thereafter, the proposed algorithm will be denoted as the M-Tier(T) algorithm [2]. The paper proposes a detailed mathematical model for the analysis of dynamic resource reservation algorithms implemented in IP switches. The semi-markov process (SMP) approach utilized provides an accurate performance prediction and representation of resource reservation mechanisms. The algorithm correlates the average packet delay and packet loss ratio parameters to activate the dynamic resource reservation mechanism in a hierarchical manner. The developed models are validated through discrete-event simulation. The performance of the algorithm is studied in terms of average packet delay and network throughput.	algorithm;multitier architecture	Subramaniam Shamala;Mohamed Othman;Rozita Johari;Mohd Yazid Saman	2005	Journal of Interconnection Networks	10.1142/S0219265905001356	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;discrete event simulation;distributed computing;computer network	NLP	0.8331391835835318	95.91867896858635	176668

Users are synchronized to the propagation delay between two adjacent users, and are thus semisynchronized. Such a system with single-buffered users and an exponential backoff strategy, is modeled. The system throughput and the mean delay are evaluated, and it is shown how to obtain the distribution of the packet interdeparture time as well as the packet delay. It is shown that the rescheduling strategy has a profound effect on the station performance, and that it can be used to eliminate the difference between the performance of different stations at any given offered load.

Selective negative acknowledgement (SNACK) is a novel scheme which integrates the capabilities of both SACK and NAK, developed for space Internet. There has been some work done in discussing the performance of the SNACK scheme based on the methodology of the scheme or by considering SNACK as an isolated entity. It is necessary to have a side-by-side, controlled experimental comparison of the effectiveness of SNACK and the widely used SACK with the operating systems fully involved. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of SNACK over GEO-satellite links in an experimental manner using the SGLS testbed, by comparing it with the widely used SACK. It has been found that at low BERs (<=10/sup -6/), SNACK and SACK show similar performance. At a higher BER (around 10/sup -5/), SNACK significantly increases link utilization and shows superior performance over SACK. SNACK is better suited for long delay and high BER channels and thus makes it favorable over SACK in the experimented communication environments.	acknowledgement (data networks);acknowledgment index;internet;operating system;retransmission (data networks);scheme;selective repeat arq;testbed;x.690	Ru H.

f29e0504419f3116b1d4ab4044e9e8a8074914c3	probabilistic modelling for congestion detection on wireless sensor networks		Recently, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) attract many researches due to their real applications. WSN is actually a network whose main components are sensors and channels. Based on applications, these components can be worked independently or separately with each others to capture information, process and send it to sink. However, in congestion-based aspect, most researches are assumed that environmental working of components are perfect, i.e. they omit packet-loss aspect due to failed sensors or broken links. This causes a limitation to rationally represent a WSN. Thus, in this proposal, using the reliable probability property, we define a Discrete Time Stochastic Petri Net Model for congestion detection on WSN in order to represent all working scenarios for components on the one hand, and calculate the congestion probability in the network on the other hand. After that, we also present a new algorithm to analyse on that model. Our straight example through this paper emphasises the idea of our model.	algorithm;link rot;network congestion;network packet;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;routing;sensor;state space;statistical model;stochastic petri net;unicast	Khanh Le;Giang V.

In this paper, we present Hermes1, a point-to-point data connectivity solution that works by modulating data onto acoustic signals that are sent over a cellular voice call. The main challenge is that most voice codecs greatly distort signals that are not voice-like; furthermore, the backhaul can be highly heterogeneous and of low quality, thereby introducing unpredictable distortions. Hermes modulates data over the extremely narrow-band approximately 3kHz bandwidth) acoustic carrier, while being severely constrained by the requirement that the resulting sound signals are voice-like, as far as the voice codecs are concerned. Hermes uses a robust data transcoding and modulation scheme to detect and correct errors in the face of bit flips, insertions and deletions; it also adapts the modulation parameters to the observed bit error rate on the actual voice channel. Through real-world experiments, we show that Hermes achieves approximately 1.2 kbps goodput which when compared to SMS, improves throughput by a factor of 5× and reduces the cost-per-byte by over a factor of 50x	acoustic cryptanalysis;backhaul (telecommunications);bit error rate;byte;codec;communications protocol;data rate units;distortion;experiment;goodput;modulation;point-to-point protocol;speech coding;throughput	Aditya Dhananjay;Ashlesh Sharma;Michael Paik;Jay Chen;Trishank Karthik Kuppusamy;Jinyang Li;Lakshminarayanan Subramanian	2010		10.1145/1859995.1860010	codec;real-time computing;speech recognition;bit error rate;developing country;telecommunications;point-to-point;computer science;computer network;data transmission;modulation	Mobile	-1.7051781199728424	88.69032937375346	176975

However, most research works in the past stayed at the level of algorithm design or modification, and seldom sought solutions on the viewpoint of architecture. In this paper, Active Networking (AN) technology is used to make congestion control more responsive to detect/recover congestion in WSN. We design a simple Active Backpressure (BP) mechanism to allocate bandwidth Proportional to the Size of tree (ABPS). ABPS introduces programs in each data packet that tell nodes how to react to congestion, and quickly converges to a fair and efficient rate. Finally, we evaluate ABPS extensively on a 50-node wireless sensor network. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our ABPS.	active networking;algorithm design;network congestion;network packet;simulation	Ying Ouyang;Fengyuan Ren;Chuang Lin;Tao He;Chao Li;Yada Hu;Hao Wen	2007	2007 IEEE Internatonal Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MOBHOC.2007.4428748	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;bandwidth management;network traffic control;real-time computing;wireless wan;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;flow control;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;network congestion;slow-start;computer network	Mobile	-3.5364856852183446	94.8147849952292	177112

Network coding which allows coding at the intermediate nodes in the network promises to increase throughput of the whole network and better utilizes network resources. To provide both robustness and efficiency for image multicast over wireless ad hoc networks, a scheme based on joint multiple description coding (MDC) and network coding is proposed in this paper. Multiple description lattice vector quantization (MDLVQ) is employed to encode an image at the source node, and different descriptions are transmitted on an individually or mixed base. Linear network coding is used to mix selected packets at the intermediate nodes provided that corresponding receivers can decode the mixed packet. At the destination nodes, received original packets and mixed packets can result in a reproduction with certain quality. Experimental results validate that the proposed scheme can benefit the image transmission with better reconstructed image quality, lower failure rate and less energy consumptions.	code;encode;failure rate;hoc (programming language);image quality;linear network coding;lossy compression;multicast;multiple description coding;network packet;routing;simulation;smart data compression;throughput;vector quantization	Yuanyuan Xu;Ce Zhu	2009	2009 Fifth International Conference on Image and Graphics	10.1109/ICIG.2009.73	wireless ad hoc network;linear network coding;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;multiple description coding;coding tree unit;computer network	Mobile	1.669517500040843	90.26100136863414	177113

The evaluation shows that these schemes suffer from one or more of the following problems: non-compliance with the selected bandwidth allocation definition (BAD), link under-utilization, and prolonged rate fluctuations. Moreover, most of them implement only one BAD, namely source-based allocation. We then propose an mpp flow control algorithm, the WSB (weighted-source-based) algorithm that is effective and supports a large set of BADs. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the WSB algorithm: correct rate allocations with fast convergence, maximum link utilization, and minimal rate oscillations.	atm turbo;aggregate data;algorithm;flow control (data);multipoint ground;simulation	Uyen T Nguyen	2004	Proceedings.

The common approach modeling spectrum access is Markov Chain (MC), which is prone to state space explosion with the increasing of the number of users. In this paper, an executable hierarchical Colored Petri Nets (CPN) model for the spectrum access in CRN is investigated to overcome the explicit limitation using MC. After the verification that the CPN model is isomorphic to MC in the case of arriving with Poisson distribution, the advantage of CPN on computation complexity is analyzed. Finally, a spectrum access strategy with queuing for the secondary users is proposed and modeled by CPN, which is demonstrated more flexible and workable than MC by the results.	channel capacity;cognitive radio;coloured petri net;computation;concurrency control;executable;markov chain;multi-user;state space	Zhaoping Li;Yanhui Lu;Shouyi Yang	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems	10.1109/ICCS.2014.7024843	spectrum;cognitive radio;simulation;systems modeling;cognition;petri dish;strategy;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;radio;mathematical model;distributed computing;markov process;computational model;petri net;statistics;computer network	Robotics	5.321650484450844	99.22851759966585	177377

The FM algorithm uses the maximum bandwidth requirement of the the future to estimate the bandwidth requirement. The IE algorithm defines a class of admission control schemes that uses a combination of maximum and average bandwidth within each interval to estimate the bandwidth requirement of the interval. The performance evaluations done through simulations show that the server utilization and the quality of service are improved by using the FM and IE algorithms. 2 Preliminaries The admission control schemes proposed in the literature can be classified into three categories [l]: Deterministic, Statistical and Best Eflort. The disadvantage of current admission control algorithms [2, 3, 41 is that they only use a few statistical data to represent the server behavior and the media streams. This method facilitates the implementation, reduces the complexity of computation, and requires less storage space. However, the streams are not modeled accurately which may lead to poor server utilization. The current policies use the worst case scenario of all the streams to employ admission control. In reality, there is a very small possibility that all the streams reach their worst case at the same time.	best, worst and average case;computation;context of computational complexity;fm broadcasting;fiduccia-mattheyses algorithm;quality of service;server (computing);simulation;worst-case scenario	Xiaoye Jiang;Prasant Mohapatra	1997		10.1109/MMCS.1997.609785	file server;sampling;real-time computing;interval estimation;jitter;quality of service;computer science;virtual machine;operating system;distributed computing;bandwidth;statistics;computer network	DB	-1.2725982665275737	96.21871002486988	177554

These algorithms offer soft QoS provisioning by letting each class of service exploiting the available bandwidth considering the delay bounds of the exisiting connection's queues so that lower priority classes can get a reasonable minimum share of bandwidth. This method is taking advantage of a bonus allocation scheme while keeping the connection priorities in focus.

Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM) techniques were extensively investigated to implement switching. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) permits multiple users to access bandwidth simultaneously and asynchronously via spread spectrum. This paper presents a non-blocking multiprotocol switch architecture based on WDM and CDMA techniques. WDM Demultiplexer is used to distribute each wavelength to a specific CDMA switch fabric. The CDMA switch fabric is used to switch the information from an input port to an output port. Each packet is segmented into proprietary cells that are switched from the input to the output. This allows synchronous operation of the switch. Orthogonal subcodes are used for the same output port to avoid cell loss. The optimum number of sub-codes codes used is determined using analytical modeling and simulations.	blocking (computing);code;multi-user;multiplexer;network packet;network switch;non-blocking algorithm;optical switch;simulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Driss Benhaddou;Ala I.

The analysis is based on our measurement study of ATM WAN tra c. We point out that in order to use the fractal characterization framework in practice we are faced with various misleading e ects that can deceive our self-similarity tests and Hurst parameter estimation methods. It is shown that the estimation of the Hurst parameter depends on several factors, e.g. the estimation technique, sample size, time scale, level shifts, correlation structure. The dependencies are illustrated in examples including the e ects of practical mechanisms like shaping or policing. We conclude that the estimated value of the Hurst parameter may be distorted in many practical cases and it may have no information for practical usage.	atm turbo;atm adaptation layer;estimation theory;fractal;hurst exponent;network traffic control;noise shaping;self-similarity	Sándor Molnár;Attila Vidács;Arne A.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of sending these descriptions through different paths that merge at some specific intermediate nodes, where the corrupted descriptions are recovered from the uncorrupted ones, thereby increasing the quality of received image/video at the destination. To quantify the gain with intermediate recovery, we first devise an analytic model with simplifying assumptions on the network system for quantifying end-to-end distortion of MD coded data as a function of path parameters, and demonstrate that on a Lena image transmitted over long multipath routes, one intermediate recovery stage offers up to 9.2% reduction in distortion compared to the traditional multipath transport. Next, accounting the random network topology we formulate mesh route construction as a cross-layer optimization problem to balance between end-to-end packet delivery delay and distortion. Since this problem is highly complex, we propose two alternative delay/distortion minimization heuristics. Further, a jointly delay and distortion optimizing genetic algorithm based meta-heuristic route construction technique is suggested for networks with highly varying link quality. NS2-based simulations of a realistic network scenario demonstrate that, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio the intermediate recovery approach results in substantial improvement, close to 15 dB, in quality of video delivery.

It has several advantages: (1) during network congestion, packets are dropped according to the (m,k) model rather than uncontrollably as the case of TD and RED, avoiding thus undesirable long consecutive packet drops; (2) it allows to admit more real-time flows than the traditional over-provisioning approach. A new mechanism, called DLB (double leaks bucket) is also proposed for dropping a proportion of packets of a flow or of aggregated-flows in case of network congestion while still guaranteeing the R-(m,k)-firm constraint. The sufficient condition for this guarantee is given for configuring the DLB parameters. It is easy to implement DLB in the actual IntServ and Diffserv architectures (by simply replacing the actual leaky, bucket by DLB) for providing respectively per flow and per class (m,k) guarantee, or event per flow R-(m,k)-firm guarantee in Diffserv.	dbl-browser;differentiated services;elegant degradation;integrated services;leaky bucket;linux;network congestion;network packet;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;router (computing)	Jian Li;Yeqiong Song	2006	20th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications - Volume 1 (AINA'06)	10.1109/AINA.2006.154	leaky bucket;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;integrated services;network congestion;computer network	Embedded	-1.4520122917928344	95.33260916884535	178146

Our proposal, called """"slide and translate"""" (SNT), adapts EDCF contention parameters to suit the varying traffic load in a basic service set (BSS). The aim of the SNT algorithm is to: 1) protect high priority access categories (AC) from increasing background traffic; and 2) maintain efficient channel utilization over wide range of traffic conditions. SNT adoptively configures backoff intervals (BI) of each AC based on the QoS advertisements from the access point (AP). We evaluate through simulations the performance of SNT and compare the results with plain EDCF. Results from the simulation tests show that SNT is able to provide a high degree of isolation for high priority ACs. Additionally, SNT attains a 9% higher peak utilization value when compared to EDCF. Finally we present the delay and frame loss characteristics for SNT and EDCF.

In the past, various utility-based network selection and handoff schemes have been presented but without concerning when network selection is performed when moving. This study presented a PNS (Profile-based Network Selection) scheme based on IEEE802.21 MIIS that invokes user preference or utility-based network selection while maintaining good communication quality in mobile communication. In particular, it provides mechanisms to prevent network selection being trapped at a poor network, when user preference is considered. Experiment results illustrate that PNS can perform better than quality-based network selection scheme.	mii	Tein-Yaw Chung;Fong-Ching Yuan;Hsun-Fu Liu	2016	2016 10th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing (IMIS)	10.1109/IMIS.2016.81	real-time computing;analytic hierarchy process;network management station;telecommunications;computer science;network simulation;computer network	Mobile	8.448400798111633	98.55352270003891	178344

This paper proposes a push system that continuously adapts to the demand pattern of the client population in order to reflect the overall popularity of each data item. The adaptation is accomplished using a simple feedback from the clients. We propose that the simple feedback from the clients can be sent at regular time intervals in order to avoid the overhead that would be an incurred for acknowledging all item broadcasts.

In this paper, we present a P2P based admission control mechanism for real-time video streaming driven by Service Provider (SP). SPdriven P2P network is a network where service provider has a comprehensive control over contracted resource utilization. SP assures the coordination and the creation of overlay P2P network and it is responsible for admission control and resource allocation among others. Our proposed QoS provision mechanism employs video traffic descriptor (i.e. traffic specification) for performing admission control. Before accepting a particular P2P video streaming session, the SP controls the access to the network resources by performing policy and admission control. After retrieving the service availability from its traffic repository, SP decides whether to accept or to reject the request. The proposed SP-driven P2P admission control mechanism is evaluated using ns2 simulator and the results show that our proposed mechanism allows the provisioning of end-toend QoS for delivered video content over P2P network.	digital distribution;digital video;end-to-end encryption;peer-to-peer;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;streaming media	Mubashar Mushtaq;Toufik Ahmed	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5198986	real-time computing;mobile qos;quality of service;computer science;resource management;world wide web;computer network	Embedded	-4.418812532309093	96.70283813442158	178757

To solve this MAI problem, it is necessary to use a longer cyclic prefix length for orthogonality between different subchannels; however, this sacrifices system efficiency due to the cyclic prefix overhead. In this paper, we propose a group contention-based OFDMA to solve the MAI problem with an adequate cyclic prefix length and support a larger number of STAs. The STAs within the cyclic prefix duration that are synchronized to an access point (AP), are included in the same contending group and compete with other STAs of the group in transmitting packets. The proposed scheme allows for the adoption of an adequate cyclic prefix length without MAI, and is able to reduce the cyclic prefix overhead. In addition, since no packet errors are induced by MAI in any of the STAs, the STAs can transmit simultaneously without redundant short interframe spaces (SIFSs) and other control packets. Through analysis and simulation, we show that for a large number of STAs, the proposed scheme achieves higher throughput than 802.11 protocols and a conventional CSMA combined with OFDMA.	acknowledgement (data networks);bit error rate;carpal tunnel syndrome;design rule for camera file system;intelligence amplification;interference (communication);multipath propagation;network packet;overhead (computing);propagation delay;rs-232;simulation;software propagation;throughput;transmitter;wireless access point	Junwoo Jung;Jaesung Lim	2012	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.102316	communications protocol;propagation delay;synchronization;throughput;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	8.718743483810329	90.88744506529689	178762

Recently, there have been investigations in Call Admission Control (CAC) to handle the handover events in wireless network environments. Wireless networks have been seen to support different handoff mechanisms, in which the user can switch from one wireless network to another such as from IEEE 802.11 to IEEE 802.16. Many wireless standards, such as IEEE 802.16e and IEEE 802.11, have been proposed to satisfy diverse requirements for mobile users.. Several strategies have been proposed to realize seamless handoff in the heterogeneous networks; in this paper, we analyze the performance of some novel intelligent handoff mechanisms with multiple attributes. The mobile set dynamically selects the optimal network and provides the user with high throughput of Quality of Service (QoS) as to minimize the blocking probability of the system in heterogeneous networks. We evaluate some intelligent handoff mechanisms such as Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPOSIS), Simple Additive Weight (SAW), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Logic and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA). From the results, blocking probability and dropping rate can be referenced to support better QoS.	additive model;algorithm;analysis of algorithms;blocking (computing);common access card;erlang (unit);fuzzy logic;grey relational analysis;ieee 1471;quality of service;requirement;seamless3d;semantic network;throughput	Cheng-Mu Shiao;Ruey-Rong Su;I-Shyan Hwang;Bor-Jiunn Hwang	2009	2009 10th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks	10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.47	real-time computing;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;computer science;ieee 802.11r-2008;computer network	Embedded	8.539834923112462	98.523536326604	178906

The main difference that appears in modern networks is the dependence structure of the data. While traditional models are based on assumptions of short range dependence, recent measurements (see [Leland et al.) show the presence of long–range dependence and self–similarity in the data of network traffic. Presently it is believed that these phenomena are caused by the presence of heavy tails in the distribution of the service times, which cause the long–range dependence. In this study we consider a fluid version of a leaky bucket flow control protocol, with an input process in which the distribution of the session lengths is heavy tailed, causing it to be long–range dependent. The leaky bucket is a flow control mechanism that is designed to reduce the effect of the inevitable variability in the input stream into a node of a communication network. Let us consider two types of input processes: an On–Off process and a M/G/∞ type process. Recently there has been a lot of work concerning fluid models fed by On–Off or M/G/∞ type processes (see, for example, [Heath et al. Unlike these studies we concentrate on certain design and performance issues related to the presence of a specific policing mechanism: the leaky bucket. Queuing systems with such control mechanism have been studied before, in particular in a series of papers of A. looked at how the leaky bucket input control performs in the presence of a long–range dependent input. However, while [Vamvakos and Anantharam(1998)] concentrated only on the rate of decay of correlations, we look directly at system performance, specifically at the time until overflow of a large buffer. We show that in the presence of long–range dependence the buffer still overflows much more often than in the """" classical """" case, without heavy tailed sessions, hence long–range dependent input. In spite of that, the leaky bucket input control will reduce the frequency at which the buffer overflows, in comparison with a system with the same input stream but without input control. It is important to mention that, unlike the previous authors, who looked at discrete time systems, here we investigate a fluid–type, continuous time system. Let work arrive to the system according to some input process.

Most of those algorithms ensure the fairness property and guarantee the QoS of all sessions in a large-scale cellular network such as GSM or GPRS.In this paper, we propose the Weighted-Sacrificing Fair Queueing (WSFQ) scheduling algorithm for small-area and device-limited wireless networks. WSFQ slows down the growth of queue length in limited-buffer devices, still maintains the properties of fairness, and guarantees the throughputs of the system. Moreover, WSFQ can easily adapt itself to various kinds of traffic load. We also implement a packet-based scheduling algorithm, the Packetized Weighted Sacrificing Fair Queueing (PWSFQ), to approach the WSFQ. WSFQ and PWSFQ are evaluated by comparing with other algorithms by mathematic analysis simulations.	algorithm;fair queuing;fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;network packet;network scheduler;proportionally fair;quality of service;queuing delay;scheduling (computing);simulation;weighted fair queueing	Sheng-Tzong Cheng;Ming-Hung Tao	2004			fair-share scheduling;weighted fair queueing;generalized processor sharing;cellular network;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;wireless network;maximum throughput scheduling;fair queuing;layered queueing network;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;network congestion;scheduling;proportionally fair;computer network	Networks	3.4155987177932627	96.5559967426877	179023

The uncoded bit or symbol error rate (SER) is specified as a channel quality metric in second and third generation cellular systems (e.g., general packet radio service (GPRS), enhanced general packet radio service (EGPRS), and universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). Nonetheless, techniques to estimate the uncoded SER are typically outside the scope of these wireless standards and are not specified. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a number of uncoded SER estimation techniques, including a novel technique in which we use the soft information of the received symbols to obtain a fast and accurate estimate of the uncoded SER. The technique we introduce has been found to outperform, in terms of accuracy and required estimation interval, conventional hard-decision based techniques that use test-patterns, or use a decode/re-encode/compare approach . Our technique also outperforms the brute-force technique, which is to send a known test-pattern, demodulate it at the receiver, and count the observed discrepancies.	channel capacity;encode;network packet;quality of service	Walid K.

In this letter, we propose the selective weighted fair allocation (SWFA) scheme, which discards packets from selected sessions. 15 TCP connections with equal minimum cell rate (MCR) and unequal MCRs are simulated. The SWFA scheme with per-virtual connection (VC) queuing is compared with early packet discard (EPD) with first-in, first-out queuing, EPD with per-VC queuing, and differential fair buffer allocation with per-VC queuing. Our results show that SWFA with per-VC queuing achieves significant enhancement on throughputs, goodputs, and fairness.	atm turbo;atm adaptation layer	Wei Kuang Lai;Chin Chao Liu	2003	IEEE Trans.

Besides simulation results, the existing analytical models address only the blocking probability and achievable throughput of such schemes. However, in determining the properties and advantages of each reservation scheme (especially the LightRing, a scheme recently proposed by the authors) the above performance figures are not sufficient, as network latency plays a determinant role when fast bandwidth provisioning is of the essence. This paper presents an analytical framework that allows one to derive the response time and throughput of such schemes under the assumption that a single request for bandwidth can be stored and processed by the source at a time. Numerical results obtained using the proposed model reveal a number of interesting properties of the existing bandwidth reservation schemes.	blocking (computing);centralized computing;erlang (unit);numerical method;performance evaluation;provisioning;response time (technology);simulation;throughput;wavelength-division multiplexing	James Cai;Andrea Fumagalli	2002		10.1109/INFCOM.2002.1019244	throughput;latency;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;synchronous optical networking;response time;bandwidth;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Networks	1.9483380786172226	96.33039511362799	179183

In the DCF, the NAV indicates the amount of time that a medium will be reserved by other nodes, so it provides an accurate estimation of neighbor nodes activities around a node. Thus, the proposed scheme dynamically adjusts the contention window according to the variation of neighbor nodes activities, which is estimated by NAV measurements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of total throughput and fairness between nodes.	algorithm;backoff;design rule for camera file system	In-Soo Lee;Dong-Won Kum;Won-Kyeong Seo;You Ze Cho	2010	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.7.1571	network allocation vector;real-time computing;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Visualization	7.657476105376735	90.50706850611041	179437

Network control considering the Self-Similarity requires high speed calculation method of the Hurst Parameter. However, such method has not been proposed yet. In this paper, we propose high-speed calculation method of the Hurst Parameter based on the Variance-Time Plot method, and show its performance. Furthermore, we try to show effectiveness of the network control with Self-Similarity.	axosoft;bandwidth management;buffer overflow;control system;hurst exponent;network packet;network performance;self-similarity	Tatsuya Hagiwara;Hiroki Doi;Hideki Tode;Hiromasa Ikeda	2000		10.1109/LCN.2000.891113	real-time computing;degradation;analysis of variance;fractal;performance;telecommunications;buffer overflow;self-similarity;computer science;hurst exponent;network performance;data analysis;packet switching;statistics;computer network	Networks	-2.328440317389479	98.99871959742126	179558

One of CDMA's advantages is soft handoff (SHO). A special case of SHO is inter-BSC SHO which is more costly to process than regular intra-BSC SHO. In this paper, we use a mobility based method to analytically estimate some important inter-BSC SHO related characteristics such as the percentage of SHOs that are inter-BSC SHO and the remote call geographic distribution. These characteristics can be used to properly size such critical network resources as sidehaul bandwidth and BSC processors in order to guarantee the success rate of inter-BSC SHO. Our results show that the inter-BSC SHO percentage increases as mobile users move faster, move longer and the BSC coverage area is smaller. It's found out that the percentage of inter-BSC handoffs is in the range of 8% - 18% depending on the network configuration.

However, measuring and characterizing link-quality is a challenging task due to the nature of wireless channel and device-specific properties of radios. The paper proposes two aspects of link-quality measurement and estimation in realistic networks that benefit higher-layer protocols. First, we analyze the statistical properties of link-quality metrics, such as received signal strength and packet error rates, in an indoor IEEE 802.11 mesh network. We show that the statistical distribution and memory properties vary across different links, but are predictable. The next contribution of the paper is a real-time measurement framework that enables higher-level protocols in wireless mesh networks. We discuss the architectural requirements and our implementation experiences of a measurement framework. In addition, we provide three concrete applications that use the measured link-quality and statistical inference to better adapt their behavior.	link quality analysis;mesh networking;wireless mesh network	Vinay Kolar;Saquib Razak;Petri Mähönen;Nael B.

On the other hand, the existing distributed QoS mechanisms are only able to differentiate between various traffic streams without being able to guarantee QoS. This paper addresses these deficiencies by proposing a new distributed QoS scheme that guarantees QoS parameters such as delay and throughput for both CBR and VBR video traffics. The proposed scheme is also fair for all streams and it can adapt to the various conditions of the network. To achieve this, three fields are added to the RTS/CTS frames whose combination with the previously existing duration field of RTS/CTS frames guarantees the periodic fair adaptive access of a station to the channel. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated with NS-2. The results showed that it outperforms IEEE 802.11e HCCA.	algorithm;carpal tunnel syndrome;case-based reasoning;centralized computing;internet backbone;quality of service;rs-232;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;volume boot record;wireless access point	Saeid Montazeri;Mahmood Fathy;Reza Berangi	2008	EURASIP J.

According to the proposed protocol, the station which grants permission to transmit at each time slot is selected by means of learning automata. The learning automata update the choice probability of each station according to the network feedback information in such a way that it asymptotically tends to be proportional to the probability that this station is ready. In this manner, the number of idle slots is minimized and the network performance is significantly improved. Furthermore, the portion of the bandwidth assigned to each station is dynamically adapted to the station's needs.	automata theory;bandwidth (signal processing);dfa minimization;learning automata;network performance	Georgios I.

For spread spectrum networks, it is not even clear how to represent the underlying network, since the existence of links is heavily dependent on activity in other parts of the network. We have developed a set of computer-based modeling tools to help understand the performance and behavior of these networks. These tools allow for numerical evaluation of important network performance measures and experimentation with network parameters. A connectivity model for a direct sequence spread spectrum packet radio network has been developed. This model allows the computation of network throughput and can be used to study routing techniques. Our current model places direct sequence spread spectrum networks on an equal footing with narrowband networks which have been modeled using the collision channel and transmission range concepts.

An integrated services network must handle traffic streams with disparate arrival processes and performance objectives, and efficiently supporting these streams becomes more difficult when performance guarantees must be met across a number of switches and when a stream’s burstiness can dramatically increase from source to destination. Three variations on the basic mechanism are proposed to address this problem: PTB-Separate Classes, PTB Minimum Interdeparture Time, and PTB-Weighted Fair Queuing. It is shown that the PTB scales well to a network of queues, and that, under the constraint that performance requirements for guaranteed traffic such as packet voice, HDTV, and packet video must be met, the mean delay experienced by other traffic is much better with the Priority Token Bank mechanisms than with other proposed algorithms. 1.0 Introduction Efficiently supporting diverse traffic types is challenging when each stream has different arrival processes and different performance objectives ,or Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. The arrival process of traffic streams at the network access point is declared during the admission process, and this information can be used to more efficiently handle traffic. In a network of queues, the arrival process of cells at downstream switches may be very different from the arrival process at the edge of the network, and traffic control algorithms must account for a much wider range of arrival processes. Since a cell carries no information about the queuing delay it has experienced, the scheduling algorithm must make assumptions about the delay experienced by cells at previous switches, leading to potentially less efficient handling of traffic. If traffic streams are combined at downstream switches, the scheduling algorithm must also maintain performance guarantees when there are cells interspersed in the same queue which may have experienced very different delays. This paper describes a traffic control algorithm, the Priority Token Bank, whose mechanism and performance in a single queue has been analyzed , and compares its performance in a network of queues to that of other proposed algorithms. Related work in the area of traffic control is discussed in section 2. The Priority Token Bank mechanism as used in a single queue is reviewed in section 3, and three variations on the basic algorithm for use in a network of queues are proposed in section 4. In section 5, the performance of the three algorithms is compared, in a network of queues, with the performance obtained by using other common algorithms, and, the paper is summarized in section 6. 2.0 Related Work The simplest scheduling algorithms that can provide performance guarantees in a network of queues are t tic priority (SP) and earliest deadline first (EDF), but neither is capable of efficiently handling traffic with diverse performance objectives. Polling algorithms generally guarantee that cells from each class receive some service during a fixed interval, or frame, or that a fixed number of cells can be transmitted in each frame, without specifying where in the frame they are transmitted. If a stream has no cells to send, the unused portion of the frame may be utilized by another stream , the frame may be shortened, effectively sharing the unused bandwidth among all streams with queued cells 4 or the excess bandwidth may remain unused, creating a non-work-conserving mechanism . While polling algorithms insure that bandwidth is fairly distributed, they do little to optimize system performance. A sophisticated algorithm, called MARS, has been proposed to run on top of Magnet’s polling-based structure. In MARS, each class is permitted to transmit cells in a portion of a frame, and the fraction of a frame dedicated to each traffic class can change as needed to maximize total system performance. MARS has been shown to be an effective approach when all traffic meets its assumptions , but it is not clear how the mechanism can be expanded to handle traffic with more diverse performance objectives. Occupancy -based algorithms calculate the oldest class i cell’s transmission priority as a function of the number of cells from stream i currently queued. Occupancy works well when there is a tight correlation between the number of cells in the queue and the queuing delay experienced by the cell at the h ad of the queue, but with bursty arrival processes the correlation begins to break down. Cost Based Scheduling (CBS) associates a cost function, c i(t), with each cell that defines a cost incurred as a function of its queuing delay, t. Cost functions are selected to represent application performance objectives. CBS then determines priority as a function of queuing delay t to minimize total cost. CBS has been shown to perform well , and near optimal where an efficient optimal algorithm is known. 9 However, implementation is complex. 3.0 The Priority Token Bank Our approach to the traffic control problem is the Priority Token Bank (PTB). In the single queue implementation, cells are divided into N classes, where all cells in a same class have similar performance objectives, though they may be from different streams. For each class i, there is a first in, first out (FIFO) queue, a token counter T i, and a token counter update period τi. Also each class has a priority function P(T i) which gives the transmission priority of the cell at the head of the class i queue. Ti, is held at zero whenever queue i is empty. When cells are present, T i is incremented every τi and decremented each time a class i cell is transmitted, so that the token counter value will approximate the queuing delay of the oldest class i cell. Ti can become negative, indicating that stream i has temporarily used more than its share of bandwidth. The next cell to be transmitted is the cell at the head of the queue with the highest transmission priority. With proper parameter selection, the transmission of cells not in danger of violating their performance objectives can be delayed, providing better performance to traffic classes which provide greater value through early cell arrival. Let G be the maximum priority for low priority traffic. A class i cell from a guaranteed stream is permitted to have priority greater than G only if T L i i ≥ , where Li is the token counter limit. If T i = Li, we are in danger of violating the class i performance requirements, so its priority increases. Parameters for all streams must be chosen such that all class i cells with priority greater than G are transmitted within τi transmission times, so that T i never exceeds Li. Performance objectives for guaranteed traffic will be met by letting P i equal some constant > G when T i > Li. To select τi, Li, and Pi(Ti) to meet performance objectives in a single queue, we use a stream’s arrival process parameters declared during negotiation for admission to the network. If an arriving stream is policed with a Leaky Bucket, the arrival process can be characterized by using parameters σL and ρL, where the amount of traffic arriving in a period of duration t is bounded by σ ρ L Lt + , where ρL is a measure of the average arrival rate and σL is a measure of burstiness. If cell arrivals are periodic, such as for CBR voice streams, we would choose τ ρ i L = 1 / and set L M M i L L L = − = − ρ σ ρ 1. The same equations apply for VBR video; ρL would be set to the peak sustainable arrival rate and σL would be set large enough to accommodate the potential burstiness in the arriving stream. It has been shown that, in a single queue , PTB provides QoS guarantees while providing performance that is significantly better than that provided by static priority and polling-based mechanisms, and nearly as good as CBS. Extending the mechanism to provide guarantees over a network of switches presents significant challenges. The most critical is that a stream’s arrival processes change significantly after traversing several hops. Any algorithm that delays transmission of cells not in danger of violating their performance guarantees, increasing stream burstiness. Consider the case where a switch does not transmit class 1 cells until they are in danger of missing their deadline, building up a large queue of class 1 cells. When suddenly there are no other cells to transmit, a burst of cells are transmitted. To maintain performance guarantees, an algorithm must be able to handle this increased burstiness at downstream switches. All of the sophisticated algorithms, to which we will compare the PTB, do not handle the increased burstiness well, though MARS fares the worst. MARS divides traffic into three classes, requiring that the class 1 load be less than 1 during any period of duration d1, where d1 is the maximum tolerable delay for class 1 packets. A similar requirement exists for class 2 traffic as well. Consider the network in Figure 1. Let d1 1 ( ) be the maximum class 1 delay at each hop 1 switch, and 1 2 ( ) be the maximum class 1 delay at the hop 2 switch. If the input to the class 1 queue at each of the n hop 1 switches is constant bit rate traffic at a load of ρ , then the load from each of these streams at switch n+1 can be as large as min( , ) ( )	access network;approximation algorithm;burst transmission;case-based reasoning;downstream (software development);earliest deadline first scheduling;fifo (computing and electronics);fair queuing;integrated services;leaky bucket;loss function;maxima and minima;multiplexing;network access point;network packet;network switch;offset binary;polling (computer science);priority queue;program counter;quality of service;queue (abstract data type);queueing theory;queuing delay;requirement;scheduling (computing);traffic exchange;volume boot record;weighted fair queueing;wireless access point	Mark A.

In this system, the CA procedures and the controls of the MAC frame transmission run independently of each other by adopting out-of-band signaling (OBS) in order to achieve flexible access control. However, in highly offered traffic, MAC frames, that have completed the CA procedure, queue to be transmitted, causing latency to increase rapidly. To solve this problem, the CA and MAC channels are properly distributed, and flow control is added to the CA procedure. In this study, the performance of this system was evaluated and confirmed using a theoretical calculation and a computer simulation. Maximum throughput of approximately 0.9 was observed regardless of network length (up to tens of kilometers) and physical transmission speed, maintaining the low latency that is characteristic of contention systems.	access control;computer simulation;mac address;maximum throughput scheduling;micro channel architecture;optical burst switching;out-of-band agreement	Kaoru Sano;Hiroshi Kobayashi;Osamu Moriya	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5963063	computer simulation;out-of-band management;throughput;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;access control;operating system;flow control;mathematical model;silicon;bandwidth;computer network;broadband networks;low latency	Robotics	1.18270386230058	93.83581610488085	180332

Based on this general result, we evaluate closed-form expressions for the TGVPs for four well-known scheduling algorithms.

This paper presents an end-to-end system architecture based on the MPEG-4 Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework (DMIF) for transporting real-time live video over the Internet. The key features of the system include: (1) MPEG-4 DMIF-based terminal architecture; (2) combination of an end-to-end feedback control mechanism and a rate-adaptive encoding algorithm for the best use of the Internet; (3) a robust and efficient packetization scheme for the MPEG-4 bit-stream by using the resynchronization marker approach specified in the MPEG-4 standard; and (4) efficient error control algorithms adopted at the end systems for visual quality enhancement. Simulation and test results using the actual Internet showed that our system is capable of utilizing the available network resource and achieve good perceptual quality at the application level. r 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Existing solutions mainly focus on rate-limitation policies or distributed fair MAC schemes at the potential expense of total network utilization. This paper investigates a special starvation problem among TCP flows that are different hops away from the BS, as well as its recently proposed solution, the ‘Minimum Content Window’ policy based on IEEE 802.11e. It is found that the aggregate throughput degrades sharply because the effect of this policy on the TCP congestion mechanism has been overlooked. This paper proposes a priority-based congestion control by using ‘Cross-Layer Explicit Congestion Notification’. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our scheme can improve the fairness of TCP flows while the aggregate throughput is at least 20% higher than the ‘Minimum Content Window’ policy.

This belongs to a new category of algorithms characterized by contention free access of uplink control channels during location update. Two or more mobile units are permitted to register with a base station simultaneously without contention on the uplink channel. The location updating procedure is hybrid in the sense that it could be temporally or geographically triggered. Based on the location information stored in all base stations, Bloom filtering is used to select cells to be paged to locate the targeted mobile unit. The performance of this scheme is compared to other algorithms previous proposed. Numerical results shows that the new algorithm requires less combined location update and paging bandwidth than other algorithms.	algorithm;bloom filter	Wing Ho A.

We also derive a more accurate sum formula whose approximation e m r is linearly bounded. We show that with use of the i n c o m t sum formula, cases arise where it is impossible to time out as the initial loss indication in slow start, which can have signlcant impact nu TCP latency, assuming a comlated loss model. We show that our more accurate sum fumula greatly reduces the number of cases showing this behaviour, further improving upon the accuracy of the model. I. BACKGROUND Analytic models are very useful to gain an in-depth understanding of the fundamental behaviour of TCP protocols. Recently , some efforts have been made to build analytic models for TCP performance using round-trip time and packet loss probability [1][2][3]. In [l], comprehensive analytic models are provided for TCP behaviour. However, their model for packet sums in slow start has little theoretical background, and no indication of how the formula was obtained. Their analytic sum formula i s also provided to calculate the total number of packets transmitted in the first k rounds in the slow start phase of TCP. We will show that their sum formula significantly underestimates the iterated sum for k > 7. We also derive a more accurate sum formula. In this note, the same notations from [l] are adopted. In [l], Sikdar et al have presented a formula to model the window increase pattern, given the mechanics of delayed acknowledgements. This is presented as w (n) = p+ +e], (1) where 1 J is the floor function. Equation (1) is used to determine the number of packets transmitted in the nlh round. This forms the basis of further models to eventually determine the number of rounds required, and hence the transfer latency, for a slow start period ending in either packet loss or reaching the	approximation;floor and ceiling functions;glossary of computer graphics;iteration;linear bounded automaton;network packet;tcp congestion control	Damien Phillips;Jiankun Hu;Bill Lloyd-Smith;Richard Harris	2003		10.1109/ICON.2003.1266200	mathematical optimization;approximation error;simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;transport layer;statistics;computer network;approximation theory	Metrics	-1.267433128624146	98.37914973831256	180707

These technologies are diverse in terms of bandwidth, delay, coverage area, etc. It is not uncommon that a mobile device is equipped with multiple wireless network interfaces to achieve efficient and ubiquitous communications. In wireless overlay networks, the mobile node can even utilize multiple network interfaces simultaneously to achieve greater QoS performance. This paper presents the design of such a system that supports multi-homed communications. In particular, we design the policy for mapping different network flows to different interfaces, and propose a load-sharing algorithm based on weighted-round-robin channel selection and jump-ahead packet scheduling. Simulation results show that the algorithm can efficiently distribute data packets among multiple channels to achieve bandwidth aggregation.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);bandwidth management;binocular disparity;bluetooth;coexist (image);mobile ip;mobile device;multihoming;network packet;overlay network;quality of service;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation;weighted round robin	Haijie Huang;Jianfei Cai;Andreas Kassler;Cheng Peng Fu	2005	IEEE International Conference on Communications, 2005.

On the other hand, input queueing is simple in the hardwa aspect, while it suffers from the problem of head of line blocking. This is the phenomenon that a packet in the input buffer is pvented from accessing an available output port because the packet ahead of it in the buffer is blocked. Hence, head of h e blocking will reduce the throughput of the switch. This problem can be overcome by allowing other packets in the buffer to be transmitted when the leading packet is blocked. Such an input buffer is caIled a bypass queue [3]. An N x N nonbuffered Banyan switch consists of N input buffers, N output buffers, N input port controllers, N output port controllers, and an N x N nonbuffered Banyan fabric. The N input buffers and N output buffers are used to store and to sfmchronize packets. The function of the input port controllers and output port controllers is to implement the bypass queueing function. The input port controller will allow a packet to be transmitted through the switch when the packet ahead of it is blocked. Inside the switch, time is divided into packet slots which contains several offer slots and one transmission slot as illustrated in Fig. 1. In an offer slot, the packet routing tag is used to attempt to establish a path through the switch to the desired output port. Hence, if the switch is designed carefully, at most log,N bit periud are required for an offer slot. We define the window size as the number of offer slots in a packet slot. At the end of the offer slots, all packets which have successfully set up a path to their output ports are transmitted during the transmission slot. Note that the offer slots will reduce the throughput of an ATM switch by a fraction of 424/(424 + flogs N), where 424 is the ATM packet length and f is the window size of a packet slot.	atm turbo;banyan vines;blocking (computing);data buffer;network packet;network switch;optimal design;routing;tag cloud;throughput	Yo-Song Su;Jau-Hsiung Huang	1994	IEEE Trans.

To make matters worse, error rates can be highly variable due to changes in the wireless environment. Researchers and developers have explored a wide range of solutions to optimize communication in this difficult error environment, including traditionalend-to-end solutions, link-layer solutions, and solutions involving layer four processing inside the network. A significant challenge is ensuring that systems with multiple layers of error control avoid compromising performance by duplication of effort. We argue and demonstrate that protocol-independent linklevel local error control can achieve high communication efficiency even in a highly variable error environment, that adaptation is important to achieve this efficiency, and that inter-layer coexistence is achievable. The Logical Link Control layer of our WaveLAN-based experimental LAN includes three error control mechanisms: local retransmission,adaptive packet shrinking,and adaptive error coding. Measurements generated on a variety of network topologies and trace-based error environments demonstrate excellent TCP performance improvements and good coexistence with TCP’s end-to-end retransmission strategy.	coexist (image);control system;data rate units;end-to-end encryption;error detection and correction;kerrison predictor;kilobyte;network packet;network topology;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);robustness (computer science);synchronous data link control;throughput;truncation;wavelan	David A.

On the other hand, Tunable Sparse Network Coding (TSNC) is a promising concept, which leverages a trade-off between computational complexity and goodput. An optimal density tuning function has not been found yet, due to the lack of a closed-form expression that links density, performance and computational cost. In addition, it would be difficult to implement, due to the feedback delay. In this work we propose two novel tuning functions with a lower computational cost, which do not highly increase the overhead in terms of the transmission of linear dependent packets compared with RLNC and previous proposals. Furthermore, we also broaden previous studies of TSNC techniques, by means of an extensive simulation campaign carried out using the ns-3 simulator. This brings the possibility of assessing their performance over more realistic scenarios, e.g considering MAC effects and delays. We exploit this implementation to analyze the impact of the feedback sent by the decoder. The results, compared to RLNC, show a reduction of 3.5 times in the number of operations without jeopardizing the network performance, in terms of goodput, even when we consider the delay effect on the feedback sent by the decoder.

The system is quite unique as radio transmission for telemetry services under extreme speed conditions requires not only superior Quality of Service guarantees but must also be able to satisfy these performance requirements under extreme and arbitrarily demanding environments as are typical during any e.g. Formula 1 racing event. Issues related to the Doppler Effect and abrupt changes of the serving HSPA channel are analyzed and addressed here. Conclusions show how a special 3G network design can help to mitigate Doppler Effect impacts. The processes carried out by both the UE and the network to cope with this high speed environment has proven essential to sustain the service in these conditions, as it has the use of suitable receiver Types in the UE. Using derived guidelines and conclusions, a unique system has been developed, built and tested in a Formula 1 environment with very promising results.	doppler effect;network planning and design;quality of service;requirement	Santiago Tenorio;Paul Spence;Beatriz Garriga;Javier López;Aitor Garcia;Miguel Arranz	2010	2010 IEEE 71st Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493957	electronic engineering;doppler effect;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer network	Robotics	8.216370204003088	96.16848313108169	181567

For each DiffServ compliant router, the scheduling algorithm is critical in implementing PHBs, according to which packets are forwarded. In this paper, we propose the parallel maximum urgency first (PMUF) scheduling algorithm for combined input-crosspoint queued (CICQ) switches to support DiffServ classes. The proposed PMUF algorithm features in a distributed scheduling scheme which can be implemented on each input and each output independently and in parallel. It adopts a two-stage flow control mechanism based on periodic statistic to provide minimum bandwidth guarantees for EF and AF traffic, and uses a priority scheduling mechanism to provide lower delay for EF traffic. The time complexity of PMUF is only O(log N), hence is practical and scalable for high speed application. Simulation results show that PMUF provides minimum bandwidth guarantees for EF and AF traffic and fair bandwidth allocation for BE traffic. PMUF also exhibits better delay performance than existing maximal matching based DiffServ scheduling schemes especially under non-uniform traffic.	algorithm;anisotropic filtering;code point;differentiated services;entity framework;flow control (data);hop;matching (graph theory);maximal set;network packet;network switch;networking hardware;per-hop behaviour;router (computing);scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;time complexity	Peng Yi;Hongchao Hu;Binqiang Wang;Hui Li	2008	2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization	10.1109/CSO.2009.208	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	HPC	-0.2866324995486791	95.12998856945676	181736

Most existing research that requires expensive modifications for large-scale already in-used base stations cannot be immediately deployed into the existing HSR systems. In this paper, we propose a quite lightweight but effective solution to improve the Internet experience for HSR passengers. Different from other existing approaches, we employ a data-driven link state prediction (LSP) mechanism for HSR reliable transmission, called LSP4HSR, which directly operates in HSR's on-board routers. In particular, we conduct an extensive measurement of network status on several realistic HSR lines and collect a first-hand dataset in terms of round-trip time and packet loss rate. By analyzing this real dataset, we find that HSR link quality presents obvious two-time-scale variation characteristics. We execute a lot of in-depth studies to explore potential reasons for this interesting phenomenon. Furthermore, based on the two-time-scale Markov chain, we establish an accurate HSR link prediction approach, which brings an LSP-based transmission enhancement mechanism to alleviate the impact from poor link status along HSR lines. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed solution can not only improve the packet transmission reliability in HSR networks but can be also deployed in existing HSR systems quite smoothly and easily.	experiment;hierarchical state routing;interference (communication);link-state routing protocol;markov chain;network packet;on-board data handling;smoothing;web service	Hongke Zhang;Wei Quan;Jiayang Song;Zhongbai Jiang;Shui Yu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2598473	markov chain;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;mathematics;forensic engineering;statistics;computer network	Metrics	3.3411413189157	90.38816315246675	182003

We present elaborate analytical results regarding the mean page delay, the Equivalent Circuit Rate (ECR), and the system saturation point for interactive data users with different channel conditions. The ECR for a user in a shared access network is the channel rate that a dedicated connection would need in order to offer an equivalent user experience. The system saturation point is the maximum number of users that can be served with a given tolerable service delay in a shared packet access system. These analytical results are useful in the performance prediction of a real wireless environment with multiple user groups that are served with different service rates due to multiple channel conditions. Therefore, our analytical results can be used in the network planning, admission control, and service differentiation for different user groups. Our analysis is demonstrated to be in good accord with computer simulations performed on model systems based on EDGE TDMA and IEEE 802.16 OFDMA.	packet switching;quality of service	Minhee Cho;Namgi Kim;Hyunsoo Yoon	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e89-b.2.342	equivalent circuit;computer simulation;embedded system;edge detection;telecommunications;feature extraction;computer science;access control;signal processing;computer security;service quality;time division multiple access;saturation;telecommunications network;access network	Networks	1.6241742249093425	101.99051741403225	182110

Such dense mesh deployments have high levels of interaction across heterogeneous wireless links. We find that this heterogeneous backhaul consisting of data-carrying (forwarding) links and non- data-carrying (non-forwarding) links creates two key effects on performance. First, we show that low-rate management and control packets can produce a disproportionally large degradation in data throughput. We define a metric for this effect called Wireless Overhead Multiplier and use it to quantify the impact of MAC and PHY mechanisms on the the throughput degradation. Surprisingly, we show that these multiplicative effects are primarily driven by the non-forwarding links where, in the worst case, data packets lose physical layer capture to the overhead, yielding disproportionate throughput degradation. Finally, we show that when data flows contend in this worst-case scenario, the loss-based autorate policy is unnecessarily triggered, causing throughput imbalance and poor network utilization.	backhaul (telecommunications);best, worst and average case;elegant degradation;mesh networking;multitier architecture;network packet;overhead (computing);phy (chip);throughput;worst-case scenario	Joseph David Camp;Vincenzo Mancuso;Omer Gurewitz;Edward W.

Previous studies mainly focused on equal service and differentiated service strategies when peers have no initial data before their downloads. For an upload-constrained P2P file sharing system, we model both the equal service process and the differentiated service process when the initial data distribution of peers satisfies some special conditions. Moreover, we show how to minimize the time required to distribute the file to any number of peers. The proposed fluid-based models can reveal the intrinsic relations among the initial data amount, the peer set size, and the minimum last finish time. The closed-form expressions derived from the extended models can closely approximate chunk-based models and systems, especially for relatively large files. As an application of the extended models, we show how to provide differentiated service efficiently to multiple peer sets. Since no limits are imposed on the upload bandwidth of peers or the size of each peer set, we believe that our analytic process and the results achieved can provide not only fundamental insights into bandwidth allocation and data scheduling but also a helpful reference for both improving system performance and building an effective incentive mechanism for P2P file sharing systems.	approximation algorithm;differentiated service;extended precision;peer-to-peer file sharing;scheduling (computing);upload	Jianwei Zhang;Yongchao Wang;Wei Xing;Dongming Lu	2013	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2013.000037	data modeling;communications protocol;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;bittorrent tracker;computer performance;bandwidth;computer network	Metrics	1.5693498717279817	96.2967799195172	182230
69f1890582ded22619ce29509b3c70b83a25abdc	a comparison of two token-passing bus protocols	performance measure;cycle time;random variable;random times	A well known disadvantage of standard token-passing in ring and bus networks is the waste of channel bandwidth often seen in lightly loaded or asymmetric systems. It is possible to make use of the broadcast mechanism in token bus systems to distribute nearly up-to-date information about the state of individual stations to the entire system. One such scheme involves the determination of a randomly varying set of more active stations. These stations are given a chance to form a second logical ring above the standard logical ring that characterizes the token bus. The transmission cycles of the system can thus be made to alternate between standard token-passing and transmission cycles, and the cycles of token-passing and transmission within the logical ring of more active stations. We assume that each station makes at most one transmission when given the chance to transmit. For Poisson arrivals and otherwise general input distributions, the cycle-time distribution of the token is derived for each kind of cycle. An important random variable is the random token turnaround time seen by individual stations. For lightly loaded stations this time tends to be larger than for heavily loaded stations. The distribution of this random time, simple performance measures, and a comparative measure of stability, showing the adaptive scheme to be more stable than the standard, are obtained.	adaptive filter;cycle (graph theory);randomness	Vernon Rego	1986		10.1145/18172.18180	random variable;real-time computing;telecommunications;cycle time variation;computer security;computer network	Networks	1.6738928568602072	93.0338591561295	182300

The multi-channel MAC protocols can exploit multiple channels to achieve high network throughput by enabling more concurrent transmissions. In this paper, we propose a hybrid and adaptive protocol, called H-MMAC, which utilizes multi-channel resources more efficiently than other multi-channel MAC protocols. The main idea is to adopt the IEEE 802.11 Power Saving Mechanism and to allow nodes to transmit data packets while other nodes try to negotiate the data channel during the Ad hoc Traffic Indication Message window based on the network traffic load. The analytical and simulation results show that the proposed H-MMAC protocol improves the network performance significantly in terms of the aggregate throughput, average delay, fairness and energy efficiency.	hoc (programming language)	Duc Ngoc Minh Dang;Choong Seon Hong;Sungwon Lee	2015	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-014-0789-8	vehicular ad hoc network;ieee 802.11s;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;service set;optimized link state routing protocol;media access control;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	7.779019393095909	90.32043746594967	182467

In particular, with ATM, packets are broken up into fixed length cells, and each cell is forwarded without having to wait for the remaining cells of the packet. However, with the interest in VC-merging, packets from multiple virtual circuits are merged into a single virtual circuit on an output link. In this case, it is critical to retain the fundamental characteristic of ATM to not interleave cells of a packet with that of another. VC-merging arises often, as in the case of a multipoint-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-point connection. We examine the stability of policies for cut-through switching when VCs are merged. We consider a queueing model of a single VC merge point employing cut-through switching. We show that, if subunits of packets cannot be interleaved on the output link, a simple round-robin polling service discipline may make the merge point unstable. Instability means that the input queues have a tendency to build up infinitely even though the total input data rate is less than the output link capacity. We prove that the round-robin discipline is stable if the merge point is symmetric in that packet rates on all input VCs are equal (or at least """"almost equal""""). We also prove that two simple modifications of the round-robin discipline make the merge point always stable. Simulation results of one of the modifications show improved performance over """"pure"""" cut-through and store-and-forward, at least in some cases."""	forward error correction;mpls local protection;scheduling (computing)	Alexander L.

Prior traffic analysis of hybrid network nodes are based on preemptive and queue-based priority mechanisms, however, in this article we focus on the time-window approach with its associated reservation induced blocking (RIB). A closed form expression for packet loss is found by minimizing the RIB and is proved to be asymptotically exact for increasing length of circuit packets. A Markov model accounting for the effect of RIB is proposed and simulation is used to determine its accuracy. For lower than 85% share of circuit switched traffic, the respective median and 95- percentile for the relative error equals 10% and 25%. Finally, when circuit packets are aggregated into bursts the total packet loss is reduced for sufficiently high share of circuit traffic. The mechanisms behind this performance gain are identified and methods to maximise its effect are proposed.	approximation error;blocking (computing);circuit switching;hybrid integrated circuit;markov chain;markov model;network packet;packet switching;preemption (computing);simulation;traffic analysis	Andreas Kimsas;Harald Øverby;Norvald Stol	2009	2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications	10.1109/AICT.2009.71	closed-form expression;approximation error;real-time computing;hybrid;telecommunications;computer science;markov process;markov model;packet loss;optical switch;circuit switching;statistics;computer network	Metrics	-0.9888473273590561	97.40211663437499	182833

This is achieved by enhancing the throughput and delay characteristics of the DCF. The throughput of DCF degrades in high loaded situations. Most analyses study the network in a saturation state where each station is always transmitting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel and simple algorithm to enhance the backoff procedure of DCF and provide QoS differentiation. The new algorithm attempts to adoptively control the DCF contention window in order to alleviate congestion through an easy to set parameter referred to as q. In our study, we evaluate the DCF and the new under non saturation condition where each station receives frames from upper layers according to a Poisson process. Simulation results indicate that better throughput and delay figures are obtained using the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithm shows less sensitivity to the number of active nodes especially for low number of active nodes. This feature is very important for WLAN service provider.	algorithm;backoff;design rule for camera file system;network congestion;quality of service;requirement;simulation;throughput;transmitter	Ashraf S.

However, it has been recently proved that the exponential distribution is inappropriate [2]. Based on the generalized traffic processes developed [2], we study the media access control (MAC) layer of WiMAX and develop a resource allocation that maintain the bit rate of real time connections independently of the user position in the cell.

For example, the round trip transcontinental [USA] delay through a fiber link is approximately 0.04 s; at 150 Megabit/s, a source needs to transmit approximately 8,000,000 bits during one round trip time to utilize the bandwidth fully. As the service rates of queues get large, the time scales of congestion in those queues decrease relative to the round trip time, making the dual goals of keeping buffers small and utilizations high even more difficult to achieve. In this paper we analyze a class of delayed feedback schemes that achieve these goals despite propagation delays and regardless of network rates. We analyze the delayed feedback schemes as a system of delay-differential equations, in which we model the queue-length process and the rate at which a source transmits data as fluids. We assume that a stream of acknowledgements carries information about the state of a bottleneck queue back to the source, which adapts its transmission rate according to any monotone function of that state. We show stability for this class of schemes, in that their rate of transmission and queue length rapidly converge to a small neighborhood of the designed operating point. We identify the appropriate scaling of the model's parameters, as a function of network speed, for the system to perform optimally: with a deterministic service rate of μ at the bottleneck queue, the steady state utilization of the queue is   100−  O  (μ      −  1  2    )%   and steady state delay is   O  (μ      −  1  2    )  . We also describe the transient of behavior of the system as another source suddenly starts competing for the bandwidth resources at the bottleneck queue. This work directly applies to the adaptive control of Frame Relay and ATM networks, both of which provide feedback to users on congestion.		Kerry W. Fendick;Manoel A.

7dda411fb84e3c49fa89e1037cda67cf8fe2f9a3	a buffer-aware fleet-based cooperative h.264/svc streaming over vehicular networks	h;cooperative streaming;scalable video coding svc;dedicated short range communication dsrc;h 264;vehicular networks;264	Because of of the characteristics of high mobility, time varying and dynamic topology, how to provide multimedia streaming service for connected vehicles becomes one emerging and popular technical research. The motivation of this paper is to utilize cooperation among neighboring vehicles for video streaming's quality improvement over vehicular networks. In the proposed cooperative streaming scenario, a connected vehicle requests a video stream from the Internet by using its 3G/3.5G interface, which may not have enough bandwidth to receive good quality of video. Thus, the vehicle is suggested to ask neighboring members belonging to the same fleet to download the requested video data by using their 3G/3.5G interfaces. Then, neighboring members should forward video data to the requested vehicle by using another wireless technique, for example, dedicated short range communication DSRC. Regarding the differentiation between the two access networks, that is, 3G/3.5G network and DSRC network, a buffer-aware scheduling mechanism based on layered streaming is designed in this paper to adapt to the networking situation of the vehicular networks. Two selection algorithms are proposed to select neighboring vehicles from the fleet. According to our simulation results, the 3G/3.5G-based selection algorithm is suitable to improve video quality for vehicles at low speeds. On the other hand, the DSRC-based selection algorithm can get better performance when vehicles move at high speeds or too many data are transmitted among vehicles.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

System capacity results are obtained by using a system level simulator which considers traffic characterisation parameters and services usage in detail, among other. Results for the most profitable cell radius are obtained via an optimisation procedure based in economic aspects. A higher number of pico cells (with a smaller radius, around 30-32 m) can be installed in the future, when costs of deploying and maintaining the network decreases, allowing for supporting higher system capacity, and reducing prices. Our approach is based in a detailed services analysis, which represents a worst case situation relatively to the total services approach, because the later does not discriminate results for the different traffic classes.

A new dynamic spectrum access strategy is also proposed which has three priority levels on condition that the emergency users, primary users and secondary users are sharing one spectrum pooling. In this paper, the users' behavior is modeled by three-dimensional Markov chains. Moreover, the blocking and dropping probabilities of users based on the users connection rate are derived as the performance metrics. In addition, we evaluate the spectrum utilization of the system. Simulation results show that this system can effectively guarantee the emergency users' quality of service and improve the spectrum utilization.	blocking (computing);cognitive radio;computation;erlang (unit);markov chain;quality of service;queueing theory;simulation;telecommunications network	Peng Han;Hua Tian;Wei Xie	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096801	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	5.218278742877061	99.04263523156017	183454

However, how to guarantee the timely delivery of isochronous (real-time) messages with hard deadline constraints is one of the open issues yet to be solved. In [5], we laid a formal basis for allocating prearbitrated slots to isochronous message streams in dual-bus networks and devised a slot allocation scheme to statically establish a set of isochronous message streams at system initialization. In this paper, we complement our work in [5] and propose, with the necessary theoretical base established, a dynamic message stream setup and tear-down scheme for dual-bus networks.

In MBSR, an overall bandwidth B-quest is split into several smaller bandwidth requests, and these requests will be reserved on multiple disjoint paths respectively. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results prove that the probability of successful reservation of MBSR is higher than that of single-path reservation, In addition, simulation results show that the MBSR can improve the reserved packet ratio of QoS traffic, the packet delivery ratio and the end-to-end delay of both best-effort traffic and QoS traffic.	hoc (programming language);multipath propagation	Guang-Hong Wang;Yantai Shu;Yong-Jie Fan;Lei Wang;Oliver W.

d7a960ead96f4275de0a2a29f9bfe100d46e18cb	reduction in ping-pong effect in heterogeneous networks using fuzzy logic		Heterogeneous networks enable mobile users to stay connected anytime and from anywhere, providing a platform for multiple radio technologies to cooperate in order to furnish network subscribers with seamless connectivity. Excess number of wireless access points in a heterogeneous network results in exposing the mobile users to a number of networks at a time. The cell boundaries are critical where the quality of service may suffer. These boundaries share signal reception from multiple cells, and this causes mobile terminals to connect back and forth between multiple cells. This is known as the ping-pong effect that leads to a greater number of call drops. This work presents a fuzzy handover decision system that uses mobile user traversal history to mitigate the ping-pong effect. The proposed parameter is fed into fuzzy decision system to quantify the decision parameters. The technique increased the value of handover success metric, compared to Monte Carlo method from 0.3 to 0.6.

However, most of them focus only on the first moments, i.e. means, of interested performance metrics such as power-saving factor, transmission delay, etc. In order to gain full quality of service (QoS) control for real-time applications, it is imperative to obtain the distribution function of, in particular, the transmission delay. Thus, in this paper, extensive simulations are performed to examine the effects of various DRX parameters on the distribution function of the transmission delay.	compaq lte;discontinuous reception;imperative programming;quality of service;real-time clock;simulation	Jeng-Ji Huang;Ting-Han Kuo;Tzu-Han Chen;Chen-Ju Yang	2013	International Symposium on Wireless and pervasive Computing (ISWPC)	10.1109/ISWPC.2013.6707436	telecommunications;engineering;operations management;computer network	Embedded	5.283394889948664	96.89173155836401	184216

In this paper, we develop and validate a simple mixed queueing network model of user mobility among access points in a campus network. We identify two classes of users, an open and a closed class, corresponding to mobile users that visit the network for a short time before departure, and users that are always resident in the network during the observation period. Using CRAWDAD traces of user-access-point affiliation over time, we compare model-predicted performance with the performance actually observed in the traces, and find that such a mixed queueing model can indeed be used to accurately predict a number of performance measures of interest.	ergodic theory;ibm open class;network model;queueing theory;server (computing);tracing (software);user space;what if;wireless access point	Yung-Chih Chen;James F.

Therefore, many traditional hop-by-hop header compression techniques were introduced to reduce the amount of packet header before transmission. However, those techniques still cannot overcome the time performance issue as compression mechanism requires longer processing time. In the time-sensitive applications such as VoIP, high network latency can lead to voice quality problems. To improve the time performance, instead of using hop-by-hop basis, the authors propose a new header compression mechanism which can be deployed in end-to-end nodes using the Software-Defined Network concept. This mechanism can reduce both packet size and time delay. This research will show the results of round-trip time between our end-to-end header compression mechanism, multiple hop-by-hop header compression mechanism, and normal IP routing algorithm.	algorithm;broadcast delay;end-to-end principle;hop-by-hop transport;interrupt latency;network architecture;network packet;overhead (computing);routing;software-defined networking	Supalerk Jivorasetkul;Masayoshi Shimamura;Katsuyoshi Iida	2012	2012 Fourth International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems	10.1109/iNCoS.2012.80	openflow;routing;real-time computing;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;processing delay;software-defined radio;software-defined networking;burst switching;robustness;computer network	Mobile	-4.455163887454882	92.56209633219042	184691

We use simulationon several network scenarios to evaluate the link utilization and adherence to service commitment achieved by these four algorithms.	algorithm;qualitative comparative analysis;dialog	Sugih Jamin;Scott Shenker;Peter B.

This paper presents a new packet scheduling scheme called Active Scheduling to control and maintain QoS parameters in virtual private networks (VPNs) within the confines of adaptive and programmable networks. In Active Scheduling an agent on the router monitors the accumulated queuing delay for each service. In order to control and to keep the end-to-end delay within the bounds, the weights for services are adjusted dynamically by agents on the routers spanning the VPN. If there is an increase or decrease in queuing delay of a service, an agent on a downstream router informs the upstream routers to adjust the weights of their queues. This keeps the end-to-end delay of services within the specified bounds and offers better QoS compared to VPNs using static WFQ. The paper describes the algorithm for Active Scheduling, and presents simulation results and these are compared with WFQ.

By assuming a symmetric channel, the performance analysis of the overall system is determined by the performance of an arbitrarily selected user, called the tagged user. The service time distribution for the tagged user buffer is found using a state flow graph. This distribution is then applied to the queueing analysis of the tagged user using available classical queueing theory results. The proposed approach can be applied to analysis of systems with a very large user population and user buffer capacity. The distributions and mean values of the important performance indices such as waiting time, queue size, and interdeparture time are obtained. The stability of the system with infinite buffer capacity is also studied. The region of transmission probability p in which the system is always stable and has best performance is obtained. Though the system with finite buffer capacity is considered to be always stable, a comprehensive analysis of the equilibrium points in the system is presented. The analysis presented will allow a proper choice of transmission probability so that the system always operates at the desired equilibrium point.		Tao Wan;Asrar U. H. Sheikh	2000	IEEE Trans.

The present work examines user opinions of quality and acceptability for video streaming material under different network performance conditions. Subjects provided quality and acceptability opinions for typical multimedia material presented under different network conditions. The subjective test showed that increasing loss levels results in poorer user opinions of both quality and acceptability. Critically, for a given percentage packet loss, the test found that increasing the packet burst size produced improved opinions of quality and acceptability. These results suggest that user-perceived Quality of Service can be improved under network congestion conditions by configuring the packet loss characteristics. Larger bursts of packet loss occurring infrequently may be preferable to more frequent smaller-sized bursts.	streaming media	David Hands;Miles Wilkins	1999		10.1007/3-540-48109-5_5	service provider;the internet;telecommunications;computer science;network performance;packet loss;network congestion;computer security;service quality;computer network	Metrics	-2.979674494610112	102.49795169530877	184970

A characterization suitable to describe the sources and the multiplexed traffic required to evaluate the influence of traffic on the behavior of ATM devices. Burstiness is one of the most significant aspects of traffic that the future IBCN/ATM will have to deal with. Burstiness may be associated to the degree of variation in the cell-rate, but the problem is to define and quantify it. Most of the simple definitions used in the literature are not complete enough. Here, we focus on ATM-traffic burstiness characterization. The major contribution is to characterize traffic in ATM networks by looking at the statistics of random burst sequences instead of random cell streams. The most commonly used definitions for burstiness are reformulated and a proposal for better burst measurements is made. The burst measurements have been tested using different pseudo-random cell sequences.	atm turbo;burst error;multiplexing;pseudorandomness	Josep Solé-Pareta;Jordi Domingo-Pascual	1994	Computer Networks and ISDN Systems	10.1016/0169-7552(94)90002-7	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous communication;integrated services digital network;packet switching;computer network	Metrics	-0.05885988811042785	100.86128986371442	185002

Besides ensuring a fair access, the protocol also incorporates a spacing function. As the access system has only knowledge about VP's (and not about individual VC's), it can only space a bundle of VC's. In this paper, we isolate this bundle spacer and investigate its performance. It was already shown in [11 that spacing according to the sum of the peak bit rates of the individual Ws may lead to unacceptable waiting times introduced by the spacer. This would suggest the use of small spacing times. On the other hand, spacing is needed to reduce the clumping of cells introduced by previous multiplexing stages. In order to find optimal values for the spacing time, we study the following system. We let the bundle of Ws consist of background Ws (modeled by e.g. Poisson traffic) and a tagged VC, and study the reduction of the clumpedness by the bundle spacer through an analysis of the cell stream of the tagged VC at the output of the spacer.

In order to study the throughput of this system, we construct a novel analytical model by considering hybrid multiple access. Our throughput analysis shows that the throughput is significantly affected by the length of access time of CSMA/CA. A large length of access time of CSMA/CA will cause a low data transmission time in TDMA, while a short length of access time of CSMA/CA will cause a large number of data transmission collisions in CSMA/CA. The failure of data transmission channel release due to the collisions will lead to an increase in the unused data transmission time in TDMA. In order to improve the throughput, we introduce a private channel-release time to avoid the failure of data transmission channel release and provide the optimum access time of CSMA/CA, thereby maximizing the throughput. The proposed method can significantly improve the throughput of the IEEE 802.15.3c mm-wave WPAN system.	access time;channel (communications);throughput	Chang Woo Pyo;Hiroshi Harada	2009	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2009.091011	channel access method;distributed coordination function;telecommunications;computer science;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	7.689174497398219	93.4869726093782	185497

It is observed that when the number of users increases in each access category, the delay significantly increased in EDCA algorithm. The performance improvement in EDCA algorithm in fluctuating network load is a challenging task. To improve the performance of EDCA algorithm for delay sensitive services, we propose an adaptive contention window algorithm, which adjusts the contention window with the number of user in each access category. We introduce a simple but novel model for delay analysis based on EDCA mechanism. The proposed model analyzes the quality of service for the delay-sensitive applications such as voice and video. The simulation result verifies the significance of the proposed model compared to the EDCA model.	algorithm;quality of service;simulation	Ikram Syed;Byeong-Hee Roh	2016	2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)	10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820668	algorithm design;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;particle detector;computer network	Visualization	2.271160903958734	95.72123452265225	185519

The central problem underlying resource allocation for such systems is realizing QoS/QoE trade-offs given the dynamic loads and capacity variability they would typically see. The paper explores a framework for context-aware scheduling based on: (1) context-aware flow classification and management, and (2), complementary base station scheduler. Motivated by typical flow-size distributions for current traffic and characteristics of the associated delay optimal (Gittins index-based) schedulers we propose a novel flow and channel-aware scheduler which meets our design objectives. Using a combination of analysis and simulation we explore the achieved QoS/QoE trade-offs across a dynamic mix of traffic, in particular: 1) mobile web browsing and small file delays; 2) stored streaming video quality vs re-buffering; 3) throughput of larger file downloads. They suggest improved QoS/QoE tradeoffs vs traditional proportionally fair schedulers and are robust to the network load.	heterogeneous computing;network congestion;proportionally fair;quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;spatial variability;streaming media;throughput	Arjun Anand;Gustavo de Veciana	2016	2016 14th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	10.1109/WIOPT.2016.7492916	real-time computing;simulation;traffic classification;computer science;operating system;computer network	Arch	2.836730160612812	96.9571842791523	185954

The probability that a packet contains          at least one lost cell depends on the packet length. It is thus very likely that the          performance of the end‐to‐end communication is influenced by the packet length. In          this paper, we analyse packet loss probability and the achievable maximum throughput          when a block of data is divided into packets of fixed size and the lost packets are          retransmitted based on the selective repeat automatic repeat request (ARQ). Through          this analysis, we examine the effect of packet length and peak cell transmission rate          on the performance measures mentioned above. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.       	atm turbo;network packet	Kazumi Kumazoe;Kenji Kawahara;Tetsuya Takine;Yuji Oie	1997	Int.

Each node independently selects its cross-layer parameter vector for each packet that it forwards. It entails the setting of the transmission data rate and the identification of the neighboring node to which the packet is forwarded (and thus the selection of the route). We present an analytical model to calculate, for each candidate parameter vector, the corresponding attainable throughput and transport throughput capacity rates. To enable throughput-effective network operations, we present cross-layer schemes under which each node configures its parameter vector by using the transport throughput capacity measures that it computes, for each candidate attached link, as key metrics. We present two such datagram-based cross-layer parameter vector selection schemes, one of which makes use of observed channel status statistical data. We compare the network’s throughput performance behavior attained under the use of these schemes, demonstrating the performance enhancement that is offered by schemes that use cross-layer adaptations that are guided by calculations of link transport throughput capacity metrics.

All network and protocol elements have been implemented in detail. A large scale DQDB network with 12 nodes and 24 access units is studied. QoS parameters of 552 TCP connections between end users are analyzed. The average frame length in our traac source model has been chosen according to the characteristics of WWW traac. We have analyzed two network models with diierent sizes of the buuers in the access unit. The innuence of the buuer size on QoS parameters and transmission performance has been examined. The worst case connections in the DQDB network have been also studied. Simulation results for throughput of the DQDB busses and the loss of IP packets in the DQDB network are given. TCP throughput and transmission times at two protocol levels are measured. Our results show a good utilization of the DQDB network capacity. The peak transmission delays in higher network load area depend on the size of sender buuers in the access unit. There is a signiicant unfairness for connection between far-oo stations in the network.	best, worst and average case;internet protocol suite;open-source software;protocol stack;quality of service;simulation;throughput;www	H.

Since the transmission control protocol (TCP) is perhaps the most widely used transport layer protocol in existing data networks, the performance of TCP over ATM using ABR and UBR services with EPD schemes is of great interest to ATM equipment vendors and service providers. With regard to this interesting issue, we demonstrate in earlier work [1] some simulation results, which show that (1) with UBR service and EPD schemes, TCP suffers significant performance degradation in terms of fairness and requires a relatively large switch buffer even with a small number of active virtual connections over a LAN configuration, and (2) for the same set of network configurations and with ABR service, TCP achieves good performance in terms of fairness and link utilization, and requires relatively small switch buffer. In this paper, we extend our work [1] by studying the performance of TCP over UBR service where EPD schemes are improved by using per-VC accounting and per-VC queueing techniques. In particular, our simulation results show that in a LAN environment, per-VC based EPD schemes can significantly improve the performance of TCP over UBR service in terms of fairness.	atm turbo;network packet	Hongqing Li;Kai-Yeung Siu;Henry H.-Y.

In this paper, we present an overview of the most representative and recent strategies. We also compare them.

This paper simulates the satellite-earth link channel of SGIN based on the simulation environment of OMNeT++. We set up the model of space-ground network and satellite-earth link channel. The satellite-earth link channel includes two main parts, one part is the free space channel that ranges from the satellites to the aerosphere and the other part is the channel that ranges from aerosphere to the ground terminals. According to the ITU Recommendations, we simulate the satellite-earth link channel of the SGIN, from the results of the simulation. We analyze the satellite-earth link channel attenuation, obtaining the packet delay and packet arrival rate of the SGIN as well.	network packet;queueing theory;recommender system;simulation	Beishan Wang;Qi Guo	2017	ICST Trans.

First, P2 can provide better effective rate and more available bandwidth than P1. Second, P2 can support more simultaneous subscribers than P1. These advantages are shown through simulations with WWW traffic modeling.	access control;telecommunications link	Soon Young Yoon;Sung Won Lee	2001		10.1109/VTC.2001.957263	cyclic redundancy check;the internet;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;computer security;tail;bandwidth;statistics;computer network;effective interest rate	Security	4.952732565486672	98.4856321392835	186985

The use of queue thresholds is a well known technique for network traffic congestion control. The external traffic is modelled using the generalised exponential (GE) distribution which can capture the bursty property of network traffic. The analytical solution is obtained using the maximum entropy (ME) principle. The forms of the state and blocking probabilities are analytically established at equilibrium via appropriate mean value constraints.

MBMS can supply users with resources in two different modalities: point-to-point (PtP) and point-to-multipoint (PtM). The power consumed by the network is an important topic to discuss when considering the presence of MBMS services. The UMTS system is, in fact, interferencelimited; thus, the power available to Node B is limited and it must be enough to serve any user under its coverage. Therefore, the choice of the most efficient transport channel in terms of power consumption is a key aspect for the MBMS, since a wrong transport channel selection for the transmission of the MBMS data could adversely affect the overall capacity of the system. In this paper we search for the most efficient transport channel to convey MBMS data, by comparing the performance of the High Speed Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH), the Dedicated Channel (DCH), and the Forward Access Channel (FACH), for given transmission power levels and cell coverage size.	compaq lte;hs algorithm;multimedia broadcast multicast service;multipoint ground;point-to-multipoint communication;point-to-point (telecommunications);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;telecommunications link	Alessandro Raschellà;Anna Umbert;Giuseppe Araniti;Antonio Iera;Antonella Molinaro	2009	VTC Spring 2009 - IEEE 69th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2009.5073855	universal mobile telecommunications system;3rd generation partnership project 2;telecommunications;network switch;point-to-point;computer science;phase-shift keying;distributed computing;interference;multimedia broadcast multicast service;signal-to-noise ratio;digital video broadcasting;umts frequency bands;computer network	Mobile	8.213922232220707	96.82556586477513	187353

An RD router provides service differentiation via transmission scheduling and by managing two FIFO queues. To ensure strict delay bounds, an RD router tracks arrival times of packets in the D service queue, and discards late packets at the queue head. However, maintaining the per-packet state is undesirable for complexity and cost reasons. In this paper, we present a Stateless RD (S-RD) router design that provides low queuing delay to the D service exclusively via buffer dimensioning, without requiring any per-packet state. After proving analytically that the S-RD design meets the delay guarantees, we use simulation to evaluate the performance of the stateless design, confirming that S-RD routers preserve the delay bounds of RD network services. As case studies, we consider Voice-over-IP (VoIP) and Web browsing as particular examples of Internet applications. The extensive simulation results demonstrate that S-RD Network Services significantly improve VoIP quality and increase the goodput of short-lived Web flows, without degrading the throughput of long-lived flows.	differentiated services;fifo (computing and electronics);goodput;informatics;network packet;perceived performance;queuing delay;router (computing);ruby document format;scheduling (computing);simulation;stateless protocol;throughput;world wide web	Maxim Podlesny;Sergey Gorinsky	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-12963-6_11	high-throughput screening;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;differentiated service;resource allocation;computer science;operating system;voice over ip;distributed computing;computer security;queuing delay;computer network	Networks	-2.5899558429783522	95.52205335140893	187420

Specifically, we consider the problem of efficiently supporting a mix of Voice over IP (VoIP) and delay-insensitive traffic, assuming a narrowband physical layer with CSMA/CA capabilities. The VoIP call carrying capacity of wireless mesh networks based on classical CSMA/CA (e.g., the IEEE 802.11 standard) is low compared to the raw available bandwidth, due to lack of bandwidth and delay guarantees. Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) could potentially provide such guarantees, but it requires fine-grained network-wide synchronization and scheduling, which are difficult to implement. In this paper, we introduce Sticky CSMA/CA, a new medium access mechanism that provides TDM-like performance to real-time flows without requiring explicit synchronization. We exploit the natural periodicity of VoIP flows to obtain implicit synchronization and multiplexing gains. Nodes monitor the medium using the standard CSMA/CA mechanism, except that they remember the recent history of activity in the medium. A newly arriving VoIP flow uses this information to grab the medium at the first available opportunity, and then sticks to a periodic schedule, providing delay and bandwidth guarantees. Delay-insensitive traffic fills the gaps left by the real-time flows using novel contention mechanisms to ensure efficient use of the leftover bandwidth. Large gains over IEEE 802.11 networks are demonstrated in terms of increased voice call carrying capacity (more than 100% in some cases). We briefly discuss extensions of these ideas to a broader class of real-time applications, in which artificially imposing periodicity (or some other form of regularity) at the application layer can lead to significant enhancements of QoS due to improved medium access.	access control;bandwidth (signal processing);delay insensitive circuit;mesh networking;multiplexing;quality of service;quasiperiodicity;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time web;scheduling (computing);sticky bit;wireless mesh network	Sumit Singh;Prashanth Aravinda Kumar Acharya;Upamanyu Madhow;Elizabeth M.

3e237f03963a897fe220fad5bf5fd8a836a8e44a	a cross-layer flow schedule with dynamical grouping for avoiding tcp incast problem in data center networks	tcp incast;qos;sla;data center network	Data center network (DCN), a type of network featuring low delays and high bandwidths, exchanges information rapidly through high-performance network switches. Currently, DCN provides various distributed services to satisfy user requirements. However, the size of buffers in the switches of DCNs is limited, thus causing throughput collapse when transmission control protocol (TCP) is used for multiple-to-one transmissions. Dropped packets result in additional retransmission costs and cause a substantial decrease in the efficient use of network bandwidths. Such a decrease in network performance is called a TCP incast problem. Previous studies have typically focused on modifying the original TCP or increasing additional switch hardware costs; rarely have studies focused on the existing DCN environments. Therefore, this study proposes using a cross-layer flow schedule with dynamical grouping (CLFS-DG) scheme to reduce the effect of TCP incast in DCNs. In CLSFDG, data transmission schedules are organized by a receiver using application-level information. Multiple data flows are then grouped for simultaneously transmission to improve TCP throughput and satisfy deadline requirements. The simulation result indicated that CLFS-DG can effectively prevent TCP incast occurrence and ensure the quality of service in the DCN.	data center;discontinuous galerkin method;dynamic circuit network;network performance;network switch;quality of service;requirement;retransmission (data networks);simulation;throughput;user requirements document	Hsueh-Wen Tseng;Wan-Chi Chang;I-Hsuan Peng;Pei-Shan Chen	2016		10.1145/2987386.2987389	tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;computer science;tcp hole punching;distributed computing;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;computer network	Networks	-3.105522531268257	94.42984940962808	188046

Flow-based network traffic capture and storage is an efficient way for high-speed network measurement. Based on the statistical investigation of the correlations between flow size and the maximum packet interinterval time of consecutive packets within a flow, we obtain the empirical conditional distribution functions for some popular TCP protocol-based application flows, and then propose a probability-guaranteed adaptive timeout algorithm (PGAT) for flow termination decision. The assessment criteria for the flow termination decision algorithm is systematically developed. Comparisons on flow generation ratio, flow intact ratio, and mean flow extra retaining time metrics indicate that the PGAT algorithm can obtain more attractive performance than other schemes.	algorithm;flow network;global communications conference;lossless compression;network packet;network traffic control;requirement	Junfeng Wang;Lei Li;Mingtian Zhou;Fanjiang Xu;Fuchun Sun	2004	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference, 2004.

In the DoS attack, a large number of systems send malicious packets that are useless to jam a victim which makes it unavailable to access the resources of the networks. The Low-rate DoS (L-DoS) attack is one of the major types of DoS attack that is not easy to detect. The various Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes have been compared to find the decrease in throughput and increase in loss rate, that results due to DoS attack. Various AQM techniques that we try to compare are: Drop-tail, Random Exponential Marking (REM), Random Early Detection (RED), Fair Queuing (FQ), Stochastic Fair Queuing (SFQ), and Proportional Integrator (PI). The throughput, end-to-end delay and loss rate are computed and plotted with respect to number of attackers and burst rate.	active queue management;denial-of-service attack;end-to-end principle;fair queuing;fully qualified name;item unique identification;jam;network scheduler;random early detection;throughput	Sanjeev Patel;Abhinav Sharma	2017	2017 Tenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3)	10.1109/IC3.2017.8284360	integrator;the internet;artificial intelligence;throughput;random early detection;fair queuing;active queue management;pattern recognition;computer network;network packet;computer science;denial-of-service attack	Metrics	-3.1977903882205205	93.2343049985981	188330
6094d876daf6c4abff67d1c0c3b41bee71abe378	the performance evaluation of an ieee 802.11 network containing misbehavior nodes under different backoff algorithms		Security of any wireless network is always an important issue due to its serious impacts on network performance. Practically, the IEEE 802.11 medium access control can be violated by several native or smart attacks that result in downgrading network performance. In recent years, there are several studies using analytical model to analyze medium access control (MAC) layer misbehavior issue to explore this problem but they have focused on binary exponential backoff only. Moreover, a practical condition such as the freezing backoff issue is not included in the previous models. Hence, this paper presents a novel analytical model of the IEEE 802.11 MAC to thoroughly understand impacts of misbehaving node on network throughput and delay parameters. Particularly, the model can express detailed backoff algorithms so that the evaluation of the network performance under some typical attacks through numerical simulation results would be easy.	algorithm;backoff;performance evaluation	Trong-Minh Hoang;Van-Kien Bui;Thanh-Tra Nguyen	2017	Security and Communication Networks	10.1155/2017/2459780	network allocation vector;telecommunications;computer science;exponential backoff;computer security;computer network	Vision	5.108277223375132	90.74977806141452	188341

We propose a novel and simple analytical model to approximately calculate the per-flow TCP congestion window limit that provides fair and e fficient TCP access in a heterogeneous wiredwireless scenario. The proposed analysis is unique in that i t considers the effects of varying number of uplink and downlink TCP flows, differing Round Trip Times (RTTs) among T CP connections, and the use of delayed TCP Acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism. Motivated by the findings o f this analysis, we design a link layer access control block to be employed only at the Access Point (AP) in o rder to resolve the unfair access problem. The novel and simple idea of the proposed link layer access contr ol block is employing a congestion control and filtering algorithm on TCP ACK packets of uplink flows, thereb y prioritizing the access of TCP data packets of downlink flows at the AP. Via simulations, we show that shortand long-term fair access can be provisioned with the introduction of the proposed link layer access control b l ck to the protocol stack of the AP while improving channel utilization and access delay.	access control;acknowledgement (data networks);acknowledgment index;algorithm;network congestion;network packet;protocol stack;simulation;tcp congestion control;telecommunications link;throughput	Feyza Keceli;Inanc Inan;Ender Ayanoglu	2008	CoRR		compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;service set;link layer;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;media access control;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;tcp pacing;telecommunications;computer science;access control;tcp hole punching;transmission control protocol;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;round-trip delay time;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;network layer;computer network	Mobile	-3.34336442988963	93.83784714244874	188350

Furthermore, we show that no correct Interest forwarding strategy can be defined that allows Interest aggregation and attempts to detect Interest looping by identifying Interests uniquely. We introduce SIFAH (Strategy for Interest Forwarding and Aggregation with Hop-Counts), the first Interest forwarding strategy shown to be correct under any operational conditions of a content centric network. SIFAH operates by having forwarding information bases (FIBs) store the next hops and number of hops to named content, and by having each Interest state the name of the requested content and the hop count from the router forwarding an Interest to the content. We present the results of simulation experiments using the ndnSIM simulator comparing CCN and NDN with SIFAH. The results of these experiments illustrate the negative impact of undetected Interest looping when Interests are aggregated in CCN and NDN, and the performance advantages of using SIFAH.	acknowledgement (data networks);control flow;cryptographic nonce;cyclomatic complexity;end-to-end principle;experiment;hop;overhead (computing);retransmission (data networks);router (computing);routing table;sensor;simulation;timer;user-generated content	J.

In this paper, we first develop an analytical model that enables us to quantitatively evaluate the effect of packet sampling on the detection accuracy and then investigate why detection accuracy worsens when the packet sampling rate decreases. In addition, we show that, even with a low sampling rate, spatially partitioning the monitored traffic into groups makes it possible to increase the detection accuracy. We also develop a method of determining an appropriate number of partitioned groups and show its effectiveness.	network packet;syn flood;sampling (signal processing);sensor	Ryoichi Kawahara;Keisuke Ishibashi;Tatsuya Mori;Noriaki Kamiyama;Shigeaki Harada;Shoichiro Asano	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.376	traffic generation model;sampling;network traffic control;the internet;packet analyzer;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;space partitioning;end-to-end delay;computer security;packet switching;internet traffic engineering;computer network	Metrics	-3.0789425361645755	98.798629272841	188594

By using IEEE 802.11 as a study case, we identify that contention based asynchronous MAC protocols can suffer from a fundamental fairness problem, i.e., some flows seize the whole channel capacity while others virtually get nothing. This problem is known as one/zero fairness problem. To address the problem, we propose a hybrid MAC protocol that operates in a single channel and employs sender-initiated (SI) and receiver-initiated (RI) schemes as well as a power control mechanism. Simulation results show that the hybrid protocol relieves the one/zero fairness problem to a large extent without impairing aggregate throughput significantly, and in some scenarios, it even improves aggregate throughput	aggregate data;channel capacity;fairness measure;hoc (programming language);hop;interference (communication);rs-232;real life;simulation;throughput	Jun He;Hung Keng Pung	2003			optimized link state routing protocol;power control;hop (networking);mobile ad hoc network;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;distributed computing;computer science;computer network;vehicular ad hoc network;ad hoc wireless distribution service;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	8.667136759239021	90.92462495862121	188856

The switchings or changes in the network topology are modeled by a Markovian jump process. By utilizing guaranteed cost control principles, the proposed congestion control schemes do indeed take into account the associated physical network resource constraints and are shown to be robust to unknown and time-varying network latencies and time delays. A set of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions are obtained to guarantee the QoS of the Diff-Serv traffic with a guaranteed upper bound cost. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed strategies.

fcad8dbbf8851c9536e63c2d99d6bd6b537e173f	robust data link protocols for connection-less service over satellite links		The performance of the connection-less network service (CLNS) over a satellite link with features such as high propagation delay and a varying (often high) level of errors, can be improved using the connection oriented data link (CODL) service. However, although existing CODL protocols satisfy the requirements of a connection oriented network protocol (e.g. X.25), they are not optimal for the CLNS over satellite links. The interaction of link error recovery procedures with the error recovery procedures implemented by CLNS users, the unnecessary delay due to link protocol sequencing and recovery procedures, and the interaction between applications with different quality of service (QoS) requirements cause most CODL protocols to have a detrimental impact on the performance of the CLNS. This study presents a new link protocol, which improves the quality of the CLNS (e.g. IP), especially considering the enhancement of the performance of connection-oriented transport protocols (e.g. TCP). The performance improvement using the new link protocols is demonstrated by implementation in a satellite interworking unit.		Nihal K. G. Samaraweera;Godred Fairhurst	1996	Int. J.

This paper presents an analytical model for perform ability modelling and evaluation of a WLAN. The spectral expansion method is employed for the exact solution of the analytical model considered.

ba6595a7e6b2e5ea150de212b5a5eaa6a3a7b7ef	cross-layer design to improve elastic traffic performance in wlans	cross layer design;elastic traffic	In this paper, we are interested in improving TCP flow performance when a short loss of 802.11 signal leads to losing segments and triggers inappropriately TCP congestion control mechanisms. A set of measurements in a common wireless environment with signal losses due to mobility or interference is made to highlight the distinct MAC and TCP loss recovery levels and the lack of interactions between them. Initially, we demonstrate the interest of adapting the 802.11 MAC layer Retry Limit parameter in the case of signal losses due to distance or obstacles (mobility). Thus, a first-level loss differentiation algorithm (LDA) acting at the MAC layer is proposed to improve TCP flow performance in the case of segment losses due to mobility. Hence, for a signal failure, the MAC layer reacts consequently by dynamically adapting the Retry Limit parameter. This adaptation allows avoiding a costly end-to-end TCP loss recovery. Segment losses due to interference are differentiated from those due to congestion through the use of a second-level LDA. The latter is a cross-layer LDA acting at the TCP layer but using a specific 802.11 parameter, the AckFailureCount, to realize the targeted loss differentiation. The TCP NewReno version is then adapted in order to integrate the cross-layer LDA results and to avoid reducing the TCP congestion window unsuitably. The efficiency and completeness of a solution integrating both LDA schemes is then discussed.

Our results are based on 23 minutes of video obtained from the entertainment movie, The Wizard of Oz. The experimental setup which was used to capture, digitize, and compress the video stream is described. Although the study is conducted at the frame level (as opposed to the slice level), it is observed that the inter-frame correlation structure for the frame-size sequence involves complicated forms of pseudo-periodicity that are mainly aaected by the compression pattern of the sequence. A simple model for an MPEG traac source is developed in which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the original captured video stream. The number of cells per frame is tted by a lognormal distribution. Simulations are used to study the performance of an ATM multiplexer for MPEG streams.	atm turbo;computer simulation;moving picture experts group;multiplexer;multiplexing;quasiperiodicity;streaming media;volume boot record	Marwan Krunz;Ron Sass;Herman D.

The Request-to-Send and Clear-to-Send message dialogue helps a transmitter detect whether an intended receiver is busy and whether any collision has occurred; thus speeding up the retransmission. The spreading code assignment avoids the disruption of any ongoing transmission by an intruder. Finally, the packets are sent under controlled time of arrival to further increase the channel throughput. Simulation results confirm that a higher channel throughput is achieved by the new protocols even in a dense network.	denial-of-service attack;rs-232;retransmission (data networks);simulation;throughput;time of arrival;transmitter	Mario Joa-Ng	2001	Telecommunication Systems	10.1023/A:1016799721296	carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance;real-time computing;collision domain;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;time of arrival;spread spectrum;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	9.323542652574611	91.06605065144828	190623

We describe many recently proposed algorithms to combat congestion and improve performance, particularly active queue management (AQM) algorithms such as random early detection (RED) and its variants. We then survey control-theoretic analysis and design of TCP congestion control with an AQM scheme. In addition, we discuss three problems associated with AQM proposals: parameter setting, the insensitivity to the input traffic load variation, and the mismatch between macroscopic and microscopic behavior of queue length dynamics. As alternatives to AQM algorithms, we also survey architectural approaches such as modification of source or network algorithms, and economic approaches including pricing or optimization of allocated resources. Finally, we list many open issues that persist in the design, operation, and control of the Internet.	active queue management;algorithm;internet protocol suite;mathematical optimization;network congestion;random early detection;tcp congestion control;theory	Seungwan Ryu;Christopher M.

We consider a per-user checkpointing approach for the home location register (HLR) database. In this approach, individual HLR records are saved into a backup database from time to time. When a failure occurs, the backup record is restored back to the mobility database. We first describe a commonly used basic checkpoint algorithm. Then, we propose a new checkpoint algorithm. An analytic model is developed to compare these two algorithms in terms of the checkpoint cost and the probability that an HLR backup record is obsolete. This analytic model is validated against simulation experiments. Numerical examples indicate that our new algorithm may significantly outperform the basic algorithm in terms of both performance measures.	algorithm;application checkpointing;backup;circuit restoration;circuit switching;experiment;glossary of computer graphics;hidden line removal;numerical method;optical mesh network;parameter (computer programming);simulation;transaction processing system	Yi-Bing Lin	2005	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2005.28	real-time computing;index term;telecommunications;mobile database;computer science;operating system;probability;computer security;computer network;general packet radio service	DB	5.558680168585313	100.16272951632502	190666

A doi:10.1016/j.comcom.2011.07.005 ⇑ Corresponding author. Tel.: +81 77 561 2692; fax E-mail addresses: gr023015@ed.ritsumei.ac.jp, hoa WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) has been seen to be one of the promising access technologies that adapts to 4G cellular network systems in providing very high speed connection with QoS guarantee through the polling function. However, when the handover happens, the contention-based medium access mechanism which is mainly used in WLAN is invoked and introduces unbounded transmission delay due to idle time periods and retransmission because of collision during the handover. If this technique is expanded to use in a microcellular network such as connected WLAN micro-cells, contention-based mechanism, therefore, should not be used to handle the MT’s handover, especially for vehicular users who change access point every few seconds. To overcome these difficulties in handover, we introduce parallel polling scheme in dynamic LMC (Logical Macro Cell) which can reduce delays much and remove packet loss rate. LMC is a virtual single macro cell which is built on a multicast group of adjacent micro-cells. In the same LMC, polling signals are sent from every BS (base station) to give MT (mobile terminal) permission to access one of these BSs. Instead of wasting much time to contend for resources of a new BS during handover, the MT answers the polling as an acknowledgment to connect to that new BS. The polling response is controlled to multicast to all BSs of the same LMC via the core network to synchronize for the next polling cycle. LMC is controlled to dynamically change when the MT comes in a new BS to make polling signals be continuous in a new LMC. Through analytical and simulation results, we show that the parallel polling scheme can achieve no handover latency, no packet loss and maintain mobile users’ throughput stably in the high traffic load condition though it causes overhead on the neighboring cells in both of wired and wireless sections. At speeds of up to70 m/s, the MT can still maintain its stable connection. OMNeT++ simulator with INET project is used to evaluate our proposal. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This assumption implies that handovers are happening according to geographic (mobile location) criteria. This paper examines the way handover-related parameters such as handover margin, averaging window and measurement period affect the handover procedure and the statistics of its associated parameters like cell residence time, number of handovers and channel holding time. Furthermore, it compares these statistics results with the predictions of the mobility modelling and other assumptions commonly made. In a nutshell, mobility modelling results regarding cell residence time could be used for relatively large handover margins 10 dB to 15 dB, whilst the averaging window equals 15 s, and generally exponential distribution approximations should be avoided. In contrast, under the same circumstances, the channel holding time could be assumed to be exponentially distributed. INTRODUCTION However, in reality a handover is initiated if certain radio channel quality criteria are met, such as the received signal strength of an adjacent cell is greater than that of the serving cell or the received signal strength of the serving cell falls below an absolute value. This fundamental difference has a tremendous impact on the statistics of the various handover parameters, which is mainly caused by the presence of shadowing and the several techniques in use aiming at the mitigation of its undesired consequences. Ideally, if there were no shadowing present, the received signal strength at the mobile station would be simply a function of the distance from the serving base station, and as a result the previous assumption would be valid. But since this does not happen, the mobile station has to perform frequently measurements and to report them regularly back to the network. Next, the network filters them and either at certain instances or whenever required it consults them in order to reach a decision regarding the initiation or not of a handover. Predominantly, mobility modelling is used in examining various issues involved in a cellular system, like dimensioning of signalling network, user location updating, registration, paging and of course handover. Thus, by modelling the mobility behaviour of a specific type of mobile users, it is possible to understand the For example, in GSM [4],[3] a mobile station (whilst in serving cell and as many as possible (at least 6 but ideally all) of the cells included in the neighbouring list mobility effect on the system performance and the necessary resources exclusively for handover usage, enhancing the provided quality-of-service (QoS). to dimension the network Or even to active mode) the received signal strength of the In mobility modelling, fundamental assumptions are made on the mobility characteristics, namely velocity and direction of the users. Typically, the initial velocity for every mobile user within the system is assumed to be constant or distributed with a uniform or a truncated normal distribution, and it may remain constant throughout the call duration or it may change uniformly within a range relative to the current velocity. The initial direction is selected to be uniformly distributed between 0"""" to 360"""" and it is allowed to change uniformly either within a certain range fa with respect to the current direction (vehicular-type mobile users) or without any restrictions (pedestrian-type users) [2]. In addition to that, a very crucial assumption is made. Handovers occur whenever a mobile user crosses the of its serving cell within 480 ms. At the end of the measuring period, it reports back to the network the signal strength of the serving along with 6 of the strongest neighbouring cells. Under normal conditions, where all of the serving cell measurements are greater than -103 dBm and the quality indicator shows acceptable interference levels (co-channel interference below 9.5 dB) neglecting in this way the need for an imperative handover, the network averages 32 consecutive measurements of the serving and of all (up to 32) neighbouring cells. Then, these averages are used to calculate the power budget parameter: where RXLEV-DL is the received signal strength of the serving cell, and RXLEV-NCELL, is the received signal strength of the nth neighbouring cell.

First, multimedia streaming sessions need to be resilient to the volatile network dynamics in peer-to-peer networks. Second, they need to take full advantage of the existing bandwidth capacities, by minimizing the delivery of redundant content during streaming. In this paper, we propose to use a recent coding technique, referred to as rateless codes, to code the multimedia bitstreams before they are transmitted over peer-to-peer links. The use of rateless codes eliminates the requirements of content reconciliation, as well as the risks of delivering redundant content over the network. It also helps the streaming sessions to adapt to volatile network dynamics. Our preliminary simulation results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our new contribution, as compared to traditional solutions with or without erasure codes.	erasure code;instability;peer-to-peer;requirement;simulation;streaming media	Chuan Wu;Baochun Li	2005		10.1145/1101149.1101211	erasure code;computer science;network dynamics;distributed computing;internet privacy;computer network	DB	1.22426162107186	91.05004588609351	191812

Thus, analysis of peer-to-peer applications and related optimization approaches (such as locality awareness or caching techniques) has been the subject of extensive recent research. In this paper we introduce and analyze a probabilistic model that employs a Markov chain, aiming to approximate the transient evolution of a swarm with a fixed number of peers. This model estimates the distribution of the number of chunks already downloaded by a certain peer at any time. We also show how this model can serve as a tool to analyze certain properties of peer-to-peer applications, such as monotonicity of performance, and primarily to evaluate the effectiveness of cache insertion in a network serving peer-to-peer. For tractability reasons, the model employs certain simplifications of the original BitTorrent protocol, the impact of which is limited as validated experimentally.	approximation algorithm;bittorrent;experiment;inter-domain;locality of reference;markov chain;markov model;mathematical optimization;network congestion;peer-to-peer file sharing;statistical model;swarm	Ioanna Papafili;George D.

In this network scenario, TCP window-based congestion control and rate-based congestion control at a rate-controlled link may not interact in a harmonious way. So, we present a packet dropping scheme called rate adaptive dropping (RAD) as a means for reconciling the mismatch between window-based and rate-based congestion controls. The main idea of RAD is to drop arriving packets depending on the rate feedback information so that dropped packets may notify TCP sources of incipient congestion before the gateway buffer overflows. We compare the performance of RAD with that of tail drop in terms of goodput and drop ratio. Results from simulations show that RAD achieves significant improvements over tail drop, especially when the gateway buffer size is around the bandwidth delay product or less.	network packet	Ji-Cheol Moon;Byeong Gi Lee	2001		10.1109/ICC.2001.936633	local area network;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;buffer overflow;computer science;natural satellite;feedback;h-tcp;tcp vegas;cubic tcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;tail;slow-start;transport layer;bandwidth;packet switching;goodput;computer network;intelligent control	Networks	-3.3503830578514213	95.23878937225386	191928

Multimode terminals for next generation wireless networks have the capability to support two or more classes of calls simultaneously. The problem of RAT selection for a group calls occurs in a HWN when a single RAT is to be selected for multiple classes of calls initiated from a multimode terminal, or when multiple classes of calls are to be handed over from one RAT to another. This paper addresses the problem of RAT selection for a group of calls in HWNs by using the modified TOPSIS group decision making technique. The paper proposes a RAT-selection algorithm that selects the most suitable RAT for a group of different classes of calls from a multimode terminal in HWNs. The algorithm considers users' preferences for individual RATs, which vary with each class of calls, in making RAT selection decisions in HWNs. A user's preference for each of the available RAT is specified by weights assigned by the user to the different RAT selection criteria for different classes of calls. Based on the assigned weights, the proposed algorithm aggregates individual calls' weights specified by the user to make a RAT-selection decision for a group of calls. Some numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed RAT-selection algorithm.	assistive technology;feature selection;next-generation network;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;selection algorithm;simulation	Olabisi Emmanuel Falowo;H.

They are tight, but there still remains a gap for small m. In this paper, we consider the case where m = 2, namely, a switch is equipped with two ports, which is called a bicordal buffer model. We propose an online algorithm called Segmental Greedy Algorithm (SG) and show that its competitive ratio is at most $\frac{16}{13} (\simeq 1.231)$, improving the previous upper bound by $\frac{9}{7} (\simeq 1.286)$. This matches the lower bound given by Schmidt.	network switch;protocol buffers	Koji M.

In V ANETs, the rapid movement of vehicles lead to the frequently handoff in different access points or base stations. To ensure that the transmission of packets will not be interrupted, how to reduce the delay of handoff is an important design issue. In view of this, we proposed a fast handoff scheme, called AAFHS. When vehicles leave the communication range of an access point (AP), their IP addresses can be reserved in the AP. Then the AP can pass the reserved IP addresses to the vehicles that are going to enter the communication range of the AP. In this way, it can reduce the use of DHCP to obtain IP addresses. Our simulation results show that the proposed fast handoff scheme can be used to effectively reduce the handoff time.	hoc (programming language)	Jen-Wen Ding;Hong-Chen Li;Yo-Hsuan Chuang;Chun-Kai Chang;Der-Chen Huang	2011		10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982628	vehicular ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;handover;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	5.255985137041336	88.58165478404082	192149

To support P traffic classes with different priorities, CICB switches requires N2 ldrkldrLldrP bytes to avoid blocking of high priority cells. In this paper, we study a shared-memory crosspoint buffered packet switch that uses small crosspoint buffers and no speedup to support differentiated services and long distances between the line cards and the buffered crossbar in practical implementations. The proposed switch requires 1/m of memory amount in a CICB switch to achieve similar throughput performance.	arithmetic underflow;blocking (computing);byte;crossbar switch;differentiated services;network packet;network switch;packet switching;shared memory;speedup;throughput	Ziqian Dong;Roberto Rojas-Cessa	2006	IEEE Globecom 2006	10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.345	shared memory;data flow diagram;real-time computing;index term;telecommunications;differentiated service;computer science;packet switch;round-trip delay time;differentiated services;packet switching;computer network	Metrics	-0.49721850227800934	94.19344332718866	192223

DARA significantly improves system reliability by addressing the challenges of estimating channel conditions caused by various dynamics due to factors, including channel fading, interference, and varying traffic density. One salient advantage of DARA is that it can estimate the average packet loss rate for each sender locally without the use of any control frames (such as ACK and RTS/CTS). DARA can also distinguish the interference losses from the fading losses based on an empirical model. It adjusts the bit rate only in response to the packet loss due to channel fading and the change of the traffic density. Simulation results demonstrate that DARA can provide reliability guarantees for vehicle safety communication.	acknowledgement (data networks);carpal tunnel syndrome;interference (communication);network packet;rs-232;simulation;telematics	Yuan Yao;Xingshe Zhou;Kailong Zhang	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2327618	vehicular ad hoc network;communications protocol;telecommunications;computer science;reliability;interference;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	5.701419675750207	89.40640739017027	192280

The influence of packet burst size, offered switch load and packet switch size are all investigated. Packet loss probability, average packet delay and 99.9% packet delay values are also derived. In comparison tests, FPCF packet switches perform better than VOQ-P packet switches and yield similar results to VOQ-S packet switches. The advantage of VOQ-S switches is manifested in somewhat lower probability of packet loss, while the advantage of FPCF switches is revealed in the limited values of their maximum packet delays. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

First, the call admission control function, which considers the inherent contention access feature of 802.11 MAC, aims to satisfy the QoS requirement of established higher priority connections, while protecting the minimum reserved bandwidth of traffic flows with lower priority at the same time. In addition, the proposed adaptive contention window adjustment mechanism dynamically adjusts the maximum and minimum contention window size based upon the equivalent established connection number observed by each individual access category. Such approach reduces the channel contention probability and packet access delay effectively. Performance results via simulations have shown the advantages achieved by employing these two mechanisms.	bus contention;maxima and minima;network packet;provisioning;quality of service;simulation;window function	Ho-Ting Wu;Minhua Yang;Kai-Wei Ke	2010	2010 8th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PERCOM Workshops)	10.1109/PERCOMW.2010.5470534	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;contention ratio;computer network	Embedded	0.15888236866026847	95.9918529517641	192396

The data are inserted and numbered into customized size relations at a predefined order. The server ability to create a full, regular Broadcast Plan (RBP) with single and multiple channels after some data transformations is examined. The Basic Regular Algorithm (BRA) prepares an RBP and enables users to catch their items while avoiding wasting energy by their devices. In the case of multiple channels a dynamic grouping solution is proposed, called the Partition Value Algorithm with Less Dimension (PVALD), under a multiplicity constraint. In order to provide an RBP under relative delays a Dimensioning Algorithm (DA) is developed. The DA, with the criterion of ratio, offers the differentiation of service. This last property, in addition to the self-monitoring, and selforganizing, can be offered by servers today providing also channel availability and lower energy consumption by using a smaller, number of channels, of equal bandwidth.

Radio channel sharing is performed by the PRADOS (Prioritized Regulated Allocation Delay Oriented Scheduling) algorithm. In this paper we assess the capability of PRADOS to guarantee to voice and data traffic types the QoS they need. The analysis leads to the conclusion that PRADOS cannot avoid the interference between the various types of traffic. A criterion to alleviate this drawback is also outlined at the end of the paper.	atm turbo;algorithm;interference (communication);performance evaluation;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;world wide web	G.

Traditional automatic retransmission request (ARQ) protocol retransmits one packet per slot, which leads to low spectrum efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Max2-Min Network Coding based Wireless BroadCasting (WBC) protocol. Specifically, to reduce the overall number of retransmissions, lost packets of different user equipments (UEs) are combined by performing Max2-Min network coding (NC) at the base station. Then, NC combined packets are broadcasted to all the UEs. At each UE, lost packets can be recovered by using the proposed joint network and recursive systematic convolution (RSC) decoder (JNRD). Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed Max2-Min NC based WBC protocol outperforms traditional NC based WBC protocol on the average number of transmissions performance.	convolution;convolutional code;datacasting;linear network coding;network packet;recursion;retransmission (data networks);simulation;spectral efficiency	Hui Tian;Kui Xu;Youyun Xu;Dongmei Zhang;Wei Xie	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China (ChinaCom)	10.1109/CHINACOM.2015.7497933	linear network coding;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;packet forwarding;computer network	Mobile	9.143628940144863	91.15998805910824	192545

d16cfbc9e5aab358064c33d402f6ea29d8af9fec	a snr-based multi-channel multicast scheme for popular video in wireless networks	buffer requirements;waiting time;vod;bandwidth utilization	Multi-channel multicast/broadcast solution is used to improve Quality of Service (QoS) /Quality of Experience (QoE) of Video-on-Demand (VoD) service in mobile Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) applications. In this paper, a SNR-based multi-channel multicast scheme (SBMM) for popular video in wireless networks is proposed. Different from the existing fast data broadcasting scheme (FB), the wireless channel Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) is taken into account in SBMM. The higher-SNR channel is assigned with a higher channel rate. The higher-rate channel is used to transmit higher priority chunks, through which users’ waiting time is reduced and bandwidth utilization is improved. Simulation results show that 22.11% of FB’s start-up delay is reduced in average by SBMM and 49.52% at most. Moreover, 4.01% of FB’s download time is reduced in average by SBMM and 8.25% at most in the price of a small increase in buffer requirements. The additional space taken is 2.11% of the total video size in average and 6.19% at most. At the same time, SBMM can use bandwidth effectively through delivering chunks according to different priorities. As hardware technology develops, it is reasonable to reduce users’ waiting time further in the price of a small increase in buffer requirements.

In the proposed system, multiple redundant descriptions of the speech are transmitted to take advantage of largely uncorrelated delay and loss characteristics on independent network paths. Adaptive playout scheduling of multiple voice streams is then formulated as a constrained optimization problem leading to a better balance between end-to-end delay and packet loss. For proper reconstruction of continuous speech, we also develop a packet-based time-scale modification algorithm based on sinusoidal representation of the speech production mechanism. Experimental results indicate that the proposed adaptive multi-stream playout scheduling technique improves the delay-loss tradeoff as well as speech reconstruction quality.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);end-to-end principle;image scaling;internet protocol suite;mathematical optimization;national supercomputer centre in sweden;network packet;optimization problem;playout;real-time clock;scheduling (computing)	Chun-Feng Wu;I-Te Lin;Wen-Whei Chang	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		voice activity detection;real-time computing;speech recognition;computer science;processing delay;end-to-end delay;transmission delay;computer network	Mobile	-4.425782091963632	100.5052585253905	192952

Video packet scheduler assumes an architectural framework for multimedia networks based on sub-streams or flows. Each sub-stream has a different QoS requirement, and we can control degree of satisfaction for the required QoS considering network traffic characteristics (e.g. delay, jitter, and packet loss). In this paper, firstly, we designed a classification scheme to partition video data into multiple sub- streams which have their own QoS requirements. Secondly, we designed a management (reservation and scheduling) scheme for sub-streams to support better perceptual video quality such as the bound of end-to-end jitter. We used MPEG-4 advanced visual coding (AVC) for our source coding. We have shown that our video packet scheduling scheme satisfies QoS requirements using real video experiment over DAB networks.

In this paper, we develop a new MAC protocol for multichannel operation in wireless ad hoc networks. The proposed protocol is based on the code division multiple access (CDMA) technique where each spreading code represents one channel. However, the proposed MAC protocol is not limited to CDMA systems. It can be applicable within frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems (with one radio transceiver) or multi radio systems. We show through computer simulations that our proposition of multichannel MAC protocol significantly improves the communication performance in wireless ad hoc networks.	access control;carpal tunnel syndrome;channel (communications);computer simulation;frequency divider;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);network performance;rs-232;throughput;transceiver;transmitter	Thamer Al-Meshhadany;Wessam Ajib	2008	2008 International Conference on Information Networking	10.1109/ICOIN.2008.4472779	computer simulation;vehicular ad hoc network;wireless routing protocol;wireless ad hoc network;reverse address resolution protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;media access control;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	8.644817767042387	91.15221210057538	193178
a3c96c90126dbe141effbf92aa4c28f7c64f33ce	design and evaluation of a rate-based congestion control mechanism in coap for iot applications		CoAP is an application protocol that provides standardised RESTful services for IoT devices. Since COAP messages are encapsulated into UDP datagrams, COAP specification provides: i) optional reliability mechanisms through retransmissions, and ii) simple congestion control mechanisms based on retransmission timeouts. Recent studies have demonstrated that these congestion control schemes may significantly underperform when operating with bursty traffic. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose COAP-R, an alternative solution for regulating the sending rate of CoAP sources, which adopts a rate-based approach for traffic control. Key features of COPA-R are: i) to leverage the tree-based routing structure of IoT networks to estimate the maximum throughput that can be obtained on the bottleneck link of every upward route, and ii) to perform in a distributed manner a max-min fair allocation of available network capacity on the basis of estimated bottleneck bandwidths. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of simulations considering a scenario in which traffic is generated in bursts, for instance as consequence of events detected by sensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures a fair allocation of network resources, and leads to a 40% decrease of the data collection delays when compared to COAP.	bottleneck (network);constrained application protocol;control system;datagram;internet;max-min fairness;maximum throughput scheduling;multistage interconnection networks;network congestion;representational state transfer;retransmission (data networks);routing;sensor;simulation;transmitter	Emilio Ancillotti;Raffaele Bruno;Carlo Vallati;Enzo Mingozzi	2018	"""2018 IEEE 19th International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WoWMoM.2018.8449736	throughput;computer network;resource management;data collection;network congestion;datagram;internet of things;retransmission;bottleneck;computer science	Embedded	-0.23495073078221118	91.54869143971823	193294

This simple and elegant protocol has been found to be very challenging to analyze. It has been long recognized that DQDB suffers from inherent access unfairness problems and several solutions to this problem have been proposed in the literature. Unfortunately, none of these solutions is completely satisfactory. The main contribution of this work is to a new way of looking at fairness in a DQDB system. Our scheme is very simple and efficient to implement and compares favorably with the leading rate-controlled schemes proposed in the literature.

In view of the diverse design options, such models have many adjustable parameters and choosing the best set for a particular performance objective is a delicate and time-consuming task. We introduce an optimisation approach to automate this task, illustrated in a two-node, tandem network of routers with finite capacity and recovery buffers. We minimise the mean end-to-end delay subject to an upper limit on the rate of losses, which may be due to either full buffers or corrupted data. Losses at a full buffer are inferred by a time-out, whereas corrupted data is detected immediately on receipt of a packet at a router, causing a N-ACK to be sent upstream. Recovery buffers hold successfully transmitted packets so that, on receiving a N-ACK, the packet, if present, can be retransmitted, avoiding an expensive resend from source. Hence, a critical parameter that affects both loss rate and transmission time is the ratio of arrival-buffer size to recovery-buffer size. We develop a queueing model of this network and present graphs showing how end-to-end delay varies with certain parameter combinations. The tedious nature of trying to find the best parameter values in this way motivates our formal optimisation which yields optimal parameter values directly from the model specification using standard software.	acknowledgement (data networks);approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;computation;display resolution;end-to-end principle;lossy compression;markov chain;markov model;mathematical optimization;mega man network transmission;modulation;network packet;numerical analysis;point process;queueing theory;retransmission (data networks);router (computing);simulation;stochastic control;streaming media;while	Nalan Gülpinar;Peter G.

44d40e2bba868d3160996d9af494bdbb273e34be	sporadic ultra-time-critical messaging in v2x		Life-critical warning message, abbreviated as warning message, is a special event-driven message that carries emergency warning information in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). Two important characteristics that distinguish warning messages from ordinary vehicular messages are sporadicity and ultra-time-criticality. This paper puts forth a medium-access control (MAC) protocol for warning messages. To circumvent potential inefficiency arisen from sporadicity, we propose an override network architecture whereby warning messages are delivered on the network of the ordinary vehicular messages. Specifically, a vehicle with a warning message first sends an interrupt signal to pre- empt the transmission of ordinary messages, so that the warning message can use the wireless spectrum originally allocated to ordinary messages. In this way, no exclusive spectrum resources need to be pre-allocated to the sporadic warning messages. To meet the ultra-time- criticality requirement, we use advanced MAC techniques (e.g., coded ALOHA) to ensure highly reliable delivery of warning messages within an ultra-short time in the order of 10 ms. The overall MAC protocol operates by means of interrupt-and-access. We investigate the use of spread spectrum sequences as interrupt signals. Simulation results show that the missed detection rate (MDR) of the interrupt signals can be very small given sufficient sequence length, e.g., when SIR is -32 dB, a 0.43 ms sequence (64512 symbols, 150 MHz) can guarantee an MDR of 0.0001. For channel access, simulation results indicate that coded ALOHA can potentially satisfy the ultra- time-criticality requirements of warning messages. In the stringent scenario where 30 emergency nodes broadcast warning messages simultaneously, the message loss rate can be kept lower than 0.0001 with delay less than 10 ms.	access control;event-driven architecture;implicit shape model;interrupt;memory data register;network architecture;out-of-band agreement;reliable messaging;requirement;self-organized criticality;simulation	Yulin Shao;Soung Chang Liew;Jiaxin Liang	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422978	real-time computing;interrupt;computer network;spread spectrum;wireless;network architecture;computer science;broadcasting;communication channel	Mobile	8.211226447136667	90.96474218559442	193664

The main contribution of this work is then to propose a new method to estimate the tail index from sampled data, based on the resolution of the maximum likelihood problem. To assess the performance of our method, we present a full performance evaluation based on numerical simulations, and also on a real traffic trace corresponding to internet traffic recently acquired.	network packet;numerical analysis;performance evaluation;simulation;traffic analysis	Patrick Loiseau;Paulo Gonçalves;Stéphane Girard;Florence Forbes;Pascale Vicat-Blanc Primet	2009		10.1145/1555349.1555380	computer simulation;econometrics;mathematical optimization;expectation–maximization algorithm;computer science;mathematics;maximum likelihood;likelihood function;quasi-maximum likelihood;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;estimation theory;statistics	Metrics	-1.9453695333465804	100.70184643670356	193758

It is generally known [1] that effective bandwidths assigned to independent flows being multiplexed behave additively. Furthermore it has been shown [2] that under the many sources limiting regime, an effective bandwidth assigned to a flow passing through a switch is not changed, and inductively a flow has the same effective bandwidth through the entire network. If all flows feeding a network under consideration have well defined effective bandwidths and QoS demands, resource dimensioning can be done based on simple large deviation principles. We address the problem of specifying and limiting effective bandwidths of arriving flows by introducing a new shaping and policing algorithm based on an on-line effective bandwidth estimator. The presented algorithm’s functionality is verified by both synthetic and real data traces. Finally the performance of proposed algorithm variants is discussed.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);multiplexing;network packet;network scheduler;noise shaping;online and offline;recursion;server (computing);statistical model;stochastic process;synthetic intelligence;tracing (software)	Dirk Abendroth;Ulrich Killat	2003		10.1109/ICON.2003.1266217	stochastic process;real-time computing;quality of service;resource allocation;computer science;stochastic modelling;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Metrics	-0.5457969313976155	97.42649551474148	193760

The MAC layer in GPRS make use of slotted ALOHA protocol combined with a specific retransmission mechanism to establish the physical connection. The main object of the new mechanism is to avoid the mixture of retransmitted access request and the new ones. The primary profit is the decrease of the transmission attempts number needed to successfully transmit an access request. Thus, it decreases the delay of transmission of one access request and the access requests blocking percent.	blocking (computing);network packet;persistence (computer science);retransmission (data networks)	Wessam Ajib;Philippe Godlewski	2000		10.1109/PIMRC.2000.881606	gsm;cellular network;real-time computing;media access control;ground-penetrating radar;telecommunications link;telecommunications;computer science;mobile station;radio control;profitability index;computer network;general packet radio service	Mobile	5.817614275865597	97.00398678162858	194038

c5a3922b4a4626e48bee30d927f046e84dd06521	performance improvement of qos-enabled wlans using adaptive contention window backoff algorithm		Quality of service (QoS) is one of the critical aspects for real-time applications in wireless local area networks (WLANs). To provide QoS, WLANs use the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) with a fixed backoff range without considering the network load for estimating the backoff time. When the number of stations (STAs) increases in each access category (AC), the collision among STAs also increases; this leads to increased delay and decreased network throughput. In this paper, we aim to improve the QoS for WLANs and achieve better network performance in terms of high throughput, low collision rate, and small mean frame delay in delay-sensitive applications. To achieve this objective, we propose an adaptive contention window backoff mechanism that improves the QoS by adjusting the backoff time according to the active STAs in each AC. First, we estimate the number of STAs in each AC and then calculate the optimal contention window size based on the estimated STAs in each AC. We derived an analytical model for the proposed scheme and then conducted simulations to validate analytical model results. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms EDCA in terms of throughput and delay in different traffic scenarios.	algorithm;backoff;estimated;local area networks;network performance;quality of service;real-time clock;simulation;snup;throughput;collision	Ikram Syed;Seung-Hun Shin;Byeong-Hee Roh;Muhammad Adnan	2018	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2017.2694859	throughput;collision;quality of service;real-time computing;computer network;local area network;performance improvement;computer science;network performance;communication channel	Metrics	2.35443361881535	95.74968960621139	194314

TCP New Reno, the current TCP standard, performs greedy congestion control, which increases the congestion window size until packet loss occurs. Therefore, because TCP transmits data at a much higher rate than the video playback rate, the probability of packet loss in the network increases, which in turn takes bandwidth from other network traffic. In this paper, we propose a new transport-layer protocol, called TCP Stream, which solves the problem of TCP in video streaming. TCP Stream performs a hybrid congestion control that combines the loss-based congestion control, which uses packet loss as an index of congestion, and the delay-based congestion control, which uses delay as an index of congestion. Simulation and experimental results show that TCP Stream transmits data at the adjusted rate, unlike TCP New Reno, and does not steal bandwidth from other network traffic.	greedy algorithm;network congestion;network packet;network traffic control;simulation;streaming media;tcp congestion control	Hiroki Oda;Hiroyuki Hisamatsu;Hiroshi Noborio	2011	2011 IEEE 11th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology	10.1109/CIT.2011.63	tcp westwood;compound tcp;tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;throughput;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;computer science;bic tcp;tcp hole punching;transmission control protocol;h-tcp;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;scalable tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;packet loss;network congestion;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;bandwidth;computer network	Networks	-4.258761447070756	94.95164443932536	194352

When congestion occurs, one (or both) flows will suffer a loss that will cause its throughput to decrease by a multiplicative factor. The identity of the flow that will suffer a loss is determined by a randomized ‘‘loss strategy’’ that may depend on the throughputs of the flows at the congestion instant. We analyze several loss strategies: the one in which the identity of the flow experiencing the loss is independent of the current throughput and the one in which the flow with the largest throughput is to suffer the loss; this is compared with the strategy that assigns loss probabilities proportionally to the throughputs (thus a flow with a larger throughput has a larger loss probability). After deriving some results for the general asymmetric case, we focus in particular on the symmetric case and study the influence of the strategy on the average throughput and average utilization of the link. As the intuition says, a strategy that assigns a loss to a flow with a higher throughput is expected to give worse performance since the total instantaneous throughput after a loss is expected to be lower with such a strategy. Surprisingly, we show that this is not the case. We show that the average throughput and average link utilizations are invariant: they are the same under any possible strategy; the link utilization is 6/7 of the link capacity. We show, in contrast, that the second moment of the throughput does depend on the strategy. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, existing 2-dimensional (2-D) Markov chain models of 802.11 systems are unable to capture the complete QoS performance and queueing behavior due to the lack of an adequate finite buffer model. We present a 3-dimensional (3-D) Markov chain that integrates the 802.11 system contention resolution and queueing processes into one model. The 3rd dimension, that models the queue length, allows us to accurately capture important QoS measures, delay and loss, plus throughput and queue length, for realistic 802.11 systems with finite buffer under finite load. We derive an efficient method for solving the steady state probabilities of the Markov chain. Our 3-D Markov chain is the first finite buffer model defined and solved for 802.11 systems. The solutions, validated by extensive simulations, capture the system dynamics over a wide range of traffic load, buffer capacity, and network size. Our 3-D model points to the existence of an effective maximum throughput and shows its relationship with buffer capacity. We demonstrate that our 3-D model can also be used in resource allocation to determine adequate buffer sizes under a particular QoS constraint.	3d modeling;algorithm;buffer overflow;coding tree unit;design rule for camera file system;markov chain;maximum throughput scheduling;network packet;onset (audio);quality of service;queueing theory;simulation;steady state;system dynamics	Ren Ping Liu;Gordon Sutton;Iain B.

The proposed protocol allows a source device to transmit a burst of data frames to the intended destination device in a single channel access opportunity. After the successful reception of each data frame, the destination device may opportunistically respond with a data frame, thus being able to perform multiple RD transmissions. This operation can reduce the overall channel access overhead, hence increasing the efficiency of data transmission between two sender-receiver devices. The results obtained by means of theoretical analysis and computer-based simulation show that the novel RD protocol can outperform existing IEEE 802.11 protocols by yielding gains close to 60%.	access control;acknowledgement (data networks);burst transmission;design rule for camera file system;duplex (telecommunications);frame (networking);overhead (computing);real life;ruby document format;simulation;throughput	Raúl Palacios;Jesus Alonso-Zarate;Nelson Luis Saldanha da Fonseca;Fabrizio Granelli	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7842014	ieee 802.11s;transmitter;throughput;real-time computing;media access control;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;computer science;ieee 802.11h-2003;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005;ieee 802.1q	Mobile	9.012355118655972	90.7842292343128	194680

To attack this problem, this chapter describes a novel congestion control scheme that is based on a Back Propagation (BP) neural network technique.We consider a general computer communication model with multiple sources and one destination node. The dynamic buffer occupancy of the bottleneck node is predicted and controlled by using a BP neural network. The controlled best-effort traffic of the sources uses the bandwidth, which is left over by the guaranteed traffic. This control mechanism is shown to be able to avoid network congestion efficiently and to optimize the transfer performance both by the theoretic analyzing procedures and by the simulation studies.	artificial neural network;autonomic computing;control theory	Naixue N.

TCP congestion control algorithms are designed to provide a fair sharing of resources in a best effort network as the current Internet. TCP is not conscious of the new services proposed by DiffServ, namely the different priorities packets are injected with into the network. Many schemes have been proposed to support TCP traffic in a DiffServ network. These schemes have been often validated with simulations. In this paper we propose an analytical model to study the performance of TCP in a DiffServ network under the different proposed schemes. The model is based on a Markovian fluid approach. We present first a general version of the model, then we specify it to the different proposed schemes. For each scheme, we compute the throughput achieved by a TCP connection. We compare then the service differentiation provided by the proposed schemes under different subscription levels, different reservations, and different round-trip times. Our model forms a good tool for the evaluation of new solutions to support TCP traffic in a DiffServ network.	algorithm;best-effort delivery;differentiated services;network congestion;simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput	Chadi Barakat;Eitan Altman	2004	Telecommunication Systems	10.1023/B:TELS.0000011200.54357.dd	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;tcp delayed acknowledgment;real-time computing;tcp global synchronization;tcp pacing;differentiated service;computer science;transmission control protocol;h-tcp;zeta-tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;network congestion;tcp acceleration;round-trip delay time;computer security;tcp friendly rate control;differentiated services;slow-start;computer network	Metrics	-3.9059433042643645	94.8552146228847	195054

We call this new mechanism Gallop-Vegas because it quickly ramps up to the available bandwidth and reduces the burstiness during the slow-start phase. TCP is known to send bursts of packets during its slow-start phase due to the fast window increase and the ACK-clock based transmission. This phenomenon causes TCP Vegas to change from slow-start phase to congestion-avoidance phase too early in the large bandwidth-delay product (BDP) links. Therefore, in Gallop-Vegas, we increase the congestion window size with a rate between exponential growth and linear growth during slow-start phase. Our analysis, simulation results, and measurements on the Internet show that Gallop-Vegas significantly improves the performance of a connection, especially during the slow-start phase. Furthermore, it is implementation feasible because only sending part needs to be modified.	acknowledgement (data networks);bandwidth-delay product;fairness measure;icpads;linear function;network congestion;operating system;simulation;throughput;time complexity	Cheng-Yuan Ho;Yi-Cheng Chan;Yaw-Chung Chen	2005	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/ICPADS.2005.86	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;communications protocol;exponential growth;throughput;real-time computing;the internet;tcp global synchronization;tcp westwood plus;telecommunications;buffer overflow;computer science;transmission control protocol;internet protocol suite;tcp vegas;zeta-tcp;cubic tcp;hstcp;tcp tuning;tcp acceleration;tcp friendly rate control;transport layer;bandwidth;packet switching;computer network;bandwidth-delay product	Networks	-3.5630322805125916	94.27163828721974	195190
aa5da46b26d8de7d4c5b7db25d2a62b1d20a1e75	a qoe-driven spectrum decision scheme for multimedia transmissions over cognitive radio networks		Spectrum decision is the key function of a cognitive radio(CR) to choose the most proper spectrum band to meet secondary usersu0027(SUsu0027) quality of experience(QoE) requirements. It is challenging to perform spectrum decision for multimedia applications in cognitive radio networks(CRNs) due to two reasons. One is that QoE evaluation model for SU in CRNs is still an open issue, for the conventional QoE models neglecting the effects of primary usersu0027(PUsu0027) behavior. The other reason is the dynamic characteristics of available channel and competitions among SUs cause difficulty to satisfy heterogeneous SUsu0027 QoE requirements. Therefore, firstly we develop a satisfaction probability-based QoE evaluation model for multimedia CRN taking specific metrics handoff delay and handoff frequency into account. Then, based on this model, we proposed a spectrum decision scheme to maximize the SUsu0027 expectation of mean opinion score(MOS). The scheme adaptively achieve spectrum decision according to changing channel condition and SU traffic load. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed QoE-driven spectrum decision scheme improves SUsu0027 QoE satisfaction.	cognitive radio;numerical analysis;provisioning;requirement;simulation	Ling Wang;Junjie Yang;Xiaojun Song	2017	2017 26th International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038356	quality of service;mean opinion score;handover;computer network;cognitive radio;computer science;quality of experience;multimedia;communication channel;base station	Mobile	8.328054045115367	98.62837528764683	195480
fa1631f4f3d3ae8a9d032772b1b7bd5cf122cafd	a tcp enhancement method based on lte carrier aggregation usage identification		Carrier aggregation (CA) techniques in LTE-Advanced expand wireless data rates by using multiple component carriers (CCs) simultaneously. However, transport layer protocols such as TCP cannot utilize the full performance of CA because they control sending rates independently regardless of wireless capacities. In this paper we propose a TCP control method based on the identification result of CA usage. We found that the occurrence frequency of delay spikes correlated with the number of CCs through substantiative experiments. We then developed a CA identification method that uses the delay spikes' occurrence frequency. We proposed an adaptive TCP rate control method in accordance with estimated wireless bandwidth based on CA identification results. We verified that our method identified CA usage at 72% accuracy within one second, and increased average throughput by 15% for CA.

For that purpose, we design a novel real-time working perceptually based classifier (PBC) optimizing the assignment of voice packets to either a premium (Pch) or an ordinary (Och) transmission channel with regard to packet perceptual importance. In particular, our PBC is based on sliding window optimization (SWO) and implement PESQa, an improved method to real-time estimation of speech quality. Based on this PBC and a differentiated service (DS) implementation of the Pch/Och, objective results indicate that 70% premium packet assignments optimizes performance over a broad range of loss scenarios on a bottleneck link.

The delay and throughput performance for message transmission are obtained, and they agree closely with that obtained by simulation. The delay performance of CLAR is similar to that of the M-CSMA protocol for an M-channel network, but only CLAR can give a stable maximum throughput of (M-1)/M independent of the cable length. Moreover, CLAR requires only two sets of transceivers, while M-CSMA requires M. The lookahead reservation technique can provide 9% throughput increase for fixed-size messages and 19% for geometrically distributed messages. >	parsing	P. C.

This paper takes into account the vertical handoff decision algorithm in HWNs where multiple types of services with different priorities are supported. By modeling the vertical handoff process as a Markov decision process, a new reward function is introduced which consists of both quality of service profit and handoff cost. Meanwhile in the proposed reward function, multiple network parameters are included for a comprehensive evaluation of the network utilization. Moreover, considering multiple services with different priorities, an online dynamic bandwidth reservation scheme is proposed based on large deviation principle. This scheme, by estimating possible bandwidth request in future time slots, reserves the bandwidth resource adaptively in advance such that the call blocking probability as well as handoff dropping probability can be guaranteed to be within an admissible range. Simulation results show that the proposed vertical handoff decision algorithm can decrease the expected handoff number by about 15---22 % and significantly increase the expected total reward compared with existing results.	algorithm	Jin Zhu;Limin Xu;Lin Yang;Wanqing Xie	2015	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-015-2407-1	markov decision process;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	6.302507502314298	98.04755152843684	195715

We show that while for a specific network configuration, the derived delay bound is not restricted by the utilization level on the guaranteed rate, it is so for a general network configuration.	aggregate data;algorithm;best, worst and average case;display resolution;end-to-end principle;fifo (computing and electronics);quality of service;scalability;scheduling (computing)	Yuming Jiang	2002	Computer Networks	10.1109/ICC.2002.997030	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;quality of service;dynamic priority scheduling;fifo and lifo accounting;computer science;end-to-end delay;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;queueing theory;scheduling;network delay;queuing delay;computer network	Networks	-0.8068530886612992	95.88344411659861	195874

The packet arrival process at each node i is assumed to be a stationary and independent increment random process with mean ai and second moment ai(2). The packet lengths at node i are assumed to be i.i.d random variables Pi with finite mean and second moment. A closed form expression has been derived for the same. We assume the input arrival process across queues to be uncorrelated Poison processes. As the nodes share a single channel, they have to contend with one another for a successful transmission. The mean delay for a packet has been approximated by modelling the system as a 1-limited Random Polling system with zero switchover times. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the analytical results.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;data rate units;design rule for camera file system;let expression;mesh networking;network packet;stationary process;stochastic process;switchover;wireless mesh network	Albert Sunny;Joy Kuri;Saurabh Aggarwal	2011	2011 National Conference on Communications (NCC)		random variable;stochastic process;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;transmission delay;statistics;computer network	Metrics	1.2526119636087885	98.25971372460779	196226

Differentiated Service (DiffServ) model is more scalable, but cannot provide service that is comparable to IntServ. To achieve scalability and a strong service model, we believe that DiffServ equipped with scalable admission control is a possible solution. This paper examines some fair intelligent admission control schemes over the enhanced DiffServ [1]. Specifically, we propose two admission control schemes: random early dropping admission control and random early remarking admission control. We apply these admission control schemes to address traditional DiffServ problem concerning fairness. The simulation results demonstrate our schemes can offer a class-based fair resource sharing. Such admission control schemes can also help enforce the desired service assurances.	differentiated service	Ming D Li;Doan B.

However, the scheduling of both wavelength and timeslot resource becomes a critical problem. In this letter, a dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation (DWBA) solution including the DWBA mechanism, mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, and two heuristic algorithms is proposed to solve the scheduling problem. By comparison of the two algorithms, only one algorithm is selected to support 10-year lifetime. Under different traffic patterns, the selected DWBA algorithm has better bandwidth utilization and lower delay in contrast with the static wavelength allocation (SWA). The backward compatibility and cost efficiency of flexible TWDM OAN are also discussed.	access network;algorithm;backward compatibility;cost efficiency;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;next-generation network;open-access network;soap with attachments;scheduling (computing);smoothing;wavelength-division multiplexing	Xintian Hu;Xue Chen;Zhiguo Zhang;Jinsong Bei	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2367119	real-time computing;computer science;computer network	Arch	4.9872137368639295	95.85415631810113	196455
ac7c3889fcca6db31b780f342a84cf8f078d4744	on the application of forking nodes to product-form queueing networks	optimization;poisson process;time series analysis	We define a ‘forking node’ as a service centre with one input feeding two outputs (each served by its own queue) under the control of an internal path-selection (PS) policy. We assume that both outputs lead to paths through which a packet reaches its final destination. However, the mean downstream delays on the two paths may be different and the PS policy should favour the path with the lower downstream delay. Using simulation, we compare the performance of this system under a variety of random, deterministic, state-dependent PS policies, including threshold-based and join-shortest-queue with bias (JSQ + b). We show that JSQ + b has better performance than the other alternatives. Moreover, if the input process to the forking node is Poisson, standard time series analysis techniques show that its two outputs are very close to being independent Poisson processes. Thus, if we find an accurate and efficient ‘offline’ analytical performance model for JSQ+ b forking node, we can extend the applicability of product-form queueing networks to include such forking nodes. For this reason, we present several ways of modelling the performance of a JSQ + b node, using bounds, and compare their results on example networks. We establish a closed-form expression relating the bias b and the delays of the downstream paths.

Congestion conk01 is concemed with allocating the network resowes and is heavily influenced by the traffic dynamic. It is not easy to get a satisfactory solution due to the complexity of the problem There is a number of network policies that affect the congestion control and there are several requirements for the design of a congestion control scheme. Among the existing congestion control algorithms, additive increase multiplicative decrease (m) a lgor ih [2,3] is widely deployed. This algorithm is the base of congestion control for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)[22]. The key principle of AIMD is that it raises load by a constant if m loss occurs and responds to packet losses, i.e. congestion indication, by reducing load to a fraction of the current value. TCP is not well-suited for new applications such as streaming multimedia. To address this issue, the recent approach is to promote the use of end-to-end congestion contml schemes [6]. Since TCP is the dominant traffic, new congestion control schemes should be TCP-biendly. Thal means, the throughput of a non-TCP flow should be approximately the same as that of a TCP flow under the same conditions of round trip time and packet loss rate. However, it was recently shown that the additive increase nature of AIMD appears inferior [19]. Two desired properties of any congestion control scheme are fairness and convergence. But additive increase does not.guarantee the quickest convergence and AIMD is unfair under ceriain conditions, as pointed out in [19,3,10,11]. It has heen also shown in 1141 that a better smoothness can be achieved with a decrease parameter less than %. Moreover, large rate variations can be observed when loss rate is high. Other works [17,15,13,12] argued that increase-by-one decreaseto-half of AIMD 'is not a hndamental requirement of congestion control. Other values have been suggested for increase and decrease. One question arises, how to choose the increase and decrease parameters SO that high thughput can be achieved while obtaining the reasonable response time according to the dynamic behavior of the network. We propose therefore in this paper a general version for congestion control with a high order model. Instead ofusing concrete increase-by-one decrease-to-half such as in existing schemes, we use general parameters a for increase and b for decrease, respectively. Moreover, we consider the exponential behavior of the round-trip delay using an exponential increase function. With the model, we derive the throughput as a function of a and b, and of loss rate and roundhp delay. In addition, we obtain the relationship between a and b and show how to choose these parameters to achieve high throughput. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review the basic principle of congestion control and some related works. We describe our genml version of congestion conkol in section 3. Section 4 shows OUT simulation results and finally, section 5 concludes the paper.	algorithm;delay-gradient congestion control;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;integrated circuit layout design protection;internet protocol suite;network congestion;network packet;requirement;response time (technology);round-trip engineering;simulation;streaming media;throughput;time complexity;timeout (computing);utility functions on indivisible goods	Dang-Hai Hoang;Dietrich Reschke	2002		10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1188465	tcp congestion-avoidance algorithm;network traffic control;real-time computing;resource allocation;computer science;flow control;distributed computing;network congestion;round-trip delay time;tcp friendly rate control;slow-start;transport layer;computer network	Networks	-3.2740242643411595	94.66722348212028	196556

We analyze the constant-rate voice capacity of a fully-connected network with slot-ALOHA and round-robin channel access, and propose two call admission control (CAC) algorithms for a non-fully-connected network with slot-ALOHA channel access. Different from the existing work in literature, transmission of multiple packets in a single time-slot is considered. Two discrete-time Markov chain based approaches are used for the capacity analysis of the two channel access schemes, respectively. It is shown that the number of voice packets that can be transmitted in a time-slot has a significant impact on the system capacity. The capacity analysis results of the slot-ALOHA scheme is used to develop a CAC procedure when all the voice flows have an identical statistical delay requirement. Further, two CAC algorithms (A1 and A2) are developed for a network with voice traffic flows having different delay requirements in which one (A1) is based on the theory of effective capacity and is considered as a benchmark to compare with the other. Simulation results demonstrate that algorithm A2 performs better than algorithm A1, and that a relaxed delay requirement leads to an increase in the network capacity.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);channel capacity;cognitive radio;common access card;markov chain;network topology;requirement;round-robin dns;round-robin scheduling;simulation	Subodha Gunawardena;Weihua Zhuang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2011.072011.110406	cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;markov process;statistics;computer network	Mobile	3.816364127362956	97.77588643246686	196828

We define the delay confidence defined as the probability that a new data call is accepted within the maximum tolerable delay without being blocked. In this case, the Erlang capacity is confined not only by the required blocking probability of voice call but also by the required delay confidence of data call. For the performance analysis, we develop a two-dimensional Markov model, and we derive the CDF of delay and subsequent relation for the delay requirement. Further we present a numerical procedure to analyze the Erlang capacity under a given blocking probability and delay confidence. As a result, it is necessary to make a balance between the Erlang capacity with respect to the blocking probability of voice call and that with respect to the delay confidence of data call so as to accommodate the more Erlang capacity.

b2be0fc93b90b9395d2602326356ddb5fa33a167	a graph-based performance analysis of the 802.11p mac protocol for safety communications in highway vehicular ad hoc networks		We address the performance of the 802.11p protocol in terms of the packet delivery ratio (PDR) and the packet reception ratio (PRR) for broadcasting safety messages in highway environments. Regarding the semi-sparse and intermediate traffic, we try to answer to questions such as what are the upper, dominant and lower bounds of PDR and PRR in each traffic condition? How they may deviate from their average values? and What fraction of vehicles may experience such bounds? To answer to such questions, we propose to consider the communication graph formed among vehicles as a special type of the complex networks and we apply the recently proposed obligatory attachment ruleto synthesize such network structures. Then, we compute some of the important structural properties of the communication graph in VANETS including the one-hop and two-hop degree distributions, the clustering coefficient and the average number of common neighbours. Next, we show how these structural properties could be combined with the state-of-the-art medium access control layer performance analysis methods, resulting in a hybrid framework which can be applied to provide the answers to the aforementioned questions. The accuracy of the results obtained through the application of the proposed hybrid framework is discussed through comparison with simulation results.	access control;approximation;attachments;clustering coefficient;complex network;degree distribution;design review (u.s. government);html5 in mobile devices;network packet;network science;packet analyzer;production rule representation;profiling (computer programming);random graph;semiconductor industry;simulation;sparse matrix;vehicle-to-vehicle	Seyyed Amir Ali Ghafourian Ghahramani;Ali Mohammad Afshin Hemmatyar	2017	Comput.

A deterministic version of the protocol, which reduces the variance of the service process and therefore improves queueing performance, is also considered. The solution is simple and fast to compute and is not overly sensitive to the number of nodes. Simulation results indicate that the results are accurate so long as the performance can be accurately approximated based on the dominant effect of an exponential tail in the distribution of queued load. The results are also applicable to a single server Gaussian queue with priorities.

794e365d96d6415b0665cf4c9ca14b79cb1f9547	experimental evaluation of the coexistence of ieee 802.11 edca and dcf mechanisms		The IEEE 802.11 standard is the most widely-used wireless technology in the industry. In the last few years, this standard has been subject to multiple revisions to improve the supported Quality of Service (QoS). Among such QoS improvements, we highlight the EDCA and HCCA MAC layer mechanisms, which both work on the top of the DCF (Distributed Coordination Function) mechanism. Currently, DCF is the only commercially-available option in the vast majority of the IEEE 802.11 adapters. Therefore, stations using communication adapters based on any new mechanism must be able to provide QoS guarantees in the presence of stations using state-of-the-art DCF adapters. In this paper, we perform an experimental assessment of the coexistence of EDCA and DCF mechanism in a real-time (RT) communication scenario. More specifically, we assess the ability of the EDCA mechanism to handle RT traffic in overlapping basic service set (OBSS) scenarios, where RT stations share the same frequency channel and coverage area with alien DCF stations. The main purpose of this paper is to understand the limitations of the EDCA mechanism when supporting RT traffic in open communication scenarios. We show that when the environment is shared with non-RT alien devices operating under the traditional DCF mechanism, the EDCA mechanism is not able to adequately support RT traffic.	byte;channel (communications);coexist (image);communications satellite;design rule for camera file system;experiment;frequency band;network packet;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;requirement	Jose R.

The problem of tracking mobile users has been addressed by several studies, many of which attempt to reduce the wireless cost of users tracking. The basic idea shared by most of these works is that users update their location based on a pre-defined criterion. Unfortunately, some of these strategies require the use of information, such as the distance traveled from the last known location, that is not generally available to the user. For this reason, both the implementation of some of these strategies and the performance comparison to existing strategies is not clear. We propose to use cell identification codes (CIC) for tracking mobile users. Each cell periodically broadcasts a short message which identifies the cell and its orientation relatively to other cells in the network. This information is used by the users to efficiently update their location. We propose several cell identification encoding schemes, which are used to implement different tracking strategies. The best performance is achieved by a four-bit CIC, used to implement a distance-based tracking strategy in a two dimensional system. In addition, we propose a combination of timer and movement tracking strategy, based on either a one-bit or a two-bit CIC, depending on system topology and user mobility. An important property of our framework is that the overall performance cost, and hence its comparison to existing methods, is evaluated for each tracking strategy. The CIC-based strategies are shown to outperform the timer-based method over a wide range of parameters.

Due to the variation and unpredictability of bandwidth and other performance parameters (e.g. packet loss rate) over IP networks, in general, most of the proposed streaming solutions are based on some type of a data loss handling method and a layered video coding scheme.

To improve MAC layer efficiency, we propose the Transmission Order Deducing MAC (TOD-MAC) protocol, which controls packet length in such a way that the transmission duration is adjusted to implicitly provide necessary information for a node to determine its transmission order among all the nodes in a network. Each node transmits frames of different duration, and thus the other nodes can determine the time when they can transmit, which has the same effect as announcing the transmission order, without using a control message. Each node transmits a frame in a round robin manner, which minimizes the idle time between two consecutive transmissions without collisions, and significantly improves the MAC efficiency in very high speed CSMA/CA wireless networks. Extensive simulation results indicate that TOD-MAC achieves high throughput performance, short/long-term air-time fairness in multi-rate networks and excellent transient behavior in dynamic environments.

cd2de02b8aa5982ad0ec902a10e1da47bef1a417	a theoretical analysis of buffer occupancy for intermittently-connected networks		Network congestion is a well-known problem that may heavily affect the overall network performance. Congestion control approaches in Intermittently-Connected Networks (ICNs) differ from those used in classical networks, since the assumptions of ‘‘universal connectivity’’ of the nodes and ‘‘global information’’ about the network do not hold. In this paper, an analytical framework is proposed to investigate node buffer occupancy in ICNs through bulk-arrivals/bulk-services queuing models. A relation in the z-domain between the discrete probability densities of the buffer state occupancies and of the sizes of the arriving bulks is exploited to analyze two classes of forwarding strategies for ICNs. The infiniteand finite-buffer cases are investigated, simulated, and compared in terms of the concept of stochastic order, which is also used to compare models obtained for different parameter choices. The results can be exploited for buffer dimensioning and for deriving estimates of performancemetrics such as average buffer occupancy, average delivery delay, and buffer overflow probability. The theoretical analysis is complemented by numerical outcomes from a network simulator and from real mobility traces. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The technique is based on the notion of detection interval, which represents the time to complete a basic congestion detecting interaction between a packet source and destination. The congestion detection consists of having the source send special probe packets during a specified period of time and then await the return of a feedback packet from the destination, which conveys the result of analysis performed by the destination upon receiving the probe packets. The source would adjust its behavior to accommodate the network status reported by the feedback packet. We measure the performance of our congestion detecting scheme in terms of the detecting accuracy. Our analysis is based on a two-state model of network operation wherein a hypoexponential distribution is used for congestion durations. Analyses of our model have resulted in strategies to enhance the detecting accuracy for network congestion. An easily calculated approximation to determine the probe packet delay for optimal performance is provided, which can be employed by the destination to set probe waiting time in the detection interval to enhance the detecting accuracy.

High priority (subscription) users are allowed more resources at the server than low priority (best-effort) users. Media applications with data encoding are considered so that the encoded data is much smaller than the raw data. Offloading decision is based on task sojourn time which includes communication, computation and queueing delays.

To do so we build a Markovian model for users arrivals, departures and mobility in such networks; which we call WET model. We firstly consider intracell mobility where each user is confined to remain within its serving cell. Then we consider the complete mobility where users may either move within each cell or make a handover (i.e. change to another cell). We propose to approximate the WET model by a Whittle one for which the performance is expressed analytically. We validate the approximation by simulating an OFDMA cellular network. We observe that the Whittle approximation underestimates the throughput per user of the WET model. Thus it may be used for a conservative dimensioning of the cellular networks. Moreover, when the traffic demand and the user speed are moderate, the Whittle approximation is good and thus leads to a precise dimensioning.

279f6333001719480f2105eabd37ed5957c5845e	label: link-based adaptive blacklisting technique for 6tisch wireless industrial networks		Industrial applications require more and more low-power operations, low-delay, deterministic communications as well as end-to-end reliability close to 100%. However, traditional radio technologies are sensitive to external interference, which degrades the reliability and introduces unpredictable delays due to collision detection and retransmissions. Therefore, recent standardization efforts focus on slow channel hopping strategies to provide strict Quality of Service (QoS) for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). By keeping nodes time-synchronized and by employing a channel hopping approach, IEEE 802.15.4-TSCH (Time-Slotted Channel Hoping) aims at providing high-level network reliability. However, some radio channels still suffer from high external interference and need to be blacklisted. Since the interference pattern is rather dynamic, unpredictable and highly localized, we here propose heuristics to decide which channels to blacklist. To avoid deafness, the transmitter and the receiver must also agree on a consistent blacklist. Furthermore, since the external interference may be time-dependent as well, we also propose mechanisms to decide when a channel has to be blacklisted or on the contrary recovered. Our thorough experimental evaluation based on OpenWSN and FIT IoT-LAB highlight the relevance of this approach: with a localized blacklisting strategy, we increase by 20% packet delivery rate for the worst links.	algorithm;collision detection;design review (u.s. government);end-to-end principle;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;heuristic (computer science);high- and low-level;interference (communication);internet of things;low-power broadcasting;network packet;openwsn;pseudorandomness;quality of service;relevance;testbed;transmitter	Vasileios Kotsiou;Georgios Z.

The purpose of packet buffering at the BS is to recover the packets dropped during inter-subnetwork handoff by forwarding the packets buffered at the previous BS to the new BS. However, when the mobile host moves to a congested BS within a new foreign subnetwork, the buffered packets forwarded by the previous BS are likely to be dropped. This subsequently causes global synchronization to occur, resulting in the degradation of the wireless link in the congested BS, due to the increased congestion caused by the forwarded burst packets. Thus, in this paper, we propose an implicit priority forwarding (IPF) packet buffering scheme as a solution to this problem within mobile IP based networks. In the proposed IPF method, the previous BS implicitly marks the priority packets being used for inter-subnetwork handoff. Moreover, the proposed modified random early detection (M-RED) buffer at the new congested BS guarantees some degree of reliability to the priority packets. The simulation results show that the proposed IPF packet buffering scheme increases the wireless link utilization and, thus, it enhances the TCP throughput performance in the context of various inter-subnetwork handoff cases.	algorithm;burst transmission;data buffer;elegant degradation;fairness measure;item unique identification;mathematical optimization;mobile ip;network congestion;network packet;overhead (computing);random early detection;seamless3d;simulation;subnetwork;tcp global synchronization;throughput	Young Sup Roh;Kyeong Hur;Doo Seop Eom;Yeonwoo Lee;Kyun Hyon Tchah	2005	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2005.6389820	synchronization;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	2.260970940504731	102.18928024569709	198049
4302ecf2b0155fe16fb9be7e7214839dc15a2ac3	a bandwidth-based polling scheme for qos support in bluetooth	bandwidth allocation;polling scheme;best effort;qos;bandwidth management;bluetooth;equilibrium state	A flexible bandwidth management scheme namely Bandwidth-based Polling (BBP) for Bluetooth is proposed. A framing structure of time is defined in BBP, and the master allocates proper number of slots for each active slave in a frame. BBP allows the master to poll a slave more than once to achieve high flexibility for bandwidth allocation. The calculation of the polling time as well as the payload type for a slave is according to the bandwidth requirement of the slave and the limit of the frame size controlled by the master. Extension of BBP for supporting slaves with the SCO link and slaves without bandwidth requirement (best-effort slaves) is also proposed. Simulation results have shown the efficiency and fairness of BBP in bandwidth management. The flexibility of bandwidth allocation depends on the maximum polling time preset by BBP. A larger maximum polling time makes the higher flexibility of bandwidth allocation at the expense of a longer latency before reaching the equilibrium state. Analysis of the impact of the maximum polling time on bandwidth allocation is also presented in the paper. q 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It is expected that the rendezvous can be achieved within a short finite time for delay-sensitive applications and over all available channels to increase the robustness to unstable channels. Some existing works suffer from a small number of rendezvous channels and can only guarantee rendezvous under the undesired requirements such as synchronous clock, homogeneous available channels, predetermined roles and explicit SUs' identifiers (IDs). In this paper, to address these limitations, we employ the notion of Disjoint Set Cover (DSC) and propose a DSC-based Rendezvous (DSCR) algorithm. We first present an approximation algorithm to construct one DSC. The variant permutations of elements in the ingeniously constructed DSC are then utilized to regulate the order of accessing channels, enabling SUs to rendezvous on all available channels within a short duration. We derive the theoretical maximum and expected rendezvous latency and prove the full rendezvous degree of the DSCR algorithm. Extensive simulations show that the DSCR algorithm can significantly reduce the rendezvous latency compared to existing algorithms.	approximation algorithm;cognitive radio;control theory;exposing to the right;mean time to repair;rendezvous protocol;requirement;ruby document format;simulation;time complexity;uniform resource identifier	Bo Yang;Meng Zheng;Wei Liang	2016	IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524556	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Embedded	8.013531998565306	92.72185051214443	198156

This paper theoretically studies a new capacity aggregation policy in both single-hop and multi-hop wireless networks with the motivation of ameliorating the trade-off between limited channel resources and multiple flow transmission. The capacity aggregation policy aggregates residual channel capacity that remains unused by the previous flow scheduling policy in order to future increase the number of performance guaranteed multimedia flows. We then proposed a novel efficient multi-flow multicasting algorithm to apply the policies of flow scheduling and capacity aggregation to practical multimedia multicasting so as to quickly and reliably admit extra multicasting traffic in a wireless network. Finally, we use NS2 simulations to evaluate the studied policy and the EMMT algorithm. Our simulation results prove the effectiveness of our schemes in improving the ability of networks to admit more multimedia flows.	algorithm;channel capacity;multicast;network architecture;routing;scheduling (computing);simulation;software deployment	Wanqing Tu	2013	2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2013.6554907	multi-frequency network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	1.0886895530071363	91.36586876306606	198536

9b6cda721e655696987875f774afabdcf3340f60	adaptive and prioritized random access and resource allocation schemes for dynamic tdma/tdd protocols		The medium access control (MAC) protocol based on dynamic time division multiple access/time division duplex (TDMA/TDD) is responsible for random access control and radio resource allocation in dynamic traffic environments. These functions of random access and resource allocation are very important to prevent wastage of resources and improve MAC performance according to various network conditions. In this paper, we propose new random access and resource allocation schemes to guarantee quality of service (QoS) and provide priority services in a dynamic TDMA/TDD system. First, for the QoS guarantee, we propose an adaptive random access and resource allocation scheme by introducing an access probability. Second, for providing priority service, we propose a priority-based random access and resource allocation scheme by extending the first adaptive scheme in both a centralized and a distributed manner. The analysis and simulation results show that the proposed MAC protocol outperforms the legacy MAC protocol using a simple binary exponential backoff algorithm, and provides good differential performance according to priorities with respect to the throughput and delay.	random access;test-driven development	Hyun-Ho Choi	2017	J.

An analytical model based on a two-state Markovian process is proposed to describe the behavior of the proposed retransmission scheme and to obtain its throughput, average delay, and delay jitter. The results of Monte Carlo simulations are included to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme and to verify the accuracy of the analytical models. Results show that a cooperation among a small number of nodes can significantly improve the performance of the retransmission process in terms of throughput, average delay, and delay jitter by reducing the average duration of retransmission trials	authorization;automatic repeat request;hoc (programming language);mobile phone;network packet;packet delay variation;real-time transcription;rewrite (programming);signal processing;simulation;throughput	Mehrdad Dianati;Xinhua Ling;Sagar Naik;Xuemin Shen	2006	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2005.863426	wireless ad hoc network;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;statistics;computer network;monte carlo method	Mobile	9.330886278436159	94.2917359370588	198766

The performances of applications built on these systems depend on bandwidth availability that arises as the most limit of this solution. In fact, the IEEE 802.11 standards do not provide performed mechanism of loading distribution among different APs of the network. Then, an AP can be heavily overloaded leading to station throughput degradation. For this problem, load balancing algorithms (LBA) was been considered as one of the attractive solution to share the traffic through the available access points (APs) bandwidths. However, applying the load balancing algorithm (LBA) and shifting a mobile connection from an access point to another without considering the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the concerned APs might causes worst communication performances. This paper is then a contribution to check the performance’s limits of the LBA algorithm through an experimental study of communication metrics for MPEG-4 video transmission over IEEE 802.11 network. The paper focuses, then, on the proposition of a new structure of the LBA algorithm with the introduction of the SNR level.	algorithm;elegant degradation;experiment;load balancing (computing);performance;quality of service;signal-to-noise ratio;throughput;wireless access point	Adel Soudani;Thierry Divoux;Rached Tourki	2012	Computers & Electrical Engineering	10.1016/j.compeleceng.2012.07.016	real-time computing;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;engineering;operating system;computer network	Metrics	-3.9074099540703844	91.81249036710301	198805

6f880d7d5e2b6a94cb84de5f36ec14f0ce023c4c	latency and resource utilization analysis for v2x communication over lte mbsfn transmission		In this paper, we investigate the performance of LTE Multicast-Broadcast Single-Frequency Networks (MBSFN). LTE-MBSFN is viewed as one of the most promising candidates for vehicular communications which can enhance reliabilit y of vehicular application traffic. This is achieved due to the possibility to efficiently support message exchange in-bet ween vehicles by multicasting information to several vehicles i n parallel (point-to-multipoint transmission) employing an Mult imedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS). We investigate two me trics to gauge the performance of MBMS/MBSFN transmissions in comparison with standard unicast transmissions for vehicular communications: latency of packet delivery and overhead ca used by vehicular traffic, i.e., network utilization. Additiona lly, we present technique of prediction of system behaviour and exp lore the influence of transmission bandwidth and transmission rate on mentioned metrics. Keywords—Multicasting, MBSFN, Vehicular Communications, V2X, Latency. I. I NTRODUCTION Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) was introduced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as means to broadcast and multicast information to 3G and 4G mobile users, with mobile TV being the main service offered [1], [2]. In the context of LTE systems, MBMS was evolved into e-MBMS increasing the performance of the air interface with a new transmission scheme called MulticastBroadcast Single-Frequency Network (MBSFN). In MBSFN operation, MBMS data are transmitted simultaneously from multiple strictly time and frequency synchronized cells. A group of such cells transmitting these data establishes the ocalled MBSFN area [3]. The increase in performance of the air interface is obtained in MBSFN due to great enhancement in the Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) which is especially beneficial for the users at cell edge [4]. Substantial developments have taken place over the past few years in the area of vehicular communication systems. After the deployment of various vehicular technologies, such as t oll collection or active road signs, vehicular communication ( VC) systems have emerged. These systems include network nodes, that is, vehicles and road-side infrastructure units (RSUs ) equipped with onboard sensory, processing, and wireless co mmunication modules [5]. Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication allows a range of applications to increase transportation safety and efficie ncy, as well as video streaming [6]. Especially road safety applica tions play a very important role in vehicular communications. Roa d safety applications rely on short-message broadcasting in a Fig. 1: Illustration of a cellular network serving vehicles via LTE’s MBMS/MBSFN feature as well as ordinary static users over uni cast transmission. vehicle’s neighbourhood to inform other vehicles in order to reduce accidents on the road. As a new traffic model, these applications exhibit some unique features in terms of generation patterns and delivery requirements. Particula rly, delivery requirements of road safety applications are of hi gh importance, since any signal delay increases the danger of accidents. Additionally, the possibility to support ordin ary unicast users is highly preferable. In order to sustain such requirements, MBSFN can be considered as a potential way to handle vehicular applications [7]. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II we define MBMS/MBSFN transmission and explain our traffic model. Our performance metrics, i.e., the latenc y definitions as well as the network utilization are discussed in Section III. Next in Section IV, methods for adaptation of Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) are motivated and explaine d. Final simulation results and discussions are described in S ection V.

In order to reduce the power consumption, the IEEE 802.16e provides three types of power saving classes (PSCs) for the Mobile Subscriber Stations (MSSs), where each PSC may contain one or several connections. However, how to define a PSC and assign PSCs to connections are open issues in the standard. Focusing on real-time traffics, a single MSS and base station (BS) pair, previous studies use a single PSC of type II to manage the awake and sleep of the MSS. In this paper, two power saving class management algorithms based on multiple PSCs in the IEEE 802.16e are proposed. These two schemes define PSCs for real-time connections by referring to the delay bound and packet interarrival time of connections. Simulation results demonstrate that our schemes outperform the previous single PSC approach in both energy efficiency and resource utilization.	algorithm;decibel;delay-gradient congestion control;ieee 1471;multi-function printer;network packet;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simulation	Jen-Jee Chen;Shih-Lin Wu;Shiou-Wen Wang	2009	2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware	10.1109/MDM.2009.86	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;base station;operating system;wireless network;efficient energy use;mobile computing;computer network	Embedded	6.704012761813684	97.24495386156234	198976

We develop a queueing model to obtain closed form expressions for the expected delay at each node which accounts for arbitrary (but fixed) packet sizes, polling rates, channel rates and the order in which the nodes are polled. The model is then further extended to account for the delays when the nodes use power management, and for cases when not all nodes are served in a frame. Our analytical results are verified through simulations. The model is also extended to evaluate the number of nodes that can be supported by a base station while satisfying an arbitrary delay requirement at all nodes and can be used as a mechanism for admission control by the base station	control theory;glossary of computer graphics;network packet;polling (computer science);power management;programming computable functions;queueing theory;simulation	Biplab Sikdar	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2007.348350	polling;active traffic management;systems modeling;index term;telecommunications;computer science;access control;base station;operating system;wireless network;queueing theory;computer security;point coordination function;computer network;satisfiability	Embedded	2.735642165668887	101.10802444974114	199075
