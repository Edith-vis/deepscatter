69bf9cf961bbd476a7058a88e103179249bbc908	deep learning based primary user classification in cognitive radios	cognitive radio;deep learning;spectrum sensing;deep belief networks	Deep Belief Networks (DBN) is a very powerful algorithm in deep learning. The DBN has been effectively applied in many areas of machine learning, such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). With the help of deep architecture, their accuracy has been largely improved and their human annotation data which traditional machine learning algorithm extremely rely on could be reduced. In Cognitive Radios (CRs), learning is necessary for its cognition, while two of the key challenges are how to classify primary user agents with their performances and predict their behaviors. The CRs' performance has a positive correlation with the hit rate of learning algorithm's classification and prediction results. In this paper, we study the questions of classification and prediction of user agents. We apply the DBN model to improve accuracy rating of user agent's recognition in CRs with user-centered model, it's the first application of deep learning structure in CRs. The DBN model provides a primary user agent's classification, which is the foundation of the prediction to both idle frequency spectrums and time slots. Experimental results show that the cognitive engine finds a much better detection rate than the CRs engine with shallow learning and other traditional strategy. The simulation results are also tested on the WIFI channel with 5GHz and 2.4GHz.	algorithm;bayesian network;cognition;cognitive radio;computer vision;deep learning;machine learning;natural language processing;performance;simulation;user agent;user-centered design	Yuanhao Cui;Xiaojun Jing;Songlin Sun;Xiaohan Wang;Dongmei Cheng;Hai Huang	2015	2015 15th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2015.7458333	speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	AI	8.884082244986232	-94.35860769997113	108382

We performed human subjective tests to investigate how motion influences the visibility of flicker distortions in naturalistic videos. Forty three naïve subjects participated in two tasks (“follow the moving object” and “view freely”) and reported their percepts on 36 test videos. Flicker distortions were simulated by periodic changes of video frames at different quality levels and flicker frequencies. An eye tracker was used to monitor each subject's gaze. The results indicate that the visibility of flicker distortions is strongly reduced when the speed of coherent motion is large, and the effect is more pronounced when the video quality is poor. We conjecture that sufficiently fast and coherent motions near the gaze point mask or `silence' the perception of flicker distortions in naturalistic videos in agreement with a recently observed `motion silencing' effect on synthetic stimuli.	coherence (physics);distortion;eye tracking;flicker (screen);flicker noise;synthetic intelligence;video	Lark Kwon Choi;Lawrence K.

It is crucial to establish an accurate distinction between BD and UD to make a correct and early diagnosis, leading to improvements in treatment and course of illness. To deal with this misdiagnosis problem, in this study, we experimented on eliciting subjects' emotions by watching six eliciting emotional video clips. After watching each video clips, their speech responses were collected when they were interviewing with a clinician. In mood disorder detection, speech emotions play an import role to detect manic or depressive symptoms. Therefore, speech emotion profiles (EP) are obtained by using the support vector machine (SVM) which are built via speech features adapted from selected databases using a denoising autoencoder-based method. Finally, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is employed to characterize the temporal information of the EPs with respect to six emotional videos. Comparative experiments clearly show the promising advantage and efficacy of the LSTM-based approach for mood disorder detection.	artificial neural network;autoencoder;blu-ray;database;expectation propagation;experiment;long short-term memory;noise reduction;recurrent neural network;support vector machine;urban dictionary;video clip	Tsung-Hsien Yang;Chung-Hsien Wu;Kun-Yi Huang;Ming-Hsiang Su	2016	2016 10th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing (ISCSLP)	10.1109/ISCSLP.2016.7918439	speech recognition;logic gate;feature extraction;computer science;speech;noise reduction;linguistics	NLP	9.947004884165576	-94.28585002013543	129732

Analysis of these sources of information is a key step in defining objective criteria for characterizing surgical performance. The Blue DRAGON is a new system for acquiring the kinematics and the dynamics of two endoscopic tools synchronized with the endoscopic view of the surgical scene. Modeling the process of MIS using a finite state model [Markov model (MM)] reveals the internal structure of the surgical task and is utilized as one of the key steps in objectively assessing surgical performance. The experimental protocol includes tying an intracorporeal knot in a MIS setup performed on an animal model (pig) by 30 surgeons at different levels of training including expert surgeons. An objective learning curve was defined based on measuring quantitative statistical distance (similarity) between MM of experts and MM of residents at different levels of training. The objective learning curve was similar to that of the subjective performance analysis. The MM proved to be a powerful and compact mathematical model for decomposing a complex task such as laparoscopic suturing. Systems like surgical robots or virtual reality simulators in which the kinematics and the dynamics of the surgical tool are inherently measured may benefit from incorporation of the proposed methodology.	blue gene;computer performance;learning disorders;markov chain;markov model;mathematical model;mathematics;minimally invasive surgical procedures;minimally invasive education;preparation;robot (device);sea-blue histiocyte syndrome;simulators;stochastic process;surgical sutures;virtual reality simulator	Jacob Rosen;Jeffrey D.

b9dd2a89ad814aa2db5ed374812f0d104a1d30ba	predicting an orchestral conductor's baton movements using machine learning	orchestral conductor;introducing video;baton trajectory;telematic musical performance;experimental confirmation;extended kalman filter;conventional machine;experimental methodology;baton path;machine learning;conventional feature-based method;baton movement;conductor video	Telematic musical performance, in which performers at two or more sites collaborate via networked audio and video, suffers significantly from latency. In the extreme case, performers at all sites slow to match their delayed counterparts, resulting in a steadily decreasing tempo. Introducing video of a conductor does not immediately solve the problem, as conductor video is also subjected to network latencies. This article lays the groundwork for an alternative approach to mitigating the effects of latency in distributed orchestral performances, based on generation of a predicted version of the conductor's baton trajectory. The prediction step is the most fundamental problem in this scheme, for which we propose the use of conventional machine learning techniques. Specifically, we demonstrate a particle filter and an extended Kalman filter that each track the location of the baton's tip and predict it multiple beats into the future; we compare these with a conventional feature-based method. We also describe a generic two-part framework that prescribes the incorporation of rehearsal data into a probabilistic model, which is then adapted during live performance. Finally, we suggest a framework and experimental methodology for establishing perceptually based metrics for predicted baton paths. Note that the perceptual efficacy of the presented methods requires experimental confirmation beyond the scope of this article.	baton;biconnected component;experiment;extended kalman filter;in-phase and quadrature components;kerrison predictor;machine learning;particle filter;performance;real-time clock;real-time computing;responsiveness;state space;statistical model;telematics;velocity (software development)	Donald G.

6cf942a10833a385293fc1382da270f362fbb6ae	perceptual dimensions of vibrotactile actuators		The objective of the present research was to determine how variations in the signals generated by different vibrotactile actuators are perceived and which features are judged as being distinctive. For this purpose, three different types of actuator were used to generate signals that varied in amplitude, waveform and frequency. Participants were required to judge the degree of similarity-dissimilarity between pairs of stimuli. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques were then used as an exploratory data analysis technique to create a spatial map that depicted the relations among the various vibrotactile signals. The first dimension that emerged from the MDS represented a continuum associated with transitions in the amplitudes of the signals, with a smooth sine wave pattern contrasting with the more abrupt transitions in square waves. This may be considered a smooth-rough dimension. The second dimension extracted from the data was more difficult to characterize in that each of the two clusters along this dimension involved signals of varying waveform and frequency. Further work will aim at defining the perceptual qualities of this dimension.	image scaling;multidimensional scaling;triune continuum paradigm;waveform	Lynette A.

7c66551cad1494ee4f0788a3965020539f09ee86	identification and evaluation of perceptual attributes for periodic whole-body and hand-arm vibration		When a systematic tactile design of a product is to be conducted, it is necessary to understand important perceptual properties of vibration from a user perspective. In everyday life humans are exposed to whole-body and hand-arm vibration, e.g. when driving a vehicle. Vibration of the steering wheel and seat is transmitted to the driver and conveys information about the condition of the road and vehicle. Depending on the spectral and temporal properties of the vibration signal certain attributes are elicited in the driver, e.g., “bumpy”. Such verbaliseable attributes describe the vibration from a perceptual perspective. In this study periodic whole-body and hand-arm vibration were presented to test subjects. The most common tactile attributes were collected using a free interview. Afterwards, these attributes were rated for their suitability to characterize the signal patterns. The results show a systematic relationship between physical parameters (level, carrier frequency and modulation frequency) and this suitability.

In the QoE assessment, we handle two cases (cases 1 and 2). In case 1, we use low quality sound and normal video as well as haptic media. In case 2, we employ higher quality sound and stereo video with higher resolution than those in case 1. Assessment results illustrate that for example, the allowable range of inter-stream synchronization error in the networked ensemble is narrower than that in previous work.	haptic technology	Qi Zeng;Yutaka Ishibashi;Norishige Fukushima;Shinji Sugawara;Kostas E.

8c9b12b89f774954bb85fc8dd9678e04ef6add74	infrared face temperature normalization in fourier domain		This paper proposes a novel temperature normalization method in Fourier domain, which can lessen the effect on infrared face recognition from ambient temperature based on the idea of statistical learning in the transform domain. Firstly, the infrared face images in different ambient temperatures are transformed to Fourier domain. Secondly, based on statistical theory, the variances of phase spectrum and amplitude spectrum of the infrared face are used to describe the extent affected by the ambient temperature. Then, to achieve the robust information, those parts with big variances in the phase spectrum and amplitude spectrum are discarded and replaced by corresponding mean parts in training database. The main idea of this process is that one can set a suitable threshold for the variance of phase spectrum and amplitude spectrum and find those characteristic points that should be replaced. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of our temperature normalization method, the normalized infrared face can be applied to traditional face recognition system based on classic PCA method. Experimental results show our normalization method can get stable information in infrared face and improve the performance of the infrared face recognition system.	facial recognition system;machine learning;spectral density	Zhihua Xie;Jie Zeng	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31837-5_39	infrared;computer science;statistical theory;pattern recognition;facial recognition system;artificial intelligence;fourier transform;normalization (statistics);frequency spectrum;discrete fourier transform	Vision	-4.412213783108114	-95.11989725830476	180170
