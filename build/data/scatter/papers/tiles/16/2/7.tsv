While the relationship between IT Usage and Performance is well studied along with the antecedents of IT Usage, extant research has not yet fully explored an integrated model of IT Usage, its antecedents and impact on performance. In this paper, we propose an integrated theoretical framework for such an effort. We detail our preliminary results for a section of the theoretical model to demonstrate the viability of the research model. We find that for our research context, the preliminary results align well with theoretical predictions. We show strong statistical relationships between actual IT Usage and performance at the business unit level in both cross sectional and panel data analysis. We conclude by discussing the proposed data collection and analysis approach for testing the integrated theoretical framework for the relationship between IT Usage, its antecedents and impact on performance.	align (company);americas conference on information systems;computer simulation;confidentiality;digital multiplex system;information systems research;panel data;performance	Sanjeev Kumar;Terence Saldanha;Mayuram S.

By expanding the Technology Acceptance Model TAM, a new research model, known as the mobile services acceptance model MSAM, is proposed. Based on the research model, seven research hypotheses are presented. The proposed research model and research hypotheses were empirically tested using data collected from a survey of users of a mobile service, extended Mobile Student Information Systems eMSIS, at a Norwegian university. The findings indicate that the fitness of the research model is good. Support was also found for the seven research hypotheses. Among the factors, the personal initiatives and characteristics has the strongest influence on the intention to use eMSIS.

In this article it is suggested that the time is ripe for introducing Hedonic elements even in those systems designed for business use. Further the study discovers, models, and tests the role of hedonic and utilitarian attributes of IS in engendering ease of use perceptions, a primary predictor of usability and actual system use.

It also investigates trust-building process, major causes of its violation, their potential implications and restoration. Design/methodology/approach – A mixed-method approach was used in collecting data in Kenya in 2014 by using questionnaire and interview techniques. The former was administered to 250 (with 81 per cent response rate) randomly selected Internet users at Kenyatta University while the latter focused on key decision-makers from four randomly selected ISPs in Nairobi. Findings – The results show that Internet users’ perceptions of ISPs’ ability to be trusted in Kenya depend more on their competence in terms of service delivery (ability) and desire to protect users (benevolence) than upholding acceptable standards (integrity).

We find that members engage in a number of cross-boundary coordination practices that make their work visible and legible to each other, and that enable ongoing revision and alignment. Drawing on the notion of a trading zone, we suggest that by engaging in these practices, members enact a coordination structure that affords cross-boundary coordination while facilitating adaptability, speed, and learning. We also find that these coordination practices do not eliminate jurisdictional conflicts, and often generate problematic consequences such as the privileging of speed over quality, suppression of difference, loss of comprehension, misinterpretation and ambiguity, rework, and temporal pressure. After discussing our empirical findings, we explore their implications for organizations attempting to operate in the uncertain and rapidly changing contexts of postbureaucratic work.		Katherine C.

Drawing on the CoP and learning literatures, we develop a theoretical model exploring how individuals' involvement in CoPs affects their learning and job performance. The model is tested using survey data collected from graduate students in a large Canadian university. Results support the hypothesis that CoP involvement is related to learning, and reveals a complex relationship between learning and job performance.	cops (software);theory	Zeying Wan;Yulin Fang;Derrick J.

Considering that in such an environment the capability to learn jointly and individually is crucial, this paper takes a learning perspective on collaborative improvement and addresses the question: How do organisational learning and collaboration interplay and affect improvement performance? Based on an analysis of three dyads of the same Extended Manufacturing Enterprise, this paper concludes that a robust learning environment (willing and able to learn) creates operational, relational and learning outcomes – a self-reinforcing process. A weak learning environment (some willingness but limited ability to learn) creates operational outcomes but is sensitive to ‘accidents’ and thus at risk of actually producing negative relational and learning outcomes. A ‘blocked learning’ environment (no willingness to learn) may create good operational outcomes, but will not produce learning and relational outcomes. Consequently, it is doubtful if such situations are sustainable.

Our study indicates that the development of task-driven software interfaces could significantly support the processes and activities of Aboriginal council management and could contribute to alleviating the stress associated with current systems. Our vision is to develop these interfaces together with networking support for peer-to-peer collaboration between councils, compliance agencies and trusted advisers. The workflows themselves would be built and refined in a collaborative fashion between users together with some automated support.	peer-to-peer;the australian	Peter Radoll;Sebastian Fleissner;Duncan Stevenson;Henry J.

As we explain, not explicitly addressing this gray area can have negative, although often inadvertent, effects on the innovative nature of IS research; we explore this danger through three pitfalls. We then propose a stance of strategic ambiguity to deal with the gray area. Strategic ambiguity calls for deliberately withholding judgment on the relevance of research in the gray area and acceptance of gray-area research provided it meets the excellence required by professional journals. We believe that strategic ambiguity benefits innovative IS research without harming the essential role of the IT artifact.	information systems research	Andrew B.

This company offshore outsourced 21 IT projects to six suppliers in India. Senior managers and the official documents from the Program Management Office consistently reported that offshore outsourcing was successful in reducing the company’s IT costs. But interviews with knowledgeable participants actually managing the projects suggest that many projects were not successful in meeting cost, quality, and productivity objectives. We found evidence that this company’s offshore strategy to simply replace domestic contractors with cheaper, offshore suppliers was a poor fit with its social and cultural contexts. Specifically, we found that strong social networks between the company’s internal IT employees and domestic contractors were not easily replicated with offshore suppliers. Furthermore, the internal project management processes were often incompatible with offshore suppliers’ processes. This paper also analyzes seven project characteristics that differentiate highly-rated projects from poorly-rated projects. These project characteristics are type of ITwork, size of supplier firm, location of supplier employees (onsite/offshore), dollar value of the contract, duration of the project, timing of the project, and client unit managing the project. The paper concludes with four overall insights for clients and suppliers.	documentation;experience;outsourcing;social network	Joseph W.

Despite established management regimes and available technology, many organizations still consider information and records management challenging. The reason may be cultural factors. This study based on a literature review, aims to explore the academic discourse on information culture and to discuss its relevance for records management. The findings show that the concept information culture is used in various ways: as an explanatory framework; as an analytical and evaluative tool; or as normative standard. The research on information culture addresses several areas: business performance, systems implementation, the manifestation of information culture in different organizations, and a few concerns records management practices. The research settings and the objects of study varied, why general conclusions are difficult to draw, but often a positive correlation between culture and performance is assumed. The focus has been on how information is used, shared and disseminated, while the production and management, that is the vital object of records management, has with few exceptions been neglected. If information culture should fully function as an analytical framework concerning records management, a widened and more inclusive conceptualization is required, which also will enrich information culture as a theoretical concept. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Research has illustrated that innovation diffusion takes place within virtual worlds. VWs facilitate the emergence of purposeful communities which support the (often real-world) activities of their members including the development and adoption of innovations. Thus, VWs alter the social structures in which their users are embedded and the manner in which they communicate, both of which are thought to influence the diffusion of technical innovations amongst individuals. Though technical innovation is at the heart of Information Systems (IS) research, empirical research investigating innovation in the networked age is in its infancy. Thus, this paper presents a framework of propositions in relation to the impact of social structures on the diffusion of innovations within VWs and proposes the use of social network analysis to investigate these propositions.

The users’ motivations to contribute to the living lab activities at the beginning of the project are usually higher than once the activities are underway. However, the literature still lacks an understanding of what actions are necessary to reduce the likelihood of user drop-out throughout the user engagement process. This study aims to explore key factors that are influential on user drop-out in a living lab setting by engaging users to test an innovation during the pilot phase of the application’s development. The stability of the prototype, ease of use, privacy protection, flexibility of the prototype, effects of reminders, and timing issues are the key influential factors on user drop-out behavior. This paper summarizes the key lessons learned from the case study and points to avenues for future research.	living lab;open innovation;prototype;usability	Abdolrasoul Habibipour;Ali Mohammad Padyab;Birgitta Bergvall-Kåreborn;Anna Ståhlbröst	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-64695-4_3	artificial intelligence;machine learning;living lab;open innovation;knowledge management;information system;computer science;usability;phenomenon	HCI	-87.54679450941869	-5.039714212383628	51004
28824f9bd5921b84cd5bef2671357053ef8d02ad	a survey of cyber-security awareness in saudi arabia	social network services;safety;mobile communication;correlation;security	Rapid development has been observed in the deployment of communication technologies and the use of the Internet across the globe. Information exchange is the main aspect of use of such technologies in everyday life. Crimes associated with the misuse of information on the Internet are on the increase and are resulting in various losses. Saudi Arabia is one of the fastest developing countries in the Middle East, where the uptake of communication technologies such as the Internet and mobile technologies has risen sharply in recent years. These technologies are relatively new to the region when compared to developed countries. Therefore, the crimes associated with these technologies may be new to the people in the region. This paper investigates the cyber security awareness of the people in Saudi Arabia within different contexts. A quantitative online based survey was conducted to gather information related to cyber security awareness in Saudi Arabia. The study found that, although the participants had a good knowledge of IT, their awareness of the threats associated with cybercrime, cyber security practices, and the role of government and organisations in ensuring information safety across the Internet, is very limited. An application based model to create cyber security awareness in the region was preferred by the majority. The results indicated that, although cybercrime is on the rise, no specific approach is being followed to increase cyber security awareness in the region except for CERT regulations and online information on government websites. Additionally, Chi-Square test results (t(627)=3.85, p=0.013) indicated that Internet skills have an effect on cyber security practices from the users' end and there is an association between skill level and the security measures being implemented by organisations in the region. The study found that there is an immediate need to develop a model to create cyber security awareness in the region in order to combat cybercrime.	chi;computer security;cybercrime;fastest;information exchange;internet;security awareness;software deployment	Faisal Alotaibi;Steven Furnell;Ingo Stengel;Maria Papadaki	2016	2016 11th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST)	10.1109/ICITST.2016.7856687	public relations;engineering;internet privacy;computer security	HCI	-81.55804267613838	-8.466805134817243	51130

32d34cd76d889ee1ee36dc6059c8c9b706418120	telecentres and the provision of community based access to electronic information in everyday life in the uk		This study explores community access and use of electronic information (EI) in everyday life arguing that current plans to expand community based access (CBA) to Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) need to be informed by research which examines what helps and hinders use of both EI and existing CBA sites, such as telecentres. The study has three themes, firstly everyday information seeking and the extent to which EI is being used in everyday life. Secondly, use of telecentres and the extent to which these organisations are being used to access EI. Finally community involvement strategies are examined to identify levels of community involvement in the design, development and implementation of telecentres. The study’s contribution to knowledge is that it adopts a community-centred approach by focusing on the views of users and non-users of telecentres to develop a framework to inform future community based ICT initiatives. The study builds upon past research which called for user-centred approaches to information seeking research and system design rather than system based approaches. This idea is extended by considering the views of non-users. A wide range of factors helping and hindering use of EI and telecentres were combined to form a framework, which contains four main elements; service requirements, cost, skills and network issues. The methods used to develop the framework demonstrated that community involvement in ICT initiatives can be about asking the right questions rather than technical knowledge. Interviews were undertaken with 47 users and non-users and seven key actors across the three telecentres studied.

In the literature, ideas for the development of new products are found to originate from different sources both external and internal to an organisation. For example, formalised product development processes use customer surveys and technology development in order to find ideas for new products while integration with a lot of other idea sources is less evident. Some organisations have identified this weakness and created arenas where ideas can be discussed and exchanged between individuals. One example of an arena is idea management systems, which are formal ways of capturing, examining, nurturing, storing and developing ideas created in an organisation. In this paper, the role of idea management systems in three multinational Swedish organisations is studied.

Previous CSCW studies have not focused extensively on causation in cooperative work (e.g. see Schmidt and Bannon 2013). Consequently, it is a challenge to find a conception of causation appropriate for the study of cooperative work. This chapter addresses this challenge.	computer-supported cooperative work;correlation does not imply causation	Lars Rune Christensen;Olav W.

Findings from prior ISD research may not generalize well to this setting. Our research-in-progress addresses this gap by examining the participation of diverse stakeholders in a large-scale, multi-party governmentacademic-industrial ISD project over a four-year timeframe. We apply the theoretical lens of faultlines to understand how the participants work together during the project. Faultlines are hypothetical attributes (such as gender or expertise) that divide groups, and can cause conflict. Using network analysis we identify faultlines between the participants in the ISD project, and examine the faultlines over the course of the project. Our findings suggest the strong presence of faultlines early in the project; however, at least for the core group of participants, the faultlines dissipate over time as the group becomes more inclusive. Approaches to Information Systems Development Track Twenty-eighth International Conference on Information Systems Montreal 2007 1 The Formation and Evolution of Faultlines in LargeScale, Multi-Party Information Systems Development ** Research-in-Progress ** Introduction Information Systems Development (ISD) projects are becoming increasingly more complex in scale and scope, more distributed, and involve a more diverse user base (Levina 2005). Findings from past research in ISD and in user involvement have often focused on systems with a smaller and less diverse user group, usually located within a single organization (e.g., McKeen et al. 1994; Sabherwal and Robey 1993), and do not necessarily generalize to large scale projects that also involve a diverse user base of individual and institutional stakeholders. Studies on open source software (OSS) have examined the distributed aspect of systems development; however, developers, users and stakeholders of systems developed outside the OSS movement do not have a common set of values (e.g. Stewart and Gosain 2006) that create commitment to a project through identification with a larger movement. Also, the involvement of multiple institutions, rather than just individual users and developers, has not been examined, even though investment in large-scale ISD has increased on the part of the government and through government-academic projects, such as the “e-Science” initiative in the United Kingdom and the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) initiative funded by the National Science Foundation in the United States. Our research-in-progress attempts to address this gap by examining the participation of a diverse body of stakeholders in a large-scale, multi-party government-academic-industrial ISD project over a four-year timeframe. The ISD project had the goal of integrating information technology and systems with civil engineering to provide a distributed collection of laboratory facilities that could be used by engineers to perform model-based simulations of earthquakes. The theoretical lens applied in our study – faultlines – comes from the group diversity literature. Faultlines are hypothetical lines that divide groups, such as gender or expertise, and which may cause conflict among subgroups (Lau and Murnighan 1998). Using network analysis we identify faultlines between groups in the ISD project, and we examine how faultlines become salient or dissipate over time. The analysis reported here is a first step in an attempt to integrate the social network and social psychological perspectives in examining the process of large scale, multi-party information systems development. Theory and Research Questions A large body of research has attempted to examine the conditions under which group diversity has positive versus negative impacts on group-level and organizational outcomes, but results have been largely inconclusive (Williams and O’Reilly 1998). The faultlines model shifted the level of analysis so that diversity was examined as a group characteristic rather than just as an individual-level attribute (Lau and Murnighan 1998). Accordingly, the effects of diversity are hypothesized to vary with the group’s composition and structure. Faultlines, by definition, are “hypothetical dividing lines that may split a group into subgroups based on one or more attributes” (Lau and Murnighan 1998). Faultlines can be an important determinant of subgroup conflict, particularly when the group's task is relevant to one of its faultlines. Groups might have several attributes that distinguish their members and therefore several possible faultlines. For example, two such attributes are expertise and affiliation. Expertise and affiliation are valuediagnostic attributes (Tajfel and Turner 1986): individuals rely on those attributes in categorizing others into an ingroup and outgroup, and in deciding whether and how much to cooperate and share information with others. Also, expertise and affiliation are distinct and uncorrelated indices of group-level diversity and as such they allow us to examine the effect of diversity among the project stakeholders from multiple angles. Recent research in group diversity and performance has found that, by integrating multiple attributes, diversity examined from the faultlines perspective had greater explanatory power for group outcomes than single-attribute diversity (Lau and Murnighan 2005). This suggests the importance of investigating multiple faultlines, rather than focusing on a single one. 2 See the website http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/escience/default.htm for more information. 3 For information on GENI, see http://www.geni.net. Approaches to Information Systems Development Track Twenty-eighth International Conference on Information Systems Montreal 2007 2 Diversity of expertise is relevant to the context of our study because the coordination and execution of large ISD projects involves complex decisions and tasks that in turn involve the input of individuals with different backgrounds (or knowledge domains, such as geology, information technology, systems design, usability) that represent distinct “thought worlds” (Dougherty 1992). There are many instances in the IS literature of expertise diversity causing conflict during ISD, for example, users and developers battling over design and implementation issues (Urquhart 2001; Barki and Hartwick 1994; Newman and Noble 1990; Markus 1983). Thus it is conceivable that an expertise faultline may develop in large-scale, multi-party ISD efforts. Affiliation is also relevant in the context of large-scale multi-party ISD projects, in which stakeholders are likely to be affiliated with different organizational units or firms. Prior studies that have looked at the diversity of affiliations within a single organization (business unit affiliations) have shown that different affiliations within a team operate as category labels that members rely on in the course of their work with others so that assumptions about values and goals are transferred from the unit to the individual representing that unit (Bunderson and Sutcliffe 2000). Members’ affiliations trigger social categorization processes (Early and Mosakowski 2000) so that members tend to favor, cooperate and align with those they perceive to have similar (or the same) affiliation as them. It is easy to imagine how this might be salient in the context of ISD projects, where a faultline might develop between users from business departments and developers from IS departments (cf Kirsch and Haney 2006; Curtis et al 1988). Moreover, when ISD projects span organizations (such as government, academic, and industrial organizations, as in our research site), it is plausible that a faultline may occur along the affiliation boundary, with academics forming one group and government officials forming another. Though it seems that faultlines may erupt due to expertise and affiliation diversity, there is little research in this area from which to develop a specific research model. Moreover, it seems plausible that faultlines may also stem from other attributes that divide groups, such as gender, age, or ethnicity. In addition, as a project unfolds over time, faultlines may change, for example, differences in expertise or affiliation may become less salient as individuals work closely with each other. Thus, to explore the involvement of different stakeholder groups in the development of a large-scale, multi-party effort, we posed two broad research questions: What faultlines form between groups of stakeholders involved in an ISD project? How do the faultlines change as the project evolves? Research Site and Context The source of our data comes from the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), a project created by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to better understand earthquakes, their causes and effects. The goal of NEES is to promote collaborative research, shared understanding, and shared equipment (including engineering equipment sites, computational resources, and digital libraries) among the earthquake engineering community. The NEES project involved the creation of NEESgrid, a large-scale network designed to connect researchers and experimental equipment sites comprised of advanced earthquake testing capabilities. The NEESgrid infrastructure and systems development project involves tasks that require inputs from multiple knowledge domains, and involve multiple user groups with different needs and requirements. The user groups and governing committees associated with NEES (including NEESgrid) are comprised of academics and professionals with different expertise backgrounds and different institutional affiliations (academia, private sector, and NSF). Given that NEES includes a community of developers, users and institutional stakeholders, the faultlines approach is an appropriate group-level p	align (company);categorization;computational resource;digital library;e-science;ibm notes;information systems;information system;library (computing);network for earthquake engineering simulation;open sound system;open-source software;organizational behavior;outgroup (cladistics);requirement;samuel newman;social network analysis;software development process;systems design;usability	Sandra Slaughter;E.

As technologies are inherently unreliable and, especially, the behavior of complex technological systems is unpredictable, the reliability and continuity of such systems cannot be a mere technological concern, but are precarious achievements that require humans, technologies and other actors. Prior research has shown that work creates variance in organizational performance and that reliability and continuity emerges from what work is done and how it is performed. This ethnographic research focuses on technicians’ IT enabled workspace to analyze how the materiality of the workspace conditions and enables technicians to perform the reliability and continuity of a smart infrastructure (smart power grid). Building on sociomaterial theorizing and infrastructure studies, a concept of infra-acting is developed to denote the technicians’ possibilities for action in smart infrastructure setting, and to foreground and make sense of the reciprocity between the (materiality of) technicians’ workspace and infrastructure continuity.

The contemporary, new, high and so-called smart or intelligent technologies are progressively cutting across different spheres of social and economic life. The oversupply of the tourism market, hotel industry in particular, has stimulated the hoteliers by implementing innovations to try to find the best way to differentiate and give prominence to their hotel facility among the large number of its competitors. They have been stimulated to implement smart technologies in their hotel facility by several primary reasons: differentiation and business cost reduction for the purpose of gaining competitive advantages, but first of all - gaining a better understanding of the hotel guests' needs and a quality level improvement of the existing hotel service. This paper examines the tourism demand readiness to accept the tourism product innovations. The research has been conducted by survey method of random sampling 106 hotel guests in the area of the city of Zadar. The given results have then been analysed by descriptive statistics methods. The Technology Readiness Index (TRI) has been calculated based upon which the tourists' readiness to use innovative tourism products has been determined. The research has proven that the respondents are relatively unsatisfied with the current smart technology implementation in the hotel product and that they are ready to except a higher level of implemented smart technologies.	quality of service;sampling (signal processing)	Bozena Krce Miocic;Ljiljana Zekanovic-Korona;Martina Matesic	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 35th International Convention MIPRO		database index;the internet;innovation management;computer science;differentiation;management;tourism;law;statistics	HCI	-83.84807099525959	-7.572280150023986	52264

With development becoming increasingly sophisticated, the business environment in China is going through a transformational stage. Organizations in China have to be able to adjust to social, economic, cultural and technical changes by being adaptive. Adaptive organizations have been studied for some time, with investigations stemming from research on organizational change, organizational learning and complex adaptive systems. According to the literature, adaptive organizations maintain competitive advantage by adjusting their strategies, organizational structures, business processes and information systems. This paper focuses on a textile manufacturer in China. A case study approach is used to address how a manufacturing organization adapts in the Chinese business environment and to determine the key elements of adaptive organizations. Company strategy, leadership, networks, capability, communication and external environment were found to be the six key elements that enable the manufacturer to be adaptive. Interestingly, the evidence from the case study indicated that agility was not critically important to an adaptive manufacturer in the Chinese textile industry. It was found that the external environment significantly hinders adaptive behaviors, and that government policies play an important role in this. Interdependent relationships among the six key elements are illustrated using a series of structural and behavioral models.

73353b3ae9ce40d0929eea4f85708c1ed6839872	towards ethical big data artifacts: a conceptual design		Although Big Data generates many benefits for individuals, organizations and society, significant ethical issues are forcing governments to review their regulations so that citizens’ rights are protected. Given these ethical issues and a gradual increase of awareness about them, individuals are in need of new technical solutions to engage with organizations that extract value from Big Data. Currently, available solutions do not adequately accommodate the conflicting interests of individuals and organizations. In this paper, we propose a conceptual design for an artifact that will raise awareness amongst individuals about Big Data ethical issues and help to restore the power balance between individuals and organizations. Furthermore, we set forward a design agenda outlining future activities towards building and evaluating our proposed artifact. Our work is grounded in discourse ethics and stakeholder theory and intertwined with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).	big data;general data protection regulation;privacy	Olgerta Tona;Ida Asadi Someh;Kaveh Mohajeri;Graeme G.

These projects have been chronicled in both academic and practitioner journals and the proceedings of various E-Government conferences. As a consequence of this growing body of data, it is now possible to look across the experiences of numerous governments to understand if there are common issues that may impact the probability of success of E-Government programs. This paper examines the literature to search for critical planning and implementation issues that have had significant effects upon the success of E-Government initiatives. A conceptual framework is proposed which contributes to the theoretical understanding of E-Government initiative planning and implementation, and may inform practitioner success with new E-Government initiatives.

d85179f87588048c8e9d5703daa4565159a3deb8	life after is outsourcing: understanding is personnel responses to resizing initatives		Anecdotal evidence and press reports point to improper management of IS personnel as a key reason for failure of several IS outsourcing deals. IS outsourcing initiatives are often coupled with changes to the in-house IS function, resulting in significant changes to the rank, size and responsibilities of IS personnel (collectively termed as “IS resizing”). This research seeks to examine the issues surrounding IS resizing, post-outsourcing, by focusing on the psychological responses of IS survivor employees. We conceptualize three kinds of IS resizing approaches – downsizing (layoff), outplacement (redeployment to an external vendor) and inplacement (internal reassignment). Drawing on psychological contract theory, social identity theory, IS personnel and outsourcing literature, we propose a model linking the IS resizing approach, psychological characteristics of the IS employee, and behavioral outcomes. We incorporate transition management as a critical component in mitigating the psychological contract violations that arise due to outsourcing and IS resizing.	outsourcing;report;type physicalism	C.

Thus, unique leadership challenges arise due to the technology/business interface. The breadth of the IS Leadership role implies that IS Leadership research needs to cover a wide range of topics concerning the role and characteristics of the CIO, the CIO's interface with the top management team, and the CIO's organizational impact.

In this paper, I examine the role that ICTs play in supporting knowledge sharing in virtual CoPs. In particular, I examine the use of two key types of ICTs -- knowledge repositories and online discussion forums. Based on the perceived cost of using these two types of ICTs, I theorize about how various factors would differ in their influence on knowledge sourcing from knowledge repositories and from online discussion forums. Two event-driven surveys were conducted with members of a CoP in a consulting firm to test the hypotheses. The surveys were conducted when CoP members downloaded documents from the knowledge repository and when CoP members posted inquiries and received responses in an online discussion forum. The results of the event-driven surveys partially support the hypotheses and show the importance of understanding the perceived costs of using the ICT to support knowledge reuse when we study knowledge sharing in virtual CoPs and in other settings that depend significantly on technological tools for knowledge sharing.	c object processor;connascence (computer programming);event-driven programming;information repository;knowledge management	Wai Fong Boh	2014	DATA BASE	10.1145/2621906.2621908	public relations;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;marketing;world wide web	HCI	-85.65888207171653	-0.8314053190712516	53522

Research argues that central actors can act as early adopters and catalysts for the adoption of technological innovations, but studies are inconclusive regarding central actors’ de facto role in this matter. Peripheral actors in scale-free networks tend to cluster, which implies that they are structurally embedded and mutually dependent. A major thesis in this paper is that clustered peripheral actors in scale-free networks may restrict central actors’ propensity to adopt innovations, and as a result impede their diffusion. The paper discusses which implications this may have for stakeholders in the private and public sector domain and practitioners of strategic management.		Jarle Aarstad	2014	Techn. Analysis & Strat.

8e851270b8457a7dd9fa9abf35c9d4678e16cb26	impact of supervisor - subordinate relationship on envy, knowledge sharing, and relational conflict among employees: a pilot study		Envy has been relatively ignored in organizational behavior research. In this study, we focus on the impact of leader member exchange on envy. In addition, we also investigate the consequences of envy in terms of employee knowledge sharing and relational conflict. Building on Affective events theory, we argue that employees who do not have a good relationship with their supervisors (low quality LMX) will exhibit higher levels of envy and eventually will restrict their knowledge sharing and engage in relational conflict in the workplace.

This paper will also discuss how concepts from organisation and management theory can help conceptualise opportunity exploration and exploitation of bio-inspired designs to commercial applications (biopreneuring). Until now, research on biomimetics has primarily focused on translating design from biology to technology, leaving the application of biomimetics for business purposes somewhat overlooked. This paper fills some of that void. Business orientation literature is applied to identify some of the key strategic aspects associated with commercial translations. In closing, this paper briefly sketches out some key implications for business research and for affected decision-makers.	biomimetics;framing (social sciences)	John P. Ulhøi	2015	Techn.

Most of the citizens, particularly from rural India are found unaware about investment avenues, rules, and regulations. As a result of this, in spite of remarkable growth in Indian economy and increase in income level, the saving per capita is found to be lower. Technology is one of the key aspects through which a large number of people especially from rural India could be connected and made aware.  Common Services Centers (CSCs) functions are delivery points for government and public service for the rural population available at their doorstep. In order to make the rural citizens aware about the concept of investment, Financial Literacy, and Investor Awareness Programs were initiated through CSCs in collaboration with Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).  This paper presents best practices and operations to deliver Financial Literacy and Investor Awareness Programs for masses through innovative technology. The paper also analyses state wise behavior pattern on investments in financial literacy. The paper ends with outcomes of impact analysis and conclusion.	best practice;financial times	Lay Smrity Guria;Rishikesh Patankar;Dinesh Tyagi	2017		10.1145/3047273.3047369	accredited investor;finance;financial system;business	HCI	-79.08158093243205	-7.952475111899343	54876
3a674f02c48ff81acf1aa77086cddf4cb3545d52	exploring virtual enterprises using activity theory	collaboration;activity theory;virtual enterprise	From joint Industry – University research into the key success factors that sustain Virtual Enterprises (VE’s), it has been observed that conditions for the establishment of a VE do not necessarily sustain it. Transactions that are valued by the participants, a balance between similarity and complementarity attributes of the participants and effective utilisation of time are seen as important sustaining factors. Different communication and ICT tools are utilised in different circumstances, and successful collaborations develop formal or informal “rules” underlying their operation. Considering such attributes helps us understand what happens within a successful VE, but not necessarily how. Two case studies describing long-standing collaborations – one relating to a manufacturing network, and the other to a professional virtual community are presented. A third case study relating to the development of ICT tools to be used in a VE is also presented. Activity Theory is used as a framework for discussion of the organisational attributes associated with these cases and how they operate. It is suggested that exploration of the nature of tools, communities etc is helpful in understanding VE operations, and applied at multiple levels, Activity Theory is also useful in understanding the evolution of those tools, communities etc.		Ronald C.

With development of eGovernment services, users can easily and quickly access the services they need any time they want and they already feel the benefits of these actions. However, the fact that technology is available, by itself does not imply that it is accessible to everyone. Although eGovernment has become a powerful tool that governments use to get closer to the citizens, there is still a paradox that those who most need to use the services provided by governments, are the ones that usually do not have access to these services. The term digital divide has been used since 1990s and nowdays it describes the difference in use of technology, developed as a result of lack of access, skills, or even interest in using of technology. This paper aims to analyze the potential of eGovernment implementation on the reduction (or expansion) of the digital divide.	expansion pack	Vujica Lazovic;Tamara Durickovic	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 35th International Convention MIPRO		information and communications technology;digital divide;e-government;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-80.21710751494903	-9.600087368818581	54903

Manifest variables and latent variables are based on the various dimensions of teamwork collated through the literature. A structural model was built on the measurement model. Models were evaluated through PLS-SEM methods. Data acquired on candidate questionnaire items from 398 international respondents who are users of five different online collaborative word processors was used for the model analysis. Of 37 candidate manifest variables, 22 were retained, which were measuring seven latent constructs: “3C Mechanisms”, “Grounding”, “Team Integration”, “Communication”, “Shared Access”, “Awareness” and “Usability”.

5270ded225ff51ee6a8f923993da5cc546fc268a	strategic information systems control practices in new zealand	information system;new zealand	A very important issue for business management is how well Information Systems (IS) strategy is supporting its business strategy and direction, in the current and future business and information technology (IT) circumstances. The issue of monitoring, reviewing and maintenance of IS strategies from a strategic perspective, (strategic IS control), have enjoyed little attention by IS researchers in the past. The paper reports on a study to investigate current strategic IS control practices in New Zealand and to measure their level of effectiveness. A field survey of 123 New Zealand organisations provided the data for the study. The results show about 80% of NZ organisations practising IS planning also practise strategic oriented control over their strategic IS plans one way or another, and with varying degrees of effectiveness. Also, strategic IS control is found to significantly influence the performance of the strategic IS plan. In addition to increasing our understanding of the issue of strategic IS control and its current approaches, the significance of the study is two folds. First, the study proves the fact that strategic IS control impacts IS plan performance, and second, it provides a criteria that help IS practitioners to evaluate and set up their strategic IS control systems.	control system;information systems;strategic information system;strategic management	Mustafa Eid;Attahir Yusuf;Anonios Vitalis	2001			computer science;information system	AI	-82.12943471030863	2.2952611312979574	55097

9a69cbcaf711640e707280c9a1ce7e7c46be78e0	a social network approach to diagnose public participation in protected areas management: insights from a natura 2000 case study		Non-participative protected areas management can generate conflicts especially between stakeholders and administrative public bodies. Involving NGOs in management activities, as representatives of citizens and stakeholders can be critical for a successful enforcement of conservation activities, contributing to a better information flow within the management network. Nevertheless, integrating NGOs in management activities coordinated by public bodies is a challenging task, mostly due the dominant top-down approach, with no shared responsibilities with other actors. To evaluate the public participation in management of Natura 2000 sites, we compare public perception data with social network analysis around administration of Iron Gates Natural Park (SW Romania) and overlapped Natura 2000 protected areas. By applying a survey in 2012 and 2016 to local people, we observed an increasing trend of awareness regarding the protected area and conservation activities carried out by the administration. However, we identified lower percentages regarding the level of participation in activities of the protected area. The social network analysis applied to management actors and relationships between them revealed a marginal position of NGOs involved in Iron Gates Natural Park management, and as well a lack of coordination of these NGOs. Our paper highlights the low level of collaboration between different types of institutions involved in environmental management. Our social network analysis results illustrate the actual collaboration relationships between stakeholders, critical findings in achieving established management objectives. Public bodies and NGOs should make progress by addressing both ecological and societal issues in the management of Natura 2000 sites, in order to ensure sustainability, raise trust and maintain long-term viability of natural and cultural heritage.	environmental resource management;marginal model;shattered world;social network analysis;top-down and bottom-up design	Andreea Nita;Cristiana Maria Ciocanea;Steluta Manolache;Laurentiu Rozylowicz	2017		10.1145/3110025.3110124	data mining;social network analysis;natura 2000;computer science;environmental resource management;cultural heritage;public participation;sustainability;social network;management by objectives;protected area	HCI	-78.93845634045881	-4.775884440519113	55241

The extent to which workers rely on tacit or explicit knowledge may produce inefficiencies and reduce productivity if the information is not shared among those who need it or if it encapsulates strategic goals and is inadvertently shared with those who might undermine the firm's competitive advantage. This article discusses the nature of tacit vs. explicit knowledge in terms of the dimensions thought to contribute to its degree of tacitness. We present the results of an exploratory study in which we develop an instrument designed to elicit perceptions regarding the nature of knowledge used by workers and their degree of reliance on tacit knowledge. It is an indirect form of measurement that eliminates the need to render the knowledge entirely explicit prior to measurement. As an additional benefit, it allows us to classify the knowledge along a continuum, ranging from entirely tacit to entirely explicit or somewhere in between. Use of this instrument by managers will help them identify pockets of tacit knowledge within the firm that could either be made explicit so that other workers can benefit from it or that could be prevented from becoming explicit should its strategic value require protection.	knowledge management;theory;triune continuum paradigm	Michael A.

Each organization is trying to come up with ways of sharing knowledge to create impact in the society they thrive in. This paper is based on exploratory survey to assess the knowledge sharing techniques amongst the jua kali artisans in Kenya. This study sought to analyze knowledge sharing amongst Jua Kali workers in Kenya; Describe the nature of their business; investigate the type of knowledge they posses; identify the knowledge sharing mechanism they use; analyze how effective the knowledge sharing mechanisms have been; identify the challenges affecting the effective sharing of knowledge; and propose strategies which can be used by the Jua Kali workers in Kenya to enhance effective knowledge sharing.  Primary data was collected through interviews using self-administered questionnaires which were distributed to the Jua kali artisans. Additional information on Jua kali workers was collected from relevant scholarly documents analysis. The findingsindicate that most of the Jua Kali workers use mentoring as a way of sharing knowledge. These knowledge sharing techniques are hampered by language barrier this is because some of the mentors or trainees are largely illiterate and can only communicate in their vernaculars. The findings can be use by the Kenyan government to develop a training of trainers programme for the experienced artisans to equip them with new skills as well as how to impart them.	hoard	Lucy Kibe	2016		10.1145/2925995.2926042	engineering;knowledge management;environmental resource management;management science	AI	-81.31581485500112	-0.42620372643656534	55493

Many scholars have adopted the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) for all sorts of research studies. However, few have conducted research from the perspective of multiple-level stakeholders, which remains to be a worth exploring research direction. This research addressed the above issue by constructing a Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) based on the available data in NHIRD in order to identify key factors influencing health spending. A future work is to conduct an empirical study to validate the HLM model, which can be also good reference for future insightful research on multiple-stakeholder perspective.	multilevel model	Ying-Kai Chen;Yu-Hui Tao	2014		10.1145/2684103.2684178	health policy	AI	-86.99584431385257	-6.098096397050125	55583

It has been showing significant result in addressing information asymmetry gap in many sectors and localities, especially in agriculture & allied sector. The rural people, specifically farming communities have been getting timely & relevant information, services & support, and farming inputs. However, the sustainability of these ICT based efforts in improving well-being of farming communities is key to the effectiveness of a rural ICT projects in India. The present paper aimed to determine the sustainability of the aAQUA (Almost All Questions Answered) e-Agriservice in Maharashtra state, western parts of India covering the four districts of the state. The study used the ex-post facto (cause to effect) research design in a quasi-intervention setting. The list of registered users was obtained from the service provider (presently Agrocom Software Technologies Pvt. Ltd.) and total of 120 users were selected randomly from four districts (30 users from each district). The sustainable-Agriservice Index (SeAGRSI) was computed based on the five dimensions viz. technological, economic, social, institutional, and political by using Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), Mixed Method Approach and Normalized Rank Order Method (NROM). The study revealed that the SeAGRSI for the social indicators was the highest among other dimensions of the sustainability (SeAGRSI = 0.77) followed by the technologically (0.73), economic (0.71) political (0.62) and institutional (0.58) sustainable. It was also found that the mean SeAGRSI was 0.70 as reported by one third (32.50%) of the users, which means 70 per cent the aAQUA e-Agriservice was technologically, socially, economically, institutionally and politically sustainable.	randomness;viz: the computer game	Sagar K.

At present, little attention is paid to the elicitation of underlying assumptions and perspectives in dealing with complex issues in traditional decision support systems (DSS). We argue that the Socratic dialectic inquiry is an effective method for dealing with unstructured problems that are complex and require the involvement of different perspectives in DSS. In this paper, we propose a design for Dialectic Decision Support System (DDSS), in which dialectical processes are integrated with traditional DSS in order to support individual users. We propose the design of DDSS and formulate a conceptual model for testing the superior efficacy of DDSS compared with traditional DSS. The potential contribution of this research is in providing a greater level of support for critical thinking, dealing with complex decision problems, and identifying creative solutions.	americas conference on information systems;contextual inquiry;decision problem;decision support system;effective method;knowledge base;out of the box (feature)	Suprasith Jarupathirun;Fatemeh Zahedi	2004			psychology;knowledge management;management science;social psychology	HCI	-79.39348008961932	-1.9773528340205109	55711

We do so by extending the behavioural perspective in strategic HR management research and argue that two variables, HR philosophy and desired employee contributions, play an instrumental role in organisational choices regarding the types of HR policies used to manage employees within and across organisations. We propose that the dimensions of desired employee contributions determine which sets of HR policies are feasible while HR philosophy governs the specific choices of HR policies within firms.

This is especially important in more sensitive domains, such as the one of Online Dispute Resolution, in which inefficient communication environments may result in misunderstandings, poor decisions or the escalation of the conflict. The conflict manager, in particular, may find his skills severely diminished, namely in what concerns the accurate perception of the state of the parties. In this paper the development of a rich communication framework is detailed that conveys contextual information about their users, harnessed from the transparent analysis of their behaviour while communicating. Using it, the conflict manager may not only better perceive the conflict and how it affects each party but also take better contextualized decisions, closer to the ones taken in face-to-face settings.	enquire;information retrieval;interaction;international symposium on fundamentals of computation theory;privilege escalation;the times	Paulo Novais;Davide Carneiro;Francisco José Cavalcante Andrade;José Neves	2013		10.1007/978-3-662-45960-7_17	psychology;conflict resolution research;knowledge management;communication;social psychology	HCI	-86.20539398980769	-4.317779218221439	55895

In practice, many senior executives argue that they do not see a connection between what IT does and their tasks as executives. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a research model was developed and tested to assess the factors that in¯uence the use of IT by senior executives. A dedicated system supporting the task of a senior executive, an Executive Information System (EIS), was used as the IT tool under review. A large number of external variables were identi®ed and hypothesized, in¯uencing the core elements of TAM. To test the research model using structural equation modeling, cross-sectional data was gathered from eighty-seven senior executives drawn from twenty-one European-based multinationals. The results supported the core TAM and found only a small number of antecedent variables in¯uencing actual use, either directly or indirectly. In addition to identifying the external factors, three of these key variables are under managerial control. They can be used to design organizational or managerial interventions that increase effective utilization of IT.	channel (communications);conceptualization (information science);cross-sectional data;executive information system;external variable;ibm tivoli access manager;information appliance;internet;mobile phone;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;new economy;occam's razor;personal computer;personal digital assistant;structural equation modeling;usability;value (ethics)	Guus G.

02101691aa01cbb51f53388111173a3716fefc21	wireless technology diffusion: an evaluation model for wireless services		The last few years have witnessed the successful diffusion of a number of wireless technologies including the increasing popularity of mobile phone services and wireless web services. As mobile communication now moves towards its next and much awaited milestone-3G services, it is imperative that equipment manufacturers, service providers and application developers must address the diffusion issue to a greater extent. A lot of planning and financial investments are going into 3G projects, hence it is necessary for industry players to understand the user requirements, attitude, behavior patterns and expectations before introducing these services. There have been successes and failures in mobile telephony in the past and many lessons can be learned from those experiences, which can be applied to 3G related services. Hence, to assist companies in successfully diffusing wireless technologies to the end users, this article proposes a Wireless Technology Diffusion Model (WITD Model) which can be used to understand and predict the diffusion of wireless technologies by those who have a stake in provision of mobile services, be it the telecommunication service provider, software developer, equipment manufacturer or a corporate adopting the mobile environment for its employees.	imperative programming;mobile phone;requirement;software developer;user requirements document;web service	Karan Gera;Lei-Da Chen	2003			municipal wireless network;marketing;computer science;management science;mobile phone;wireless wan;wi-fi array;computer network;base transceiver station;motorola canopy;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wireless site survey	Mobile	-91.65319183870483	-7.0211050926670175	56174

Since information plays an important role in IT adoption, this study applies an information science lens to investigate the factors affecting the continued usage of mobile phones in rural India. Analysis of interviews with 22 women earning less than a dollar day reveals the influence of social, economic, cognitive, technological, and information-related factors on their continued usage of mobiles. Micro-and meso-level socioeconomic motives and active information-seeking behavior emerge as the most significant factors encouraging respondents to continue using mobiles against several technical and human barriers. The application of information science lens yields three constructs and ten micro-, meso-, and macro-level variables, advancing critical research on IT adoption with the help of a theoretical lens outside of psychology and communication literature.	information science;mobile phone	Devendra Potnis	2015	IJTD	10.4018/IJTD.2015010105	knowledge management;management science;computer security	HCI	-86.82152628115183	-8.43152709655717	56278

SocLab is a platform for the modelling, simulation and analysis of cooperation relationships within social organizations – and more generally Systems of Organized Action. Design/methodology/approach – Simulation results, including an interesting tendency for a Free Rider model, will be given. Considering that actors’ decision-making processes are not just driven by instrumental interest, the SocLab learning simulation algorithm has been extended to represent moral sensitivity, making actors trying to prevent bad emotions and feel good ones. Findings – Some simulation results about actors’ collaboration and emotions in a Free Rider model were presented. A noteworthy tendency is that actors’ unconditional collaboration, which occurs when their moral sensitivity reaches its highest value, is not so good since it exempts other actors from collaboration (they take advantage from the unconditional collaboration), while values of moral sensitivity somewhat below the highest value (between 0.7 and 0.9) still induces collaboration from others. Originality/value – The research and results presented in this paper have not been presented in other papers or workshops. The presented quantitative definition of emotions (determining indexes of emotions) is different to previous approaches – for instance, to Ortony, Clore and Collins (OCC) qualitative descriptions and to logical descriptions. Similarly, simulation of morality in organizations is a new research field, which has received scarce attention up to now.

The purpose of this paper is therefore two-fold. One, it seeks to develop a KM framework for disaster management portals. Two, with this framework, it seeks to construct a checklist and demonstrate its utility by evaluating 60 disaster management portals from the North American and the Asian region. Findings revealed statistically significant differences in the knowledge management implementation level between the two regions. The findings also helped to identify the essential knowledge management features that these portals should support. This research not only highlights the usefulness of a knowledge management perspective in managing digital information but also serves as a template to design disaster management portals.	digital data;fold (higher-order function);knowledge management;portals	Alton Yeow-Kuan Chua;Radhika Shenoy Balkunje;Dion Hoe-Lian Goh	2011	2011 Sixth International Conference on Digital Information Management	10.1109/ICDIM.2011.6093347	disaster;data management;organization;knowledge management;evaluation;statistical significance;personal knowledge management;emergency management;statistics	DB	-77.83807161533657	-4.729576167767137	56708

0f689c03eafa92c5e530c7e5c1d1d71a2eb6dbe9	empirical investigation of the role of privacy and data protection in the implementation of electronic government in ghana	thesis or dissertation;e government;ghana;privacy and data protection	This study investigates the role of privacy and data protection in the implementation of e-government in developing countries. It examines the privacy and data protection issues which arise when e-government is introduced in Ghana. E-government is a way that governments liaise with their various departments and agencies through the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Through e-government, governments are able to provide better, effective and efficient services to their citizens. This new form of governments’ delivering services electronically to their citizens, businesses and various departments potentially offers benefits (for example, economic development, low costs and improved services) to society. However the implementation of e-government carries potential risks to users. The potential for online identity theft and fraud raises privacy concerns. From a theoretical foundation, fieldwork in Ghana, through interviews and focus groups, is used to investigate the issue of privacy and data protection in e-government implementation in an empirical setting. Interviewees included senior civil servants, political leaders, members of the Select Committee on Communication, academics, university students as well as stakeholders from private and public organisations. The research borrowed from the Straussian grounded theory approach as a technique to analyse the fieldwork data. The results of the study indicate that privacy and data protection does not currently play a significant role in e-government implementation in a developing country such as Ghana. Other factors such as access to information and communication technologies (Internet accessibility) and e-skills were found to be challenges which significantly impact individuals’ use of e-government. The study found that there is a low privacy concern among Ghanaian citizens. This was found to be significantly related to a lack of awareness of privacy issues; and also the national cultural dimensions of Ghanaian society.	e-government;information privacy	Eric Agyei-Bekoe	2013			public relations;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;data mining;business;computer security;information privacy law	DB	-79.54038676637612	-6.085230024631927	56844

Drawing on our involvement with PortNL, an integrated e-government service for expatriates in the Netherlands, we explain this absence as a result of an inevitable tension between user-centred design – the most common way to involve users – and e-government. User-centred design is a structured approach to produce interactive systems by involving users or potential users and addressing their needs at every stage of the design process. Governments, while concerned with their users' needs, have their own considerable needs to address. We outline four manifestations of the tension between user-centred design and e-government: users' and governments' contradictory visions of the tasks to be accomplished; governments' mandate to design for exceptions, as well as for the mainstream, governments' and users' differing commitments to the law and governments' and users' contradicting desires about the nature of their relationship. We conclude with observations about the design and development of e-government services to improve their quality and, thus, increase their uptake	e-government;user-centered design	Nalini Kotamraju;Thea van der Geest	2012	Behaviour & IT	10.1080/0144929X.2011.563797	user-centered design;simulation;design process;e-government;human–computer interaction;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;service design;management;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-82.30770574906595	-3.3264406875686285	56942

As a result, organizational change has been reified and treated as exceptional rather than natural. In this paper, we set out to offer an account of organizational change on its own terms—to treat change as the normal condition of organizational life. The central question we address is as follows: What must organization(s) be like if change is constitutive of reality? Wishing to highlight the pervasiveness of change in organizations, we talk about organizational becoming. Change, we argue, is the reweaving of actors’ webs of beliefs and habits of action to accommodate new experiences obtained through interactions. Insofar as this is an ongoing process, that is to the extent actors try to make sense of and act coherently in the world, change is inherent in human action, and organizations are sites of continuously evolving human action. In this view, organization is a secondary accomplishment, in a double sense. Firstly, organization is the attempt to order the intrinsic flux of human action, to channel it towards certain ends by generalizing and institutionalizing particular cognitive representations. Secondly, organization is a pattern that is constituted, shaped, and emerging from change. Organization aims at stemming change but, in the process of doing so, it is generated by it. These claims are illustrated by drawing on the work of several organizational ethnographers. The implications of this view for theory and practice are outlined. (Continuous Change; Routines; Process; Improvization; Reflexivity; Emergence; Interaction; Experience) The point is that usually we look at change but we do not see it. We speak of change, but we do not think about it. We say that change exists, that everything changes, that change is the very law of things: Yes, we say it and we repeat it; but those are only words, and we reason and philosophize as though change did not exist. In order to think change and see it, there is a whole veil of prejudices to brush aside, some of them artificial, created by philosophical speculation, the others natural	emergence;experience;interaction;intrinsic dimension;organizational behavior;reification (computer science);stemming	Haridimos Tsoukas;Robert Chia	2002	Organization Science	10.1287/orsc.13.5.567.7810	psychology;interaction;organizational learning;organizational culture;social science;reflexivity;knowledge management;organizational studies;organizational effectiveness;management science;sociology;management;social psychology;organizational space;organization development;organizational architecture;emergence;process	SE	-82.00608265881773	-3.809053821627213	56977
aa1a884649333bdcd2604152c9e0913f6e1b1070	employees' innovation behavior - the role of external information awareness and proactiveness of innovation strategy		Employees’ innovation behavior (IB), which involves developing, promoting, judging, distributing and implementing new ideas, is the foundation for knowledge creation and diffusion in organizations. Therefore, it is important to encourage employees’ IB in knowledge management initiatives. To better understand IB, this study applies the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Employees’ attitude towards innovation, subjective norm about innovation, and perceived behavioral control to innovation are expected to influence employees’ IB. In addition, the effects of organizational factors are considered. Specifically, the influence of external information awareness (EIA) and proactiveness of innovation strategy (PIS) are examined. Results from a survey of employees in Japanese organizations show that employees’ attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control not only significantly influence their innovative behavior, they also mediate the effects of EIA and PIS. This study contributes to research by understanding what individual and organizational factors influence employees’ IB and extending TPB by considering the effects of EIA and PIS, using data collected from an understudied yet important context. The findings also suggest that managers should focus on improving perceived behavioral controls, EIA and PIS to encourage employees’ IB.	knowledge management;scart	Jing Tang;Loo Geok Pee;Junichi Iijima	2011				HCI	-84.45009532804119	-0.6451828017826753	57063

In this thesis the focus is directed at the relationship between communication technology and the development of routines in an industrial organization leading to enhanced value creation. The impact computer-supported knowledge representation has on an organization’s ability to change through development of operating routines are addressed, and propositions concerning the effects on different aspects of communication technology (e.g. system structure and functionality) and organizational environment (e.g. organizational learning, empowerment, systemic innovation, and absorptive capacity) are developed. The moderating role (i.e. the learning mechanisms) of an organization’s ability to learn from, and share, experience within a multilevel nested organizational structure is also discussed and evaluated. The main goal of this study has been to reveal and explain how operating routines are developed and learned through ICT-supported knowledge representation, and on this basis build concepts and methods that can be used to improve the development of operating routines in business organizations. In this context we have developed a deliberate organizational learning model (DOLM). The main contributions of this work are the		Ove R. Hjelmervik;Kesheng Wang	2007	J.

0d0b85da3cd5196fe27962b2983b4741741d8189	refuge tech: an assets-based approach to refugee resettlement		Refugee integration is a long process that follows resettlement into a country where refugees not only face language and culture barriers but also difficulties integrating into the workforce, receiving a good education and accessing healthcare. In addition to the UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, there are countless organizations and nonprofits around the world focused on trying to facilitate this process and provide support where needed. This paper presents preliminary user research undertaken in Clarkston, Georgia (USA), to study the process. We used qualitative research methods including contextual analysis and semi-structured interviews to evaluate the ease of integration for refugees who have relocated to Clarkston. We took a human-centered design approach to identify the gaps in the current process and to present preliminary design recommendations.	semantic analysis (compilers);semiconductor industry;user research;user-centered design	Azalea Irani;Kriti Nelavelli;Kristin Hare;Paula Bondal;Neha Kumar	2018		10.1145/3170427.3188680	multimedia;refugee;user research;knowledge management;health care;computer science;workforce;context analysis;qualitative research	HCI	-81.51308097288195	-7.47088809686004	57365

This work aims at analyzing the potential of these networks for the SME in Algarve, creating a questionnaire for the purpose. The empirical study revealed that some firms have already an integrated business strategy with social networks, as well as a group in the firm responsible for it. Most of their managers consider that social networks enhance performance, but few really measure these results. A categorical principal component analysis identified two dimensions of social networks’ use: social networks for product-client interaction and knowledge; and social networks with potential for marketing. A supplementary analysis (hierarchical clustering) identified three patterns of SME’s involvement in social networks: cluster Social Net Level 1, cluster Social Net Level 2 and cluster Social Net Level 3. These groups validated the results described above, indicating a sustainable methodological approach.	cluster analysis;hierarchical clustering;principal component analysis;social network;strategic management	Ana Belo;Guilherme Castela;Sílvia C.

In this short paper, I voice my concern that emphasis on methodological accountability may well inhibit criticality, and I argue for the need to recognize that researchers bring into their investigation tacit knowledge, emotions, and moral and political convictions that cannot be rationalized in methodological descriptions. Moreover, I suggest that critical research should maintain suspicion to instrumental reasoning and that it should place its effort to producing knowledge on an alternative agenda of substantive social issues by the interplay of theory and empirical evidence.	information system;self-organized criticality	Chrisanthi Avgerou	2005	Inf.

They still have strong sense of participation and sense of contribution in society through convenient high-efficient new social media, exploring social values of the elderly and making them a strong impetus of social development. Considering the population growth of the elderly and the increasing popularization of new media-based social contact in the current age, new media usage behavior data of the elderly were collected through questionnaire survey and in-depth interview. Factors of new media usage behavior of the elderly were analyzed by SPASS and four main influencing factors were concluded: serviceability, usability, value and willingness (SUVW) of the elderly using new media-based social contact. Next, the media-based social contact model of the elderly was constructed by the theoretical model approach based on SUVW. The new-media social contact mode of the elderly verified and discussed through some cases of china. Finally, shortcomings of this study were disclosed and the some reflections and prospects were proposed according to the large fuzzy improvement space in this field. These deserve further deep researches in future.	new media	Minggang Yang;Mingliang Dou;Yinan Han	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58536-9_15	human–computer interaction;advertising;social psychology	HCI	-87.39663512645916	-9.73443473766747	57904

To improve users’ protective behavior, it is necessary to have a better understanding of the downstream beliefs and attitudes. Although previous IS research has intensively investigated protection behavior in the IT context, findings from psychological studies that people’s threat and coping appraisals are gender-specific are largely neglected. Drawing on gender schema theory and protection motivation theory, the present study analyzes gender differences in the formation of mobile users’ intentions to take precautionary actions and their consequent coping behavior. Utilizing a two-step mixed-method research approach (survey, experiment, and interviews) and drawing data from 177 Android users, we show that female and male mobile users’ problemfocused coping behaviors are based on different threat and coping appraisals. These findings have significant implications both for future research and for practitioners.

Perceived distance in relation to the organizational culture has been surveyed through the fixed point observation for two years at the project based company, where the activities learning from failure have been executed so as not to mistake again in the operational field. The web based questionnaire is developed to cover wider employees in the company, asking for their perceived distance about keywords learning from failure and their activities. As a result of positioning keywords on the map by means of multi-dimensional scaling method, no big changes are seen for two years, yet if being exposed to the changes in external environment, it can be said that some factors which did not belong to any of clusters from the analysis, such as the attitude of tackling with challenging things becomes management issues. Thus, visualizing the organizational culture with multi-dimensional scaling method might be supportive and valid when organizing management to some extent.

Enterprise knowledge is becoming ever more specialized in nature, so no single person or organization can know everything in detail. Hence addressing complex, multidisciplinary problems requires developing and accessing a network of knowledgeable people and organizations. The problem is, many otherwise knowledgeable people and organizations are not fully aware of their knowledge networks, and even more problematic, they are not aware that they are not aware. This focuses our attention toward organizational metacognition. The research described in this article involves fieldwork to investigate the metacognition phenomenon, at the organizational level, and to understand its effects in terms of knowledge networks and dynamics. Findings reveal insightful dynamic patterns and differential performance capabilities of various organizations, and highlight the importance of knowing the knowledge network. This work suggests immediate results amenable to practical application, and it suggests also an exciting agenda for continued research along the lines of this investigation	field research;knowledge management;organizational metacognition;social network	John P.

This research provides new discernments for better understanding the mechanisms supporting this relationship by analysing the effects of IT maturity, complementary investments, process orientation and relational maturity on firm performance. We expanded existing literature by developing and empirically testing a model where: 1 the performance is affected by IT maturity; 2 relational maturity can reinforce this relationship. The correctness of the suggested model was statistically approved by gathering data from Iran electric industry and using MPLUS3 software. This research proves that there is a positive significant correlation between IT maturity and performance. Also, we find that IT maturity affects firm performance by enabling organisational processes. Based on the findings of this research investigation, relational maturity of the organisation plays a moderating role in the relationship between IT maturity and firm performance. Findings of this research will be of epical interest to both academics and practitioners of information systems.	capability maturity model	Abbas Keramati;Masoud Afshari-Mofrad;Iman Behmanesh;Reihaneh Gholami	2016	IJBIS	10.1504/IJBIS.2016.078021	knowledge management;electrical engineering;operations management;electric power industry;management;service integration maturity model;law;information technology;people capability maturity model	SE	-81.89067792690643	3.4046849370096792	58334

A comparison of the occupational cultures of two groups can help identify potential conflicts that could ensue when the members from the two groups interact. In the current study, we interviewed IS personnel and management personnel to identify their respective cultural beliefs along group and grid dimensions proposed in Trice’s theoretical framework for characterizing occupational cultures. Based on these interviews, we have analyzed the belief systems of the two groups and highlighted the potential for conflict.	information system	Srinivasan V.

94999ca76d5861a19369831762200d11736309af	education in conflict zones: a web and mobility approach		We propose a new framework for education in conflict zones, considering the explosive growth of social media, web services, and mobile Internet over the past decade. Moreover, we focus on one conflict zone, Afghanistan, as a case study, because of its alarmingly high illiteracy rate, lack of qualified teachers, rough terrain, and relatively high mobile penetration of over 50%. In several of Afghanistan’s provinces, it is hard to currently sustain the traditional bricks-and-mortar school model, due to numerous incidents of schools, teachers, and students being attacked because of the ongoing insurgency and political instability. Our model improves the virtual school model, by addressing most of its disadvantages, to provide students in Afghanistan with an opportunity to achieve standardised education, even when the security situation does not allow them to attend traditional schools. One of the biggest advantages of this model is that it is sufficiently robust to deal with gender discrimination, imposed by culture or politics of the region.	instability;mortar methods;rough set;social media;web service;world wide web	Shah Mahmood;Ismatullah Nazar	2012	CoRR		social science;simulation;artificial intelligence;sociology;management;social psychology;law;computer security	Web+IR	-78.20319835975268	-9.057095097250304	58745
7508f2385b25929e429cdf099bc886dab8240d64	media selection theory for global virtual teams		This study proposes a behavioral complexity theory for media selection in global virtual teams. This theory captures multiple contingencies into one holistic approach. Unlike existing linear and mechanistic theories of media selection, this heuristic theory moves away from the universal models that were previously proposed. The behavioral complexity theory assumes ambiguity, complexity, and a nonlinear, organic, and holistic process. This theory emphasizes the role of media repertoire, the ability of individuals to differentiate situations according to multiple contingencies, and their flexibility to effectively use multiple media in any particular situation. This theory is examined in a context of exploratory case study of global virtual teams’ media selection in one of the leading fortune 500 corporations.	accessibility;americas conference on information systems;cognitive complexity;computational complexity theory;futures studies;heuristic;holism;nonlinear system;x86 virtualization	Pnina Shachaf;Noriko Hara	2006			computer science;knowledge management;management science;repertoire;ambiguity;virtual team;instructional simulation;heuristic	NLP	-79.924301622486	-1.1333329493046347	58768

However, many intentional efforts to bring about innovation do not succeed. In order to be successful, innovation requires the support of individuals throughout the environment in which it is emerging. In many cases, such support is not forthcoming for a variety of reasons. In this paper, the authors discuss a number of barriers that may inhibit the success of innovative practice. They then discuss a role for contextual analysis as the means to target individual engagement, and present an example of a method which could be used to conduct such analysis.	contextual inquiry;learning organization;problem domain;relevance;semantic analysis (compilers);sensemaking;theory	Peter M.

In this paper, terrorist attacks in the Middle East are analyzed using methods of network science, statistical methods, geographic information science, and artificial neural networks designed from a socio-spatial perspective. Based on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), firstly the distribution and trends of terrorist attacks are detected. Then approaches for building diffusion network and identifying diffusion patterns of transnational and transyearly attacks are developed. Finally a Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model is built for predicting future attacks. Results lead to a greater understanding of socio-spatial dependencies and diffusion regularities of terrorist attacks. The findings have significant implications for multinational security and the need to coordinate transnationally.	artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;backpropagation;gene regulatory network;geographic information science;network science;sociological theory of diffusion;software propagation;technical support;uniform theory of diffraction	Ze Li;Duoyong Sun;Hsinchun Chen;Shin-Ying Huang	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI)	10.1109/ISI.2016.7745463	market research;computer science;organization;terrorism;operations research;law;computer security;correlation	AI	-78.60558323191677	3.13126554429886	59033

The research draws upon an in-depth empirical study on Citizens Service Centres, one of the biggest projects of the Greek e-government strategy. Specifically, we outline the rationale for introducing performance monitoring technology in Citizens Service Centres, the use the central government ministry made of the system and the ways in which Citizens Service Centre staff responded to such performance monitoring. Drawing upon studies on e-government and the critical literature on performance monitoring systems, we argue that performance monitoring technology is a limited tool for ensuring accountability. This is due to the effects of the monitoring and performance standards, which increase staffs concerns and are likely to encourage irresponsible and unaccountable practices.	design rationale;e-government;itil;performance engineering;separable polynomial	Dimitra I.

ABSTRACT Contrary to Frey and Osborneu0027s (2013) prediction that the accounting profession faces extinction, we argue that accountants can still create value in a world of Big Data analytics. To advance this position, we provide a conceptual framework based on structured/unstructured data and problem-driven/exploratory analysis. We argue that accountants already excel at problem-driven analysis of structured data, are well positioned to play a leading role in the problem-driven analysis of unstructured data, and can support data scientists performing exploratory analysis on Big Data. Our argument rests on two pillars: accountants are familiar with structured datasets, easing the transition to working with unstructured data, and possess knowledge of business fundamentals. Thus, rather than replacing accountants, we argue that Big Data analytics complements accountantsu0027 skills and knowledge. However, educators, standard setters, and professional bodies must adjust their curricula, standards, and frameworks to...		Greg Richins;Andrea Stapleton;Theophanis C.

The project involved a case study of 12 companies, selected as being `high performing’ according to specified criteria (profitability, productivity, quality, peer evaluation, and export success) and an interview and questionnaire survey technique which investigated: use of information technology to deliver information services, coverage of both internal and external information and data; constitution of the knowledge base; risks to the knowledge base caused by dependency on individuals rather than systems; value of key company staff to the value of information as a contributor to performance; and how far the company can be described as having an information ethos, through which the value of information is conveyed to all workers. Results were used to construct a Research Model of information flows within companies using the variables identified. Findings proved the legitimacy of the research model and validated the interconnected variables studied.

However, examining a panel of hospitals for the adoption of IT, we find that close to 50% of hospitals that adopt a health IT system go on to stop using it during the duration of our panel.1 We find that smaller hospitals and hospitals that are located in areas that have low IT-Intensity are more likely to roll-back IT systems. Additionally, we find that advanced IT systems (that are more complex to implement) are more likely to be rolled back in the absence of complementary services and in smaller organizations. Additionally, we discuss further research that we hope to undertake where we examine the effect of other factors on the probability of roll-back. We hope that reducing this roll-back can reduce the unnecessary costs that hospitals may have to incur as they implement IT systems.	chaos strikes back	Kartik K. Ganju;Hilal Atasoy;Paul A.

A proper reporting system can yield previously unknown, but critical information for combating human errors and ensuring smooth flow of operation. A one-stop generic reporting platform can be a useful collaborative tool between common people and responsible authority in a developing country. Although there are web-based systems to facilitate reporting, the response rate and volume from common people are not satisfactory. In this paper, we strive to know what impediments people face on the way to submit reports on a social reporting website or similar systems in the developing countries as the people of those countries are not well-educated. The attention of this research work is chiefly in identifying study-related problems and resolving them. For this purpose, we have conducted some surveys and focused group discussions with questions focusing on educative aspects and general improvements of reporting system. Survey responses are categorized, analyzed and presented in an appropriate format. By observing the result patterns and making comparison with existing systems, the barriers to reporting in a generic reporting platform is identified and an effective solution is proposed to increase people's participation to reporting. Based on the proposed solution, a system is implemented and demonstrated. Our findings also present some human behavioral pattern or characteristics which are not only effective to design a more credible and lucrative reporting platform, but also gives some psychological insights about fundamental human behavior. The identified barriers to reporting and proposed solutions will act as forerunner to successful reporting of various kinds of problems of the developing countries.	behavioral pattern;categorization;collaborative software;web application	Shantanu Dutta;Abdul Kawsar Tushar;Md Abdullah Al Mamun;Alvi Md.

In today’s digitised society, participation via online media is becoming more important. But is this so-called e-participation being used optimally? Or is a better design possible? In my opinion, the answer to these questions is a ‘yes’. Despite numerous efforts in engaging the public with policy deliberation, the actual amount of participants remains low. In this article, I have used the YUTPA model (Nevejan 2009) to analyse some existing e-participation projects. Additionally, I derived ten characteristics of ‘play’ to make proposals for a more designerly e-participation approach.	design tool;digital media	Maurice Berix	2011	AI & SOCIETY	10.1007/s00146-011-0329-3	design;public engagement	HCI	-82.89486133957234	-7.704228746001513	59654

While research on IT security investment is fast growing, it lacks a theoretical basis for structuring research, explaining economictechnological phenomena and guide future research. We address this shortcoming by suggesting a new theoretical model emerging from a multi-theoretical perspective adopting the Resource-Based View and the Organizational Learning Theory. The joint application of these theories allows to conceptualize in one theoretical model the organizational learning effects that occur when the protection of organizational resources through IT security countermeasures develops over time. We use this model of IT security investments to synthesize findings of a large body of literature and to derive research gaps. We also discuss managerial implications of (closing) these gaps by providing practical examples.	closing (morphology);information systems;information security;theory	Eva Weishäupl;Emrah Yasasin;Guido Schryen	2015			social science;economics;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;management science;management	HCI	-79.2093430465467	-0.14646617870661086	59808

This paper reports investigations on the adoption of ICT in agriculture among Italian tractors users and explores their opinions on technologies applied to agricultural tractors. A survey was conducted during the International Exhibition of Agricultural Machinery (EIMA). The results show that, while economic benefit is recognized as the primary reason to adopt new agricultural technologies, other attitudes play roles in the adoption decision of the tractor users.

5fe631cfa417f417227eb013bf13ecccc327e7e1	"""information systems continuity process: conceptual foundations for the study of the """"social"""""""		Organizations' value creation is dependent on the reliable and continuous operations of their inherently unreliable information systems (IS). Year after year industry and academic surveys show that IS-related incidents persist as a top concern on IS managers' agendas. While past research has addressed technological improvements and planning methodologies as a means of improving the continuity of organizational technologies (IS continuity), the “social” part – that is, the humans and their social and cognitive processes – has largely remained in the background and under researched. This current research seeks to bring to the foreground the implications of the social for IS continuity by developing conceptual foundations of the social dynamics in the IS continuity process. This study proposes a framework of IS continuity process with three phases: (1) preparing for incidents; (2) coping with and mitigating the impact of incidents; and (3) recovering from incidents. Implications of and potential theoretical and conceptual foundations for the social in the IS continuity process are discussed together with their practical implications. Addressing the challenges that pertain to the management of IS continuity requires multidisciplinary approaches that broadly take use of social and cognitive theories on individual and collective levels of analysis.	information system;scott continuity	Marko Niemimaa	2017	Computers & Security	10.1016/j.cose.2016.11.001	knowledge management;management science;computer security	AI	-79.03239571728574	-0.7665424732567527	59858

The research utilised multiple data sources including semi-structured interviews, a focus group, and observations to achieve triangulated findings. The adoption of grounded theory analysis has resulted in the identification of key elements influencing the perception of C-BT deployment in natural events. Findings indicate that organizational readiness, coordination, individual perception, individual readiness, C-BT characteristics, and non C-BT redundancy constitute the key dimensional elements influencing the perceived C-BT usage in natural events. The findings serve as a knowledge base for emergency professionals in both New Zealand and other countries that are also coping with frequent natural disasters to enhance their organisational and individual readiness in C-BT usage in natural events, leading to more effective emergency management performance.	cloud computing;focus group;haplogroup bt;knowledge base;semiconductor industry;software deployment	Ying Lu;Stuart Dillon;Karyn Rastrick;Gottfried Vossen	2017	2017 4th International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Disaster Management (ICT-DM)	10.1109/ICT-DM.2017.8275669	management science;focus group;software deployment;emergency management;coping (psychology);geographic information system;grounded theory;knowledge base;cloud computing;business	HCI	-79.1572040078497	-4.044688566056531	59956

This paper empirically investigates current meeting recording practices in order to both understand fundamental collaboration processes and to determine how these might be better supported by technology. Our main findings were that participants create two types of meeting record. Public records are a collectively negotiated contract of decisions and commitments. Personal records, in contrast, are a highly personalised reminding tool, recording both actions and the context surrounding these actions. These observations are then used to informally evaluate current meeting support technology and to suggest new directions for research.	archive;veracity;while	Steve Whittaker;Rachel Laban;Simon Tucker	2005		10.1007/11677482_9	data mining;management science	HCI	-83.47469162932596	-2.770137605644549	60185
c1995b8e0daa07e970972a898602acc407cb99d3	obstacles to implementation of information security governance		Information security leadership has struggled for almost two decades to demonstrate that investment in information security capabilities would return a tangible value to the organization. The efforts to govern and manage security have not resulted in the value statement that has been desired. A critical look at literature reveals that the struggles with governance can be consolidated into three main topics: practitioners do not have guidance on how to implement security governance; security governance models and methods are failing to address the dynamic environment that security works within, and; there lacks a method to measure governance, alignment, and the proposed value that governance brings. This paper examines these issues in the literature, the gaps in the literature, and identifies opportunities to address these gaps.	align (company);failure;information governance;information security	William LIdster;Shawon S.

A model incorporating Habermasian validity claims is employed to evaluate an urban planning meeting (including the use of the Groupsystems software tool) and meeting follow-up. Support is found for four propositions, all of which focus on the degree to which the application of the model unlocks practical value. The paper concludes with a discussion of the nature of the knowledge discovered in GSS-enabled interventions and the potential for a Habermasian analysis of the knowledge discovered in other collaboration systems and technologies.	programming tool	Jim Sheffield	2005	Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2005.594	gold;application software;strategic planning;gold standard;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;software engineering;urban planning;management science;software testing	SE	-90.02466090205812	0.5523156708811703	60551

It also makes a comparison that how case organizations think about quality and TQM along with its applicability within public sector. The study can be categorized as qualitative research. The data is collected from semi structural interviews of the informants and the concerning documents, which consist of strategy, policy papers and audit reports of the case organizations. Altogether there are two case organizations. Furthermore, data is analyzed with the help of content analysis. Most vital issues in TQM practices are its comprehensiveness, and its application in such a way which is appropriate for the organization, with a logical way of operation and the participation of management and personnel. Training, guidance, teamwork, involvement and learning are imperative for achieving a continuous improvement culture and are vital elements when adopting TQM. Managers should learn from the experience of TQM implementers by studying expected challenges and pitfalls. They should also pay more attention to the crucial role of all stakeholders in the TQM implementation. The study could be quite valuable from a strategic perspective in providing guidelines to build up a proper plan for TQM practices more promptly. The paper also manages to shed light on TQM practices of public service organizations by comparing their current approaches to quality.

E-government is becoming an important topic and is attracting more and more research. Its adoption is determined by many factors among which user's familiarity is not a well researched one. Without a real longitudinal research, familiarity cannot be investigated. To explore the influence of e-government familiarity, we utilized two samples with two different objectives. The first sample utilized 241 responses to understand the relative awareness of 20 concepts that are known to belong to e-government topic. The second sample included a two stage method, with an extended survey. A survey including the 20 concepts and an additional 14 items measured four constructs: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, privacy and security assurance, and trust in e-government. The second survey was distributed to a class of 50 students at the start of an e-government course and at the end of it.Results of the first survey indicated high levels of awareness in regard to service provision, time and location, and necessity of information needed. Dimensions like digital divide (gender and accessibility) and social change were among the highly recognized topics. On the other hand, e-participation and political concepts of e-government were moderately perceived by the sample. Results of the second sample indicated a significant influence of familiarity with e-government (gained from the course content) on 14 items out of the 20 used. Also, perceived usefulness and privacy and security assurance were significant predictors of trust in e-government. Finally, all item means increased in the second stage except for one item only. Governments need to raise awareness regarding e-government initiatives and improve citizens' familiarity with the topic.	e-government	Emad Abu-Shanab	2017	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2016.05.001	public relations;repeated measures design;e-government;computer science;marketing;dynamic program analysis;trustworthy computing;social psychology;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-88.99329144784947	-9.809656533099256	61130

In this study we develop a model for measuring the chain digitisation maturity of organisations and validate it by conducting a survey among 33 CIOs. In addition, one of the responses is further investigated through a case study. Based on the survey data, three determinants, namely (i) complexity of chain digitisation solutions, (ii) synchronisation of data and (iii) the size of the organisation, appear to be correlated with chain digitisation maturity. This is confirmed by the case study, which also provides a deeper understanding of alignment of technology and organisation on the one hand, and the supply and demand chain partners on the other. We conclude that the topic of chain digitisation alignment deserves further research, as does its situationality for profit and non-profit organisations.	capability maturity model;chief information officer;information system	Marijn G.

BI systems are the IT-based systems that have the greatest impact on organizational strategy. Unfortunately, BI projects are subject to high failure rates and those that are implemented suffer from a utilization problem where only 10 to 20% of intended users actually use the systems. Most decision support systems (DSS) and BI research and practice treats managers as a homogenous group, but management research reports differences between senior executives and other levels of management, and individual differences between managers. This is a significantly more complex development environment than that assumed by current DSS and BI research. There are no specialist methods for analyzing the decision support requirements of senior executives. This paper discusses the rationale and design of a research project that uses a design-science strategy that aims to develop and test such a method. The method will be based on a sound understanding of senior executive information behaviors.	chief information officer;decision support system;design rationale;report;requirement;strategic management	David Arnott	2010		10.3233/978-1-60750-577-8-37	executive information system;decision support system;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;data mining;management science;management	HCI	-82.03700499976037	1.5130949658825936	61317

Client/server technology implementation is used as the leading case, given the fact that it is a good example of a major paradigm shift. The results draw attention to the importance of end-user interaction and the maturity level of organizations as significant factors in the success and benefits of the project. Client/server projects seem to be more successful, are executed in a more timely manner, and yield greater benefits when end users take an active participation in some of the stages, particularly during the implementation phase.

It is reported that many MIS fail t o meet either their stated objectives or management's rea l needs. Accounting information and control systems, certainly according to several researchers and many line managers , are no exception. Reasons for such disappointmen t generally center on the MIS design process, for exampl e lack of top management support (McKinsey, 1968), inadequate management involvement (Diebold, 1969), poo r management of the design process (Alloway, 1977) or inattention to design decisions (Kriebel & Van Home, 1971). Promising frameworks and principles have been developed to counteract these failures, for example Ackoff' s (1967) design procedures to avoid management misinfor-mation systems, Gorry & Scott-Morton ' s (1971) decision-oriented framework or more recently Mintzberg's (1975) eight principles to overcome impediments to managemen t information use. However such """" principles"""" are not yet fully validated and are often difficult to put into operation. Consequently, conventional wisdoms based on intuitiv e good reason continue to gain momentum. Thus, the practical literature of MIS in general, and accounting in particular , is replete with exhortations to make systems understandable , to involve managers, to simplify systems, t o educate users, to devise foolproof procedures and so on , each perhaps relevant, but still seemingly elusive. Argyris (1977) has recently suggested why these conventional wisdoms may be inadequate. In his work on organizational learning, he finds the majority of learning done in a n organization is single-loop, namely the identification an d correction of errors so that the job gets done and action remains within stated policy guidelines. As long as objectives , competences and loyalties are not questioned, thi s single-loop learning occurs. However, many of the accepte d """"principles """" of MIS design depend on such questions bein g raised, discussed and resolved—double-loop learning — which Argyris finds most organizational behavior inhibits ."""	control system;information and computation;management information system;organizational behavior;prototype;resources, events, agents (accounting model)	Michael J.

Currently, many countries are investing heavily in policy-making process development through the ICT for this purpose. In the policy cycle, there are many opportunities in which a scientific method can be effectively applied especially in the agenda setting. In the phase, it is important to visualize a cognitive structure in a citizen. We focus on the evaluation grid method to figure out the citizen's requirement. Once we construct the cognitive structure represented by a graph in which nodes and arcs are represented as constructs and relationships between them, respectively, we can develop a predictive cognitive model which will be useful in the agenda setting. For this purpose we employ multivariate visualization techniques which can figure out meaningful relationships in the cognitive model.	cognitive model	Koji Koyamada;Nobuyuki Kukimoto	2014	2014 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium	10.1109/PacificVis.2014.62	computer science;data science;data mining;management science	Visualization	-79.04021194087449	-4.812706921485504	61602

Main pillars in the new vision are an intensive use of IT (Customs becomes eCustoms), partnerships between Customs administrations and businesses (G2B), and collaboration between national Customs administrations (G2G). But how to design new customs control procedures? Very little theory exists, and an inspection of current procedures shows that they are vulnerable to fraud, and thus badly designed. Therefore we identify a need for developing theory for the design of government control procedures. Some research has been done on designing inter-organizational controls in B2B transactions. In this paper we argue that with certain modifications control principles used in B2B are also suitable for the Government-to-Business context, and we present a conceptual model for designing government controls in G2B, based on earlier work of Bons. We use a study on customs procedures for the export of agricultural goods from the EU to Russia as a proof of concept.	e-governance;e-government	Ziv Baida;Jianwei Liu;Yao-Hua Tan	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74444-3_6	economics;computer science;artificial intelligence;conceptual model;operations management;management science;public administration;management;law;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-79.8172928829887	-2.2739472599718047	61609

However, current technology can affect not only how we communicate but also what we communicate. As a result, the issue for designers of communication support systems has become broader: how should technology be designed to make communication more effective by changing the medium and the attributes of the message itself? The answer to this question requires a shift from current preoccupations with the medium of communication to a view that assesses the balance between medium and message form. There is also a need to look more closely at the process of communication in order to identify more precisely any potential areas of computer support.#R##N##R##N#This paper provides the spadework for a new model of organizational communication, and uses it to review existing research, as well as to suggest directions for future research and development. Beginning with the crucial aspects of action, relationship, and choice, an integrated model of how people communicate is developed. This model incorporates three basic factors: (1) inputs to the communication process (task, sender-receiver distance, and values and norms of communication with a particular emphasis on inter-cultural communication); (2) a cognitive-affective process of communication; and (3) the communication impact on action and relationship. The glue that bonds these factors together is a set of communication strategies aimed at reducing the complexity of communication.#R##N##R##N#The model provides a balance between relationship and action, between cognition and affect, and between message and medium. Such a balance has been lacking in previous work, and we believe it reflects a more realistic picture of communication behavior in organizations. A set of propositions generated from the model sets an agenda for studying the communication process as well as its inputs and outputs. Furthermore, this knowledge of the mechanisms that guide behavior is used to demonstrate the potential for developing design principles for future communication support systems.

E-service process presentations may facilitate customer learning; however, no scientific investigation has attempted to explore the effectiveness of such presentations in customer education and e-service adoption. Thus, this study intends to fill the research gap by investigating how e-service process presentations influence customer readiness and trial intention. Based on the stimulus-organism-response framework, we develop a theoretical model and propose customers’ perceptions of readiness as the antecedents for trial intention. By applying the cognitive load theory, the effects of different presentation formats on customer readiness are hypothesized. The contingent effect caused by customers’ levels of expertise is also studied. An experiment will be conducted to test the hypotheses. This study is expected to have both theoretical and practical implications.	contingency (philosophy);e-services;experiment;theory	Hao Li;Jinhu Jiang	2014			public relations;knowledge management;marketing;diffusion;customer intelligence;customer advocacy	HCI	-84.17523572690881	-1.2530433180367226	61771

These relationships were tested simultaneously using structural equation modeling analyses. A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted among 320 information technology (IT) consultants in Sweden. Data were collected at two time points, over a six-month follow-up period. Cross-sectional studies have been presented earlier but one of the contributions of this study is that it is a two-wave data set. The present two-wave study uses a model which covers more information than a cross-sectional design and the results add another aspect to existing work motivation and stress research, by using a longitudinal data set, and relating job characteristics to perceived stress directly and indirect. These findings emphasize the importance of job demand and illuminate the role of motivators in the experience of job stress among IT consultants. The presented model can be used to examine potential causes of job stress among IT consultants and may generate important lessons for managing the general workforce of tomorrow.

In a recent paper, Oldham and Hackman (2010) [co-inventors of the Job Characteristics Model that is presented in Hackman & Oldham, 1980)] explain that when they did the research on job design, the organizational work was generally organized as a linked set of specific jobs. These jobs were analyzed, defined and performed by individuals who worked mostly independently of one another. Moreover, Oldham and Hackman remark that nowadays there are fundamental changes in the relationships among people at work. Today, individuals may work in temporary teams whose membership changes as work requirements change and/or they may work in projects in which other members come from different organizations – for example, suppliers and clients. Oldham and Hackman give many examples of “new factors” in the “new” work environment that have existed for several years in the IT consultants’ work environment. In the IT consultancy sector, where very high work commitment and high performance are expected, working time is non-regulated and is often more than 50-60 hours a week (Alvesson & Robertson, 2006). According to Caplen Jensen, Netterström, and Borg (2003) their daily work is characterized by projects with strict deadlines where there is often no time for important recovery since projects overlap – it is not unusual that a new task starts before the last one is completed. Adding to the pressure is the requirement that the relationship to the customer must remain strong, and therefore the IT consultant must also nurture the customer relationship in order to acquire future business (Maister, 1997). JOB CHARACTERISTICS AND STRESS The concept of “psychosocial work environment” is widely associated with health in the workplace, and numerous studies have established associations between psychosocial factors at work and (poor) health. According to Cox, Griffiths, and Rial-Gonzales (2000), one such factor is stress, which is a negative psychological condition that originates in the dynamic interaction between the individual and his/her work environment. Job stress is a major issue among employees in advanced industrial societies and is recognized as a major health challenge, both for employees and for employers (International Labour Organization, 1986, 1992). Although there was a decrease in work-related disorders (both physical and mental) from 2003 to 2010 in Sweden, approximately 16% of the knowledge workers in Sweden reported stress and other types of mental strain during the last 12 months measured (Swedish Work Environment Authority, 2010). Stress often results from high job demands in relation to the worker’s abilities, frustrated aspirations and dissatisfaction with valued goals (Kalimo & Mejman, 1987). A basic hypothesis in stress theory is that psychosocial stressors in the work environment, such as quantitative overload, qualitative underload, lack of control and lack of social support, and the interaction of such conditions, may have harmful effects on an individual’s health and wellbeing (Karasek & Theorell, 1990; Levi, Frankenhaeuser, & Gardell, 1986; Melin & Lundberg, 1997). Those effects may be specific to an industry, and they may be considerable in certain occupational groups, such as assembly line workers and service workers (Karasek & Theorell, 1990). However, there is little knowledge about these effects in the knowledge-worker industry, such as information technology (IT). A number of research studies have been conducted on workplace burnout. One study shows that burnout consists of several core dimensions including emotional exhaustion and cynicism (disengagement) (Bakker, Demerouti, & Verbeke, 2004). Another study argues that burnout may be averted on several levels – individual, organizational and societal (Hansen, Sverke, & Näswall, 2009). Different job demands can result in many different stress reactions. However, according to Le Blanc et al.

We show how the platform emerged from existing practices, the features and expectations of the system, and the ways in which it was used. Common failure points include infrastructural limitations, human error, and unexpected use cases. We find that 1) the use of SMS as a media enables new types of communication, and 2) SMS alone is not sufficient for maintaining relationships within the NGO program.	ecosystem;human error;interaction;software deployment;the 100;usability	Melissa Densmore	2012		10.1145/2212776.2212816	computer science;operating system;sms banking;internet privacy;world wide web;computer security;short message service	HCI	-81.17540706659705	-9.607080568271021	61890

0a86cec0ad1cdd53a97cbb1658f59dddbbb83ee6	deconstructing the sme spectrum from a knowledge management perspective: proposing an adapted seci model		The term SME [Small to Medium Enterprise] is used extensively, both by practitioners and by academics. However, while both argue the importance of research relevant to SMEs few follow the same definition of the term. The lack of agreement has fostered inconsistency, as within the definition of SME, multiple heterogeneous subcategories exist and research specific to each of those subcategories has not yet received serious academic attention. SME-specific research is essential, as they are not simply scaled-down versions of their larger counterparts; neither are businesses belonging to the SME category identical in terms of their characteristics and reactions. To ensure survival and continual advancement in modern environments, innovation, resourcefulness and particularly, knowledge play a crucial role in long-term success. Thus, deconstructing the differences that exist within the broad range of business categories within the SME spectrum, and how those differences impact knowledge management, offers valuable insights. This article argues that the differences between small (50 employees or less) and medium (250 employees or less) businesses are correlated with the inconsistencies in the literature, and proposes an adapted SECI model to view SME knowledge management in a new light.	knowledge management	Shohil Kishore;David Sundaram	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-94421-0_8	business;knowledge management	AI	-78.45605447614767	0.33322725483870286	62620

Understanding how specific sociotechnical affordances of VOs can enhance effectiveness in new and distinctive ways will improve our understanding of virtual organizations, and of computer-mediated human activity. We analyze and synthesize relatively fragmented existing research to develop a schematic success model for virtual organization effectiveness. We suggest that this research could progress through developing and validating a pattern language for virtual organizations, which we illustrate, drawing from ongoing fieldwork.	field research;pattern language;pervasive informatics;schematic;social affordance;sociotechnical system;virtual organization (grid computing)	John M.

While increasing incidents of information security breaches have generated extensive publicity, previous studies repeatedly expose low levels of managerial awareness and commitment, a key obstacle to achieving a good information security posture. The main motivation of our study emanates from this phenomenon that the increased vulnerability to information security breaches is coupled with the low level of managerial awareness and commitment regarding information security threats. We report this dissonance by addressing a cognitive bias called optimistic bias. Using a survey, we study if MIS executives are subject to such a bias in their vulnerability perceptions of information security. We find that they demonstrate optimistic bias in risk perception on information security domain. The extent of this optimistic bias is greater with a distant comparison target with fewer information sharing activities. This optimistic bias is also found to be related to perception of controllability with information security threats. In order to overcome the effects of optimistic bias, firms need more security awareness training and systematic treatments of security threats instead of relying on ad hoc approach to security measure implementation. a 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

af4a8b30ea8c06f8009e6469bfde6df30070d59d	the inhibitors and enablers of maintenance and manufacturing strategy: a cross-case analysis	software engineering	This paper concerns the findings from case studies carried out at four North East of England manufacturing plants. The research was part of a wider investigation into the ‘‘linkage between maintenance and manufacturing strategies and the effects on manufacturing performance’’. The initial study began with a comprehensive literature review, which confirmed a dearth of models and frameworks surrounding the topic. To close this gap, a new conceptual model was developed. This defined the configuration and the key processes and linkages involved. Based on the model, a new diagnostic tool and questionnaire evolved. These were used to measure the status of maintenance and manufacturing strategies at the manufacturing sites. The research produced large quantities of rich data via semi-structured interviews and these were analysed and coded. This generated the information necessary to complete a questionnaire and diagnostic footprint for each site. Importantly, the analysis of the data identified a number of specific inhibitors and enablers to strategic success and these are discussed in detail. A cross-case analysis of the data is also presented, offering five generic recommendations for practitioners to consider.	linkage (software);mathematical induction;semiconductor industry;succession;synergy	Kenneth Robson;Robert Trimble;John MacIntyre	2014	Int.

Inclusion of guidelines and prototyping practices that take into consideration the capabilities of human users make it possible to avoid errors that would otherwise significantly reduce efficiencies offered by Information Technology (IT). Design strategies that include consideration of the Human Factor (HF) within e-PIS are introduced and discussed. Argued is that without integration of design strategies that consider human capabilities the efficiencies brought about through the use of IT are significantly reduced. Through the study of intended user behaviours during the development of systems loss of efficiency is avoided.	human factors and ergonomics;information system	Karl W.

We examine how prior research has incorporated context in theorizing and develop a framework to classify existing approaches to contextualization. In addition, we expound on a decomposition approach to contextualization and put forth a set of guidelines for developing context-specific models. We illustrate the application of the guidelines by constructing and comparing various context-specific variations of the technology acceptance model TAM---i.e., the decomposed TAM that incorporates interaction effects between context-specific factors, the extended TAM with context-specific antecedents, and the integrated TAM that incorporates mediated moderation and moderated mediation effects of context-specific factors. We tested the models on 972 individuals in two technology usage contexts: a digital library and an agile Web portal. The results show that the decomposed TAM provides a better understanding of the contexts by revealing the direct and interaction effects of context-specific factors on behavioral intention that are not mediated by the TAM constructs of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. This work contributes to the ongoing discussion about the importance of context in theory development and provides guidance for context-specific theorizing in IS research.	information systems research	Weiyin Hong;Frank K.

A three round Delphi questionnaire was used. The results of this study are compared with a previous study of generic attributes conducted by the authors in Queensland, Australia. Differences between academics and industry are identified. The top three attributes in each study are the same, although the order is reversed in the national study. Some of these include the higher ranking of interpersonal skills, teamwork, and knowledge of the IS discipline by academics compared with the higher ranking of industry of self-motivation and the ability to learn independently. Other major findings include the high ratings of the attributes of team participation and the commitment to further learning and intellectual development. Oral and written communications are significantly rated as more important than a comprehensive knowledge of IS. This study has a very strong overall correlation with the previous Queensland study.	information systems;piaget's theory of cognitive development	Robert Snoke;Alan Underwood	2000	JGIM	10.4018/jgim.2001040104	public relations;economics;marketing;public sector;management;law;economic growth;information system;private sector	HCI	-84.60863370332847	0.9663015381699449	63102

Design/methodology/approach – The results were based on a survey completed by 185 travel agencies with less than 50 employees, covering over 5 per cent of the SME travel agencies in Spain. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the links between the studied dimensions. Findings – The findings indicate that QMPs have a positive, direct influence on the adoption of AMIS and that the adoption of AMIS has a positive, direct impact on financial performance. The results suggest that quality policies facilitate greater use of financial indicators but not in the use of non-financial indicators, where the key to better business performance lies. Originality/value – Therefore, the results of this paper indicate that being proactive about quality practices can provide travel agencies a great number of benefits through the implementation of AMIS.	management information system;structural equation modeling	Jordi Perramon;Llorenç Bagur-Femenias;Oriol Amat	2015	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/IMDS-04-2015-0133	public relations;economics;marketing;operations management;management;information system	HCI	-83.13270039509874	3.7922898408949983	63132

If we can manage the inter-cultural communication apprehension properly, we may be able to bring organizations of different cultures together for successful completion of EC collaborative works. This paper summarizes previous works on intercultural communication apprehension and identifies three potential factors that could influence inter-cultural communication apprehension: cultural climate, technology environment and communication leadership. Also, this paper proposes a research framework and several hypotheses for future testing.	e-commerce;robertson–seymour theorem	Ron Chi-Wai Kwok;Matthew K. O.

Considering the “hub and spoke” morphology, the author argues that KT is deeply affected by both the firms' contractual power and their positions within the district. Explicit KT is mainly linked to development of production processes; in contrast, tacit KT depends primarily on the actions of people working in the district. Human capital plays an important role in transferring knowledge through imitation, work mobility and social interaction.Design/methodology/approach – The authors adopt an empirical approach in which they describe and analyse the principle characteristics of the Val d'Agri relational structure, with identification of the main issues that impact...

In the literature on engineers’ information-seeking practices the generally agreed-upon explanation of this preference for close-by, internal information sources is that engineers follow a principle of least effort by choosing their information sources on the basis of ease of access rather than quality of contents. This study argues that engineers’ preference for internal sources such as their colleagues is just as much a preference for sources with a known or easily determinable trustworthiness as it is a preference for information that is easily accessible. Trust is of central importance because quality is a perceived property and, thus, assessing the quality of an information source is essentially a matter of establishing to what extent one is willing to place trust in it. This can be done with greater ease and precision for familiar sources. A field study of the meetings in a software design project shows that in discussing and selecting information sources the software engineers devote significantly more attention to quality-related factors than to cost-related factors. It is also normal conversational practice at the meetings to accompany the mentioning of information sources that may be unknown to some project participants by information that puts them in context. Systems for managing knowledge and sharing expertise must recognise these rich means of forming a perception of the credibility of individual pieces of information.	field research;information source;software design;software engineer;trust (emotion)	Morten Hertzum	2002	Information and Organization	10.1016/S1471-7727(01)00007-0	public relations;computer science;engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;software design;management science;trustworthy computing;management;field research	SE	-89.40284155724413	0.8222951459953332	63281
4ad2dba62dd77bdc48ac422d257a876462bc6c43	a location-based service to support collaboration and strategic control in a real estate broker		Increasingly more companies support their strategies and value propositions offering their clients some services that require physical mobility and teamwork by their staff. This article proposes a type of Location-based Services system called Geomanagement, which supports the fulfilment of business strategy for a real estate broker agency, based on mobility and collaborative work of their employees. Geomanagement application acts as a valuable support to explore real estate and potential client information in each showing appointment, to share information among realtors and to help new and old realtors in developing teamwork skills while they are in movement. Clients also value the great contribution of Geomanagement regarding the collaboration between realtors. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of Geomanagement by generating value in, an uncommon scenario, as is a real state broker agency. We show that the implementation of Geomanagement increases both collaboration among realtors, and strategic control of managers and heads. Strengthening the link between collaboration and management control systems supported by Geomanagement, turned out to be crucial in business strategy follow-up and monitoring.	location-based service	Christian A.

In recent years, a number of initiatives across the world have applied crowdsourcing to contexts including constitutional reform, drafting federal bills, and generating local policies. However, crowd-civic systems also come with challenges and risks such as socio-technical barriers, marginalization of specific groups, silencing of interests, etc. Using a design-thinking approach, this workshop will address both opportunities and challenges of crowd-civic systems to develop best practices for increasing public engagement with law and policy. The workshop organizers will suggest an initial framework explicitly intended to be criticized by participants and reconfigured through a series of iterative cooperative small-group activities focusing on ``diagnosing'' the failures of past crowd-civic system efforts and the successes of online action around social issues. While the ultimate objective of the workshop is to develop a best practices guide, we see iterations on the guide as a mechanism for fostering community and collaboration among policymakers, technologists, and researchers around crowd-civic systems for law and policy.	best practice;bridging (networking);crowdsourcing;iteration;sociotechnical system	Brian James McInnis;Alissa Centivany;Juho Kim;Marta Poblet;Karen Levy;Gilly Leshed	2017		10.1145/3022198.3022656	social science;computer science;management science;management;social psychology;law;world wide web;crowdsourcing;best practice	HCI	-79.70597591548828	-6.830116010948319	63565

This is part of an ICT-for-de velopment project located in a rural area on the Wild Coast of South Africa. Thus far, five schools in the area have been the primary points of access to the netwo rk for the surrounding communities. Thanks to external funding, eleven mor e schools will be connected. Consistent with the Living Lab approach, the expansion needs to take into account technical as well as social aspec t . Technical challenges relate mainly to the constraints of working in a rugged, m ountainous terrain with poor road and electricity infrastructure and harsh envir onmental conditions such as dust and temperature variances. Social challenges r elate to obtaining the buy-in of the local community and to reaching consensus on the criteria for the expansion. In this paper we account for the prelimi nary work which led to the implementation plan. We hope our experience will in form similar interventions in other parts of Africa.	ace;co-ment;computer cluster;ext js javascript framework;holism;interdependence;living lab;rugged computer;software deployment;telecommuting	Lorenzo Dalvit;Ingrid Siebörger;Hannah Thinyane	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-29093-0_22	geography;environmental protection;environmental resource management	HCI	-79.26420077416704	-8.698864707204544	63776

To gain new insights, this paper presents an approach of change and of culture based on the theory of the strategic actor of Crozier and Friedberg (1977). In this view, how and to what extent middle managers promote IT in the workplace is assimilated into a strategy of actors motivated by their interests and having to take into account the constraints they face, opportunities, and their capacity. An approach around the notion of “cultural tools” and “cultural capacity” is suggested in order to take into account cultural heterogeneity and organizational change. We suggest a multiple cases design qualitative methodology in one large organization in order to conduct this study.	diversification (finance);organizational behavior;stereo realist	Christophe M.

31269c884c62540f29fd0147a9b28d9604258ff1	a typology of different forms of business process standardisation (bps)		Organisations are increasingly adopting a process-centric view in order to compete and thrive. Business Process Standardisation (BPS) is a strategy for improved efficiency and effectiveness of business processes. BPS approaches are known to vary in practice, but are ill-understood. Through inductive content analysis of 18 published BPS case studies we identify three key decisions of the BPS approach: (i) Origin of standardisation (de facto or de jure), (ii) Optimisation of the master process (yes or no), and (iii) Choice of master process (internal exemplar, internal best-of-breed, or external exemplar) thus yielding twelve (2 × 2 × 3) alternative BPS types. This typology can serve as a useful tool for researchers investigating the BPS concept and may provide insight for practitioners when selecting an appropriate form of BPS. Further development, extension, and evaluation of the typology are suggested as future research.	biological anthropology;business process	Kanika Goel;Wasana Bandara;Guy G.

Using data from a survey of 379 companies concerning electronic data interchange (EDI), significant differences are found in the evaluation of successful implementations. The overall evaluation of success is increased (or decreased) depending upon alternative versions of question order. In addition, the analyses show that the main effects from question order interact in different ways with respondent characteristics, including functional area, educational background and being a systems user. The bias tends to be consistent for some types of respondents, such as systems users. However, other classes of respondents, especially persons with professional backgrounds in systems or MIS, are influenced in more complex ways by question order. The order in which queries regarding systems output and quality occur tends to be especially important in anchoring subsequent responses and overall assessments. The final section addresses corrective actions and future research.	information systems research;management information system;systems theory	Donald H. Drury;Ali F. Farhoomand	1997	Inf. Syst.

A key to understanding the success or failure of BI within an organization, termed as BI Effectiveness, is the identification and assessment of BI Capabilities and their constituent dimensions. Using this theoretical foundation, we develop a conceptual framework that identifies four BI Capabilities, comprising of eleven dimensions, and offer three propositions that illustrate their effect on BI Effectiveness. To facilitate empirical research, we develop and cross-validate a questionnaire instrument to measure these new constructs, which can serve as a diagnostic tool through which organizations can assess the effectiveness of their BI initiatives. We thus provide a definitional and empirical context for assessing key BI Capabilities that directly impact an organization's effectiveness at BI implementation and use.	conceptual schema;definition	Thiagarajan Ramakrishnan;Jiban Khuntia;Abhishek Kathuria;Terence Saldanha	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.623	computer science;organization;knowledge management;management science;management;collaboration	SE	-81.04010257072828	3.2818457758549613	64360

A number of studies have suggested a variety of competency models, including a list of required competencies for use by organizations that wish to enrich their employees’ competencies. However, all these required competencies do not necessarily share the same importance. To effectively implement competency development, it is desirable to distinguish the differences of perceived competency levels between high-performers and others. In doing so, a large number of required competencies can be reduced into a compact set that focuses on significant competencies of high-performers. To this end, this paper proposes a method based on the rough set theory to explore high-performers’ required competencies. An empirical study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed method. Based on our findings, conclusions and implications for management are presented. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Our training focuses on avoiding technical failures, but unfortunately our systems sometimes have unintended consequences. We need to develop products to avoid unintended negative impacts on society, people, and the environment. Professional responsibility requires that we identify the morally salient features of a situation. Some issues are relatively easy to spot; for example, we shouldn't lie to clients, we shouldn't bribe inspectors, and we should respect people's privacy. But some ethical and social risks are harder to recognize. Even developers with the best intentions have walked into ethical traps. When we study technical problems, we apply the project's constraints and priorities to find acceptable possible solutions and choose among them. Here are four suggestions for considering ethical constraints during that process, they are: look for human values in technical decision; identifying who will be affected; examining how stakeholders' right and obligation will be affectedl; and reviewing relevant professional standards to help identify issues.	privacy;software engineer;unintended consequences;value (ethics)	Donald Gotterbarn;Keith W.

This work presents a methodology for the design and selection of public policies based on the cognitive democratic model known as e-Cognocracy. In addition to facilitating debate between representatives and the represented (deliberative democracy), this model allows for co-decision making between citizens and politicians. Furthermore, and of even greater importance, e-Cognocracy generates a process of continuing education that is concordant to the lifelong process of living systems (cognitive process). The methodology contemplates multiple rounds (usually two) when incorporating the preferences of the actors implicated in decision making and takes advantage of the creative capacity of human beings when solving complex problems. At the same time, the methodology permits the evaluation of both the individual and social learning that is derived from the scientific resolution of the problem and the democratisation of the knowledge that is extracted. This methodology was applied to a real-life experience in the Spanish municipality of Cadrete.

A keyword dictionary is valuable in that it helps to integrate fragmented accumulated knowledge with generalized knowledge. However, this necessitates a method that allows for coauthoring, and Wiki, BBS and other existing tools are still insufficient in this respect. As well as offering a method for expanding BBS, this paper shows a method for assessing use within an actual corporation.	dictionary	Shinji Takao;Tadashi Iijima;Akito Sakurai	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02559-4_10	engineering;knowledge management;data mining;world wide web	NLP	-90.86352594728777	1.5356070228405148	65132

This paper examines the relationship between the factors, and the different strategies that may be needed in order to provide an adequate foundation for users' trust. The discussion begins by recognising that users often lack confidence that sufficient security and privacy safeguards can be delivered from a technology perspective, and therefore require more than a simple assurance that they are protected. One contribution in this respect is the provision of a Trust Evaluation Function, which supports the user in reaching more informed decisions about the safeguards provided in different contexts. Even then, however, some users will not be satisfied with technology-based assurances, and the paper consequently considers the extent to which risk mitigation can be offered via routes, such as insurance. The discussion concludes by highlighting a series of further open issues that also require attention in order for trust to be more firmly and widely established.

Three types of misalignments between packaged ES and Chinese context are identified, including (1) package-context misalignment in terms of software application, (2) package-context misalignment in terms of organizational management model, and (3) package-context misalignment in terms of organizational IT maturity. Based on (Soh and Sia 2004)s ERP package-organization misalignment source framework, the researcher identified two group of contextual variables which direct or indirect results in these misalignments in Chinese context: (1)institutionally imposed contextual variables and (2) voluntarily acquired contextual variables. Based on these findings, the conceptual paper argues that, for the discussion of dealing with the package-context misalignment in Chinese business context, it is necessary to consider the context source which causes the misalignment, and then appropriate strategy can be confidently chosen to tackle with system misfit problem.	capability maturity model;erp;enterprise system;service in informatics and analysis	Lan Cao	2010			marketing;operations management;advertising;china	AI	-81.33923381768547	3.9680295042237312	65650

These variations enable the exploration of the role of agent capabilities, and the way in which agent capability and coordination interact to effect performance. Both micro and macro organizational behavior are examined. Results suggest that simpler models of agents are needed at macro levels and more detailed, more cognitively accurate models are needed at micro or small group levels, to generate the same predictive accuracy.	cognition;computer simulation;organizational behavior	Kathleen M.

This paper proposes that embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are particularly well suited to automate and augment accounting interviews to save costs, streamline the interviewing process, and maintain quality. An ECA is an autonomous computer interface capable of human-like interactions such as interviews. This paper describes how an ECA can be used to augment accounting-related interviews and the advantages and disadvantages of doing so. This paper also presents the ECA Self-Disclosure Model with propositions of how self-disclosure can be influenced by an ECA through reciprocal behavior and rapport building. The model and propositions are supported by the computers-as-social-actors (CASA) paradigm (Reeves and Nass 1996).

Over two hundred published research papers in this space have been subjected to content analysis using NVivo qualitative analysis tool. The results reveal that there are three major types of responsibilities namely social responsibilities, environmental responsibilities and the role based responsibilities which the organizations have in terms of ensuring corporate sustainability. These responsibilities have been found to be effectively achieved through effective corporate sustainability reporting practices, policy level concerns backed by values and principles, coordination of consumer inputs, ensuring stakeholder understanding about their roles and responsibilities and effective risk management backed by proper definition of roles and responsibilities. A number of conclusions along with implications for practice have been derived as the outcome of the documented research.

e4ca62eded2f1c68d8c2cb6b5e552bb3716350e7	conceptualizing consumer perceptions of making m-payments using smart phones in ireland		Consumer adoption of smart phones is growing globally at an exponential rate presenting significant commercial opportunities for all organizations. The percentage of the population using mobile phones in Ireland is the largest in Europe, with market revenue of i2 billion in 2009, and 117.3 percent penetration. However, the commercial growth potential of smart phones is being hindered by an industry failure to adopt an accepted m-payment model to facilitate the widespread adoption of m-payments. Furthermore, previous research has shown there is a lack of a willingness among consumers to make m-payments. However, little is known about consumers= perceptions of m-payments using a smart phone or what factors impact upon these perceptions. In response, this paper develops a theoretical smart phone m-payment model, and applies it using an online survey, to explore Irish consumers= perceptions of making an m-payments for products/ services using their smart phones. The empirical findings of the developed PLS model, illustrate that respondents display a strong willingness to transact using m-commerce but trust is the key factor in explaining consumer=s willingness to make an m-payment for products/ services using their smart phones. Another significant finding for m-payment companies is that respondents considered using a secure and trusted third-party payment company as the preferred method of making an m-payment for products/ services. Significant levels of concern regarding perceived privacy control, together with the authority and independence of regulatory bodies and the robustness of the legislative frameworks governing m-commerce, were also very evident from the empirical	emoticon;mobile commerce;mobile phone;security through obscurity;time complexity;trusted third party	Pavel Andreev;Aidan Maurice Duane;Philip O'Reilly	2011			environmental resource management;marketing;advertising;business	HCI	-88.1750991798567	-8.874782006776284	66281

Large software firms are changing their business models to incorporate OSS for long term success. As a result of greater organizational involvement in OSS, there is an increased prevalence of reward options for OSS developers. However, introducing compensation/rewards to these ideologically motivated communities may threaten their sustainability. We don’t know the nature and type of rewards that would be acceptable in OSS developer community. Using grounded theory methodology, we extracted the concepts regarding developers’ perception of rewards in OSS community and how developers prefer to be compensated. This paper contributes to the literature of open source software development by (1) providing in depth examination of the developers’ intention to work on the OSS project if compensated (2) providing an initial theory for understanding when compensation helps an OSS project and when it hinders.	emergence;information systems;open sound system;open-source software;software developer;software development;software industry	Arzoo Atiq;Arvind Tripathi	2014			social science;computer science;distributed computing;grounded theory;world wide web	SE	-82.03327607444606	1.5649849384211116	66321

This paper hence examines the problem of ex-ante information system evaluation, and aims at assessing the impact of IT on the information management process underlying clinical trials. Design/methodology/approach - Combining UML and system dynamics modeling, a simulation model for evaluating IT was developed. This modeling effort relies on a case study conducted in a clinical research organization, which, at that time, faced an IT investment dilemma. Findings - Some illustrative results of sensitivity analyzes conducted on error rates in clinical data transmission are presented. These simulation results allow for quantifying the impact of different IT options on human resources' efforts, time delays and costs of clinical trials projects. Notably, the results show that although the technology has no real influence on the duration of a clinical trial project, it impacts the number of projects that can be carried out simultaneously. Originality/value - The research provides insights into the development of an innovative approach appropriate to the evaluation of IT supporting clinical trials, through the use of a mixed-method based on qualitative and quantitative modeling. The results illustrate two critical issues addressed in the IS literature: (1) the necessity to extend IT evaluation beyond the quantitative-qualitative dichotomy, (2) the role of evaluation in organizational learning, and in learning about business dimensions.	simulation	Céline Bérard;L.

It takes a look at education challenges faced by African youth and the gaps that exist in the education systems. African youth have the potential to be frontrunners in socio-economic transformation in the continent. They need to be empowered to be able to play their part. The huge gaps between education policy and practice, and other problems in this sector leave many African youth out of the system. Information and communication technology (ICT) is being integrated in education in many African countries. The emphasis has been on equipping schools with computers and literacy of the same. However the progress and impact is minimal due to inadequate resources, infrastructural challenges and lack of capacity. Mobile phone penetration in the continent has increased phenomenally unlike ownership of personal computers. This paper therefore proposes m-learning using mobile phones as a logical and viable channel of delivering education to African youth.	mobile phone;personal computer	Mokeira Masita-Mwangi;Nancy Mwakaba;Faith Ronoh-Boreh;Jussi Impio	2012		10.1145/2212776.2212827	education policy;education;information and communications technology;simulation;management	HCI	-79.75066960969734	-9.536695014285348	66432

This study explored the underlying behavioral context of information security in the workplace, exploring how individual and organizational factors influence the interplay of the motivations and barriers of security behaviors. Investigating factors that had previously been explored in security research, 20 employees from two organizations were interviewed and the data was analyzed using framework analysis. The analysis indicated that there were seven themes pertinent to information security: Response Evaluation, Threat Evaluation, Knowledge, Experience, Security Responsibility, Personal and Work Boundaries, and Security Behavior. The findings suggest that these differ by security behavior and by the nature of the behavior (e.g. onand offline). Conclusions are discussed highlighting barriers to security actions and implications for future research and workplace practice.	information security;online and offline;relevance;syntax highlighting	John M.

Furthermore, a new identification method is constructed that takes into account the law of scientific research cooperation and economic factors. The method utilizes multisource data, combining bibliometric and econometrics analyses to achieve the network core of the existing collaboration network, and institution competitiveness in the innovation chain. Empirical analysis of the genetic engineering vaccine field shows that throughout the distribution characteristics of creative technologies from different institutions, the analysis based on the innovation chain can identify more complementarities between institutions. Compared to previous studies, this study emulates the real conditions of IURC. The rule of technological innovation can be better revealed, potential partners of IURC can be more easily identified, and the conclusion has a higher value in consultation. In particular, diverse informative indices can assist researchers in deriving appropriate partners for research and development cooperation.	bibliometrics;embnet.journal;emulator;information;knowledge spillover	Haiyun Xu;Kun Dong;Ling Wei;Chao Wang;Shu Fang	2017		10.1145/3110025.3110142	knowledge spillover;delegation (computing);computer science;knowledge management	ML	-84.21647260472534	0.8635178348247903	67190

In spite of the acknowledged competitive significance of digital services, the impact of service augmentation on customer satisfaction remains an unexplored area of research. Arguing for priceand relationalevaluations, we develop hypotheses for a substitution effect of value added services, and a complementary effect of customer care, on the relationship between core service and customer satisfaction. Specific to the BOP market context, we argue for a differentiated influence of service augmentation for different categories of providers. We empirically examine and find support for the hypothesized relationships using an archival data set from surveys of cell phone customers in seven South Asian BOP markets. We discuss the managerial implications and contributions of the findings.	archive;mobile phone	Jiban Khuntia;Sunil Mithas;Ritu Agarwal;Prasanto K.

Design/methodology/approach – A rigorous review of the existing literature is undertaken for the purpose of developing a contingency framework that determines firm boundaries. Findings – The conceptual framework posits that three decision contexts (the threat of opportunism, the threat of commercial failure, and the opportunity for sustainable advantage) are predictors of selecting the governance mode between e-collaboration and arm’s-length relationship, and that an intention to e-collaborate moderates the governance mode choice. Originality/value – Testable propositions are offered to examine the proposed relationships in the framework. The paper concludes by suggesting that firms which would like to implement e-collaboration in a group of companies must initiate and strengthen their intention to form the desired governance mode.	coat of arms;failure;group cohesiveness;occam's razor;software propagation;world wide web	Eddie W.

It is important to investigate intervening factors that challenge software development productivity. In this paper, the authors mixed method approach harnesses a structural equation model (SEM) for its quantitative part to establish a paradigm for understanding the effects of social factors for software development organizations. The proposed SEM model measures the correlations between several potential factors associated with productivity, social productivity, and social capital that are chosen as latent variables. For the qualitative phase, an industrial focus group is used to single out these factors and their association with potential social aspects. Quantitative data is gathered from a survey conducted at a university. The qualitative phase encompasses an industrial focus group, initially starting with the factors from the literature and refined through participants’ field experience. Findings indicate that a high correlation exists between several social factors that are reported by the focus group. Finally, initial results suggest that understanding the factors that affect social capital in software development is essential for building and sustaining highly productive development environments.

Today, it is commonly accepted as the productivity of a software development team not only depends on the degree of its members’ experience, skills, and competences but also how well its members socially interact. In fact, it is not surprising to observe that experiencing greater production success heavily relies on how the teams socially communicate, and utilize their interactions. These interactions however, should be governed and coordinated to achieve the desired productivity levels both for an individual and a team. By understanding software development as a social activity (Dittrich, Floyd, & Klischewski, 2002), we begin to investigate social capital as a network-based shared norm or a value that supports collective outcomes and to explore the related factors for software development. The goal is to measure the socioeconomic constraints for organizations by exploring several social and productivity factors that are highlighted by software development participants. A software development organization should enable their teams to use their social capital (for example while creating optimal team configurations) and use this value to understand and measure the needs to improve its economically effective levels. The process of forming a conceptual definition of social capital and customizing a method for its measurement are both very challenging tasks especially in applied settings. Nevertheless, we claim that social capital should be considered as an adequate value to be identified, measured and used for productivity improvement in a software development environment. There are several context specific definitions of the term social capital emerged and used within the empirical research. Social capital should be a factor to improve the productivity of social structure. It should be defined as a network based (hidden) resource identified by the size and the value of an individual’s social connections. Therefore, understanding the notion of social capital has a potential of improving social aspects of software development. Our research agenda has two important objectives: First determining factors that are affecting productivity and second, investigating a method or a model to determine a way to measure the correlations among these factors. In our preliminary study (Yilmaz & O’Connor, 2011), we have analyzed the relationship between the social factors potentially affecting productivity and productivity based upon software productivity literature refined by our focus group studies. Consequently, we designed a SEM model to investigate productivity factors and sought empirical support for our proposed approach. Based on the selected data collected from a preliminary study, in this work, first we plan to revise our previous models, and second we design a new SEM model to examine the relationship between social productivity and social capital. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we introduce several definitions for the social and value dynamics of software development landscapes such as software artifacts, productivity, the value, social capital, social productivity. The following section describes some of the techniques that are used in social network analysis (SNA). The next section describes the analysis models and methods proposed and used in this research. It presents some of our findings that validates our proposed model, and verifies our empirical approach. Finally, the last section concludes the paper with a brief summary of contributions and some directions for future research. SOCIAL AND VALUE DYNAMICS Social dynamics, also known as the dynamics of human interactions, is a multi-disciplinary field of science that is concerned with analyzing socialites or social systems formed by participants and their interactions. This section surveys several important concepts and definitions and the foundations of social and the value dynamics of a software organization. These concepts and definitions highlight the important points of the Social Aspects of Software Engineering (SASE) (Dittrich et al., 2002). Ultimately, SASE helps 42 International Journal of Human Capital and Information Technology Professionals, 3(2), 40-62, April-June 2012 Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.

It promotes cooperation within software teams and organizations and helps them to respond better for the dynamic and future trends of software development. We start this section by defining a software artifact. Next, we identify sources of capital that are used in any production process. Moreover, we define both social and human capital, and further the concept of social productivity is introduced. The Software Artifact The cost of quality attributes in the software development activities is heavily based on interaction skills of individuals and teams. Specifically, one of the most important of the output of these skills is the software artifact. Software artifact is defined as; “The products, process and software developed by human efforts are considered as artifacts (or tools) that embody human knowledge” (Shariq, 1998, p. 11). “A software artifact is a social artifact, which means it is a product of social beings or an outcome of their behaviors. Software artifact is a unit of material, in the form of a document, presentation, or code, that is developed as a part of, or as a contribution to, the final solution to the users” (Tsui, 2004, p. 3). According to Baldwin and Clark, an artifact is a quintessential outcome of both human intelligence and endeavor. Nevertheless, knowledge-based artifacts (e.g., software, computers, etc.) are interconnected group of entities usually created by a team of workers (Baldwin & Clark, 2000). Morisio et al. point out that the artifacts produced in a software process are complex creations and channeling of the human acumen identified several different characteristics. Tsui (2004) describes the notion of software artifacts as a “unit of material”, which can be in any form such as documentation or source code. Its life-cycle starts from requirements analysis phase follows through product development and documentation. Several entities can be accepted as software artifacts. For example, manuals or guide booklets, and even internal deliverables inside the organization. Software artifacts are considered as smaller and manageable parts of a software project. They are useful touchstones for implementing the concept of separation of concerns (Parnas & Clements, 1986), which values the division of the effort and knowledge by coordinating the software engineering tasks and decisions (Baldwin & Clark, 2000). Shariq suggested that the knowledge should be considered as an outcome of human activities, which essentially produces knowledge artifacts, and knowledge networks are intervened by these artifacts (Shariq, 1998). Cluts conducted a case study to develop a framework based on the connections between people and their activities where artifacts are described to contain a backlog of the past events and connections among them (Cluts, 2003).	artifact (software development);barry boehm;capability maturity model;computer;documentation;entity;focus group;hoare logic;integrated development environment;interaction;knowledge management;latent variable;level of measurement;list of system quality attributes;new product development;observable;perl;programming paradigm;requirement;requirements analysis;separation of concerns;social capital;social dynamics;social network analysis;social structure;social system;software development process;software engineering;software project management;structural equation modeling;theoretical definition	Murat Yilmaz;Rory O'Connor	2012	IJHCITP	10.4018/jhcitp.2012040104	structural equation modeling;economics;systems engineering;engineering;operations management;management	SE	-86.07960854366631	2.0382472640919667	67453

However, most research has focused on single overall, high-level organizational goals while ignoring important operational goals farther down in the goal hierarchy. This paper explores the important issue of interdependent feedback on multiple operational goals with shared task environments. We conjecture about the impact of shared technological task environments on feedback across goals. We then empirically examine these conjectures using panel vector autoregression (PVAR) analysis of performance feedback from three strategically important operational goals with shared technological task environments in the automobile industry. We find that interdependent feedback can lead to severe and misleading confusion regarding learning from feedback on such goals with shared task environments. Then, we discuss the implications of our findings. These include the following: the absolute intractability of the ...		Songcui Hu;Richard A.

Firms can exert control over output quality through incentives formally written into contracts and allow both clients and providers to manage the offshore agents creating a dual governance mechanism. We use a combination of two data sets, a cross sectional data set of 139 processes and a balanced panel data set comprising 21 processes with 36 observations per process, to investigate the impact of different factors on the quality of output of offshore BPO providers. Our findings point to the strong moderating effect of process codifiability on the dual governance mechanism. Process codifiability is not only associated with higher output quality, it also moderates the functioning of the dual governance mechanism and determines when the managerial efforts of the client and provider are substitutes and when they are complementary. We show that contractual incentives tied to quality are generally associated with a higher quality of output. Finally, we show that the use of process-level inter-organizational information systems also has a positive impact on the output quality of offshore BPO providers.	business process;outsourcing	Ying Liu;Ravi Aron	2015	Information Systems Research	10.1287/isre.2014.0550	offshoring;principal–agent problem;social science;economics;marketing;operations management;empirical research;management;commerce	AI	-82.79931638634365	4.090355543916132	68342

Our model also includes organizational support structure for BI and the users’ involvement in the ongoing development of BI systems as contributing factors. Data collected from over 300 organizations across the world confirmed 7 of 9 hypothesized relationships. Notably, user involvement and the organizational support factors are seen to be associated with the BI capability factors which, in turn, are positively associated with users’ perception of net benefits and their satisfaction with BI practices. This is one of the first studies that evaluates the success of BI at organizational level and considers user involvement, characterized by on-going configuration / customization / improvement cycle, as a contributing factor in the classic IS Success model.	angela mclean (biologist);computer;information systems success model;seven of nine	Uday R.

As users, and citizens, we become reliant on electronic solutions that give us a certain level of utility and trust, and use e-ID solutions to interact with local and central government in an e-service context. The management of e-ID development in a national context is the case in focus for investigation. Such development initiatives, and especially inter-organizational projects, face a number of challenges. Therefore it is a need for a more thorough understanding of e-ID development within a public e-service context. The purpose is to analyse the contemporary management of e-ID development in Sweden from: a) an e-government systems development life-cycle perspective and b) a project challenge and critical success factor perspective. This study concludes that there are significant challenges involved in managing integrated e-ID development. Challenges involve the organization and management of the program and can be traced back to e-government and general project management literature, but based on this study one can question, e.g. governance models, centralization, and a narrow focus on a technical artefact. Important implications from this paper are a call for further contextual studies of e-ID development, putting the user and organizational setting, path dependency, and governance models in focus.	authentication;centralisation;digital signature;e-government;e-services;electronic identification;emoticon;path dependence;smart card;software development process;systems development life cycle;visual artifact	Ulf Melin;Karin Axelsson;Fredrik Söderström	2013			public relations;knowledge management;environmental resource management;marketing;database;management;world wide web	HCI	-79.67275609671776	-0.2689510219791951	68676

This is particularly true in the case of firms that engage in international business activities. The present paper is part of an empirically oriented project to investigate the impacts of strategic alignment on organizational performance, especially in the case of European International Companies. We use Structural Equation Modeling to apprehend the strategic alignment concept as an emergent variable derived from the co variation of two components: (1) business strategy; and (2) the IS/IT strategy. Then, we explore the role of this emergent concept as a determinant of organizational performance. We use data from a large database constructed due to survey instruments to assess the usage of IS/IT among European firms. 505 questionnaires have been exploited in this study.

A comprehensive theoretical framework for the analysis of notions of ICT literacy is presented. Current notions of ICT literacy in different segments of policymaking and implementation in Australia are analysed and compared. Two dimensions (intended and implemented) and three theoretical perspectives (ICT policy, literacy policy and teaching and learning) are covered in this analysis. Similarities and differences in the understanding of ICT literacy at the national and regional levels and in various segments of decision-making and implementation are revealed. The complexity of the ICT literacy phenomenon is described. It is shown that, at the intended level, the formation of the notion of ICT literacy is strongly influenced by thinking about ICT literacy in ICT and educational policies. At the implemented level, the notion of ICT literacy is strongly influenced by various local factors and even implementation routines.

Individuals resist change and software developers are no different than other organizational actors in this regard. This paper describes a case study which examines the changes to the IS development environment wrought by the introduction of a new software development methodology. One aspect of the new methodology involves the use of user stories in place of traditional requirements documentation. The findings of this longitudinal study illustrated that developers’ commitment to the use of user stories diminished greatly, ranging from initial commitment to skepticism, to virtual abandonment. In order to explain the underlying reasons for the reduction in commitment, the authors used the theory of competing commitments. Competing commitments are typically subconscious forces that work against behaviors and actions that social actors were previously committed to. While competing commitment theory has been applied in other fields, it has not been applied previously in the field of IS to understand IS-based phenomena. Further to the use of the competing commitment process, this paper’s analysis of the software development project suggested the presence of hierarchical group think influencing the diminishing commitments.	commitment scheme;documentation;groupthink;requirement;software developer;software development process;user story	John McAvoy;Tom Butler	2005			documentation;knowledge management;software development;personal software process;team software process;social software engineering;ranging;user story;computer science;software walkthrough	SE	-82.17101107862234	0.12948638338045948	69047

A successful InfoSec policy must demonstrate understanding of the local workforceu0027s culture and not just blindly impose rules and regulations. We conducted a quantitative study of 177 professionals across 35 national cultures to investigate whether national culture influences InfoSec training and best practices using Hofstedeu0027s six cultural dimensions. Our findings indicate that training programs should more directly address the variances in perception of InfoSec across cultures. These training programs should also reflect the significance of the organisationu0027s InfoSec policies in the context of the local employee, while maintaining unified corporate governance. By increasing training comprehension, organisations can reduce security incidents resulting from unintentional policy violations and in turn, avoid costly remediation efforts.	information security	Miloslava Plachkinova;Steven Andrés	2018	IJIPSI	10.1504/IJIPSI.2018.10013212	business;insider threat;best practice;environmental resource management;information security;comprehension;workforce;hofstede's cultural dimensions theory;corporate governance	Crypto	-81.96984937751608	-1.47225289863148	69279

7b81850aa336922f6ef2c1cef638a2254ab9789b	an analytics approach to exploring the link between ict development and affordability		Despite the rapid development in information and communications technologies (ICTs), the disparity in the ICT affordability, adoption, and utilization between developed and developing countries is still a subject of discussion among academics, researchers, and policy makers. Recent initiatives by the UN in developing a comprehensive ICT development index (IDI) and other accompanying data collection efforts have created a fertile ground for researchers in applying various methods to measure the magnitude of the digital divide and monitor how the disparity will evolve over time. This paper contributes towards this objective by extending existing research in the measurement and understanding of the global digital divide issue. Using unsupervised and supervised data mining techniques, we explore the countries' ICT development and affordability profiles, their evolution over time, and the link between ICT pricing and the ICT development stages of countries. Our analyses, based on ICT pricing and development data of 120 countries from 2008 to 2012, provide valuable insights into the global digital divide and the evolution of countries over time. In addition, it demonstrates the potential for predicting a country's future ICT development stage using its past or current ICT pricing information. This provides policy making opportunities for governments through continuous monitoring, reporting, and benchmarking of their ICT development and pricing information.	automated clearing house;basic;big data;cluster analysis;coherence (physics);crisis (dynamical systems);decision tree;dia;emoticon;ips community suite;lu decomposition;linear algebra;logistic regression;nam;sap hana;unsupervised learning	Anteneh Ayanso;Kaveepan Lertwachara	2015	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2015.09.009	simulation;economics;marketing;management;economic growth	AI	-78.11311987381171	-5.749636643382754	69383
9aec0b63dc366f5aa87b1fd009e35c159ad77bf8	records professionals' challenges and barriers in public institutions in korea		The purpose of this study was to investigate how the work practices of records professionals are driven and influenced by national regulations and policies, especially when the public records management system is established over a short period of time. This study focused on the perceived work tasks and practices along with professional development opportunities among Korean records professionals who work in public institutions. Korean records professionals face unique challenges because public institutions in Korea hire records professionals not because of internal needs but because of the law that mandates hiring at least one records professional at each public institution; no records can be discarded without the permission of the records professional. Interviews were conducted to better understand records professionals' perceptions, challenges, and experiences on their own terms. The results reveal that records professionals who participated in this study practice in an isolated environment and are prone to develop narrow understandings of their profession. The majority were concerned about poor recognition of their role in serving their organization and the public. There was a great need for professional development to help them enhance their awareness of the breadth and diversity of their contributions to the public beyond their day-to-day functions. This article concludes by discussing possible solutions and strategies for improving work practices that provide insights and show the practical implications for records professionals' workplaces in other countries and beyond the Korean public organizational context.

This facet of usage represents the user's disposition, or inclination, to use any IT (digital devices, software, etc.) pro-actively and in a self-determined fashion; it includes affective, cognitive and behavioral elements that result from both individual and group factors. With a classic grounded theory stance, we use mixed data and techniques, both qualitative and quantitative, to conceptualize, define, and model this new variable; we develop a quantitative index to assess it at a given moment in time. As a result of our work, we also propose that expectable use should significantly explain effective use and utilization.		Isabelle Walsh;Mireille Gettler-Summa;Michel Kalika	2016	J. Strategic Inf.

However, numerous strategic information systems planning methodologies stress the rational and formal aspects of organizational life, while ignoring the complexity of actual organizational situations which are characterized by human behaviour. Additionally, although numerous researchers have conducted empirical studies examining the relationship between various factors and strategic IS planning effectiveness, many factors have received little attention. This study uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyse the effects of organizational context and inter-group behaviour on the success of SISP.

Interestingly, these concepts have made little in-roads into the field of IT research. In this paper, we propose that experienced meaningfulness and calling offer a new perspective to understand IT professionals' turnover and turnaway intentions. Drawing on extant theory, we hypothesize that experienced meaningfulness has a negative direct effect on both turnover and turnaway intentions. Calling, on the other hand, has a negative direct effect on turnaway intentions, but moderates the effect of experienced meaningfulness on turnover intentions. Results from our large-scale study showed support for the hypothesized relationships.

Configuration and implementation tasks are dependent on generating some level of shared understanding of both business practices and technology. These problems become acute in implementations in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs often operate with non-standard business processes, making an effective interchange of process knowledge between consultants and end-users crucial. Using a multiple case study method and content analysis, the authors investigate the mediating role of absorptive capacity in knowledge transfer in SMEs ERP implementations. They present exploratory case studies from 3 Nigerian companies with varying outcomes, and hypothesize that knowledge transfer is complicated by acute information asymmetry, absence of pre-existing related knowledge and consequent difficulties in developing a shared understanding, and by a tendency to operate with lone consultants and lone organizational representatives.

The model is validated through a laboratory experiment that involved 44 teams of geographically dispersed members. Three levels of technology support were tested. The results demonstrate that the level of technology support impacts knowledge conversion, which influences the teams' shared understanding. Implications for research and practice are highlighted.

What ethical considerations should guide researchers and managers when they employ causal research methods that make different community members bear different risks and benefits, under different levels of consent? We introduce a structural framework for evaluating the flows of risks and benefits in social systems with multiple interacting parties. This framework has implications for understanding the governmentality of managing socio-technical systems, for making research ethics discussions more commensurable, and for enumerating alternative goals researchers might pursue with interventions.	causality;computation;computational social science;interaction;online community;social system;sociotechnical system	Brian Keegan;J.

We term this transaction ‘R&D acquisition’. This is most relevant for industries with extreme hunger for external knowledge like the IT-, telecommunicationand media(ICT) industries. Based on a review of the related knowledge transfer and post merger integration literature and based on an existing model for clustering R&D units by Birkinshaw (2002), we develop a testable model for the relationship between the choice of early stage integration mechanisms and R&D acquisition success. We argue that this relationship is moderated by the knowledge characteristics of the target firm. We suggest specific early acquisition integration mechanisms for the successful integration of three distinct and practically observable target firm R&D constellations. We illustrate our model with a telecommunication case example.

Organizational culture exerts a strong power in all sectors of a company, either in the transmission of values, behaviors or habits and, in particular, the adoption of new practices and methodologies also do not escape from this rule and appear to be under the control of this culture which selects and designates what can and cannot be promoted within the corporation. In addition to corporate culture, the level of corporate maturity is also a determining factor on the implementation of successful processes and without adequate and mature understanding, can affect as a consequence, the results and quality of a products and services, thus compromising the sales, user’s satisfaction, and for last, the market positioning.	capability maturity model;user-centered design	Lara da Costa Brito;Maria Manuela Rupp Quaresma	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-91238-7_2	organizational culture;human–computer interaction;process management;computer science;corporation;user-centered design	HCI	-86.40223197163144	-9.347578844345236	70213

But it is doubtful that sufficient account has been taken of the many, non-ICT roles played by such centres, whether in fostering education, empowerment, or greater environmental awareness. Through a conceptual framework informed by the capability approach, research discovered that iREACH, a Cambodian telecentre initiative had encouraged farming practices compatible with sustainable development.

While early e-gov projects focused on government-to-public information and interaction, the second and third wave of e-gov projects also emphasize internal effectiveness and efficiency, along with intra- and interdepartmental as well as intra- and interbranch integration. With these increases in scope and scale of e-gov projects, existing business processes, including core processes, become candidates for improvement and change. While the private-sector-oriented literature on business process change abounds with descriptive and prescriptive accounts, no equivalent has been found in the public-sector-related literature. Although many insights drawn from the private sector may apply, the public sector seems to develop distinct practices. This paper contributes to the understanding of current practices in e-gov-induced business process change, comparing those practices to prescriptions derived from private-sector experience. Among other factors, the more inclusive approach observed in e-gov business process change may explain the higher success rate of public-sector projects compared to those reported from the private sector.	business process;e-government	Hans Jochen Scholl	2005	IJEGR	10.4018/jegr.2005040102	business analysis;organizational learning;organizational culture;knowledge management;change management;management science;process management;empirical research;management	HCI	-79.49527806228194	2.351507313341295	70467

Although ability, benevolence, and integrity are generally recognized to be three key characteristics of trustworthiness that explain much of the within-truster variation in trustworthiness, some researchers have noted conceptual issues regarding how these characteristics are related to trust and have detected empirical inconsistencies in past research. The present paper suggests that in many contexts, the three characteristics of trustworthiness are non-linearly related to trusting behaviors and tests this idea via a multi-method approach (two laboratory experiments and a qualitative organizational study). The results of the three studies strongly support the validity and usefulness of the non-linear relationship hypothesized between ability, benevolence, and integrity.	nonlinear system;standard boolean model	Henri Barki;Jacques Robert;Alina Dulipovici	2015	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2015.02.001	psychology;public relations;computer science;communication;trustworthy computing;social psychology	AI	-88.2342834233102	-4.296821632426385	70576

Although infrastructure issues received a great deal of media attention, the site has had its fair share of interface design problems. Drawing on the usability guidelines on the government site of usability.gov, we developed a survey instrument that comprised 16 dimensions to form overall usability. Based on a survey of 374 citizens, we found that usability strongly predicted citizen satisfaction with the website and intention to use the website. Six out of the 16 dimensions of usability emerged as significant in driving overall usability perceptions. In addition to key theoretical implications for e-government and usability research, our work offers practical implications for the healthcare.gov website and e-government web applications in general.	usability	Viswanath Venkatesh;Hartmut Hoehle;Ruba Aljafari	2014	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2014.07.003	pluralistic walkthrough;web usability;website architecture;cognitive walkthrough;usability;human–computer interaction;system usability scale;usability engineering;universal usability;multimedia;tree testing;heuristic evaluation;world wide web;usability lab	NLP	-88.98993866407623	-8.078410216366656	70692

A non-experimental, quantitative method of analysis was used for this research and a survey instrument developed by Venkatesh (2003) was used to gather data from information technology professionals in the United States. The data generated were tested using Chi Square and Multiple Regression. Chi square was used to test the hypotheses and the result establishes a pertinent relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. Multiple regression analysis was also conducted on the four independent variables and all of the independent variables tested have a pvalue that is greater than 0.05 (p&gt;0.05). Hence, it was concluded that the null hypothesis be accepted for all the four independent variables tested.

For the effective use of renewable energies, innovative information and communication technologies (ICT) and concepts are necessary to efficiently balance power generation and consumption. An ICT-based innovation in this context is the smart metering technology allowing bidirectional transfer of information between energy systems’ components. Using a context-specific extension of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of Davis (1989), our study investigates smart meters’ acceptance based on the attitude toward use and the salient beliefs perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and subjective control. Results support the theorized relationships indicating that the attitude toward use fully mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and subjective control on intention to use. In the conclusion a detailed discussion of the study’s findings is provided and the implications for research, practice, and policy are highlighted.	ibm tivoli access manager;quantum fluctuation;smart tv;smart meter;theory;usability	Johann Kranz;Julia V.

Research in understanding actual usage and adoption by this target population, though, is sparse. There appear to be a number of issues which prevent low-income, low-literate populations from meaningfully adopting and using existing m-banking services. This paper examines variations across countries in adoption and usage of existing m-banking services by low-literate, low-income individuals and possible factors responsible for the same. It is observed that variations are along several parameters: household type, services adopted, pace of uptake, frequency of usage, and ease of use. Each of these observations is followed by a set of explanatory factors that mediate adoption and usage.	mobile banking;mobile phone;population;sparse matrix;usability	Indrani Medhi-Thies;Aishwarya Ratan;Kentaro Toyama	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02767-3_54	public relations;marketing;business;commerce	HCI	-88.06526332082844	-8.990500951057228	71103

Our research highlights the importance of national technological and organizational (human capital) contexts for e-Government development. Our results also show that national environment (institutional and macro-economic) is not a significant facilitator for e-Government development.

Images carried by each stakeholder role is modeled and managed by several system modules, and they also evolve to reflect the real time situations of each entity. In addition, the system is dynamic in terms of its emphasis on the dynamic relationships among these roles and entities. When interactions occur, image mixing will be conducted to derive extra image attributes for the adjustments of the images. Besides, since colors can be mapped onto emotions, this paper adopts colors to operate the image matching and mixing process in order to find good matches of destinations for the recommendations meeting the tourists’ emotional needs.

Despite the increase in interest in trust research and its stated importance in HCI, prior research has mainly focused on understanding its role in human to human interactions mediated through technology. The ongoing and rapid technological developments have made it necessary to move beyond studying trust relationships between people mediated by information technology (IT) and focus on studying the relationship of the user with the IT artifact itself. We recognize that HCI discipline lacks a focused body of knowledge on trust and there is a lack of theoretically grounded and robust psychometric instruments for quantifying trust. With this in mind, this article is aimed at empirically evaluating a socio-technical model of trust so as to assess its feasibility in user technology interactions. Using prior established measures and theories, we identify seven trust attributes and test the proposed model using partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Our study contributes to the literature by advancing the discussion of trust in human-artefact relationship.	autonomous robot;human computer;human–computer interaction;mind;sociotechnical system;stochastic process;structural equation modeling;theory;visual artifact	Siddharth Gulati;Sonia C.

However, organizations remain hesitant to adopt it. For cloud computing providers , it is important to understand how to influence organizations’ adoption decision. However, extant l iterature has focused on cloud computing’s architecture, potential applications, and costs and benefits without understanding how organizations’ perceptions are formed. Building on the institutional perspective and real options theory, this study examines how institutional influ ences may affect organizations’ perceptions about the technological characteristics of cloud co mputing and recognition of real options. A preliminary survey of 101 IT professionals indicate s that institutional influences significantly affect perceptions related to the accessibility, sc alability, cost effectiveness, and lack of security of cloud computing.

27c6b462b268da846bbde5efb597eae4453ef173	conflict management process for virtual communities		Through the participation on collaborative tasks in virtual communities, members can express their divergences during discussions, which characterize conflicts. Conflicts can contribute positively creativity, innovation and quality of decisions. However, if not managed, conflicts can negatively impact community performance and members’ satisfaction. We propose a conflict management process for virtual communities. The process is useful to design new virtual communities because it allows to bring conflict management mechanisms, and also to improve mechanisms of existent virtual communities by correctly addressing the causes and consequences of conflicts.	virtual community	Juliana de Melo Bezerra;Celso Massaki Hirata	2011			knowledge management;computer science;conflict management	HPC	-81.52227410372127	-3.1016179037391094	72117
8ffd3c47ca67d0b14ec54341d2a6dc1d975fb3cc	how employees perceive organizational learning: construct validation of the 25-item short form of the strategic learning assessment map (sf-slam)		PurposernrnrnrnrnThis study aims at the employees’ view on organizational learning (OL). OL is originally assessed in the Strategic Learning Assessment Map (SLAM) at the level of the firm by addressing managers, who rated OL in the SLAM on five dimensions of individual, group, organizational, feed-forward and feedback learning. However, as employees are getting their jobs done discretely and are increasingly making their own decisions, their perspective on OL genuinely matters. Hence, the authors assessed OL at the level of the individual by addressing employees on all levels, who rated OL in a short form of the SLAM (SF-SLAM).rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnIn this paper, the authors focused on the construct validity of this SF-SLAM by investigating its reliability, factorial validity and nomological network. First, they asked whether the SF-SLAM reliably measures OL on five dimensions of individual, group, organizational, feed-forward and feedback learning. Next, they asked whether the SF-SLAM was associated with its nomological network of engaging in innovation-related learning activities, behaving innovatively on the job and showing higher educational levels, intelligence and individual job performances. They used a diverse German employee sample of skilled and unskilled workers and managers (N = 434) and analyzed the data with structural equation modeling.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe SF-SLAM was reliable, but revealed both constrained factorial validity and validity on the basis of its nomological network. First, five dimensions found support in the employee sample, but their correlations were high or very high, except for individual learning. Second, the SF-SLAM showed only few differential relations with variables from its nomological network.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnTaken together, the SF-SLAM is short, reliable and only valid for examining individual learning.

This study examines the switching behavior of mobile users who are not under any contractual obligations to stay with a provider. Drawing upon the literature on relationship marketing and switching costs, we examine if the relational investments made by mobile users in a user-provider relationship and demographics influence their switching behavior. Based on data on over 30,590 mobile users, we examine our research questions. Statistical analysis supports significant associations between mobile users’ service usage, service bundling and their switching behavior. Support was also found for the influence of age and gender on mobile user switching.

Systems thinking (ST) has been suggested as a framework of thought, based in holistic understanding of systems, to aid in dealing with increasingly complex systems and their problems. The primary contribution of the paper is examination of both individual capacity and corresponding organizational competence related to ST as a response to more effectively navigate the complex problem domain facing practitioners and organizations. Following a short introduction, we have organized the paper to explore four primary areas. First, we examine the nature of the complex problem domain confronting organizations and practitioners. Second, we suggest individual capacity and organizational competence as two essential areas necessary for ST to offer a response to more effectively navigate the complex problem domain. Third, we present an in depth examination of individual capacity for ST. Fourth, we develop a perspective of organizational competencies in relation to engaging ST. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges and implications for further development and application of ST.	complex systems;complexity;emergence;holism;problem domain	Raed M.

92f4bc95ef5fc01cba8993df256f3d2ba87769fa	a scale for measuring internet banking service quality: literature review and validation with indian public sector banks	indian public sector banks;internet banking;expectation;perception;service quality	There have been many fragmented studies of Internet service quality which have resulted in several models with different combinations of constructs and items, some focusing on different perspectives, and many using different names for the same construct. Some of these models were developed for the specific context of Internet banking. This paper consolidates these fragmented studies of Internet service quality and Internet banking service quality and proposes a scale with nine constructs to measure Internet banking service quality. The scale compares expected service (E) with perceived service (P) across all nine constructs and measures perceived service quality based on PE. The paper then validates the scale using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of 499 survey responses from Internet banking customers of five Indian public sector banks. The service quality scale was conceptualised as a nine-construct, 39-item scale. Through the purification process it was reduced to 34 items spread across nine constructs: availability, site aesthetics, ease of use, technical performance, reliability, privacy, trust, responsiveness, and customisation.

The main study (U.S. n = 311, Japanese n = 192), utilizing latent profile analysis, revealed that (a) there are three “FCS profiles” (laissezfaire, high-context, and open-affectionate), each of which represents distinct FCS endorsement patterns; (b) individuals with different FCS profiles have different levels of subjective well-being and family satisfaction, and moreover, such profile-level dynamics operate independently of the effects of individual FCS dimensions; and (c) FCS profile endorsement is undergirded by individualism-collectivism and horizontal-vertical orientation. A follow-up study found that FCS profiles entail unique family conflict strategies.

Management must have a good understanding of the nature of changes, as well as the 'momentum and forces' behind the changes. In this paper, we adopt the momentum accounting concept initially proposed by Ijiri (1982, 1986, 1988) and extend it to the practice of change management. With momentum accounting as the backbone, we also incorporate the flow concept and the change-causation-possibility (CCP) model of change management to facilitate the implementation of momentum accounting. Such an integrative framework not only helps a firm gain a better understanding of the nature, the processes and causal relationships of the past or potential changes in the firm's internal and external environments, but also provides a practical procedure for facilitating and improving change management. This integrative framework also provides a solid foundation for building decision support systems for change management.		Judy K. Land;Chen H.

Accordingly, researchers have investigated StSP practice and proposed both formal methods and principles of good practice. StSP cannot be understood by considering format methods alone. The processes of planning and the implementation of plans are equally important. However, there have been very few field investigations of these phenomena. This study examines SISP experier)ce in 27 companies and. unusually, relies on interviews not only with IS managers but atso with general managers and tine managers. By adopting this broader perspective, the investigation reveals companies were using five different StSP approaches: Business-Led, Method-Driven. Administrative. Technological, and Qrganizational. Each approach has different characteristics and, therefore, a different likelihood of success. The results show that the Qrganizational Approach appears to be rrjost effective. The taxonomy of the five approaches potentially provides a diagnostic toot for analyzing and evaluating an organization's experience with SISP.	automated planning and scheduling;formal methods;information systems;strategic information system	Michael J.

Accordingly, this study devises a multilevel model for examining the links among contextual variables and collects data via a multi-informant questionnaire design. To clarify the multilevel influence of these individual-level (e.g., knowledge sharing) and organizational-level variables (e.g., organizational memory) on individual-level outcome (e.g., employee service performance), this study applies hierarchical linear modeling to examine three hypotheses. Using data from a study of 266 healthcare employees and 34 supervisors sampled from 34 hospitals, the HLM results clearly indicate how organizational memory moderates the relationship between knowledge sharing and employee service performance.

Despite this recognition, researchers have not explored how the outer form in which a technological innovation is embodied influences the processes through which the innovation’s value is constructed and perceived. In this paper we argue that by embodying novel technologies in objects with specific functional, symbolic, and aesthetic properties, innovating firms also endow their products with cues that trigger a variety of cognitive and emotional responses. Drawing on psychological research we articulate how such cognitive and emotional responses underlie initial perceptions of value and theorize how innovating firms can influence them through product form design. Our framework explains how product form contributes to perceptions of value by modulating the actual technological novelty of a product innovation and facilitating how customers cope with it. Our theoretical framework makes an important contribution to innovation research and practice because it articulates how product form can be used strategically to achieve specific cognitive and emotional effects and enhance the initial customer perceptions of the value of an innovation.	modulation	Violina Rindova;Antoaneta P.

In particular in the airline industry very successful (passenger reservation) systems have been built which have totally changed the competitive arena of the industry. On the cargo side however attempts to implement large-scale community systems have largely failed across the globe. Air cargo parties are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of IT and, increasingly, they understand the value that IOS could provide for the total value chain performance. However, whereas in other sectors IOSs have been very successful, there are only fragmented examples of successful global systems in the air cargo community and the penetration of IOS in the air cargo industry is by no means pervasive. This paper describes the genesis and evolution of two IOSs in the air cargo community and identifies plausible explanations that lead one to be a success and one to be a failure. It draws on extensive fieldwork in Europe and in Hong Kong SAR that is complemented by secondary data analysis of relevant trade and company literature. We argue that in these two cases the complex, institutional and technical choices by the initiators of the system in terms of their competitive implications that were the main causes for the systems failure. The paper thus concludes that it was the institutional factors involved in the relationships of the stakeholders that led to the opposite manifestations of the two initiatives, and that such factors should be taken into accoun when designing and implementing large-scale information systems.	exploratory testing;field research;genesis;information system;interdependence;pervasive informatics;social structure;ios	Ellen Christiaanse;Jan Damsgaard	2000		10.4018/jgim.2001040102	simulation;value chain;computer science;marketing;operations management;data analysis;user interface;management;operations research;world wide web;economic growth;information system;communications system	HCI	-79.04131253652173	1.288606708997	73523

Since more and more citizens are using cell phones and other mobile devices, it seems clear that there is an opportunity for government to provide services using related technologies, what has recently been called mobile government. Based on configuration theory, concepts from business models, and a set of individual interviews, this paper proposes a preliminary business model for mobile government, particularly using SMS (short message service) technology. The paper shows how the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in the Paraná State in Brazil has been using an innovative model to deliver services to citizens, which public managers can use as a model to better understand and help them begin a mobile government project using this technology. Therefore, the paper proposes a business model and tests it for the case of the DMV in the state of Paraná in Brazil.	e-government;mobile device;mobile phone	Beatriz Barreto Brasileiro Lanza;José Ramón Gil-García;Fernando Antonio Prado Gimenez	2017		10.1145/3047273.3047380	simulation;advertising;business;computer security	HCI	-80.923007830826	-8.524363803164041	73822

In addition, the study explores whether these capabilities increase firm performance and also examines the relationship between relationship-specific memory and absorptive capacity. To test the hypotheses, we conducted a partial least squares analysis using data collected from 115 firms. The results demonstrate that firms enhanced their relationship-specific memory and absorptive capacity by leveraging their physical and human IT resources invested in interorganizational relationships and that these two capabilities increased their performance. Moreover, our results indicate that relationship-specific memory served as a knowledge base for the development of absorptive capacity. The results offer empirical evidence on how firms could improve their performance by internally managing the relational knowledge obtained through their interorganizational relationships.	knowledge base;partial least squares regression	Sujeong Choi	2014	Information Technology and Management	10.1007/s10799-014-0181-5	computer science;knowledge management;operations management;management	Metrics	-81.6517207252293	3.705573604240114	73922

Ways of assessing the effectiveness of development teams has highlighted measures of factors, such as teamwork, group cohesiveness, and team integration, but the use of group potency theory (the collective belief of a group that it can be effective) is rare. In our study, we investigated antecedents of and consequences to group potency in software development project teams. By examining 53 software development project teams collected from small and medium-sized software firms in Turkey, we found, that team potency positively affected speed-to-market, development cost, and market success of the product. We also found that trust among project team members, past experiences of the members, and team empowerment had a positive impact on the team potency during the project.

We articulate this approach as the hierarchy-of-parts architecture and explain how it emphasizes decomposition of a design into loosely coupled parts and subsequent aggregation of these into an industrial product. To realize the scale benefits of modularity, firms successively freeze design specifications before production and therefore only allow limited windows of functionality design and redesign. This makes it difficult to take advantage of the increased speed by which digitized products can be developed and modified. To address this problem, we draw on Christopher Alexander’s notion of design patterns to introduce a complementary approach to manage technological change that is resilient to digital technology. We articulate this approach as the network-of-patterns architecture and explain how it emphasizes generalization of ideas into patterns and subsequent specialization of patterns for different design purposes. In response to the increased digitization of industrial products, we demonstrate the value of complementing hierarchy-of-parts thinking with network-of-patterns thinking through a case study of infotainment architecture at an automaker. As a result, we contribute to the literature on managing products in the digital age: we highlight the properties of digital technology that increase the speed by which digitized products can be redesigned; we offer the notion of architectural frames and propose hierarchy-of-parts and network-ofpatterns as frames to support innovation of digitized products; and, we outline an agenda for future research that reconsiders the work of Simon and Alexander as well as their followers to address key challenges in innovating digitized products.

Little University of Auckland “Understanding customer value: an action research-based study of contemporary marketing practice” Abstract: The study developed understanding of how managers create and deliver customer value, addressing the 2003 ISBM research priority of “developing better understanding relating to creating, measuring and delivering customer value in business markets”. Action research philosophy and practice were applied to a three-stage multi-method design, featuring a survey of 152 managers, 14 cases, and an in-depth study of an industrial small to medium-sized enterprise (SME). The study was grounded in the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. A synthesising framework integrated strategic management and marketing views of value, contributing to current understanding of linkages between marketing practice and firm performance. A new definition of customer value appropriate to a business-to-business context was developed. The definition was supported by a series of empirically based conceptual frameworks describing the customer value construct and the customer value development processes of the firm. Five value postures identifying various approaches to creating and delivering customer value were found: Traditional Transactional, Transitional (or Hybrid), Traditional Relational, Network, and Systemic. The postures characterised firms’ approaches to customer value creation and delivery in various contexts (e.g. for-profit and not-for-profit, consumer and industrial) and at various management levels (e.g. senior management, functional management and front-line). The findings suggested a contingency of marketing practice: e.g. if a firm (the buyer) has a particular strategic approach in a particular context, or if marketing activities are directed at particular levels of management, then a congruent value posture or marketing communications approach is indicated on the part of the seller. Customer value creation and delivery processes were conceptualised as a triad, based on making, keeping, and enabling promises. A fourth dimension, realising promises, identified process outputs, i.e. the financial and nonfinancial value enjoyed by buyer and seller. Finally, four types of customer value were proposed: notional, potential, kinetic, and realised. Notional customer value describes the intellectual capital of managers, or ideas about how value could be created for customers. Potential customer value describes explicit knowledge, codified in documents such as strategic and relationship plans. Kinetic value describes the energetic, iterative process of value co-creation, engaged in by buyer and seller. Realised value describes customer value as an output: buyer satisfaction and loyalty, and seller financial returns and knowledge. Overall, customer value and its associated processes were found to be complex, dynamic and multi-dimensional; and, in the context of contemporary marketing practice, knowledge-rich and relationship-oriented. 2.

880229fd13d74b86901058f9d5d2b5f1ad03cb19	measuring perceptions of trustworthiness: a research project		The digital curation and preservation community has long acknowledged that trustworthiness is a critical component of successful digital repositories. However, there is no known method to determine if or under what circumstances an end-user perceives a repository as trustworthy. While the research literature describes definitions, criteria, and certification processes that allow repository managers to assert trustworthiness under certain conditions, it does not adequately define, measure, or specify trustworthiness from the perspective of the end-user. This paper highlights traditional notions of trustworthiness in the context of the literature on digital repositories and explores trustworthiness from the end-user’s perspective. The paper also presents an ongoing research project to: (1) investigate designated communities’ perspectives on trustworthiness using focus groups, and (2) explore building, testing, and assessing an index to measure trustworthiness.	digital curation;digital library;focus group;scientific literature;trust (emotion)	Devan Ray Donaldson	2013			focus group;trustworthiness;certification;digital curation;business;knowledge management	HCI	-81.88677536947148	-3.659344401441349	74463

However, innovation barriers hinder OGD users from generating value. While previous studies have detailed a large number of such barriers, little is known of how different types of OGD users are affected, and when the barriers appear in their innovation processes. To this end, this paper describes a case study of distributed service development in the Swedish public transport sector. The contribution to extant research is twofold. Firstly, based on an inductive analysis, three OGD user archetypes are proposed: employees, entrepreneurs and hobbyists. Secondly, the study finds that the significance of distinct innovation barriers varies across phases of the services’ lifecycles and depending on the OGD users’ motivation, objective, pre-conditions and approach. Drawing on these insights, we propose that OGD initiatives aimed at facilitating outbound OI to a greater extent should address the barriers that appear during diffusion of innovations, the barriers that are not directly related to the OGD provision, and the barriers that are experienced by non-obvious OGD user groups.	inductive reasoning;open innovation	Göran Smith;Johan Sandberg	2018	Information Polity	10.3233/IP-170045	knowledge management;open government;open innovation;diffusion of innovations;extant taxon;archetype;business	HCI	-79.4061875389104	0.2581071016641943	74690

The language styles, interactive modes and interfaces for most of the mobile communication products in Chinese marketplaces are just copies of those developed for Western users, which are difficult and not suitable for Asian people's thinking habits and usage customs. This especially applies to the needs of the poorly educated and users who are challenged by digital products. They are almost totally ignored by the mainstream of mobile product makers, even though a huge consumptive potential exists in those segments of consumers in the future years. This joint project of Tsinghua and Nokia, targeting the market segment of Chinese migrant workers, concentrates on user research and conceptual design for proper mobile communication products or service systems, with hopes to contribute to the corporate future design strategies and market development plans.	user research	Xin Liu;Jikun Liu;Jun Cai;Ying Liu;Xia Wang	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-02806-9_56	marketing;operations management;advertising;business	HCI	-82.87821178135903	-9.710241376641173	74750
45426a5967296254809efca4fbc3b8f4d87c650c	the influence of job rotation on physicians' system use: a situated learning perspective		While job rotation has been well recognized as an effective management strategy for career development, it could have detrimental effects on the success of a healthcare information system. Junior physicians, who often periodically rotate among different hospitals, are unlikely to be proficient in a particular system. Drawing on the situated learning theory, this study explores how job rotation affects a rotating physician’s system use and related benefits. An interpretive case study was conducted among rotating physicians in a public hospital. The data analysis results reveal three important sets of concepts originating from rotation experiences: direct system knowledge, diversified system knowledge and organization identification. A rotating physician with direct system knowledge may go through a process of repeat-based learning, whereas, diversified system knowledge may trigger a process of comparisonbased learning. In addition, organization identification is important to facilitate system knowledge transfer from physicians to the hospital.	experience;information system;situated	Yu Tong;Nadee Goonawardene;Sharon Swee-Lin Tan;Hock-Hai Teo;Cheng Ooi Low	2011				HCI	-83.73469007031886	-1.6854607854093944	74815

Increase of smartphone user has extended the smartphone business arena from simple and personal applications and content to professional software for the purpose of working inand out of the office. In this regard, developing their services to be mobile-friendly would be important business strategies for Web business companies. The mobile data traffic in Korea had been 11.2 times increased from January 2010 to January 2011 and the average traffic per user in Korea is much higher than other countries. Usage of smartphones also has been steadily increased with the diffusion of smartphones. This may indicate that the dependency level on mobile portal service in Korea would be higher and more important than in other countries. This study analyzes the influences of UI simplicity and UI consistency on user perceptions of mobile portal services using PLS methodology. Simplicity shows a greater effect on usability and credibility than does consistency although consistency also shows a significant effect. In this regard, developing mobile Web services to be simple by following the selection and concentration strategy can be an effective strategic approach. Credibility shows a greater and direct effect on user satisfaction in this study than simplicity. But it does not mean that the perceived credibility should be treated simply as more important to user satisfaction than usability. Credibility of mobile Web services would be concreted more when the perceived usability would be developed with proper UI simplicity and consistency following the suggestion of Mann and Sahni. Also satisfaction significantly turns out to mediate the effect of credibility on loyalty. This study contributes as an earlier study on how and what the mobile Web service providers should design and provide their services.	computer user satisfaction;mobile app;partial least squares regression;smartphone;usability;user interface;web service	Jongtae Lee;Dongwon Lee;Junghoon Moon;Myeong-Cheol Park	2013	Information Technology and Management	10.1007/s10799-012-0143-8	usability;computer science;marketing;database;multimedia;internet privacy;consistency;world wide web	HCI	-89.0749390438114	-8.607184399311551	74822
35675e55e9fffe1fd517a8ca44c15d0b16443b70	what characterizes an enterprise systems implementation methodology?	social sciences;enterprise systems	Enterprise Systems Implementation Methodology (ESIM) is considered to be a critical factor for successful Enterprise Systems (ES) implementations. In spite of ESIM’s potential and significance for practice, little attention has been paid to this object of study in ES literature. Current studies reveal contradictory findings regarding its potential value and provide a fragmented understanding of it. This paper, therefore, addresses the following research question: What characterizes an ESIM? and suggests that ESIM can be interpreted in terms of its characterizing aspects, i.e. formalized, relational and emergent. This interpretation provides guidance in assessing ESIM in practice and lays the groundwork for useful follow-on research. Since ESIM might be regarded as one of the latest interventions undertaken in an attempt to improve the quality of an ES product and the productivity and quality of an implementation process, this study retains valuable insights of prior works in Information Systems Development research.	emergence;enterprise system;indivisible;information systems;knowledge base;natural language understanding;programming paradigm;software deployment;subscriber identity module	Daniela Mihailescu	2010				Metrics	-78.62045183423054	-1.159825262802449	74826

A research model based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was developed and empirically tested using a web-based survey questionnaire. Antecedent variables are considered as organisational support, organisational culture, subjective norm, web-self-efficacy, attitude towards knowledge sharing, and intention to sharing knowledge. The results showed that attitude towards knowledge sharing, organisational culture, and subjective norm have significant positive effects on knowledge sharing intention which in turns has a significant positive impact on knowledge sharing. Additionally, organisational support indirectly impact intention through attitude. Additionally, the results revealed that web-self-efficacy gender, age, educational level, and firm's age were not significant. Implications for researchers and managers were reported.		Aisha Y.

One aspect that is critical in order to provide relevant and useful analyses is the capability to infuse culture systematically. Cultural elements are typically either lacking or implicitly (and sometimes unintentionally) embedded in social network construction. Thus, current SNA approaches must deal with imprecise, un-realistic, and incomplete data. In this paper, we propose a generic approach to systematically model culture and infuse it into social networks to obtain more realistic and complete social network data sets that can provide insight into the probable intentions and behaviors of the actors in the network. In fact, in this paper we will introduce the concept of culturally-infused social networks, their construction, and their capability to provide fuller and more relevant social network analyses.	embedded system;social network analysis	Eunice E.

Meetup.com is a website that facilitates the creation and coordination of mixed-mode groups. Analysis of interviews with 34 Meetup group organizers and a longitudinal analysis of 100 randomly selected Meetup groups revealed the evolutionary processes at the group and population level, respectively. Specifically, the ecological factor of population density, the demographic factor of group age, the group’s profit orientation, experience of leadership change and shared leadership, and external ties played decisive roles in predicting group survival. Implications of the findings for theoretical and practical contributions are discussed.	mixed-signal integrated circuit;randomness	Chih-Hui Lai	2014	J.

Due to its relative importance, we focus in par- ticular on Bitcoin. Through an inductive, exploratory interview approach with 13 individuals in three distinct groups, the determinants usability, usefulness, and subjective norm that could make Bitcoin a game-changer are explored. The results reveal that most stakeholders consider perceived ease of use still rather low, with perceived usefulness varying according to the user group. The notion of Bitcoin as having much future potential as a payment method is confirmed across all interviewees. Interestingly, the underlying concept of a blockchain is also seen as a potential revolutionary way to create a more just society based on open platforms and open data. However, the reasons of why Bitcoin is actually a disruption to existing solutions varies widely.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;schema (genetic algorithms)	Aaron W.

E-consultation is seen as a valuable way through which a two-way relationship can be developed and enhanced between citizens and elected representatives. It involves the use of information and communications technologies (ICTs), such as the Internet, to extend and/or enhance political democracy through access to information, and to facilitate participation in democratic communities, processes, and institutions. Drawing on a case study of the Darebin eForum in Victoria, Australia, this article focuses on the role of public servants as moderators of this local form of e-consultation. The discussion has three parts: online policy consultation is defined within the context of e-democracy; some of the ways that e-consultation challenges the roles of the public service, elected representatives, and citizens are outlined; and the author then argues for an e-consultation strategy that is situated within a continuum of citizen engagement that is ongoing, deliberative, educative, and inclusive.

024eedad1416c5a692ccaf206bf4794e717a0790	towards theorising information systems from a neurobiological perspective		In spite of more than 25 years of research, the nature of Information Systems (ISs) remains elusive. To this end, a new conceptualization of ISs from a neurobiological perspective is proposed. ISs are seen as instruments for action, which in turn requires coordination. We posit that the phylogenetic evolution has endowed humans with a neurobiological substrate enabling coordination. The construct of activity modalities – objectivation, contextualization, spatialization, temporalization, stabilization, and transition – is introduced as inherent factors in this substrate. These modalities provide an analytical link for integrating the neural and social realms; thus enabling IS conceptualization as a dialectical relationship between coordinative, individual brain structures and the IT artefact. Consequently, the IS is seen as intrinsically related to the individual. We exemplify implications for the IS discipline by discussing how the concept of sociomateriality can be articulated from the neurobiological perspective. As a result, the “individual” is to put on equal theoretical footing as the “social” and “material”, thus providing a way to disentangle the problematic conflation of the “social” and the “human” in sociomaterial contributions. In conclusion, we claim that the neurobiological approach opens up for hitherto untrodden paths to advance the IS discipline.	conceptualization (information science);exemplification;information systems;information system;phylogenetics;realms;sociomateriality	Lars Taxén	2015			social science;computer science;knowledge management;sociology;management;social psychology	AI	-78.74806575402302	-2.0712445613670147	75591

With the increasing decentralization of IT responsibilities and personnel to functional areas, the management of IT project teams changes, with more responsibilities for end-user managers in systems development and technology integration tasks. Results of a pilot study to identify differences in the perceptions of IT professionals versus the end-users with respect to the characteristics of top performing IT personnel are presented here. This study is intended to extend previous research, which considered only skills and knowledge areas to include personality characteristics. Thus, this research has significance for IS training, IS staffing, and human resource management, and may also serve as impetus for future projects to determine superior versus inferior methods for the management of IT projects. A three-round Delphi study was conducted, using MBA students from the IS and accounting disciplines. Both groups agreed that outstanding IT people are characterized by their creative problemsolving skills and their ability to abstract business problems. The IT ranked business functional knowledge, interpersonal skills, and a team-orientation very highly. The accountants, however, placed more emphasis on technical skills.

This study uses the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the extended TAM (TAM2), the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI), and trust to build a parsimonious yet comprehensive model of factors that influence user acceptance of the EAS. We collected data from a total of 112 public officers in 12 ministries in Cambodia. We assessed the model with regression analyses. The findings in this article show that the determinants of the model (perceived usefulness, relative advantage, and trust) explain 30.5% of the variance in user acceptance of the EAS. At the same time, image, output quality, and perceived ease of use explain 38.4% of the variance in user perception of the usefulness of the EAS. In this article, we discuss our findings, implications, and suggestions for future research.

De-escalation is potentially a more important issue than escalation because de-escalation provides remedies for the ills of escalation. Therefore, it is important to understand how project stakeholders' commitment to troubled IS projects may be transformed under management executives' influence, hence allowing project teams to carry out their de-escalation activities. Here, we adopt theories of leadership, politics, and interpersonal influence, as our lenses to examine the management executive's influence behaviors during the transition from escalation to de-escalation of a failing electronic procurement project at UK Borough Council. Based on the case analysis, we presented three key factors that shaped the influence behaviors and six influence tactics utilized separately or collectively by the management executive in the unfreezing, changing, and refreezing phases of project de-escalation. Through the findings, researchers may develop a deeper understanding of how project stakeholders may surrender previous failing courses of action and accept alternative courses of action. Practitioners may also devise useful influence tactics when de-escalating troubled IS projects.	failure;information system;privilege escalation;procurement;theory	Gary S. C.

fe3e91735f6fa53648e0930eec9e820efabb67bb	ecra volume 6, number 4	ecra vol	This issue features a total of 13 articles. The first four articles are part of a special section on ‘‘Intelligent agents in e-services”, edited by Professors William K. Cheung and Jane Y. Hsu under the supervision of Professor Robert J. Kauffman. Summaries of articles appearing in the special section are provided in the guest editors’ introduction. The following is a summary of the nine regular submission articles also published in this issue. The review of these articles was kindly coordinated by Professor Jae Kyu Lee, former Editor in Chief of ECRA. The general submission articles in this issue focus on adoption issues, looking in particular at e-commerce adoption in Asia. They offer new insights on adoption models, using data collected in Korea and Taiwan. They also discuss adoption challenges faced by small businesses in New Zealand, online grocery stores in Singapore, businesses in China, and online portals in developing countries such as Nepal. Other topics covered in this issue include pricing of e-government services, automated e-commerce bargaining technologies, and electronic payment solutions. The first two articles look at models derived from social psychology research to help predict people’s adoption of Web technologies. In ‘‘A structural equation model of Internet acceptance in Korea”, Byung Gon Kim, Soon Chang Park and Kyoung Jun Lee present and analyze a model of Internet adoption that integrates Ajzen and Fishbein’s theory of reasoned action (TRA) and its extension by Davis in the technology acceptance model (TAM). The study was performed using data collected from 409 employees of 10 Korean companies spanning five industrial sectors. The authors’ analysis indicates that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have an important influence on an individual’s adoption of the Internet, whereas subjective norms, which reflect sensitivity to the opinions and expectations of colleagues, do not seem to be significant. In ‘‘Predicting consumer intentions to shop online: An empirical test of competing theories”, Hsiu-Fen Lin compares the TAM model and two variations of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to predict consumer intentions to shop online. The study is based on data collected from 297 Taiwanese customers of online bookstores.

74a4a501801ccb8b680d80b82da6ab1e89ade943	special issue on smart tourism: convergence of information technologies, experiences, and theories		The notion of smart tourism has been gaining currency recently, particularly as a strategic tool for tourism development. For instance, under the general framework of smart city initiatives, the European Commission (2015) has identified travel information and communication as one of the strategic objectives for improving human mobility and transportation. In emerging economies like China smart tourism is becoming an integral part of the national policy for economic development and overall improvement of service quality with the aide of information technology (CNTA 2015). Generally speaking, smart tourism aims to develop information and communication infrastructure and capabilities in order to improve management/ governance, facilitate service/product innovation, enhance the tourist experience, and, ultimately, improve the competitiveness of tourism firms and destinations (Gretzel et al. 2015; Hunter et al. 2015; Koo et al. 2015). Considering tourism is an important, and in many cases even primary, sector in national economies, smart tourism seems to offer a promising direction for sustainable tourism development and has the potential to impact tourist destinations and their representations in electronic markets at different levels. The notion of smart tourism was born against the backdrop of the recent development and diffusion of information technology that offers new modalities of communication, new ways for data collection, analysis and exchanges, and thus, new opportunities for value creation and management (Lazer et al. 2009). In the past decade or so, we have seen incredible growth of search technologies, online travel distribution channels, virtual tourism communities, and numerous forms of social media that allow travelers to make more convenient and smarter decisions (Sigala et al. 2012; Xiang et al. 2014). These technologies and systems are directly or indirectly connected to, or have impact on, various computerized reservation systems, which have long been integrated by the travel and tourism industry (Alt and Klein 2011; Kärcher 1995; Mitev 1999). The widespread adoption of mobile technology, especially the smartphone, seems to have further accelerated this trend with the convergence of information search, communication, entertainment, social networking as well as mobility-related functionalities to assist travelers on the go (Wang and Xiang 2012). Furthermore, the growing capabilities of embedding and connecting a variety of RFID tags, sensors and mobile devices into our physical environment seems to lead to a more optimistic view that now is the time for technological innovations in terms of co-creation processes and the management of tourist experiences (Atzori et al. 2010; Taafe 2014). While it is a phenomenon of growing significance, scholarly work on smart tourism is lacking, both conceptually and empirically. In response to this emerging need, the journal of Electronic Markets presents a special issue that disseminates * Chulmo Koo helmetgu@khu.ac.kr	backdrop cms;electronic markets;floor and ceiling functions;mobile device;multi-level governance;radio-frequency identification;sensor;smart city;smartphone;social media;theory;usb on-the-go;virtual tour;word lists by frequency	Ulrike Gretzel;Chulmo Koo;Marianna Sigala;Zheng Xiang	2015	Electronic Markets	10.1007/s12525-015-0194-x	computer science;knowledge management;marketing;management science	AI	-79.77723628703428	-7.77093755535254	76389

Use scenarios are increasingly being employed as a method for addressing issues facing the mbusiness community such as lack of adoption of technologies and services, usability issues, and the difficulty of designing technologies for a variety of users. Their use in the design of new mobile technologies enhances the likelihood that these technologies will be widely adopted to successfully exploit the wealth generating potential of the mobile wireless market. This paper reviews the place of use scenarios within user-centred design and then considers how scenarios have been used to date within mbusiness. We conclude with a discussion of the differences between empirically derived and fictional use scenarios, arguing for the importance of the former for grounding the design within its context of use.	design tool;mobile phone;usability;user-centered design	Kirsten C Sadler;Toni Robertson;Melanie Kan	2005	International Conference on Mobile Business (ICMB'05)	10.1109/ICMB.2005.109	simulation;human–computer interaction;systems engineering;engineering	HCI	-89.32251103774028	-5.980299083491538	76594

This study examines the factors influencing consumers' adoption of IPTV, a representative convergent service combining communication and media technologies. Applying innovation diffusion theory, we developed an adoption model reflecting the unique characteristics and usage contexts of IPTV. The results indicate that relative advantage, compatibility, trialability, content diversity, monetary value, personal innovativeness, and social influence have significant direct effects on the consumer's adoption of IPTV. In addition, the specific attributes of IPTV-interactivity, content diversity, and monetary value-have significant mediating effects on the consumer's adoption via relative advantage. These results not only provide practical insights into the consumer's acceptance of new convergent services but also help practitioners to plan their marketing strategies more effectively.	cuecat;iptv;interactivity	Dongwon Lee;Insoo Son;Myunghwan Yoo;Jong-Ho Lee	2011	2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2011.464	the internet;social influence;marketing;marketing strategy;advertising;consumer behaviour;commerce	HCI	-88.45237532917365	-9.27339763776599	76657

Therefore the exploitation of the capabilities that mobile phones has to offer seems promising for the development of the everyday life of the Cameroonian population. The aim of this paper is to stress the need of introducing mobile solutions in the everyday activities of Sub-Saharan countries such as Cameroon. Accordingly we suggest a m-commerce solution, called bayasella, that will boost the so called Bayam Sellam trading activity and will take advantage of the popularity that the use of mobile phones is gaining nowadays.	mobile commerce	Paul Dayang;Rebecca Siafaka	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-41178-6_16	environmental protection;economy;business;commerce	EDA	-80.18331291111691	-9.673318306027145	76954
ea811d31594bb675021adf30bcd181c714890d63	information sharing vs. privacy: a game theoretic analysis		Abstract Sharing cyber security information helps firms to decrease cyber security risks, prevent attacks, and increase their overall resilience. Hence it affects reducing the social security cost. Although previously cyber security information sharing was being performed in an informal and ad hoc manner, nowadays through development of information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs), cyber security information sharing has become more structured, regular, and frequent. This is while, the privacy risk and information disclosure concerns are still major challenges faced by ISACs that act as barriers in activating the potential impacts of ISACs. This paper provides insights on decisions about security investments and information sharing in consideration of privacy risk and security knowledge growth. By the latest concept i.e. security knowledge growth, we mean fusing the collected security information, adding prior knowledge, and performing extra analyses to enrich the shared information. The impact of this concept on increasing the motivation of firms for voluntarily sharing their sensitive information to authorities such as ISACs has been analytically studied for the first time in this paper. We propose a differential game model in which a linear fusion model for characterizing the process of knowledge growth via the ISAC is employed. The Nash equilibrium of the proposed game including the optimized values of security investment, and the thresholds of data sharing with the price of privacy are highlighted. We analytically find the threshold in which the gain achieved by sharing sensitive information outweighs the privacy risks and hence the firms have natural incentive to share their security information. Moreover, since in this case the threshold of data sharing and the security investment levels chosen in Nash equilibrium may be lower than social optimum, accordingly we design mechanisms which would encourage the firms and lead to a socially optimal outcome. The direct impact of the achieved results is on analyzing the way ISACs can convince firms to share their security information with them.	computer security;game theory;hoc (programming language);information sensitivity;privacy;social security	Mansooreh Ezhei;Behrouz Tork Ladani	2017	Expert Syst.

Furthermore, it may support the design of policies for sustaining the accumulation of scientific and technological capabilities.

The model incorporates different rationales for adoption and integration of interorganizational systems (IOS) namely the strategic choice perspective where adoption is voluntary with a view to improve organizational efficiency and performance and the institutional perspective where adoption is more a result of conforming to pressures from organizations within an organization's field of operation. Two technological factors (perceived benefit and perceived costs), three organizational readiness factors (top management support, financial readiness, IS infrastructure and capabilities) and three external environmental factors (perceived standards convergence, perceived consumer privacy and perceived stakeholder privacy) have been suggested as adoption and integration drivers from a strategic choice perspective while the three inter-organizational pressure factors (coercive, mimetic and normative pressures) have been proposed as predictors of adoption intent and expected integration from the institutional perspective .

The central issue facing the external auditor when evaluating IA work is the reliability of IA work. Reliability assessments are structured using the cascaded inference framework from behavioral decision theory, in which attributes of source reliability are explicitly modeled and combined using Bayes' rule in order to determine the inferential value of IA work. Results suggest that the inferential value of an IA report is highly sensitive to internal auditor reporting bias, but relatively insensitive to reporting veracity. Veracity refers to internal auditors' propensity to report truthfully, whereas bias refers to the propensity to misreport findings. Results also indicate that this sensitivity to reporting bias is conditional on the level of internal auditor competence, thus suggesting significant interaction effects between the objectivity and competence factors. Collectively, these findings suggest that the impact of source reliability attributes may be more complex than portrayed in the auditing standards and that recognizing these subtleties may lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness.

2638004d4fb14904364aa3a95a9b3775839b7da9	the evolution of social media and its impact on organizations and leaders		ABSTRACTThis paper examines organizational impacts of social media on Fortune 100 companies over a 5-year period (2011–2016). Specifically, the study focuses on three broad areas of social media impact: (1) the adoption of social media platforms across industries and business models from 2011 to 2016, (2) the influence of social media adoption on the roles of the chief information officer (CIO) and chief marketing officer (CMO) and their changing relationships in companies over this time frame, and (3) the impact of social media on company strategy, governance, and the IT (information technology) and marketing functions. The results support the contention that the CMO role has evolved to meet the technology needs of the marketing function and that the relationship between the CMO and CIO has taken on greater importance.

In developed countries, computers and the network infrastructure may very well be comparable to roads. But, as with roads, a computer and/or a network per se do nothing without a means to use them. We must have something equivalent to a car - the software! In this poster we explore whether we can build a public software grid based on free software that brings benefits to the state and to the individual.	computer;information superhighway	Duarte Alvim	2005		10.1145/1067445.1067607	simulation;developing country;software engineering;computer security	SE	-80.84436779219025	-9.182994901576858	78072

Three dimensions of the organizational ethics -- ethical optimism, corporate social responsibility, and top management action -- are investigated. The necessary data is collected by a survey conducted among 391 respondents in different regions of Poland. The results of this survey indicate that organizational ethics, in general, affect the job satisfaction of employees in transition economies. The highest job satisfaction seems to be in organizations where the top management propagate and enforce high ethical standards.

4c9261d58f9cfce6b01f841c2ec95ea0f7d5f595	intellectual capital management and university research group performance: mediating effects of machiavellianism and organisational narcissism		The purpose of the present study is to analyse the mediating effects of organisational Machiavellianism and narcissism on the relationship between intellectual capital management (ICM) and university research group performance (URGP). The hypothesis model is tested with a sample of 288 research groups from Colombian public and private universities, since these groups are responsible for producing knowledge in the country. For the data analysis, structural equations by the partial least squares method are used. The study results show that only organisational narcissism has a mediating effect, which is partial. In conclusion, the research group must adopt narcissistic behaviours and practices, which improve the perceptions it has of its members and of its own knowledge and capacities. In this way, the group will achieve greater presence in its knowledge area and academic spaces, which leads to a better exploitation of knowledge assets and to improvements in research group performance (RGP).

The different types of interorganizational relationships have different objectives and accordingly require different resources and capabilities. We construct a theoretical model that employs intuitions from multiple theories including political economics, transaction cost economics and the resource-based approach. The model argues that the relationship-specificity of the objectives of the interorganizational relationship (IOR) influences the interorganizational dependence and trust. The dependence and trust affect the investment of relationship-specific IOS related resources and subsequently, combinations of these resources produce relationship-specific IOS related capabilities. These capabilities support the relationship-specific IOR objectives.	computer simulation;interoperable object reference;sensitivity and specificity;theory	Mohammed Ibrahim	2004		10.1145/1052220.1052261	public relations;knowledge management;management science;business	AI	-82.03933257847463	4.015033705382544	78356

The authors propose to expand our perspective towards users’ welfare that becomes vulnerable when information systems (IS) are implemented by mandate, and suggest user satisfaction with IS as the appropriate measure of success. The authors are especially interested in the mandatory introduction and implementation of IS in organizations where users of such information systems are unsophisticated with limited educational background or IS experience, and whose job is relatively simple and labor-intensive. They hypothesized that information quality, system quality, and perceived usefulness are important factors for user satisfaction with mandatory IS. They also found that compatibility with work is a critical mediator through which the independent variables make significant influence on user satisfaction.

The study first identifies motivations for actors to continuously participate in co-innovation activities. Then, three discriminant functions are developed and cross-validated to classify actor groups, based on their level of willingness to participate in three types of behaviors: ideation, collaboration, and socialization. The results indicate that financial gains, entrepreneurship, and learning are significant predictors of ideation behaviors. Enjoyment and learning are strong indicators of collaboration, whereas networking, enjoyment, and altruism are most strongly related to socialization behaviors. These findings highlight three classes of SPD actors (Ideators, Collaborators, and Networkers) based on motivational differences. These classes provide a theoretically parsimonious model to predict the co-innovation behaviors in SPD and highlight the importance of platform design to appeal to different classes of potential contributors.

This is traceable to the process by which leaders emerge in these countries often through coup d'etats, revolutionary struggles, but more recently through flawed electoral processes. In most cases where elections have been undertaken, dissatisfaction of citizens with the outcomes have been a common result, due to both real and perceived vote frauds. This has led to colossal losses in terms of human lives, infrastructure, tourism opportunities and even ostracism of countries. To increase public confidence, citizen participation, and strengthen the electoral process in African countries, this paper proposes the widespread use of electronic voting machines and systems in the conduct of elections using Nigeria as case study. The proposed framework relies on the existence of Nigeria's global communications satellite, NigComSat as well as the country's growing IT-literate population while emphasizing simplicity without compromising the security of system processes. A deliberate policy to improve electricity supply and internet connectivity across the country will go a long way in overcoming the major infrastructure constraint against this framework. Furthermore, growing voter consciousness and political participation in the country is expected to result in a higher demand for improved transparency in the electoral process over time, a demand which the proposed electronic voting can potentially meet.	communications satellite;consciousness;internet access;traceability	Sanjo O.

Nevertheless, most of the RFID studies only discussed the applications or challenges of RFID technology; while rare attentions have been paid on empirically studying factors affecting the adoption of RFID in the retail chains. Drawing both on the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory and RFID technology, this paper assesses the influence of a set of environmental determinants on the intention to adopt RFID technology. Retail chains in Malaysia were chosen for an empirical survey; 77 valid data sets were obtained and SPSS software was used to analyze the research model. Research findings reveal that social uncertainty and competitive pressure are significantly associated with the adoption of RFID. Empirical result could provide as reference for government, RFID's system developer and retail companies in n advancing the RFID adoption.	automatic identification and data capture;logistic regression;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;real-time data;spss	Soleyman Paydar;Intan Rohani Endut;Ali Lajevardi	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technologies and Applications (RFID-TA)	10.1109/RFID-TA.2013.6694547	computer science;marketing;regression analysis	SE	-88.49525003187627	-5.911682515657686	78480

In this paper we develop an IT-RM success model based on Hofstede et al.’s (1990) framework involving five dimensions of culture. Each cultural dimension is described in terms of how it relates to the concept of knowledge sharing (KS) among organisation members and the successful implementation of IT-RM. Our contribution is to illustrate the utility of Hofstede et al.’s (1990) framework by linking the five general cultural dimensions into an organisation’s KS to propose a model of successful IT-RM implementation. Specifically, the aim of this study is to explore the roles of potential and realised KS cultures in IT-RM success. By doing so we present a necessary step in developing the concept of KS culture and moving towards a more comprehensive framework based on systemic empirical research.

From a theoretical point of view the specific structure of these networks is characterized by tensions: While on the one hand trust as well as informal control is of high importance in hub-and-spoke networks, on the other hand structural properties of these networks constitute the hub’s preference for efficient formal control, which, following a conventional view, undermines trust. Based on an exploratory case study and driven by socio-economic theory we develop a process model. The model is based on the concept of trust-sensitive context management that explains how the tensions are resolved by clarifying the relationship between different means of control (formal / informal) and different types of trust (personal trust / system trust).

However, there is a lack of empirical studies that examine the usage of cloud computing technology from an individual’s perspective. In fact, the adoption of cloud services in Middle Eastern counties like Saudi Arabia is still low compared with developed countries. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the end users' behavioural towards using cloud computing services in Saudi Arabia. In this paper, we propose an integrated model in an attempt to understand individuals’ attitudes and to identify the key factors that might impact on their behaviour to use cloud technology services. The proposed model integrates the critical factors from technology adoption theories Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), along with other factors to examine the effect of these variables on end users’ behaviour.	cloud computing;ibm tivoli access manager	Nouf Alkhater;Gary B.

Towards that end, the three research questions of this study are: “What are the most important factors affecting a user’s belief of ease of use and usefulness of kiosks?”, “Are there differences in these factors for different types of kiosks?” and “What are users’ desired improvements for the future?” Results indicated that the top four determinants of ease of use and usefulness are ease of operation (ease of use factor), data security (reliability and security of data factor), convenience (location factor) and reliability of data (reliability and security of data factor). Further analyses of the results highlighted that the factor reliability and security of data differed significantly amongst the different types of kiosks. Finally, while users of kiosks are found to be receptive of information kiosks, they have noticeable contributions and suggestions as to how information kiosks can better serve their needs in future. The more significant suggestions include making kiosks operate faster, introducing more functions, and improving user-friendliness. The paper ends with a section on implications for EC practitioners who may be developing and implementing kiosk applications.	data security;e-commerce;interactive kiosk;usability	Lai Tung	2001			observational error;beam (structure);gauge (instrument);computer security;interactive kiosk;usability;computer science;mill;mechanical engineering	Web+IR	-89.07605850866298	-7.463628669485545	79188

Although these machines take over tasks that have been executed by humans, they will not make human workforce obsolete. To leverage the potentials of ML, collaboration between humans and machines is necessary. Before collaboration processes can be developed, a classification of tasks in the field of ML is needed. Therefore, we present a taxonomy for the classification of tasks due to their complexity and the type of interaction. To derive insights about typical tasks and task-complexity, we conducted a literature review as well as a focus group workshop. We identified three levels of task-complexity and three types of interactions. Connecting them reveals three generic types of tasks. We provide prescriptive knowledge inherent in the task/interaction-taxonomy.	artificial intelligence;focus group;humans;interaction;machine learning;taxonomy (general)	Fabian Traumer;Sarah Oeste-Reiß;Jan Marco Leimeister	2017				AI	-89.80502493501758	2.2256703632668446	79202
1ffd1529f86047147a3f6edbd965e60ad538c6a8	ict for governance and policy modelling: visionary directions and research paths		The role of government in the society is undergoing continuous change, accelerated in the recent years due to the widespread adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). The legitimacy of governments’ actions is increasingly put into question, and it is recognised that the emergence of new and complex problems requires governments to collaborate with non-governmental actors in addressing societal challenges, for example, related to climate change or the financial crisis, moving into a new era in which the provision of public services is oriented towards the creation of public value and user empowerment. In recent years, we have assisted to a flourishing of user-driven ICT tools addressing public service delivery and administrative processes. But yet, this domain is still very much unchartered, led by bottom-up initiatives, with little consolidation, with mostly small-scale experiments, at the margin of government’s initiatives. In this context, consensus is starting to build around the potential that collaborative technologies have in the field of governance and policy modelling. However, in order for effective citizen empowerment and participation to become mainstream at a greater scale, several challenges will have to be faced, which will require new tools to be developed. The major research questions that come to the forefront concern which new ICT-enabled governance models and methods of monitoring, interaction, collaboration for policymaking and enforcement are emerging and which are the appropriate policy-modelling mechanisms that will effectively re-engage citizens in the decision-making process.

It is even more challenging to comply with foreign standards and laws, when a firm aims to internationalize its operations and remain competitive. This paper discusses the role of information security compliances in international diversification phenomena. Specifically, drawing from the organizational information processing theory, this paper proposes that the fit between knowledge management capabilities of a firm and the requirements of information security compliances influences the degree of international diversification of the firm. Unlike much of prior academic literature focusing on American firms, this paper discusses how certain American security compliances possess challenges for foreign firms to diversify their businesses in the US.

2e8fd71b50f3fbda4d13fd33c4eb4eea916325a3	a critique on participatory design in developmental context: a case study		The dimensions of understanding and involving users and their context while constructing a system have become important. Participatory Design has shown promising success in recent times. The concept of Participatory Design originates from developed countries [11, 13, 16, 17]. Its nature and methods are more oriented toward the Western setting where there is more privilege in terms of economy, education, and technology and a different socio-economic context. However, in the Developmental context, these presumptions may operate differently. In this paper, we critique the operationalization of Participatory Design in a healthcare case study in a developmental context. The study was conducted in urban-poor areas in a metropolitan city in India with 5 users individually, by a Designer and Public Health policy student. All users were recruited on the basis of their education (not more than 8th standard) and the age of their child (below 18 months). This paper reports findings on various factors such as social-cultural barriers, family power hierarchy, language barriers, power distance issues which affect and limit an attempt to facilitate Participatory Design in a developmental context.

In order to make a comparison, we also report on the findings of user assessment of the Electronic Filing and Payment System national tax survey (e-Tax) conducted at the same time. Our results show that the combined factors of TAM, IS Success and residents’ credibility are useful for system evaluation by residents of local governments.	ibm tivoli access manager;information systems;information system	Shinji Watanabe	2014	The Review of Socionetwork Strategies	10.1007/s12626-014-0049-5	public relations;actuarial science;marketing	HCI	-89.89746146074317	-9.751505813714203	79435

Therefore, the objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of MAS in service sector, mainly in banks as this sector is critical for future economy of the State of Qatar. This study surveyed the top management team in finance and accounting departments in banks about their prospective of MAS usefulness, the critical driving or resisting factors, and the financial and non-financial indicators that are affecting the implementation of the MAS in their banks. Surveys were distributed to 16 banks operating in Qatar. In addition, interviews were conducted with individual senior management and executive managers. The results of this study demonstrate that the highest demographic factor affecting the critical driver factors in implementing MAS is the experience of the employee in the organisation, because each experience category had different view in the import...

A recent survey shows that ‘‘Improve IT quality” is one of the top concerns facing IT executives. As IT quality is a multidimensional measure, it is important to determine what aspects of IT quality are critical to organizations to help Chief Information Officers (CIOs) to devise effective IT quality improvement strategies. In this research, we model the relationship between information systems’ (IS) quality and organizational impact. We hypothesize greater organizational impact in situations in which system quality, information quality and service quality are high. We also hypothesize a positive relationship between system quality and information quality. We test our hypotheses using survey data. Our structural equation model exhibits a good fit with the observed data. Our results show that IS service quality is the most influential variable in this model (followed by information quality and system quality), thus highlighting the importance of IS service quality for organizational performance. This paper contributes theoretically to IS success models through the system quality-to-information quality and IS quality-to-organizational impact links. Implications of our results for practice and research are discussed. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It considers questions of IS security as socially constructed and dependent on how people make sense of their context of work. The social representations perspective presented in this paper is especially useful to make sense of IS security from the point of view of various communities. The paper illustrates the relevance of this perspective by analyzing the differences and similarities in the way members of seven occupational communities (e.g., physicians, nurses, IS professionals) working in the same healthcare organization represent IS security. The paper finally draws the strategic implications for research and practice of considering the social representations of IS security. In particular, security and awareness programs should be customized to acknowledge that members of various communities ''know'' different things about security and that they react differently to various security initiatives.	information systems	Emmanuelle Vaast	2007	J.

This paper seeks to fill this void. We examine the concept of organizational learning capability (OLC), defined by dimensions of managerial commitment, systems perspective, openness and experimentation and transfer and integration to understand how firms can appropriate ERP systems to capture their potential benefits. Specifically, we examine the impact of OLC on ERP systems usage. We also incorporate the concept of user satisfaction to argue that OLC has an indirect effect on user satisfaction as well as a direct effect on ERP system usage. The empirical results show that OLC has a positive effect on user satisfaction. Besides, managerial commitment was found to have a positive effect on both user satisfaction and ERP system usage. Finally, user satisfaction was found to be a strong predictor of ERP system usage. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the analysis focuses on the role of embeddedness in infrastructure development. We expand on the notion of human infrastructure to develop the concepts of synergizing, leveraging, and aligning, which denote the active processes of creating and managing relationships among people, organizations, and technologies in the creation of cyberinfrastructure. This conceptual lens highlights how embeddedness is not only an important result of infrastructure development, but is also a precursor that can act as both a constraint and a resource for development activities.

Knowledge levels are not clearly conceptualized, nor are there clear devices for documenting knowledge transfers in terms of knowledge levels. This paper presents the methods of a qualitative research approach for measuring knowledge transfer directly in terms of knowledge. The paper specifically addresses the commonly avoided dimension of knowledge, depth. The methods are derived from a real-life comparative case study exploring knowledge sharing in product development. Our focused interview approach has been refined to avoid unproductive digressions by the subjects and certain forms of bias, yet still obtain rich accounts of project events. Evidence of transfer obtained by the interviews is analysed in terms of three knowledge dimensions: scope, depth and action. Methods for aggregating and interpreting data are discussed and an operational flowchart for knowledge transfer coding is proposed.

55785d4588c050ee841e3002cb180257f49f8e6f	governing the fiduciary relationship in information security services		We propose a model of security governance that draws upon agency theory to conceptualize the InfoSec function as a fiduciary for business users. We introduce a ternary typology of governance and test the efficacy of governance on goal congruence and information asymmetry. Our survey of information security managers finds that: (1) governance enhances goal congruence but does not impact information asymmetry, and (2) perceived information security service effectiveness is positively related to both information asymmetry and goal congruence. Contrary to what agency theory suggests, in the InfoSec context, information asymmetry can be exactly what is needed to enhance the principal's welfare. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.	information security	Yu Andy Wu;Carol Stoak Saunders	2016	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2016.09.008	public relations;actuarial science;information governance;marketing;management	ECom	-85.3639447021709	-6.6343468150291525	80651

The research focuses on three important dimensions, namely knowledge, ICT and human capital. This study adopts a modified Delphi technique to seek the important dimensions that can contribute to the development of Malaysian's KS. The Delphi technique involved ten experts in a five-round iterative and controlled feedback procedure to obtain consensus on the important dimensions and to verify the proposed definition of KS. The finding shows that all three dimen- sions proposed initially scored high and moderate consensus. Round One (R1) proposed an initial definition of KS and required comments and inputs from the panel. These inputs were then used to develop items for a R2 questionnaire. In R2, 56 out of 73 items scored high consensus and in R3, 63 out of 90 items scored high. R4 was conducted to re-rate the new items, in which 8 out of 17 items scored high. Other items scored moderate consensus and no item scored low or no consensus in all rounds. The final round (R5) was employed to verify the final definition of KS. Findings and discovery of this study are significant to the definition of KS and the development of a framework in the Malaysian context.	delphi method;knowledge society;object pascal	Norsiah Abdul Hamid;Halimah Badioze Zaman	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04757-2_20	definition;knowledge management;data mining;knowledge;management	HCI	-85.35910109542547	2.289844349099745	80697

Countries from Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin American and South Asia were selected for the study. Prior research has investigated E-gov growth, development, and diffusion across both the developed and developing worlds. While such a focus is useful for comparative analyses at a global level, it is however argued that more useful information will emerge to enrich insight when research efforts particularly focus attention on issues in emerging parts of the world. Very few researchers have studied the factors influencing E-gov maturity in TEDC and with the approach employed in this present research. Using relevant theoretical frameworks, this research identified and examined the impact of 9 environmental factors of socio, political, economic, and technological dimensions on E-gov maturity in TEDC. A 5-year panel data consisting of 320 observations or data points was used in conjunction with the ordinary least squares (OLS) technique. This research also provided analyses for each of the selected sub-regions to enhance insight. Overall, the results showed that the availability of quality human resource, technological infrastructure, innovative capacity, wealth, rule of law, and transparency levels are important factors that positively impact E-gov maturity in TEDC. The implications of the study's findings for research and policy making are discussed. Future research avenues are also highlighted.	capability maturity model;data point;e-government;ordinary least squares;panel data	Princely Ifinedo	2011	DATA BASE	10.1145/2096140.2096147	development economics;economics;developing country;human resources;marketing;economy;management;economic growth	HCI	-77.88738389158601	-6.29237209190665	80825

95b8e6043d599ad5434bf2745786a8eee0a2ac60	imperative ethical behaviours in making systems development and deployment compliant with health & safety and wellbeing		Literature on systems development has been progressively identifying the importance of social aspects in systems development, to the extent that this process has been considered a socio-technical system. More often than not there is a failure of participants in the recognition, and fulfilment, of ethical duties concerning the concepts of health and safety and wellbeing. The purpose of normative ethics is to scrutinise moral standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, the ultimate goal being the identification of the true human good. A rational appeal can be made to normative defensible ethical rules in order to arrive at a judicious, morally justifiable judgement. In this paper our first step is to report on the findings of a literature review, which presents the current health and safety issues concerning usage of computers in organisations and the workplace. Secondly, we identify and list some basic generic Deontological and Teleological moral principles and theories that can serve as normative guidelines for addressing the issues pinpointed in the initial step. Thirdly, we prescribe a set of moral rights and duties that must be exercised and fulfilled by protagonists in systems development and software engineering in order for them to exhibit moral behaviour. Each of these suggested actions are substantiated via an appeal to one, or a number of the normative guidelines, identified in the second step. By identifying, and recommending a set of defensible moral obligations that must be fulfilled in the development and deployment of systems, protagonists such as: project managers, software engineering teams, systems analysts, clients, etc. can fulfil their ethical duties, thus increasing the likelihood a deployed system that is compliant with principles of health and safety and wellbeing of its users. Ultimately systems development and deployment must be underpinned with ethical consideration.	imperative programming;software deployment	Harjinder Rahanu;Elli Georgiadou;Kerstin V.

Many social theories have been used in these studies. Some include the theory of reasoned action, Ajzen & Fishbein (1975); diffusion of innovations, Rogers (1983); economics of technology, Arthur (1985), social cognitive theory, Bandura (1986) and technology acceptance model, Davis, Bogozzi & Warshaw (1989). However, investigations to date have been inconclusive about the ability of any of these theories to be conclusive about all the complexities found in the innovation decision-making process of adoption of information technology within an organization. In this study we further investigate one heretofore unapprised aspect of the theory of diffusion of innovations. We re-present Everett M. Rogers’ theoretical model and test his perceived characteristics of innovations (PCIs) along with others more recent contributions to this area at pre-diffusion stage to explore the theories fuller predictive ability for developing rates of acceptance of innovations. We select innovative licensing agreements developed by extreme social groups known as “Free Software or Open Source Software projects,” e.g. GPL, LGPL, BSD and MIT agreements. We conduct a survey of Linux Users Groups for perceptions with the same instrument used for testing other innovations by Moore & Benbasat (1991), Agarwal & Prasad (1997) and Van Slyke, Lou & Day (2002). We include in our instrument the validated intention to use (ITU) measure developed by Van Slyke, Lou & Day, (2000). We conduct a pilot study. We make adjustment to the instrument for clarity and presentation. Then we conduct a final survey. This research in process study identifies our theoretical foundation and the methodology of our research for re-presenting Rogers (1983), Moore & Benbasat (1991), Agarwal & Prasad (1997) and Van Slyke, Lou & Day enhanced model at pre-diffusion stage of innovations.	bsd;game theory;information systems research;linux;moore machine;open-source software	Frank Valier;Richard V.

It is likely to make a deep influence on business activities, consumer behavior, and national and global markets. Thus the identification of factors that impact mobile commerce adoption will have significant value. This paper identified nine factors affecting mobile commerce adoption by consumers, based on recently published research. Multiple comparisons in China and United States were conducted to clarify the applicability of these factors in the two regions. A survey was conducted on 190 individual mobile commerce users in China and US. We found significant differences among the antecedents and their impact on consumers’ intentions to use mobile commerce. The study also draws a number of practical insights and provides vendors seeking to enter the Chinese and US marketplace with specific information about m-commerce users’ perceptions and intentions.	mobile commerce	Hua Dai;Prashant Palvia	2008			computer science;consumer behaviour;china;marketing;mobile telephony;mobile commerce	HCI	-88.41805596025914	-9.226251377870629	81574

We develop a construct called Virtual Distance ® that includes temporal, spatial and relational facets and apply it to 115 project teams. We propose that virtual distance will influence trust, goal clarity and organizational citizenship and will indirectly have an influence on innovativeness and project success. Our results showed that virtual distance had significant influences on trust, goal clarity and OCB and indirectly influenced innovation and success. The results have implications for the selection and management of teams that are geographically dispersed and interact virtually.

41a58749f0be2b53df4acb19604e9de73d2bd548	explaining consumer satisfaction of services: the role of innovativeness and emotion in an electronic mediated environment	trust;electronic mediated environment;consumer satisfaction;innovativeness;risk;emotion	"""a r t i c l e i n f o The services section has started to dominate economic activity in many industrialized economies since the last decade. The growth of services in Electronic Mediated Environment (EME) has changed the manner in which firms and consumers interact. Drawing on such theoretical foundations as trust, risk perceptions, trying, emotion, and satisfaction, this study proposes an integrative research model to investigate the relationships among these constructs in the EME context. We collected data from 415 consumers and found that consumer innovativeness and emotion are significant antecedents of trust, risk perception of service, perceived benefits, and service quality. These important factors will influence consumer satisfaction in EME. This empirical investigation breaks a new ground for future studies to understand and gauge the influence of innovativeness and emotion in emerging IT artifacts such as EME services. The service sector has become quantitatively the most essential sector in the world economy over the last decade. It now leads economic activities in a wide variety of industrialized economies. According to CIA World Factbook [14], the service industry accounted for 76.8% and 73.1% of the U.S. and European Union gross domestic product in 2011, respectively. Concurrently, there are more service companies on the list of Future 500 companies than before. Given the precipitously growing rate of the service section, technologically empowered advancements of information technology (IT) and the ever developing Internet are constantly galvanizing today's organizations to more effectively and efficiently coordinate with their constituents via the value-added electronic services (e-services) conduit. Furthermore, the mushrooming growth of e-commerce reflects the increasingly paramount role of IT in e-services while IT spurs the influx of e-service economy across the Internet. It is apparent that Information Systems (IS) plays a crucial role in EME because contemporary organizations have to leverage IT to improve business performance and assist the communication and service delivery amid various value-chain constituents. Consumers play a focal role in the paradigmatic change from the exchange of goods towards a service-centered model of exchange as found in both IS and marketing literature [73]. In this study, the conceptual definition of services in EME is based on Dai and Salam [19] and thereafter refers to the """" services being facilitated by IT where the consumer interacts with a proper user interface including web site, mobile phone, social media, virtual world environment, tablets, etc., so as to gain a consumption …"""	e-commerce;e-services;encrypted media extensions;focal (programming language);futures studies;itil;information system;internet;mobile phone;social media;theoretical definition;user interface;virtual world	Hua Dai;Xin Luo;Qinyu Liao;Mukun Cao	2015	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2014.12.003	public relations;emotion;computer science;marketing;risk;commerce	HCI	-85.8763148786832	-9.68823149430799	82127

At the group level, we hypothesize that the network pattern of competence and warmth perceptions among group members determines the amount of leadership exhibited leadership structure density and the degree to which the emergent leadership structure is centralized or shared leadership structure centralization. We then identify two individual-level mechanisms underlying these group-level effects: a individuals' identification with the group and b the differentiation of leader-prototypical roles within the group. Using social network analysis, we test these hypotheses in a sample of 255 MBA consulting teams working full time on projects in 41 different countries over seven weeks. Our findings establish the emergent nature of leadership structures in self-managing teams and foreground interpersonal perceptions as an explanation for why emergent, informal leadership structures vary across teams.	emergence	D.

We examine the effectiveness of two group structures for such tasks—the team structure, in which the group works together in time and space, and the hybrid structure, in which individuals first work independently and then work together. We define the performance of a group as the quality of the best ideas identified. Prior research has defined performance as the average quality of ideas or the number of ideas generated, ignoring what most organizations seek, a few great ideas. We build a theory that relates organizational phenomena to four different variables that govern the quality of the best ideas identified: (1) the average quality of ideas generated, (2) the number of ideas generated, (3) the variance in the quality of ideas generated, and (4) the ability of the group to discern the quality of the ideas. We test this theory with an experiment. We find that groups organized in the hybrid structure are able to generate more ideas, to generate better ideas, and to better discern the quality of the ideas they generate. Moreover, we find that the frequently recommended brainstorming technique of building on others’ ideas is counterproductive; teams exhibiting such buildup neither create more ideas, nor are the ideas that build on previous ideas better.	experiment	Karan Girotra;Christian Terwiesch;Karl T.

For the innovations to be inclusive there is need to reframe IS design through local perspectives. I hope to develop and test a conceptual framework that will reconceptualise the user participation construct by locating it in a developing country context and to explore how this local context influences user participation's relation with system success.  On this basis, the goal of this study is to develop a framework that focuses on the multi-dimensional aspects of user participation in system design and the objectives of are to (1) identify the different dimensions of user participation in a developing country context, and (2) determine the best approach to user participation in a successful IS solution for a developing country user.	mobile payment;money;systems design	Juliet Ongwae	2014		10.1145/2662155.2662245	user modeling;computer user satisfaction;knowledge management;environmental resource management;commerce	HCI	-79.32309567223295	-6.9391163938230465	82651

The involvement of citizens in this process is crucial and measuring participation in process allows for assessment of the effectiveness of participation. Measuring the maturity of this decision, i.e. assessment of individual participation and its consequent reflection on the group’s decision, can be accomplished through the maturity level method discussed in this paper. In order to accomplish an examination of the relative potential and difficulties in achieving and measuring e-participation, we found it necessary to have a reasonable level of information structuring. For this purpose, online surveys were built and tested in stages, structured according to the Government-Citizen Interactive Model in a way as to support the Maturity of Decision-Making method (MDM).

Knowledge workers supposedly organize and manage their workplaces, at least partly themselves, which needs to be considered when designing ICT for supporting their daily knowledge-intense activities. It is considered useful for designers of knowledge management systems (KMS) to look into the results of behavioral science in information systems concerning the adoption, acceptance and assimilation of ICT. Thus, this paper proposes a model that contributes to bridging the gap between design science and behavioral science in the domain of knowledge management. In this regard, widely recognized behavioral models that aim at explaining organizational and human behavior in conjunction with ICT are analyzed in order to extract important factors influencing the successful application of KMS with respect to the adoption by an organization or organizational unit, acceptance by individual knowledge workers, and assimilation into knowledge processes and practices. By combining, categorizing, and structuring these factors, we developed a comprehensive model to be taken into account in software design and evaluation processes from various perspectives. Moreover, we discuss a case example in which this model is applied to the design of a KMS.	bridging (networking);categorization;data assimilation;information system;knowledge management;organizational unit (computing);software design;systems design	Maximilian Hecht;Ronald Maier;Isabella Seeber;Gabriela Waldhart	2011		10.1145/2024288.2024297	organizational learning;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain	HCI	-77.96957114267524	0.8414975356493081	83123

This study presents a case study of motivations of women to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in a ubiquitous information environment. This study follows an interpretive paradigm to explore an understanding of culture and gender in a middle-class Indian context. Women in this report varied in terms of heavy/light and mandatory/voluntary use. We discuss the implications of such variations in terms of technology adoption for digital inclusion. Social factors, such as the role of parents and social communities, were found to influence women to develop and maintain interests in ICT that were reflected in their professional and personal lives. Some women were slow to adapt to ICT use as they tended to adhere to normative expectations which hindered ICT use. Women tend to have greater ICT use if it is for fulfilling familial roles and for communication.		Anindita Paul;Kim M.

Empirical results suggest that institutional forces and IS resources significantly influence the enterprise systems adoption, which indirectly impacts the enterprise systems assimilation. Further, the enterprise systems adoption significantly influences business performance, and the enterprise systems assimilation mediates the effect of the enterprise systems adoption on business performance.	data assimilation;enterprise system	Kuo-Chung Chang;Yoke May Seow	2016	IS Management	10.1080/10580530.2016.1220215	enterprise system;enterprise software;computer science;knowledge management;integrated enterprise modeling;digital firm;database;institutional theory;enterprise data management;enterprise architecture;enterprise integration;management;enterprise planning system;enterprise information security architecture;enterprise information system;business architecture;enterprise life cycle	OS	-81.13996818338357	3.5517938541829097	83701

The lack of clear guidance on how to share government data can potentially harm Freedom of Information and or Data Protection rights. This article addresses this issue by drawing from the main concerns governments have when dealing with Freedom of Information and Data Protection issues. As illustration, we comment on the findings of a case study we have conducted in a Local Authority in the United Kingdom (UK). Our findings show that local government managers might be struggling to adequately implement Freedom of Information and Data Protection aspects. Cultural aspects are subtly present in this context, as managers' values and beliefs regarding public access to information might be biased toward either information disclosure or information withholding.	e-government;freedom of information laws by country;information privacy;information security	Luciano Batista;Marc Cornock	2009	Journal of Information, Law and Technology		computer science;knowledge management;data protection act 1998;computer security;information protection policy	HCI	-79.52514057714912	-5.616586115237531	83878

Some people support the government’s intervention because MWN services seem to fit in the “public goods” category and result in “positive externality” (Cornes and Sandler, 1986). However, others are suspicious of the efficacy of the government’s intervention based on the competing New Institutional Economics (NIE) theory (Williamson, 2000; Cheung, 2002). Backed with the theoretical arguments of property rights and transaction costs, we critique the welfare economics policy recommendation which calls for government interventions. We predict that city governments will contract with private firms in developing MWN and will contribute city owned radio frequency and streetlights in the production of MWN services. Our initial findings from an empirical study confirm this proposition. Our study contributes to the MIS research on the emerging phenomenon by introducing NIE and provides practitioners with valid policy recommendations.	numerical weather prediction;radio frequency;schmidt decomposition	Lin Ngo;William Haseman	2006			empirical research;public economics;externality;public good;new institutional economics;transaction cost;property rights;government;economics;phenomenon	HCI	-80.32498126492041	-7.228627637905828	83901

RFID can scan devices in their proximity and report the data to information systems. RFID in healthcare settings presents potential security and privacy concerns to the people and processes being tracked by the devices -- particularly healthcare workers including nurses and doctors. This research presents a theoretical model that will assess the effect of six independent variables: cognitive factors, perception of external control, privacy concerns regarding surveillance and RFID devices, subjective norms, existence of security policy, and persistence of data on three dependent variables, medical staff perceived usefulness of RFID, intention to use RFID, and actual use of RFID. The model is validated with an empirical study. The results suggest that cognitive factors, persistence of data captured through RFID, and the awareness of the existence of security policy influence medical staff members' use of RFID in hospitals.	information system;persistence (computer science);privacy;radio frequency;theory	Thomas G.

889634b4129dc28b0012dd6b0867db47be5eae3e	information sharing and knowledge sharing as communicative activities		Introduction. This paper elaborates the picture of information sharing and knowledge sharing as forms of communicative activity. Method. A conceptual analysis was made to find out how researchers have approached information sharing and knowledge sharing from the perspectives of transmission and ritual. The findings are based on the analysis of one hundred and two key studies characterising the above viewpoints. Results. Information sharing and knowledge sharing represent similar communicative activities when looked at from the viewpoints of transmission and ritual communities. The former view emphasises one-way communication from sender to recipients, and the sharing activity appears as transfer, diffusion or provision of information or knowledge. From the ritual point of view, the sharing activity has been conceptualised in terms of exchange depicting two-way communication between interacting participants. The activities of knowledge sharing have mainly been examined in work-related contexts, while information sharing has also been investigated in non-work contexts. Conclusions. As communicative activities, information sharing and knowledge sharing have more similarities than differences. However, the terminological questions become more complicated if the focus is shifted to what exactly is being shared while sharing information or knowledge, due to multiple interpretations of the concepts of information and knowledge.	information;interaction;one-way function;point of view (computer hardware company)	Reijo Savolainen	2017	Inf.

It also suggests ways in which IS research can inform the development of activity theory. In this way, this paper seeks to be forward-looking as much as reflective to advance an enlarged understanding of activity theory, and argue for its development in IS studies. Design/methodology/approach The paper is conceptual and draws upon existing literature and research to propose and cultivate an updated understanding of activity theory as a theoretical lens capable of accounting for social and technical aspects in IS. Findings The paper has three aims. First, to cultivate the use of activity theory in IS.

This paper examines the capacity of the research designs of 37 empirical studies of information systems (IS) effectiveness to provide a basis for the development of theories about behaviour related to IS effectiveness. The power of each study to support causal inference was evaluated in terms of (a) its handling of the time dimension, (b) its ability to weigh differences and (c) its resistance to internal validity threats that pose alternative explanations for its reported findings. Of the reviewed studies, 29.7% could account for the time dimension, 32.4% employed a comparison group and 16.2% were not susceptible to any internal validity threats. Only 13.5% of the studies combined an accounting for the time dimension with the use of a comparison group. Of these, however, only 5.4% were also invulnerable to internal validity threats. The research designs of nearly 95% of these published studies were deficient in supporting causal inference. In those studies, suggestions that one variable was causally related to another variable could not be substantiated. Encouragement for the future capacity of IS effectiveness research to support causal inference was found in a trend towards the use of quasiexperimental designs. Recommendations are made regarding ways to increase the inferential capacity of research designs employed in the study of IS effectiveness.		William J. Haga;Moshe Zviran	1994	Inf. Syst.

We motivate the need for the method by pointing out that, although much has been done to accommodate blind users’ accessibility to systems, little formal research has addressed the need to include members of this large and growing population in RE activities. We develop objectives for a method to address three problems that potentially affect such participation.

This research study was designed to broaden understanding of the behavioral nature of publishing research datasets by distinguishing between the intention to share and the action of sharing. The data was generated from preliminary survey results conducted by Data ONE work groups. The final data used in this paper is based on 587 observations. The analysis results show support for all of the path coefficients of the theoretical model except for the path of perceived self-efficacy, and legal context and policy variables. The intention to share a dataset was found to be a significant determinant in the action of sharing data. Acknowledging the key determinants of intention to publish datasets arguably entails significant policy implications on data sharing.	path coefficient;policy-based design;theory	Djoko Sigit Sayogo;Theresa A.

It is based on ethnographic field work, participant observation and interviews supplemented with video recordings from a control room responsible for operating a microgravity greenhouse at the International Space Station (ISS). Drawing on examples from different stages of a biological experiment on the ISS, we demonstrate how engineers, researchers and technicians work to anticipate and proactively mitigate possible problems. Space research is expensive and risky. The experiments are planned over the course of many years by a globally distributed network of organizations. Owing to the inaccessibility of the ISS, every trivial detail that could possibly cause a problem is subject to scrutiny. We discuss what we label anticipatory work: practices constituted of an entanglement of cognitive, social and technical elements involved in anticipating and proactively mitigating everything that might go wrong. We show how the nature of anticipatory work changes between planning and the operational phases of an experiment. In the planning phase, operators inscribe their anticipation into technology and procedures. In the operational phase, we show how troubleshooting involves the ability to look ahead in the evolving temporal trajectory of the ISS operations and to juggle pre-planned fixes along these trajectories. A key objective of this paper is to illustrate how anticipation is shared between humans and different forms of technology. Moreover, it illustrates the importance of including considerations of temporality in safety and reliability research.	align (company);distributed cognition;experiment;field research;global network;imperative programming;quantum entanglement;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;relevance;situated;work systems	Jens Petter Johansen;Petter Grytten Almklov;Abdul Basit Mohammad	2015	Cognition, Technology & Work	10.1007/s10111-015-0357-8	psychology;procedure;simulation;human–computer interaction;engineering;anticipation;social psychology;psychological resilience;mechanical engineering	HCI	-82.17507622944532	-4.189209754913644	84320

Despite a proliferation of literature on knowledge sharing, most studies focused on such practice within an organization. The question of how to achieve effective interorganizational knowledge sharing remains unanswered. This study intends to answer this research question using the results from a case study of a software implementation project. Collaboration between software vendors and clients in information systems development/implementation projects require considerable amount of knowledge exchange between the partners. Differences in organizational culture, knowledge domain, as well as other critical factors, pose major challenge for interorganizational knowledge sharing. To be able to observe the impact of these critical factors on interorganizational knowledge sharing, the knowledge sharing processes between organizations should first be thoroughly explored. While effectiveness of knowledge sharing may be viewed from different theoretical disciplines, we draw our analysis based on organizational learning perspective	information system;software development process	Nongkran Lertpittayapoom;Souren Paul;Peter Mykytyn	2007	2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)	10.1109/HICSS.2007.41	organizational learning;organizational culture;knowledge integration;knowledge economy;computer science;knowledge management;mathematical knowledge management;knowledge engineering;management science;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;management;information system;domain knowledge	AI	-79.42150293027053	2.824487078315155	84347

Regression analysis results demonstrate that system analysts and programmers differ in terms of influencing factors on creative self-efficacy. Domain-specific skills were the main influence in the system analyst model, followed by degree centrality. In comparison, degree centrality was the only influence in the programmer model. Degree centrality exerted a negative influence in both groups. Additionally, among system analysts, the strength of ties slightly influenced creative self-efficacy, while computer self-efficiency and domain-specific information technology skills exerted only small influences on programmers.	information system;programmer	Heng-Li Yang;Hsiu-Hua Cheng	2009	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2008.10.005	psychology;self-efficacy;programming;social science;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;sociology;empirical research;creativity;social psychology;information technology;information system;regression analysis;social network	HCI	-87.08220829576028	2.9629575669462986	84364

Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual framework encompassing th\e concepts of service recovery, communication, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in the commercial bank setting is developed. A questionnaire is designed to focus on issues related to efforts made to investigate causes of service failure and to develop recovery strategies that meet customer expectations of how their banks should handle such problems. Findings – Results show that communication had a significant relationship with service recovery and that higher levels of redress independently increase positive consumer responses. The findings also show that the interaction of employee responsiveness and courtesy can also have a positive impact on consumer evaluations. Satisfaction was highest and negative word-of-mouth intentions lowest only under conditions of high responsiveness and courtesy. Research limitations/implications – Service recovery is process-oriented, and does not assess whether the reported problem that led to the actual complaint has been resolved. This aspect of the study opens a number of directions for future research with the goal of increasing the still limited understanding of service recovery issues in commercial banks. To achieve an in-depth view, a more comprehensive qualitative study that pursues the same research questions may be appropriate. Practical implications – An implication is that, when managing complaints related to customer dissatisfaction, the approaches undertaken by service quality leaders should aim to provide just resolutions/fairness in service recovery. This study also provides insight into a company’s customer relationship management practices. However, in order to encourage customers to complain directly, a company, if complained to, needs to enhance the perception of a possible outcome. Originality/value – A conceptual framework is developed and used to investigate the relationship between service recovery, consumer satisfaction and loyalty.	customer relationship management;fairness measure;responsiveness	Mabel Komunda;Aihie Osarenkhoe	2012	Business Proc.

32c7ae39bf178fd5953f74b7f7c0ab689f6068d9	cultural emergence in global is/it outsourcing		In the contemporary business environment, Global Outsourcing (GLOS) and global networks are used to achieve strategic and economic advantages, with customer-supplier relationships spanning across not only countries but also continents. In this global context, culture and culture-related issues are factors that affect GLOS relationships and collaboration. Building on areas of existing research, the paper examines literature on culture and IS/IT outsourcing, and focuses on the emergence of culture in a GLOS-specific context. GLOS culture is examined through a cultural systems perspective, which normative research shows to be able to effectively reflect issues of emergence, change, and dynamism. Using an interpretivist qualitative methodology and a thematic analysis of case studies of a customer-supplier automotive network across Europe and Asia, cultural emergence was found to be related to four categories of cultural attributes: ABC (attitudes, behaviors, and cognition), context, interactivity, and regulation. To address cultural emergence, the paper focuses on the analysis of specific mechanisms and processes that play a role towards the emergent GLOS culture. Understanding them through the dimensions of dynamism, scale, and motivation, the paper discusses their role in cultural emergence and discusses benefits for researchers and practitioners.	emergence;outsourcing	Danai Tsotra;Laurence Brooks;Guy Fitzgerald	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24815-3_6	knowledge management;political science;management science;management	AI	-79.28956295741027	-1.3997959135332187	84642
17a4d4eb2cc63857ddaee19cfbb020636d6644e2	divide and conquer? the role of governance for the adaptability of industrial districts		This paper develops a simulation model of the behavior of industrial districts in the face of changes in their environment. By applying Kauffman’s N/K-C model to the question of optimum governance in industrial districts facing an external shock, the paper sheds light on the optimum co-ordination mechanism among agents in interdependent industrial networks. Simulation results indicate that collective governance structures with agents adjusting for the sake of the district as a whole perform best in adaptation, whereas individualistic governance modes deliver the worst results. Alliance and leader firm governance forms position themselves in-between these two extremes. However, both modes of governance can be preferable to the collective one if the observation and punishment mechanisms in the district’s local culture are not strong enough to impose solidarity among its agents. In this case, a prisoner’s dilemma emerges and the collective governance form is replaced by the inferior individualistic one. Through these results, the model highlights the link between governance and district adaptability. It provides an explanation for the trend in Italian districts towards more hierarchical governance structures. Moreover, the identification of the role played by governance structure for district adaptability in changing environments could serve as guidance for future research.	collective intelligence;interdependence;prisoner's dilemma;simulation	Kerstin Press	2007	Advances in Complex Systems	10.1142/S0219525907000957	alliance;dilemma;divide and conquer algorithms;financial economics;adaptability;interdependence;solidarity;project governance;public relations;economic system;corporate governance;economics	AI	-86.98764569096339	3.560807427166459	84794

At the same time, digital innovations, as part of evolving information infrastructures, are becoming increasingly prevalent in healthcare. In this paper, we adopt a Schönian approach to understand how a medical professional, who is not an IS designer by trade, engages in the design of digital practice — turning what may appear as a failed digital innovation effort into a successful design of digital practice. Our inquiry suggests three pragmatic principles that call for further investigation: (a) professionals can make a significant contribution to design work by inventing means for fact-based, reflective engagement with the situation; (b) the reorganization of work practice involves organizational design, information system design, and communication design; and (c) developing design as digital practice entails the development of fact-based design practice and must engage practical theories.	emoticon;information system;systems design;theory	Mark Aakhus;Pär J.

This is a critical problem because on the one hand, organizations who use but do not understand the discriminatory potential of such systems will facilitate the widening of social disparities under the assumption that algorithms are categorically objective. On the other hand, the responsible use of machine learning can help us measure, understand, and mitigate the implicit historical biases in socially sensitive data by expressing implicit decision-making mental models in terms of explicit statistical models. In this paper we specify, implement, and evaluate a “fairness-aware” machine learning interface called themis-ml, which is intended for use by individual data scientists and engineers, academic research teams, or larger product teams who use machine learning in production systems.	algorithm;data science;fairness measure;machine learning;mental model;statistical model	Niels Bantilan	2017	CoRR		application programming interface;socioeconomic status;knowledge management;psychology;machine learning;statistical model;artificial intelligence;end-to-end principle	ML	-91.92819383677205	-3.1368275813317594	85234

Because of the difficulties and importance in researching emergent behavior in network organizations, this review summarizes the main aspects of 17 papers and tries to disclose open research points by combining the different perspectives of behavior and forms of NOs. Due to the complexity of those organizations, there are several “soft aspects” that affect the partnership implicitly. In particular, trust is intertwined with other facets (e.g. legal aspects). IT governance and IT systems can have an impact on trust and vice versa. Therefore, maintaining a trustworthy relationship in a network organization is undoubtedly an enormous challenge for all participants. At the end of this literature review, we discuss some open research gaps like the influence of different cultures in NOs or the visualization of emergent behavior.	emergent;network governance;open research;systematic review;trust (emotion)	Marcel Morisse;Bettina Horlach;Wiebke Kappenberg;Jurate Petrikina;Florian Robel;Florian Steffens	2014	2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2014.561	public relations;computer science;knowledge management;management science;trustworthy computing;management;law	HCI	-80.00169912506917	-0.8248846667678879	85241

To address this knowledge gap, using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theory and the literature on citizen engagement (or participation); we posit that information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, lack of citizen orientation (in form of low ethics and high corruption), and institutional regulations will have both direct relationship with EGSQ and indirect relationship with EGSQ through the mediating effects of e-participation. Based on publicly available archival data from 123 countries, our preliminary results supported the hypothesized model. More specifically, ICT infrastructure, lack of citizen orientation, institutional regulations, and e-participation had a direct relationship with EGSQ. Further, eparticipation fully mediated the relationship of ICT infrastructure and institutional regulations with EGSQ. Results also indicate that the relationship of lack of citizen orientation with EGSQ was not mediated by e-participation. Implications of our preliminary findings and future plans of our research are highlighted.	cross-sectional data;e-government;icis;itil;information systems;kerrison predictor;nam;quality of service;switzerland;theory	Satish Krishnan;Thompson S.

35d5a33ae258cd9f7f66d53a99892319f2c62f12	strategic information systems alignment - a decision support application for the internet era	decision support;information system	Strategic information systems planning, SISP, methods have proven organisationally complex to utilise, despite 40 years of research and evolution of Information Systems, IS, in the organisational context. The diverse nature of organisational strategy and environmental factors have been mooted as primary causes. On one hand, confusion exists in the literature due to divergent, deficient definitions of SISP. On the other, a lack of distinction exists between SISP as a planning process, and the broader alignment of organisational direction with the IS capability that provides the context for sustainable IS intellectual and cultural integration. Consequently, no methods or models for alignment of IS and organisational activities exist that have both validity in the literature and sustainability in practice. HISSOM (Holistic Information Systems Strategy for Organisational Management) is a practical, holistic model that co-ordinates and facilitates cohesive alignment of organisational needs and the IS capability required to meet those needs, at (1) stakeholder; (2) feedback metrics; (3) strategy and change management; and (4) organisational culture and capability levels. HISSOM was initially developed as a logical extension of the IS-alignment literature, and has been validated by action research in several significant studies in different industries, markets and organisational settings. The HISSOM model has been revised in the light of these studies, and a practical, Web-based decision support application, the HISSOM Decision Support Advisor, HDSA, is now under development, to promote wider use of the model and obtain evolutionary feedback from the user community. A synthesis of the development of HISSOM and work on designing the HDSA architecture is described, together with the impact of this research on extending the field of SISP and IS-alignment.	decision support system;holism;strategic information system;virtual community	David Lanc;Lachlan M.

Professionalism is closely connected to expertise and is therefore closely connected to the ability to prevent and mitigate errors. But there are two paradoxes in this connection. First, professionalism can increase, rather than reduce, the risk of errors and accidents by promoting practitioners' tendency to break procedural rules. This is because professional expertise tends to favor adaptation to local circumstances over standardized approaches to problem-solving. Second, professionalism can create blind spots within organizations, blocking the flow of critical information about unsafe conditions. This is because professional groups develop unique subcultures, specialized language, and communication habits that tend to separate them from other professional groups, even when those groups work within the same organization. I illustrate these paradoxes using case studies from several different professional domains. I then outline some methodological challenges for research on safety and professionalism. Finally, I argue that the kind of professionalism that can prevent errors is rooted in organizational practices that reduce the social separation between professional groups and promote the maintenance of adequate margins of safety. This requires the acceptance of safety as a central value that is at least as important as productivity.		Matthew C.

Strategy studies focus on one type of actor or organizational context. Instead, we considered various firms, roles and expertise. We conducted 20 hours of in-depth, elite interviews with 15 senior managers from client firms, digital marketing agencies and strategy consultants and identified several opportunities related to the data and how they are manipulated, the business uses of digital technologies and broad behavioral changes. However, data quality and quantity limit the value of data granularity and currency. Additionally, we found that the three types of interviewees produce strategy assessments that differ in terms of content, salience and valence. This finding advances the conceptual understanding of the impact of different roles and cognitive frameworks on strategy development and, thus, the need to incorporate the views of third parties in environmental scanning exercises.	data quality;digital marketing;software framework	Ana Isabel Canhoto;Sally Dibb;Lyndon Simkin;Lee Quinn;Mathew Analogbei	2015	2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2015.155	face;public relations;the internet;cognition;interview;organization;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;management science;digital economy;management;law;world wide web	HCI	-82.46885722668182	-0.4605090813727527	85567

This study develops a previous model on the relationship between job design, group processes, group initiative and self-organizational activities by including supportive leadership. The hypothesized model was tested using LISREL 8.30 Joreskog & Sorbom, 1993 in five different organizational contexts two types of industry, elderly care, school and nuclear power plant and in 104 work groups. The results are based on work task analysis two studies and questionnaires. The meaningfulness of the model was tested both in contexts where proactive behavior and self-organizational activities are desirable and in a context where proactive behavior can be damaging. Dimensions of job design, supportive leadership, group processes are interrelated and connected to self-organizational activities. Reflectivity and group initiative show the largest effects on self-organizational activities. Job design captured by work task analysis gives a better model fit and has a larger impact on self-organizational activities than self-assessed autonomy. Supportive leadership has an effect on group processes that in turn impact group initiative and self-organizational activities and a direct effect on group initiative as well.	job design;self-organization	Annika Lantz	2013	IJKBO	10.4018/ijkbo.2013040102	psychology;knowledge management;management;social psychology	HCI	-86.15931919183996	-0.3716343371925953	85783

In recent years, progress has been made to reduce software piracy. However, computer software is greatly susceptible to theft and market influences have recently contributed to a staggering $48 billion worldwide loss due to piracy (BSA, 2008). This paper outlines research in progress that will provide insight into software piracy attitude and intention. The purpose of the research is to investigate the moderating effect of environment on the relationship between behavioral beliefs and attitudes toward softlifting (i.e. the illegal duplication of copyrighted software by individuals) in three unique settings work, home, and school. This study promises to make several important contributions. The work should demonstrate the importance of including environment in theoretical models of the antecedents that influence softlifting attitude and intention. Results may also prove helpful to information systems professionals and educators in implementing measures to discourage software piracy.	bioinformatics;information system;persistence (computer science)	Pamela A.

That is further supported with the results from the experimental study of the potential use of various mobile computing devices in the project information exchange. In this respect only cost effective, commonly available and standardised solutions would prove a project-wide applicability. The final objective of the paper is to show why there should be further research in mobile computing focused on identifying weaknesses in project-related information exchange and how to apply existing optimised IT procedures to alleviate these weaknesses.	information flow	Nenad Cus-Babic;Danijel Rebolj;Ales Magdic;Milan Radosavljevic	2003	Concurrent Engineering: R&A	10.1177/1063293X03011001004	construction;economics;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;operations management;mobile computing	SE	-82.97247767400333	-3.014465098431899	85847

Recently, more attention has been drawn towards mobile services due to the adoption of 3G in Thailand. This enhanced the competition in the telecommunication industry. Consequently, it became very critical for mobile services providers to better understand users and factors that affect users' adoption of mobile services. This paper aims to identify and study factors that impact mobile services adoption in Thailand. Factors and sub factors were identified and a survey was conducted. Factors were compared using Pairwise Comparison Method (PCM). Results of the analysis show that intermediary factors have the highest impact on users' intention to adopt mobile services followed by service characteristics factors and social factors respectively. The study provides an insight and information about factors influencing users' adoption of mobile services in Thailand.		Tugrul U.

On the basis of a recent detailed database on many achievement criteria of 35 major cities in the world, it seeks to arrive at a relative performance ranking of these cities by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). A novel element is the use of a new type of ‘Super-Efficiency DEA’ to identify unambiguously the high performers (‘exceptional places’) in the group of world cities investigated. This new productivity-based approach is complemented with two new directions in DEA research, viz. a Distance Friction Method and a Context-Dependent method.	data envelopment analysis;viz: the computer game	Karima Kourtit;Peter Nijkamp;Soushi Suzuki	2013	Computers, Environment and Urban Systems	10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2012.08.007	economics;geography;civil engineering;operations management;economy;ecology;management;sustainability;economic growth;competitive advantage;benchmarking	ML	-77.5808806408571	-5.892575583464579	86207

ICT can play a key role in disseminating such knowledge across the world. But a digital divide exists between urban and rural/remote areas, which results in economic and social disparities across regions. Developing last-mile telecommunication technologies for rural/remote areas is a crucial aspect in providing computing and ICT services that can integrate millions of stakeholders in rural/remote areas globally into the digital age, particularly with the advent of cloud computing. This article focuses on the different aspects of providing last-mile rural telecommunication access such as interfering factors, technology options, and deployment trends. This article aims to guide service providers, industry practitioners, and local entrepreneurs with a technology-and-deployment-trend analysis to choose, deploy, and operate suitable telecommunication networks depending on the unique features of the rural/remote area. Our goal is to bring attention to accessible and affordable technologies with practical considerations.	cab direct (database);cloud computing;last mile;software deployment	Somen Nandi;Saigopal Thota;Avishek Nag;Sw.

One such area is health-related websites where the sensitive issues around the consumer’s health extenuate the similar challenges faced in other areas of e-commerce. Disclosing personal information is necessary to fully utilize such health-related websites but consumer trust is required for this. This research proposes a model of the role of trust in personal information disclosure on health-related websites. This model identifies 10 factors grouped in three categories. The first category is dispositional factors including faith in humanity, trusting stance and privacy concern. the second category is situational factors including reputation and perceived risk. Lastly the third category is institutional factors including the perceived effectiveness of the privacy statement, third party certification, legal and regulation and security infrastructure. Low risk, reputation, effective privacy statement and privacy seals were found to facilitate trust. While institutional factors like the legal framework and regulation have an elevated role to keep the consumer safe in this context, lack of clarity on what they are leads to a weak perception of their value. Trust in the health-related website was found to positively influence the intention to disclose information.	biological anthropology;e-commerce payment system;european conference on information systems;information sensitivity;internet privacy;personally identifiable information;purchasing;trust (emotion)	Luoxia Chen;Alex Zarifis;Julia Krönung	2017			marketing;e-commerce;personally identifiable information;public relations;computer science	HCI	-85.07413544285693	-8.54619782828361	86413

Recently, investors, donors, lenders, regulators, and microfinance institutions have been more concerned with social and outreach performance. Transactions cost and distance theories inform a new ICT-enabled microfinance institution (MFI) outreach theory positing that information and communication technology (ICT) adoption among MFIs will result in direct improvements to MFI operations and a greater capacity for poverty and geographic outreach. These propositions are modeled using a case study methodology with primary research materials collected from 14 microfinance institutions in 8 countries. Using a pattern-matching mode of analysis, we find that different ICTs impact two types of outreach: geographic and poverty. Policy, database, and software-related ICT adoption activities impact poverty outreach due to their support of flexibility and information. Infrastructure, networking, hardware, and telephony ICT adoption activities impact geographic outreach since these areas support connectivity.	database;networking hardware;pattern matching	David M.

We identify three main issues with current theorizations: diffuse definitions of “trolling,” blurred boundaries between trolling and other online anti-social behaviors, and the context dependency of trolling. To address these unresolved issues, we adopt a practice-based theoretical approach. Informed by this approach, we analyze trolling behaviors not as products of individualsu0027 attitudes, values, and decisions, but rather as behaviors embedded within and occurring as part of social practices. Specifically, we conduct a practice-based theoretical analysis in a multi-site exploratory study involving online archival research and in-depth interviews with online community members. Based on this analysis, we propose that trolling be conceived as a constellation of three social practices: learning, assimilating, and transgressing. Also, we find that practices of trolling transgre...	internet troll;online community	Angela Gracia B. Cruz;Yuri Seo;Mathew Rex	2018	Inf.

Goal-driven decision-making for technology adoption decisions has been largely overlooked with a few notable exceptions. Social psychology and consumer-behavior research streams are integrated with traditional technology adoption concepts to yield a holistic framework.	holism	Alan A.

Based on the distributed cognition framework, the concepts of public and private representations are developed in order to better understand how various computerized artifacts can support communication and co-ordination in teams engaged in process control. The findings, based on two field studies, indicate that the importance of public representations in control rooms has not always been fully understood or been taken into account in the design of control room systems.	distributed cognition	Christer Garbis	2000		10.1145/633292.633334	simulation;knowledge management;process control;management	HCI	-82.46633623489603	-4.50205900050911	87841

In fact, Organizational Change Management (OCM) has been identified as an essential knowledge area for any SPI initiative. However, enough attention is still not given to the human factors and therefore, the high degree of failures in the SPI initiatives is directly linked to a lack of commitment and motivation. Gamification discipline allows us to define mechanisms that drive people’s motivation and commitment towards the development of tasks in order to encourage and accelerate the acceptance of an SPI initiative. In this paper, a gamification framework oriented to both organization needs and software practitioners groups involved in an SPI initiative is defined. This framework tries to take advantage of the transverse nature of gamification in order to apply its Critical Success Factors (CSF) to the organizational change management of an SPI. Gamification framework guidelines have been validated by some qualitative methods. Results show some limitations that threaten the reliability of this validation. These require further empirical validation of a software organization.	data validation;gamification;human factors and ergonomics;organizational behavior;transverse wave	Eduardo Herranz;Ricardo Colomo Palacios;Antonio de Amescua Seco;Murat Yilmaz	2014	J.

It then moves on to outline four conceptual limitations to conventional dichotomous notions of the digital divide and individuals’ ‘access’ to information and communications technology (ICT): what is meant by ICT; what is meant by ‘access’; the relationship between ‘access to ICT’ and ‘use of ICT’; and a lack of consideration of the consequences of engagement with ICT. The article outlines a more sophisticated, hierarchical model of the digital divide based around these conceptual ‘stages’ while recognizing the mediating role of economic, cultural and social forms of capital in shaping individuals’ engagements with ICT.

In this investigation, data is collected from one system that permits extensible information sharing (i.e., information sharing beyond immediate, first-tier supply chain participants) to empirically investigate the determinants of extensible information sharing. The goal of this study is to identify specific actions that promote extensible information sharing. It uses hierarchical regression analysis to examine the contribution of these actions, after controlling for certain dyadic information sharing and industry practices. According to the results, companies that pursue real-time integration of the supply chain and are willing to change the roles and responsibilities of their employees engage in extensible information sharing. Surprisingly, it is found that companies that have a long-term relationship with immediate supply chain participants are less likely to expand their information sharing beyond dyadic information sharing, perhaps because of a perception that their information needs are adequately met.

DeLone, E.R. McLean, Information systems success: the quest for the dependent variable, Information Systems Journal 3(1) (1992) 60-95] for evaluating the success of information systems. Given the growing awareness among researchers and practitioners about the importance of high-quality conceptual modelling scripts, it is surprising that there is no practical evaluation framework that considers the quality of conceptual modelling scripts from the user perspective. A first research goal is therefore to determine what the appropriate dimensions are for evaluating the success or quality of conceptual modelling scripts from the user point of view. A second goal is to investigate the relationships between these quality dimensions. The paper also presents an empirical test of the proposed model of quality dimensions and their relationships. Results are presented of two experiments with 187 and 124 business students respectively, that were designed to test a set of hypotheses generated from the proposed model. The results largely support the proposed model and have implications for both theory and practice of quality evaluation of conceptual modelling scripts.		Ann Maes;Geert Poels	2007	Data Knowl.

Both sides agree that data governance primarily is a matter of organisation. However, hardly any scientific results have been produced so far indicating what actually has to be organised by data governance, and what data governance may look like. The paper aims at closing this gap by developing a morphology of data governance organisation on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art both in science and in practice. Epistemologically, the morphology represents an analytic theory, as it serves for structuring the research topic of data governance, which is still quite unexplored. Six mini case studies are used to evaluate the morphology by means of empirical data. Providing a foundation for further research, the morphology contributes to the advancement of the scientific body of knowledge. At the same time, it is beneficial to practitioners, as companies may use it as a guideline when organising data governance.	business requirements;closing (morphology);customer relationship management;data governance;galaxy morphological classification;information system;mathematical morphology;requirement;theory	Boris Otto	2011			data governance;morphology;information governance;computer science;knowledge management;development theory;management science;information management;project governance;management	SE	-77.98274314145874	-0.26194608328902613	88314

Existing literature identified 4 affordances visibility, persistence, editability, and association (between people and between people and information) as action potentials of social media in organizations. Content analysis of a sample of organizational social media policies reveals that organizations especially reacted to the affordances of visibility and persistence much more than to the affordance of editability. It also discovers a third type of association (between employees and organization). It shows how organizations’ reactions to social media evolved from being solely concerned with risk management to also considering its value-generating potential.	action potential;persistence (computer science);risk management;social media	Emmanuelle Vaast;Evgeny A.

Drawing on evidence from the Swedish approach, STYREL, the study emphasises the need for a thorough consideration of the various interests that are involved in such a complex system of national multi-level planning. This model provides a novel approach for analysing strategic objectives in complex planning environments, thereby offering a context for a constructive dialogue about strategic objectives, reachable goals and appropriate means among actors who are involved in such planning as well as the stakeholders it affects. Even beyond national critical infrastructure protection (CIP), the contribution of this paper is twofold: it outlines a complex problem for operations research in general and suggests a systematic approach for examining strategic objectives in complex planning environments in particular. Hence, this paper encourages a discussion of systemic implications of these various interests and an enhancement of collaboration and mutual understanding to facilitate decision-making in public and private strategic management.	complex system;complex systems;critical infrastructure protection;emergent;holism;mathematical model;mechatronics;operations research;planning;risk management;strategic management;symbian	Christine Große	2018		10.5220/0006646302870296	management science;economic shortage;operations management;information system;computer science	AI	-79.13074090864446	-3.56683292629798	88554

d38813e207ee3dee31be687b35ee2e33de49f10c	"""how are citizens involved in smart cities? analysing citizen participation in japanese """"smart communities"""""""		In recent years, “smart cities” have rapidly increased in discourses as well as in their real number, and raise various issues. While citizen engagement is a key element of most definitions of smart cities, information and communication technologies (ICTs) would also have great potential for facilitating public participation. However, scholars have highlighted that little research has focused on actual practices of citizen involvement in smart cities so far. In this respect, the authors analyse public participation in Japanese “Smart Communities”, paying attention to both official discourses and actual practices. Smart Communities were selected in 2010 by the Japanese government which defines them as “smart city” projects and imposed criteria such as focus on energy issues, participation and lifestyle innovation. Drawing on analysis of official documents as well as on interviews with each of the four Smart Communities’ stakeholders, the paper explains that very little input is expected from Japanese citizens. Instead, ICTs are used by municipalities and electric utilities to steer project participants and to change their behaviour. The objective of Smart Communities would not be to involve citizens in city governance, but rather to make them participate in the co-production of public services, mainly energy production and distribution.	smart city	Benoit Granier;Hiroko Kudo	2016	Information Polity	10.3233/IP-150367	public relations;environmental resource management;political science;socioeconomics	HCI	-77.93777052188396	-8.736504770049745	88913

However, to transform e-government initiatives from ambitious ideas into fruitful outcomes, several success factors have to be considered that vary from case to case, depending on the structural characteristics of the social, cultural, and political environment. Based on the e-government implementation success framework of and a case study of e-government implementation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, this research extends the view of e-government implementations by focusing on the themes culture and demography and develops critical success factors subordinated to these themes. These include five factors determining the cultural component and four factors determining the demographic component, each of which influence the respective success or failure of large e-government projects.	e-government	Roland Franke;Julia Krönung;Friedrich Born;Andreas Eckhardt	2015	IJEGR	10.4018/IJEGR.2015010103	computer science;environmental resource management;operations management;management	NLP	-77.92054978405463	-5.887641523053162	89103

Given its critical effects on the project business, the organization, the project team, and the project manager, it should be studied in more depth. We identified factors which make RPM occurrences inherently different and we show that work-system theory and activity theory give comprehensive lenses to advance research on RPM. For the future research on RPM we identified three objec- tives: experiences on RPM, process model for RPM, and organizational culture's influence on RPM occurrences.	systems theory	Tero Vartiainen;Heli Aramo-Immonen;Jari Juhani Jussila;Maritta Pirhonen;Kirsi Liikamaa	2009		10.1007/978-1-4419-7355-9_10	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;operations management	Logic	-80.49631370153769	1.5705543681705045	89139

This study aims to fill this void. Unlike previous research, this study investigates the interrelations among four categories of knowledge assets and four knowledge creation processes — socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization (SECI) [9]. In our framework, we argue that different types of knowledge assets may have differing influences on knowledge creation. In order to test the feasibility of this framework, we conducted an empirical research exercise. This study employed a survey instrument to collect data from a wide variety of organizations in manufacturing, trade, transportation and service industries, computer industries, finance, and academic institutions. A total of 204 usable responses were analysed. We identified four interrelationships from this study. (1) Compared to other knowledge assets, conceptual knowledge assets have a greater effect on externalization of knowledge creation process; (2) compared to other knowledge assets, routine knowledge assets have a greater effect on socialization of knowledge creation process; (3) compared to other knowledge assets, experiential knowledge assets do not have a greater effect on internalization of the knowledge creation process; and (4) compared to other knowledge assets, systemic knowledge assets do not have a greater effect on the combination of knowledge creation process. The implications of the study are discussed, and further research directions are proposed.	knowledge management;socialization	Shih-Wei Chou;Mong-Young He	2004	J.

18b72c048f04c65b1da7aa13f2b5b13b595d9c8f	antecedents of customer satisfaction in mobile commerce: exploring the moderating effect of customization		Purpose – To determine statistically significant drivers of customer satisfaction in mobile commerce and to test the moderating effects of customization on the relationships between customer satisfaction and its predictors. Design/methodology/approach – The sample comprised 224 respondents. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the validity of the model, and moderated regression analysis was applied to determine main and interaction effects. Findings – Trust, perceived usefulness, mobility, and perceived enjoyment were found to be significant drivers of customer satisfaction. The results also indicate the statistical significance of two interaction effects: customization moderates the influence of mobility and the influence of trust on customer satisfaction. Research limitations/implications – The study was conducted in a single time period and in a developing country where m-commerce is still not widely used. Future models should include new variables. Comparison between different age or gender groups would also be useful. Practical implications – The findings are useful for m-commerce providers who are developing marketing campaigns, where the focus should be on promoting the mobility aspect of mcommerce, in particular its usefulness to consumers and its security. M-commerce activities should be developed and redesigned to better meet consumers’ specific demands and needs. Originality/value – M-commerce customer satisfaction studies are rare. The developed model has five potential antecedents of satisfaction: trust, social influence, perceived usefulness, mobility, and perceived enjoyment. New insights are provided into the moderating role of customization.	confirmatory factor analysis;mobile commerce	Veljko Marinkovic;Zoran Kalinic	2017	Online Information Review	10.1108/OIR-11-2015-0364	customer satisfaction;social psychology	HCI	-89.66265416288913	-9.663342632525	89180
0e0127538a2a2fd0de1a69e042f265a528ea612d	logistical performance as a key factor of success for european food e-tailers - three paradoxes and a research agenda		In many Northern European countries, the sale of convenience goods through the Internet is experiencing a slow but undeniable growth. The emergence of this new distribution channel has brought into existence an extremely productive research area on the key factors which food e-tailers need to master for a lasting success in this field. The central nature of a perfect logistical organization is particularly emphasized in the areas of cost and service quality, both in terms of order fulfillment and order delivery. There is no question of minimizing the importance of logistics in the success of online transactions, as e-consumers obviously expect to be delivered at home in good conditions. But can we affirm that logistical performance systematically plays a crucial role for food e-tailers in obtaining a sustainable competitive advantage? By critically examining the relevant literature, this paper attempts to prove that the answer may be negative. The authors refer to three paradoxes relating to e-grocery logistics: one, the pressure of national and local Authorities leads to the sharing of resources to reduce environmental pollution (first paradox); two, the recognition of an e-marketing mix dissolves logistical performance in a set of non-logistical variables whose weight is probably significant in e-consumers’ behavior (second and third paradoxes).	e-commerce;electronic business;emergence;last mile;logistics;online advertising;online shopping;simulation;strategic management;way to go	Dominique Bonet;Gilles Pache	2004				Web+IR	-81.99401044685153	-9.644596528082078	89394

There is substantial evidence to suggest that e-banking is being embraced by financial institutions in developed and emerging markets to the extent that explosive growth is almost at hand. This paper explores the adoption linkages in customer perceptions, preferences, and barriers to the adoption of banking technology in Kenya. The data for this study has been collected from bank customers in using well structured and pre-tested questionnaires. The result indicated that necessity perception is positive and ATM, Mobile and Internet banking were mostly preferred compared to others whilst negative linkage was observed between barriers and adoption as Security, bank lag in adoption and unawareness were identified as the most reported barriers to adoption. It means that positive link enable adoption while negative link distract adoption. The findings implicate banks and other financial institutions to increase the campaigns which may develop positive customer perceptions and preferences at the same time look for alternatives of reducing the possible barriers posing the banking technology.	robertson–seymour theorem	Richard Nyangosi;Kennedy O.

Unlike other mobile payment systems that lack convenience, scalability, and usability, the proposed MBPS contains several important functionalities and it has the potential to bring together hitherto unconnected industries—banking, Fintech and telecoms—to offer value-added services to their existing and potential customers. The ownership of the MBPS shall remain with the financial services sector including the banking and microfinance institutions.

Specifically, we examined organizational antecedents of healthcare organization’s assimilation of security policies and practices. The study examined perceived complexity related to the initiatives, the organization’s compatibility with adopting and assimilating the measures, and the structure of the organization as measured by the degree of centralization and decentralization. As such, we examine the effect of complexity, compatibility, and centralization-decentralization on the assimilation of security-related measures. The model demonstrates that complexity related to the assimilation of security measures presents challenges for healthcare organizations, as it predicts lower levels of assimilation. Organizational compatibility and structure were not found to be significant. Our model controlled for the level to which these organizations had assimilated internet-related technologies and strategies in order to account for their level of sophistication with IT and their exposure to the risk of cyber threats. We conclude that complexity related to assimilation of security-related measures is a significant challenge.	complexity;data assimilation;http 404;logic centralization pattern;threat (computer)	Kevin P.

The availability of electronic  data has exploded within the past decade as communication technologies and storage capacities have grown tremendously. The  need to analyze this collected data for creating business intelligence and value continues to grow rapidly as more and more  apparently unbiased information can be extracted from these data sets. In this paper we focus in particular, on email corpuses,  from which a great deal of information can be discerned about organization structure and their unique cultures. We hypothesize  that a broad based analysis of information exchanges (ex. emails) among a company’s employees could give us deep information  about their respective roles within the organization, thereby revealing hidden organizational structures that hold immense  intrinsic value. Enron email corpus is used as a case study to predict the unknown status of Enron employees and identify  homogeneous groups of employees and hierarchy among them within Enron organization. We achieve this by using classification  and cluster techniques. As a part of this work, we have also developed a web-based graphical user interface to work with feature  extraction and composition.  	social network analysis	Chuanlei Zhang;William B. Hurst;R. B.

This approach is based on the Scandinavian Tradition of Participatory Design, but also motivated by on-going technological development. In cooperating around development of new, integrated services, catering to various categories of users as well as to a growing diversity of mobile technologies, we are aiming to establish feedback channels between practice and theory, between use and design, and between different academic disciplines where we see a need to synchronize the models and methods we work with.

However, empirical results on the relationship between them have been disturbingly mixed and inconsistent. Through a meta-analysis of 54 correlations derived from 21 empirical studies, we attempted to explain and resolve these mixed results by synthesizing across studies the effects of organizational size on IT innovation adoption and by examining the effects of six moderators on the relationship. The results suggested that, although a positive relationship generally existed between them, the relationship was moderated by five variables: type of IT innovation, type of organization, stage of adoption, scope of size, and type of size measure. This suggested that the mixed empirical results from previous studies can be explained by a lack of consideration of moderators.	requirements analysis	Gwanhoo Lee;Weidong Xia	2006	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2006.09.003	meta-analysis;economics;operations management;sociology;management;social psychology;information technology;statistics	HCI	-85.25466503596884	3.9239349911987245	90708
772f059308bd28585c68d55af9b2c47227d3e830	social practice design (spd), pathos, improvisation, mood, and bricolage: the mediterranean way to make place for it?	multiple perspectives;new technology;ethnography;social practice design;innovation process;social problems;participatory design;information system;action research;everyday life;information system development	Our proposal for Social Practice Design (SPD), i.e., the design of social practices – in itself a social design activity -, seeks to ensure that the potential benefits of envisioned novel technologies can be realized, by increasing the bias towards the social in Information Systems Development (ISD). SPD is a form of intervention research or action research based on counselling. It can be considered an extension of Participatory Design (PD) approaches to the implementation phase of information systems. It regards the concept and participative introduction of new things to do, or of new ways to do things, by humans, in order to make place for technology (Ehn 2006), and in order to resolve a variety of other pending social problems in organisations. In this paper we present SPD as a fully phenomenology-based approach, we reason about its stand in the IS discipline, and we briefly describe and point to an application for a European research project. What characterize our position in defining SPD are Claudio Ciborra’s Pathos, Improvisation, Caretaking, Bricolage, and other key concepts he puts forth in order to shift the ISD focus from ‘method’, and direct it ‘on human existence and everyday life’ (Ciborra 2002). We are motivated in this choice by the quest for more impact of ISD research on ISD practice, and our belief that phenomenology and counselling are the right recipe ingredients for this. The approach of Social Practice Design is based on the idea that problem solutions are in the hands of the organisation’s personnel, and that person centred counselling approaches are capable of empowering them and support them to success. It is well known that social practices cannot be ‘engineered’ but that they are evolving as part of people’s activities of integrating a new technology into their ways of doing. Using the word ‘design’ we wish to stress intentionality, proactiveness, creativity and planning as necessary ingredients of organisational innovation processes; i.e., we underline the usefulness of the cognition of the necessity of a conscious design approach to the development of innovative social practices. Thus, our choice of an oxymoron in the SPD title. In structure, SPD is similar to any methodology for the social, i.e., it includes multiple perspectives into the usual triad of scientific paradigms: observation, analysis, and synthesis. Its core actions reside in the two basic phases of the ‘design’ approach for innovating social practices: • an ethnographic analysis phase to identify outstanding problems in the area of social practice • a creative design phase for developing social practice innovations We judge the quality of the SPD approach by three requirements (Baskerville and Myers 2004): a contribution to practice (the action), a contribution to research (the theory), the criteria by which to judge the research, and we show explicitly how the research in the case meets these criteria.	bricolage;cognition;information systems;information system;intentionality;requirement	Gianni Jacucci	2007			knowledge management;management science;sociology;social psychology	HCI	-78.0956392286715	-2.518015080216443	90993
32892eb855198e260f5c149376b7eee01268057f	understanding the use of social media by organisations for crisis communication	crisis communication;crisis response strategy;crisis management;social media	Many businesses have commenced using social media for crisis communication with stakeholders. However there is little guidance in literature to assist organisational crisis managers with the selection of an appropriate crisis response strategy. Traditional theories on crisis communication may not adequately represent the social media context. This study took a qualitative approach and explored organisational use of social media for crisis communication at seventeen large Australian organisations. An analysis of 15,650 Facebook and Twitter messages was conducted, drawing on the lens of Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) (Coombs & Holladay, 2002). Findings suggested that when large Australian organisations responded to crises via social media, they lacked an awareness of the potential of social media for crisis communication. Organisations often did not respond to stakeholder messages or selected crisis response strategies that may increase reputational risk.

2d5e7064602f1f8b462e0afb182a5c7aa87979e1	the nature of public e-services and their quality dimensions		In this paper, we argue that our understanding of the concept of ‘e-service’ is incomplete and that this inadequate understanding blurs important differences between distinct types of interaction between a government and its citizens. This in turn creates difficulties when assessing the quality of ‘e-services’, as we cannot specify precisely what we are measuring. Based on a literature review, we argue that it is neither feasible nor fruitful to provide an unambiguous, precise understanding of the concept of e-service. However, in our context, ‘e-services’ is understood as a sequence of digital interactions between a service provider and service receiver which add some value to the receiver. We will accordingly inquire into the ‘e-service’ concept and examine its distinct types of communication in order to provide a better understanding of its basic characteristics. As a result, we outline a framework for categorizing the different types of digital communication that are denoted ‘e-services’ by identifying their basic service elements. This framework will also help to specify their distinct quality dimensions. We can thereby identify and model various types of interaction between citizens and public agencies based on a consistent set of service elements. As an illustration of its usefulness, we describe one of the life event services in the EU eGovernment benchmark framework in terms of our framework, including its quality dimensions.	e-services	Arild Jansen;Svein Ølnes	2016	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2016.08.005	knowledge management;data mining;management science;world wide web	Crypto	-86.00938691308005	-5.726233712630117	91043

Evidence from other environments, where the social, economic, and cultural characteristics vary, is needed before generalizations can be made. This chapter reports on an investigation designed to explore the relationship of three organizational factors—top management support, user involvement, and the maturity of the IS function—to systems effectiveness in an Egyptian setting. Data was collected from 214 managers, and the results indicate that the three organizational variables positively associate with systems effectiveness, measured by user information satisfaction and system use in improving decision This chapter appears in the book, Advanced Topics in Global Information Management, Volume 3, edited by Gordon Hunter and Felix B.

Also, user’s tenure in the organization and ownership type were found to affect the relationships between the system’s effectiveness measures and the three organizational variables. These findings are discussed and implications are offered. The findings of this study suggest that the positive relationships of top management support, user involvement, and IS maturity to systems effectiveness may transcend cultural differences. This empirical evidence contributes to the external and international validity of the similar Western-based findings, which, in turn, add to the efforts toward building a general theory of trans-national global information systems (GISs). INTRODUCTION Evaluation of information systems effectiveness continues to be a major concern for both IS researchers and practitioners. Over the last 30 years, many factor and process studies have attempted to predict and explain the adoption and use of information technology (IT). Guided by a number of proposed models and frameworks, relevant research has focused on defining and measuring systems effectiveness and their major determinants, including individual, psychological, organizational, sociological, environmental, information-structural, managerial, and technical (e.g., Mason & Mitroff, 1973; Lucas, 1978; Ein-Dor & Segev, 1978; Mawhinney & Lederer, 1990; Raymond, 1990; Li, 1997; Khalil & Elkordy, 1999, 1997). Also, research findings show the primacy of the managerial and organizational issues, compared to the technological issues as major barriers to the effective implementation and use of systems (e.g., Lucas, 1975; Robey & Zeller, 1978; Cerveny & Clark, 1981; Markus & Robey 1983; Leifer, 1988; Mawhinney & Lederer, 1990). However, consistent relationships between these managerial and organizational variables and systems effectiveness have yet to emerge. Further, most of IS effectiveness research has centered on data gathered in the Western culture. Yet, research findings obtained from organizations operating in a Western environment cannot be necessarily generalizable to other environments without further verification of their external validity (e.g., Dasgupta et al., 1999; Khalil & Elkordy, 1999, 1997; Aharoni & Burton, 1994). IS related problems are perhaps country-specific and are related to the country’s unique political, legal, economic, cultural, and technological environments (e.g., Aharoni & Burton, 1994; Rosenzweig, 1994; Deans et al., 1991; Ein-Dor et al., 1993). The investigation of IS issues in particular areas of the world emphasizes the possible impact of cultural differences on such issues (e.g., Straub et al., 2002; Dasgupta et al., 1999; Watson et al., 1997; Al-Khaldi & Wallace, 1999; Hassan, 1994; Wetherbe, Vitalari, & Milner, 1994). There is a need for IS research to broaden the focus beyond ethnocentric and regional studies in order to build a general theory of trans-national global information systems (GIS) (Palvia, 1993). More specifically, both country specific and cross-cultural research is imperative in order to strengthen the generalizability of the Western based evidence on the organizational determinants of systems effectiveness. In addition, effective management of systems in a particular culture requires identifying the issues that might be unique to that culture (e.g., Jain, 1997; Deans & Ricks, 1991; Palvia & Saraswat, 1992). 30 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the publisher's webpage: www.igi-global.com/chapter/relationship-someorganizational-factors-information/4540"""	capability maturity model;emergentism;external validity;fax;geographic information system;global information system;gordon hunter (academic);imperative programming;information systems;information management;mason;os-tan;pa-risc;primacy of mind;rule 184;source-to-source compiler;type inference;uniform resource identifier;wallace tree;watson (computer);web page;word lists by frequency;zeller's congruence	Ahmed A.

We performed 16 semi-structured interviews with national level expert informants, and with officers operating at the municipality and province (prefectures) level in an Italian region (respondents were selected based on their involvement in emergency communication and/or emergency management processes). Social media usage appears distributed over a continuum of engagement, ranging from very basic usage to using social media by adopting a broadcasting approach, to deeper engagement, which also includes continuous interaction with citizens. Two main attitudes emerge both in the narrative style and in social media representations: some respondents seem to adopt an institutional attitude, while others adopt a practical-professional attitude. Among the main barriers to a broader adoption of social media, cultural considerations seem to prevail, along with the lack of personnel, a general concern toward social media communication reliability, and the perceived distance between the formal role of institutions and the informal nature of social media communication.	apache continuum;semiconductor industry;social media	Francesca Comunello;Simone Mulargia	2017				HCI	-79.07019614737058	-6.43321852400979	91530

Mobile data services integrate handheld and Internet technologies to create new value propositions (Keen and Mackenzie 2001), in a social context, over time (Rogers 1995). Yet, this value can only be realised through new behaviours, including acquiring the enabling technology, learning to use it, applying it to solve problems or add value in everyday life, and communicating what one has learned about it to other prospective users. This article explores the recent emergence of the mobile data services phenomenon in Malaysia and Singapore, and analyses survey data from over four hundred cell phone subscribers to identify a marketing model that targets the needs of early adopters, identifies the information channels that reach various types of innovators, then examines the linkages among early adopters and other segments over time and across markets. Introduction Mobile data services (MDS) applications deliver content and enable transactions, but unlike the Internet, can serve users while they are on the move. The Internet plays an important enabling role in the MDS phenomenon: for WAP and i-Mode as an enabling technology and source of content. Both use mark-up languages derived from the Web, with features to accommodate the limitations of cell phones. The messaging capabilities built into GSM were not originally intended for subscriber use, and Internet chat serves as an inspiration and role model for the extension of the SMS standard to EMS and beyond. As communications devices that accompany owners, cell phones have characteristics in use that differ sharply from personal computers: they are truly portable, seldom used by others, and increasingly, constantly connected to an ”always-on” network (Raisinghani 2001). The rapid diffusion of digital mobile networks, first to Europe, then throughout Asia, and now North America, enables data delivery to various types of “anywhere, anytime” personal terminals. However, while SMS adoption is growing exponentially, the technically more sophisticated WAP services have generally failed to attract a critical mass of users. MDS are a current example of technologyenabled discontinuous innovation, similar from the economic and behavioural perspectives to the Internet. Such innovations will succeed only if adopted by a critical mass. To attract this critical mass, MDS must create new value, and generate new behaviours, in specific social contexts, over time. Such behaviours include acquiring the enabling technology, learning to use it, applying it to solve problems or adding value in everyday life, and communicating what one has learned about it to others. The Context of the Study Adjacent Southeast Asian nations Singapore and Malaysia share a colonial heritage, and were briefly a single nation. Despite similarities in culture, they vary greatly in terms of geographic, demographic, political, and economic structure. Home to about four million residents, Singapore is a compact and entirely urban city-state. Malaysia, with its far more widely dispersed population of about 20 million, has a strong agricultural sector. Both developed modern urban infrastructure, to support a wide range of industries including electronics manufacturing. To enhance its main economic role as an entrepôt trading centre, Singapore deployed analogue mobile technology in the 1970s, followed by digital wireless voice services in the 1980s, with Malaysia not far behind. Malaysia opened fixedline and mobile markets several years before Singapore’s “big bang” liberalisation in early 2000. In Malaysia, mobile subscribers double every 18 months, and SMS traffic accelerated following operator agreements to interconnect SMS services so subscribers to one operator can send messages to those subscribing to another. In the relatively saturated Singapore mobile voice market, operators use SMS as a source of HIICS 2003 mobile data services 2 differentiation. Local operators have the second highest (after the Philippines, where SMS is a substitute for expensive intra-city voice traffic) percentage of revenues from SMS, and SMSbased information services such as information services, taxi orders, and logo and ringtone downloads are gaining market acceptance. The MDS phenomenon has roots in the storeand-forward short messaging service (SMS) model. This soon evolved to the broadcast ”push” mode, followed by interactive or “pull” SMS. MDS infrastructure is evolving rapidly. In Europe and much of Asia, GSM (Global Systems for Mobile communication) is the current de facto wireless network standard. Designed for voice, GSM carries data over a relatively slow, circuit-switched signalling channel. Today, data rates are being upgraded through General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) and Enhanced Data for Global Evolution (EDGE) technologies. In perhaps five years “Third-generation” (3G) infrastructure will be deployed throughout the region, offering far higher mobile data rates. The resulting increase in spectrum capacity, combined with new functionality, will drive the diffusion of mobile data communications (Gruber and Verboven 2001). Merrill Lynch views the Asia Pacific (outside Japan) as a promising region for MDS growth, riding on continuing growth in adoption, and operator upgrades to support Enhanced Messaging Services (EMS). Even today, premium SMS services could easily double current revenues from mobile data services, according to Strand Consultancy (2002). In responding to this opportunity, mobile service operators face several uncertainties. First, the specific types of MDS products that will meet marketplace desires are not well understood (Evans 2001). Until the value propositions are established, it is impossible to source and price content. Next, the underlying structure of this market, which is the basis for its segmentation, is not likely to resemble current markets. In any case, operators are not effectively segmenting mobile markets, as evidenced by high churn rates. Finally, several years and billions of dollars will be needed to deploy 3G. Given that these factors are the basis of a viable business model (Afuah and Tucci 2001), and that fixed costs are likely to dominate the MDS cost structure, MDS investment risk will remain high until these knowledge gaps are filled. Approach This work integrates two perspectives on market segmentation. Diffusion research, by categorising adopters according to their intended and actual adoption behaviour, creates segments derived from factors such as perceived value, time, and access to information (Rogers 1995). Needs-based segmentation emerges in information intensive contexts, where competing demands for attention (Simon 1971, Goldhaber 1997) shift marketing and communication activity from the traditional mass media orientation toward a personalised approach, enabled by information technology (Hoffman and Novak 1996). To successfully introduce new products to emerging markets, it is necessary to acquire an understanding of the underlying phenomena: consumer behaviour, market segmentation, product life cycles and positioning, and competitive behaviour (Urban and Star 1991). This work explores the first two of these phenomena. Needs-based Market Segmentation Originating in diffusion research, different adopter groups perceive innovations and thus behave differently. Miller (1993) finds that prior knowledge of potential adopters can focus the use of resources to prevent an innovation from failing. The three dimensions for segmentation analysis are based on Weinstein (1994): Table 1: Segmentation Dimensions Demographic Psychographic Behavioural Age, occupation , gender, income, religion, nationality, education, marital status, ethnicity Values, lifestyle, interests, opinions, activities Product use patterns and perceived benefits Innovation theory can be applied to identify the attitudes and behaviour of early adopters, as a dynamic basis for a market segmentation model. A Research Framework for MDS Deployment The figure below models interactions among supply factors, demand factors, and the contextual forces that mediate supply and demand, from the dual perspectives of the MDS operator and its subscribers. Contextual forces – the flow of wealth, new tools, public policy, and culture shape both the supply of new technology-based services and the demand for them (Urban and Star 1991). The marketplace is mediated by these macro forces. Supply factors for operators include both internal and external HIICS 2003 mobile data services 3 resources, marketing activities, and operational activities such as customer care. An operator’s current subscribers represent both opportunities and constraints, in that perceived subscriber needs and expectations tend to influence both the value proposition and pricing structure for new offerings. On the demand side, adoption and use of MDS are driven by various types of personal needs and by institutional forces such as employer or client expectations. Adoption of new MDS may be constrained by commitments brand loyalty, a lack of number portability to a new operator, or the expiry date of a service contract to their current mobile operators, or simply by a lack of awareness regarding the availability and features of new services. Figure 1: A Research Framework for Mobile Data Services This framework is multidisciplinary and atheoretical, in the sense that it is possible to map it to any one of several theories. From a strategy perspective, it is compatible with the Porter diamond (Porter, 1990), while from a behavioural perspective, the Rogers (1986, 1995) model of innovation adoption is a good fit. The framework is also dynamic: changes in any cell are likely to influence others. For example, when MDS technology enables a new value proposition on the supply side, its emergence in the marketplace may alter market structure, tap latent user needs, or reveal new governance issues, 	anytime algorithm;bang file;circuit switching;emergence;failure;freedom of information laws by country;handheld game console;high availability;interaction;internet;joseph d. novak;landline;logo;markup language;mega man battle network;mobile phone;personal computer;prospective search;software deployment;strand (programming language);theory;tom gruber;urban computing;world wide web	A.

In the case of social debt, decisions are about people and their interactions. Our objective was to study the causality around social debt in practice. In so doing, we conducted exploratory qualitative research in a large software company. We found many forces together causing social debt; we represented them in a framework, and captured anti-patterns that led to the debt in the first place. Finally, we elicited best practices that technicians adopted to pay back some of the accumulated debt. We learned that social debt is strongly correlated with technical debt and both forces should be reckoned with together during the software process.	anti-pattern;best practice;causality;interaction;social engineering (security);software development process;software engineering;technical debt	Damian Andrew Tamburri;Philippe Kruchten;Patricia Lago;Hans van Vliet	2015	Journal of Internet Services and Applications	10.1186/s13174-015-0024-6	computer science;technical debt;management science;computer applications;computer security	HCI	-84.10720845722818	1.6385646136663774	91609

However, this growing (and at times, conflicting) body of research has made it challenging for researchers and practitioners to comprehend the current state of knowledge on the formation, implementation, and effectiveness of security policies in organizations. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to synthesize what we know and what remains to be learned about organizational information security policies, with an eye toward a holistic understanding of this research stream and the identification of promising paths for future study. We review 114 influential security policy-related journal articles and identify five core relationships examined in the literature. Based on these relationships, we outline a research framework that synthesizes the construct linkages within the current literature. Building on our analysis of these results, we identify a series of gaps and draw on additional theoretical perspectives to propose a revised framework that can be used as a basis for future research.	information security	W.

According to the exploratory findings of this research, the research endeavored to achieve two main targets. Initially, it was revealed that the telemedicine phenomenon was not that extensive in the UAE in the sense there was no self initiated TM networks or specialty TM centers as such. According to this finding the researcher attempted to explore the perceptions of healthcare professional in the UAE about their attitudes and behavior towards adopting the TM technology in their organizations using a theoretical construct extended from the technological innovation literature. Secondly, the existing TM initiatives in the UAE were initiated in cooperation with Mayo Clinic to have complete multimedia TM system for teleconsultations (second opinion). The effectiveness of this approach is also examined in this research. The research discusses the research findings in the light of the overall literature highlighting further implications and suggesting ways where TM could be pushed forward in the UAE. What is yet to be seen in the UAE context is the initiation of self governed specialty TM systems and networks.	bang file;theoretical definition	Nabeel A. Y.

In particular, social complexity is increasingly seen as an innate feature of multiparty ISD projects which make them less amenable to being ‘tamed’. However, an understanding of the intricacies of social complexity and how it impacts team cohesion in multiparty projects remains nascent. In this paper we offer findings from the case study of a funded academia-industry collaboration to investigate the elusive phenomenon of social complexity. A theoretical framework is developed to reveal the factors which contribute to social complexity and its impact on team cohesion in multiparty ISD projects. The findings derived from the application of this lens reveal the numerous challenges to team cohesion that arose from the interplay between macro- and micro-level factors.

Literature on formal governance suggests that either a coercive (i.e., to force employees' effort and compliance) or an enabling (i.e., to help employees better to master their tasks) design of procedures help to avoid what literature calls 'mock bureaucracy' (i.e., rules are promulgated for their symbolic value but ignored in practice). Our analysis of two organizations, however, implies that both coercive and enabling governance for IT-RM may lead to mock bureaucracy. We categorize antecedents of 'mock' IT-RM procedures and identify important design challenges for IT-RM research and practice. Our study contributes to the IT governance body of knowledge by linking types of bureaucracy to IT governance tasks and providing anti-patterns associated with IT-RM procedures.	anti-pattern;bureaucracy;categorization;it risk management;mock object	Manuel Wiesche;Michael Schermann;Helmut Krcmar	2013	2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2013.607	public relations;it risk management;risk management;computer science;knowledge management;information management;enabling;management	HCI	-81.70666955119792	-0.8336248010638853	91940

Decision making requires the availability and proper use of data. Three evolving technologies relate to the support of decision making: information processing, decision science methods, and organization of decision makers and decision processes. More and more, because of technological developments and increased understanding of complex decision situations, these technologies must be seen as an integrated whole in order to support efficient and effective decision making. Within organizations, different groups are often charged with each of the three technologies that should support decision making. As a result, we often experience problems where the data is unavailable, is not compatible with the analyses desired, or is not relevant to the decision-making processes that managers wish to use. A substantive integration of these support groups and their expertise would help.rnrnActing as a change agent, business and management schools can develop a conceptualization of the three technology areas that integrates them with respect to terminology. They can also develop a unified set of general constructs that carry throughout each of the areas. Further, a new series of core courses can be developed that present the integrated technology subjects in a logical sequence.rnrnManagement schools have been concerned with teaching concepts and skills related to data acquisition, manipulation, and presentation to their students for some time. However, in organizing the delivery of data-handling concepts and skills, these schools have relied on courses from various disciplines such as decision sciences (DSci), management information systems (MIS), and managerial decision making (MDM). These courses in management school curricula are generally redundant, use similar terminology differently, and are not mutually supportive.rnrnThis article focuses on the design and delivery of an integrated sequence of core courses that addresses the three technology areas. Drawing on experience at our own schools, we address general course design principles, resolution of issues on content requirements and delivery, implementation issues, and current and future problems related to the effective integration of topics that have traditionally been addressed in DSci, MIS, and MDM courses.

95e29cca84ef17abc56dd7d335c7d4422fcfd545	information technology and organizational structure revisited: implications for performance	information technology;organizational structure	While the relationship between information technology (IT) and organizational structure has long been a focus of research from a descriptive and prescriptive point of view, few solid results have been found as of yet linking this relationship to enterprise level performance. This can be attributed to problems related to the definition and measurement of IT, performance and fit between technology and structure. In trying to overcome some of these problems, an empirical study was conducted among 108 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms, using a comprehensive instrument to measure IT sophistication in lieu of individual criterion variables. Controlling for organizational size and environmental uncertainty, it was found that IT sophistication is positively related to structural sophistication, IT sophistication is positively related to organizational performance, and the relationship between IT sophistication and structural sophistication is stronger among high-performing firms than among low-performing firms.

The reliability of networks is therefore of crucial importance for ensuring effective business processes. All IT networks are administered and managed by human administrators. As the process of administration becomes increasingly complex, human limitations can amplify challenges to network reliability and security. Despite researchers’ agreement that the human factor becomes increasingly significant as the network becomes more reliable, efforts to design reliability measures have remained largely separate from considerations of the human component. We examined the question of whether joint consideration of these two components would be useful in designing reliability of enterprise networks. We interviewed and surveyed networking professionals to understand their impact on network reliability. The result is a discussion of specific demographic, organizational, and technical factors that contribute to network reliability issues. For demographic factors, academic background was a notable factor associated with network instability. For organizational factors, a notable factor was the number of devices assigned per administrator. Finally, for technical factors, a notable factor was misconfiguration of networking devices, which contributed significantly to the unreliability of the studied networks. Based on this research, we concluded that the future of network reliability engineering will benefit substantially from actively addressing the human role in network administration and management.	best practice;business process;communications protocol;computer science;human factors and ergonomics;instability;networking hardware;norm (social);proactive parallel suite;public key certificate;reliability engineering;requirement;semiconductor industry	Magreth Mushi;Rudra Dutta	2017	Journal of Network and Systems Management	10.1007/s10922-017-9440-1	networking hardware;organizational network analysis;human error;enterprise private network;reliability (computer networking);management science;network security;computer science;instability;human reliability	Web+IR	-79.36315984531106	-0.3310186223411404	92281

These digital service encounters bring along two changes: First, diverse digital channels such as text, audio, or video communication vary in the perceived media richness and perceived social presence of the counterpart. Second, digital channels allow service providers to employ service personnel remote from the customer and to serve a geographically wider, potentially global market. In this, there is a rise of intercultural service encounters. Therefore, we investigate how customer satisfaction is influenced by the type of digital communication channel and by cultural differences between service personnel and customer. We build a theoretical model on the effect of communication channels and cultural differences on customer satisfaction in digital service encounters. Afterwards, we collect data through an internetbased survey including a simulation of a digital service encounter and cultural differences. We use the data and structural equation modelling to test our theoretical model. Our results indicate that perceived media richness and perceived social presence play a substantial role for customer satisfaction. Contrary to prior literature on offline service encounters, our results suggest that perceived cultural distance does not affect customer satisfaction in digital service encounters.	channel (communications);customer relationship management;european conference on information systems;information system;koch snowflake;online and offline;schmidt decomposition;simulation;social presence theory;structural equation modeling;systems engineering	Henner Gimpel;Johannes Huber;Serkan Sarikaya	2016			public relations;customer relationship management;computer science;marketing;advertising	HCI	-83.0954947086773	-2.7278119586551464	92298

This paper presents a conceptual model to examine what determines medical professionals’ acceptance of mobile healthcare systems. The structural equation modeling technique was used to evaluate the causal model and confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the reliability and validity of the measurement model. The results indicate that compatibility and computer self-efficacy (CSE) have significant direct effect on behavioral intent, whereas technical support and training have strong indirect impact on behavioral intent through the mediator of CSE. Among these, the compatibility has the most significant contribution to behavioral intent. Yet, the hypothesis for management support effect on behavioral intention to use is not supported.	causal model;confirmatory factor analysis;mhealth;structural equation modeling;technical support	Jen-Her Wu;Shu-Chin Wang;Li-Min Lin	2005	Proceedings of the 38th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2005.689	structural equation modeling;simulation;mobile telephony;confirmatory factor analysis;computer science;knowledge management;conceptual model;marketing;technology management;operating system;management science;marine technology;mobile computing;management;system testing;health care;causal model	SE	-88.99396593833013	-8.070029067410346	92373

There are various kinds of dimensions about organizational search activities. Past studies on boundary-spanning search have focused mainly on technological dimension. We characterize the boundary-spanning search on geographic dimension. We propose a conceptual model and 6 hypotheses. Data from 156 firms were collected to test above hypotheses. The results show that both local search and nonlocal search have positive effect on incremental innovation. What’s more, local search is more positive than nonlocal search on incremental innovation. Meanwhile, both local search and nonlocal search have positive effect on breakthrough innovation. However, it is not supported by data that nonlocal is more positive than local search on breakthrough innovation.	file spanning;local search (optimization);quantum nonlocality	Wenqiong Yang;Zengyuan Wu;Bei Wu	2016			economics;knowledge management;marketing;management science	AI	-78.82984043190403	2.159061179751339	92459

Research has shown that knowledge workers frequently evaluate KM efforts as missing the mark. They are too often left without the help they need for constructing knowledge-based solutions. Knowledge workers point to failures not so much in retrieving topically-perfect-information but rather to communication gaps, such as systems that do not address work demands and informing needs in complex, changing, and sometimes elusive situations. This research used an interviewing approach informed by Dervin's Sense-Making Methodology. The aim was to allow digging deeply to understand hidden depths of informing practices that rarely have come to light in user studies. The ultimate aim is to design systems that support knowledge creation anchored to knowledge worker informing practices and to the situationality of these practices. The purpose of this paper is to present an exemplar study focusing on the challenges of doing user research in such a way that it usefully informs the design of knowledge management systems intended for use in knowledge-intensive work in the for-profit context. Sense-Making Methodology is presented as an alternative and more powerful approach to studying knowledge creation work.	sensemaking	Patricia Souto;Brenda Dervin;Reijo Savolainen	2008		10.1002/meet.2008.1450450221	computer science;knowledge management;body of knowledge;knowledge-based systems;management science;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;domain knowledge	Vision	-79.11526172515225	-1.4220716877869626	92508

In the literature several theoretical strands have examined the impact of the purpose of inter-firm relationships on the forms of governance. Building on a robust literature review on the topic, this study focuses on a specific issue influencing the choice of the form of governance in inter-firm relationships, i.e. the purpose of inter-firm relationships with relation to partner's resources. We gather in a unique framework three typologies of partner's resources, i.e. production, R&D and marketing, and through two empirical analyses in two different Italian industries, machine tool and pharmaceutical, we show how differently these purposes shape the choice of the governance mode.

To do this, it appears very promising the use of lightweight e-voting systems relying on existing social networks, as a good way to solve the trade-off among security, usability and scalability requirements. Among the other security features, anonymity of citizens i.e., secreteness should be guaranteed, at least to be sure that the action of people is actually free from conditioning. However, the decisional process would be better driven if the opinions of citizens were mapped to social, economic, working, personal, non-identifying attributes. In this paper, by extending a previous solution working on existing social networks, we overcome the above limit by re-interpreting the classical concept of secreteness in such a way that a preference expressed by a citizen can be related to a number of certified attributes chosen by the citizen herself, yet keeping her anonymity.

Promoting knowledge sharing within organizations is an increasingly important challenge for managers. Past literature in organizational studies has focused on personal motivations to explain knowledge sharing behaviors. We see an organization as consisting of multiple networks simultaneously, e.g. informational, structural, and relational networks. We propose a model to understand the individual knowledge sharing behavior from informational, structural, and relational perspectives in an organizational context. We find that in the context of interpersonal task related knowledge sharing, perceived value of knowledge, empathy and dependence play a critical role in knowledge sharing while the impacts of competition and relationship building are insignificant.	information science	Shun Cai;Yunjie Calvin Xu	2008			organizational network analysis;public relations;organizational learning;knowledge management;management science;knowledge value chain	AI	-82.4663607445483	0.8082308832880589	92785

Laptops can connect to the internet via cellular services, handheld devices can deliver email and phone calls; support for these devices and services requires technical expertise that cuts across the traditional fields of information technology and telecommunications. At Yale University, the School of Medicine IT department has begun collaborating with the University Telecommunications department to provide a single point of contact for IT and Telecom services. We will outline the process we used to evaluate the single point of contact concept, including needs and feasibility assessments. Our discussion will identify both barriers and strategies for success. Some of the barriers were political, some logistical and some technical. Groundwork included developing a shared vision, establishing trusting relationships, defining user needs and preferences and researching current and emerging technologies. We will present the collaborations we have established, including a coordinated Web presence, collaborative research and development and a unified service center. We will also discuss the options we discarded, such as a single call center. We will offer advice for how other IT departments can begin integrating telecommunications support in this rapidly developing technology sector.	converge;display resolution;email;laptop;logistics;mobile device;trust (emotion);web presence	Susan Grajek;Gunther Dannheim;Jeffrey Euben;Joseph Paolillo;David Stagg	2002		10.1145/588646.588710	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;enhanced telecom operations map;management science	HCI	-88.99021370243798	4.12494488905097	92903

Using a previously established set of social sustainability key performance indicators (KPIs) targeting the operations level (i.e. impacts on EWM operators), social implications are examined in a case where a specific innovative new technology is introduced to replace manual sorting of e-waste into re-use, refurbish and recycle fractions. The social sustainability KPIs were applied to the case as a structured interview guide. The results showed that the KPI framework provided a good basis for examining the social impacts and also stimulated discussions about potential business impacts based on the human resources in the system. The framework showed that the implementation supported proactive social sustainability, but some additional conditions need to be addressed by the customer organization to make sure that potential risks (identified in the interview) are mitigated.	electronic waste;physical symbol system;sorting	Naghmeh Taghavi;Ilaria Barletta;Cecilia Berlin	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22759-7_67	engineering;knowledge management;environmental resource management;operations management	HCI	-80.73573845082007	-0.15506765678683684	93010

These dimensions were evolved from the literature. The qualitative scales for the dimensions were explained with a scale table. The scale table was constructed using fuzzy possibility values. Each respondent used this table as a guideline before responding to each item in the questionnaire. The data analysis validates the relationship between IS flexibility, organizational flexibility, and competitive advantage. The results of path analysis confirmed that organizational flexibility and competitive advantage could be achieved through IS flexibility.

In this regard the use of GMOs in food and agricultural applications has increased greatly over the past decade. However, the development of GM crops has been a matter of considerable interest and worldwide public controversy. This, in addition to skepticism, has stifled the use of this practice on a large scale in many areas, including Iran. It stands to reason that a greater understanding of this practice could be formed after a review of the existing expert opinions surrounding GM crops. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the predictors that influence agricultural experts' attitudes toward the development of and policies related to GM crops. Using a descriptive correlational research method, questionnaire data was collected from 65 experts from the Agricultural Organization in the Gotvand district in Southwest Iran. Results indicated that agricultural experts were aware of the environmental benefits and possible risks associated with GM crops. The majority of participants agreed that GM crops could improve food security and accelerate rural development, and were proponents of labeling practices for GM crops. Finally, there was a positive correlation between the perception of benefits and attitudes towards GM crops.	agricultural crops;attitude;avian crop;description;benefit	Mansour Ghanian;Omid M.

However, sharing knowledge is not risk-free. An organization might lose its competitive edge if it shares too much or certain key knowledge. In addition, an organization might suffer if its intellectual property is improperly handled by its business partners. While the literature has touted the value of knowledge sharing within networks, there is a conspicuous absence of studies examining the risks of sharing knowledge. To address this gap, we develop an exploratory framework that categorizes knowledge-sharing risks across multiple dimensions. Such a framework is a structured approach to knowledge risk management and complements the practice-based approach to knowledge risk management that is presented in (Marabelli and Newell, 2012). Our framework outlines the various kinds of knowledge risks that organizations are facing. We use a combination of knowledge-based and transaction cost theories to show how knowledge risk impacts knowledge transfer among entities in the network, the whole network, and the risk mitigation options.

Instead, the question that is more relevant is how well the electronic services offered by a particular organization perform in comparison with those offered by others. Benchmarking is currently a popular means of answering that question. The benchmarking of e-Government services has reached a critical stage where, as we argue, simply measuring the number of electronic services is not enough and a more sophisticated approach is needed. This paper details the development of a Contextual Benchmark Method (CBM). The value of CBM is that it is both benchmark- and context-driven.	benchmark (computing);e-government;itil;online service provider;population;quality of service;replicator (stargate);word lists by frequency;yang	Jurjen Jansen;Sjoerd de Vries;Paul van Schaik	2010	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2010.02.003	public relations;context analysis;e-government;economics;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;services computing;world wide web;benchmarking	AI	-81.23920673440408	-7.145172977566555	94884

Following a case study methodology, we examined developer interaction data from three active and successful FLOSS projects using qualitative research methods, speciWcally inductive content analysis, to identify the task-assignment mechanisms used by the participants. We found that ‘self-assignment’ was the most common mechanism across three FLOSS projects. This mechanism is consistent with expectations for distributed and largely volunteer teams. We conclude by discussing whether these emergent practices can be usefully transferred to mainstream practice and indicating directions for future research. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the wealth of information available on web ease-of-use or usability, there is no standard, allencompassing framework defining web site effectiveness. Hence it is difficult to measure usability from a qualitative and especially quantitative perspective. In this paper, we examine various approaches to assessing Web site effectiveness and usability, and then present a three-dimensional approach that takes into account the context of the site and its functionality within that context.	electronic business;usability;web presence	Amit Basu	2003		10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174475	e-commerce;web service;web usability;web application security;three-dimensional space;web mining;web development;web modeling;data web;web analytics;web mapping;usability;web design;web standards;computer science;marketing;web navigation;social semantic web;multimedia;web intelligence;web engineering;web 2.0;world wide web	Web+IR	-88.43183627610794	-7.592407629118827	95016

Beliefs about property rights affect information and knowledge sharing. This study explored factors that help determine an individual's beliefs about the organizational ownership of information and expertise that he or she has created. Four different situations of organizational ownership (information vs. expertise/internal vs. external sharing) were considered. The study found that a belief in self-ownership was positively associated with organizational ownership - suggesting a collaborative type of ownership situation for both information and expertise and for both internal (intraorganizational) and external (interorganizational) sharing situations. Organizational culture and the type of employee also influenced the beliefs of organizational ownership in all four scenarios. We conclude the paper with implications for practice and future research.		Sirkka L. Jarvenpaa;D.

Many of these are single person run micro-businesses and cannot afford to buy and maintain their own IT infrastructure. For others, easy availability of cheap labour provides a convenient alternative even though it results in inefficiency, as little or no records are maintained, and only manual, paper-based processes are followed. This results in high response times for customers, no formal accountability and higher charges. For the businesses this translates to lower earnings and losses due to inefficiencies. In this paper, we look at few such micro-business segments and explore their current models of operation, while identifying existing inefficiencies and pain points. We build upon the findings and propose an approach for delivering benefits of IT solutions to such micro-business segments. Finally, we present technology that realizes the proposed approach in the specific context of two such segments.	organizing (structure)	Arun Kumar;Nitendra Rajput;Sheetal K.

Successful development of this emerging technology will promote the ability for older people to live independently and age in place. This paper focuses on the socio-technical challenges associated with implementing the AAL market with specific reference to Canada. The strategy used to gather information was a case study design. Market facilitators include the vast Canadian geography, the number of older people living in rural communities, and the development of several provincial initiatives aimed at enabling seniors to remain independent. The principle of universality in Canada's healthcare system bodes well for these technologies, as AAL has the potential to assist in equalizing services to these communities. Barriers include fragmentation of the market, where in Canada more than 100 different health authorities serve individuals across ten provinces and three territories.

Major ganizations have appointed chief knowledge officers (CKOs) a chief learning officers to formally initiate and cultivat KM activities in their organizations. In spite of thes initiatives, the bulk of organizations still have no approached knowledge management (KM) activity formally or deliberately. The cause for this lack effective management of knowledge could be that m organizations are still struggling to comprehend the K concept. The reason for this confusion and lack of cla can be attributed to a gap between the emerging K phenomena and the current lack of understanding ab this phenomena by researchers and practitioners. bridge the gap, the fundamental issue of identifyi salient characteristics of KM phenomena needs to addressed. This is a prerequisite for systematic resea into the nature and possibilities of KM, as well as f easing the emergence of KM into practice.

Drawing on recent research on issues of gender within the IT profession (Ahuja 2002; Trauth 2002), as well as on recent studies into gender differences in workplace stress (Gardiner & Tiggeman 1999), we develop a conceptual framework to understand the phenomenon. We develop hypotheses about how the experiences of men and women IT professionals will differ in certain ways as they adopt and adapt to using a technological innovation. Using a mixed-method study of two firms that were adopting a technological innovation, we examine employees' reactions along gender lines. We found that perceived compatibility of the changes being assimilated was inversely related to employees' perceptions of stress for both men and women. While women experienced higher levels of stress and being overworked (as we predicted), there were also some unanticipated findings. Women IT professionals appeared to be more sensitive to the total number of elements in the work environment that were changing (total amount of change) as a precursor to stress. In the one firm where managers provided more autonomy but less supervision in adapting to the new technology, women reported considerably higher levels of stress. Based on both our expected and unexpected findings, we provide insights for IT practitioners to anticipate and manage workplace stress, and we offer future directions for researchers. We argue that our recommendations will allow employers to better accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce.	autonomy;computer compatibility;computer-aided software engineering;control variable (programming);data assimilation;dummy variable (statistics);experience;graphical user interface;javascript;powerbuilder;reed–solomon error correction;requirement;system requirements;systems design	Michael J.

This study measures the expectations and perceptions of various service elements among clients of Military Engineer Services (MES) in India. Customers’ survey mode was used to measure the expectations, perception, importance and satisfaction. The perceived quality of services provided by this department was measured with SERVQUAL instrument on selected attributes using the Gap approach for identifying priorities. Additionally, this study also examines the influence of demographic characteristics of clients on expectations and perceptions of the clients. The results can be used by similar organisations for cultural and structural change to increase accountability and performance, in which the results indicate that the three most important dimensions in the order of importance among the clients of MES are tangibles, responsiveness and reliability.	computer performance;manufacturing execution system;responsiveness;servqual	Anand Parkash Bansal;Vishnuprasad Nagadevara	2010	IJISSS	10.4018/jisss.2010070105	service provider;public relations;economics;knowledge management;marketing;structural change;public sector;customer satisfaction;law;service quality	SE	-87.07337227011628	-3.6494674896198167	96040

Importantly, this study aims to develop a conceptual framework that is based on previous literature of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in order to examine the relationships between certain factors (government trustworthiness, service quality and citizen satisfaction) and citizen adoption of e-government services. A self-administered questionnaire was used to capture data from 356 Jordanian citizens across the country randomly. The findings indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, citizen satisfaction and trustworthiness are significant predictors of the Jordanian intention to use an e-government service. The results also showed that the service quality dimensions: responsiveness, reliability, and empathy have significant impacts on the citizen satisfaction. The study has made significant contributions to the body of knowledge at academic and practical levels as an important exploratory study that was conducted in the context of Jordan, a developing country with genuine need for more research works on e-government issues. In addition, this study provides some valuable insights into the performance and adoption of e-government in Jordan that could help government agencies to improve the effectiveness of their services.

This revelatory case study follows fresh cut roses’ journey from the growers in Kenya to the retail distribution in Holland and shows relatively high barriers related to the associated activities, information and documents, etc. Our empirical findings reveal the serious limitation that existing inter-organizational system (IOS) only facilitates actor-to-actor information forwarding in a communication chain of peer-to-peer communication along the supply chain and has no provision for persistent and simultaneous exchange of information between multiple actors. To address this limitation, we conducted a comparative analysis of affordances of the existing vs. future inter-organizational information systems with a focus on sharing critical information. Our extended analysis shows that modern IT features supporting affordances could be useful for the actors’ collaboration in the trade lane of the roses. We discuss some of the benefits of our proposed approach (e.g. lower transaction cost and real time information) but also raise some concerns (e.g. about trust and governance) which calls for further research.	information system;peer-to-peer;qualitative comparative analysis	Thomas Jensen;Ravikiran Vatrapu	2015			information infrastructure;simulation;activity theory;computer science;operations management;affordance;advertising	SE	-78.76909243297942	0.9916596160243273	96375

Beyond clinical indicators and standards, however, there exist few evaluative frameworks for assessing health information, especially within peer-to-peer networks. Traditional methods of analyzing online discussion content, such as keyword examination or network structure analysis, have proven largely unsatisfactory for unstructured health data analysis. Using a disease-specific illustration, this study proposes a theoretical framework that is broad enough to encompass a variety of poorly understood healthcare domains, and provides one example of an often misunderstood and ambiguous disease that lends itself to online patient-centered discussion, which can serve to supplement traditional clinical information exchange.	epilepsy;existential quantification;information exchange;internet;keyword;patients;peer-to-peer;standards characteristics	Daniel P.

Security knowledge sharing substantially reduces risk and investment in information security. Despite the importance of information security, little research based on knowledge sharing has focused on the security profession. Therefore, this study analyses key factors, containing attitude, self-efficacy, trust, norm of reciprocity, and shared language, in respect of the information security workers intention to share knowledge. Information security professionals in virtual communities, including the Information Security Professional Association (ISPA), Information Systems Security Association (ISSA), Society of Information Risk Analysts (SIRA), and LinkedIn security groups, were surveyed to test the proposed research model. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique were used to analyse the data and evaluate the research model. The results showed that the research model fit the data well and the structural model suggests a strong relationship between attitude, trust, and norms of reciprocity to knowledge sharing intention. Hypotheses regarding the influence of self-efficacy and reciprocity, to knowledge sharing attitude were upheld. Shared language did not influence either the attitude or intention to share knowledge.	information security	Alireza Tamjidyamcholo;Mohd Sapiyan Bin Baba;Hamed Tamjid;Rahmatollah Gholipour	2013	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2013.05.010	computer science;knowledge management;virtual reality;social psychology	HCI	-87.92217010109988	-3.981992026017097	96513

Specifically, enterprise resource planning systems are not typically regarded as innovative, as measured by a multidimensional construct of knowledge and skills as well as information and communication. The innovative nature of the enterprise resource planning system is dependent on the infusion level of the individual user. This study hypothesizes that a greater level of infusion results in increased individual innovation. In addition, information quality and system quality are hypothesized to be positively related to higher levels of infusion.	enterprise resource planning	John Muraski	2015			natural resource economics	AI	-82.39057514958516	2.550321432068693	96605

The objectives of this study are to examine the usage patterns of the mobile Internet in different countries and to interpret these differences from a cross-cultural perspective. We propose a value structure in order to investigate the cross-cultural differences in mobile Internet usage. The value structure is an analytic framework that consists of various types of values that the mobile Internet provides. To identify the value structure of the mobile Internet and compare usage patterns, large-scale online surveys were conducted in Korea and Japan simultaneously with the same questionnaire. Results show that value structures of the mobile Internet are significantly different between Korea and Japan, and effects of the values on the degree of satisfaction derived from the mobile Internet vary across the two countries.

Increasingly organisations are under pressure to change their work practices and organisational structures. Typically these changes are supported by information and communication technologies that have major impacts on jobs, the workplace itself, and employment generally. Yet HCI research and practice have tended to focus on the interface between the individual user and the computer. This focus has excluded the relationships between the technology, the people who use it, the organisational environment and the work the technology is intended to support.

Emotions do not only influence the human mind, but can also be transferred to others through knowledge. This transfer of knowledge is part of the broader organizational concept of knowledge management (KM) and requires the attention of researchers interested in emotions and emotion theories. Therefore, our paper presents a systematic review of existing evidence on the emotions’ role in KM research. Our review shows that despite KM’s long tradition, there is only limited evidence as to how emotions are related to KM, most of which mention emotions as motivation for KM. As a result of our study, we identify four research opportunities to further examine certain aspects of emotions’ role in KM.	information system;knowledge management;mind;systematic review;theory	Olivia Hornung;Stefan Smolnik	2018				NLP	-78.11141156377339	-2.154220823064933	97200
783fe58142d959fc0b5b9d54f70d5ed333109f75	thinking relationally about digital inequality in rural regions of the u.s		This article reconsiders the concept of digital inequality drawing from recent developments in science and technology studies, including evolving theories of materiality (Barad, 2003; Bennett, 2010; Ingold, 2012), work on critical media infrastructures (Parks and Starosielski, 2015), and on maintenance and repair (Jackson, 2014; Edgerton, 2007). New ways of thinking about the material world move away from an examination of the cultural significance of ‘objects’ to consider the relationality, vibrancy, and continual “becoming” of materials that we live amidst and interact through. These innovative theoretical developments offer new ways of framing present-day problems and consequences of disparate connectivity by drawing attention to connecting infrastructures instead of the end points of access. I draw from ethnographic fieldwork on Internet access and use in a rural and remote part of northern California to show how the uneven and patchy deployment of the Internet and its physical infrastructures across space shapes rural experiences of the Internet.	social inequality	Jenna Burrell	2018	First Monday		public relations;internet access;software deployment;the internet;computer science;science, technology and society;social science;materiality (auditing);ethnography	Theory	-77.6393716938004	-9.548459464823082	97304
6cc0d69d2b237ff07ca3fe1d0b8222cac2637ba8	the analysis of network additionality in the context of territorial innovation policy: the case of italian technological districts		Evidence from economic literature suggests that innovative activities based on extensive interactions between industry, universities and local government can yield high levels of economic performance. In many countries, therefore, steps have been taken at an institutional level to set up innovation networks and, in particular, regional technological districts. Our paper deals with Italian Technological Districts: we aim to analyse the network additionality for territorial innovation determined by district policy. The analysis is based on a priori structural regional characteristics and on Social Network Analysis techniques.

From the view of e-business process, this paper, together with the theory of resource-based view (RBV), demonstrates the formation of collaborative e-business capability in the e-CRM process. We find that the integration of IT resources is the foundation for the creation of e-business capability and IT knowledge integration capability, serving as a kind of internal e-business capability, and fully mediates the creation of collaborative e-business capability. This study is expected to help managers in planning internal and external resources and make contributions to the research perspective on e-business capability.	business process;control variable (programming);electronic business;knowledge integration	Yi Jiang;Jing Zhao	2012	IJNVO	10.1504/IJNVO.2012.045212	tertiary sector of the economy;information and communications technology;customer relationship management;capability;economics;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;management;law	HCI	-77.68169940845381	3.97154667264589	97575

A survey study was conceived which relied on the exposure of respondents to a marketing campaign for this technology. In preceding steps Theory of Planned Behavior and Technology Acceptance Unified Theory were applied to adequately model and test predictive relations upon intention to adopt that technology and upon expectation of remaining with known methods that compete with the technology, with a Partial Least Squares structural modeling approach. Results suggest that the frameworks are useful for predicting intention to adopt this type of technology. Especially important predictors were Effort Expectancy, Social Factors and Positive Attitudes. Given validation of the nomological network, the goal is to comprehensively integrate differences in adoption across socio-demographic strata and tied to consumers’ energy behaviors with the structural network linking IT predictors to dependents.	class diagram;partial least squares regression	Maria São João Breda;Marta Lopes	2014		10.5220/0004941902960304	simulation	HCI	-88.05183561980058	-6.95742601441078	97581

There is limited empirical evidence about the determinants of cynicism toward change, particularly in the healthcare sector environment. In this paper, a model is proposed which identifies three key antecedents of cynicism toward change: change information, involvement with change and trust in senior management. Data were collected from two healthcare sector organisations to test the proposed model. The results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equations modelling (SEM) suggest that change information, involvement in change processes and trust in senior management influence cynicism toward change. More specifically, evidence is presented which suggests that involvement in change and trust in senior management directly influence cynicism toward change, and that information about change and involvement in change directly influence trust in senior management. Collectively, the antecedent variables accounted for just over 50% of the variance in cynicism toward change. In general terms, the findings will prove helpful to human resource practitioners interested in diagnosing and managing attitudes to change of healthcare employees.	confirmatory factor analysis	Simon Albrecht	2010	IJISCM	10.1504/IJISCM.2010.033075	public relations;structural equation modeling;economics;confirmatory factor analysis;knowledge management;change management;trustworthy computing;management	SE	-83.06089292029066	-0.268541093523887	97696

Dynamic political and economic environments strengthen these effects. Multiple concepts addressing this challenge can be identified and “learning organizations” are one key concept in economics to handle knowledge increase and dynamic environment. Environmental Management Systems based on ISO 14001 or EMAS (Eco Management and Audit Scheme) are possible ways to extend the organization’s environmental awareness. The goal of this contribution is to analyze whether environmental management systems have this effects on (German) hospitals or not. So this chapter combines the concepts of environmental management systems and learning organizations in context of hospital organizations. After a short introduction to environmental management systems the concept of organizational learning in the three dimensions of learning levels, learning types and learning determinants is pointed out. German hospitals and their organizational attributes as the object of study are introduced next. The main part of this chapter is the analysis of organizational learning processes initiated by environmental management systems. It is shown that these processes can be found in all three learning dimensions in a hospital. So the implementation of environmental management systems could be a possibility to extend organization’s environmental awareness. At least empirical surveys are recommended to approve these mainly theoretical outcomes.	environmental resource management;learning organization;management system	Lars Rölker-Denker	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-19536-5_30	environmental management system;international health;environmental health;knowledge management;environmental resource management;nursing;business;organizational space	HCI	-79.72837683869518	-3.766606989561593	97738

The first section introduces some preliminary definitions. The assumption is that a societal transition is more than a social, economic or technological change. It is a large-scale and long-term macro process through which a given social system radically changes its structural basis, in terms of new socio-technical practices, governance rules, social and economic institutions, cultural frames, and patterns of social life. The second section provides an excursus on social science accounts on transitions. In particular, the attention has been given to Norbert Elias’ famous study on the rise and fall of the court society in France, between 17th and 18th century and to Manuel Castells’ recent analysis of the emergence of the network society. The third section discusses problems and challenges of standard approaches and suggests some building blocks of societal transition models, taken from complexity and social simulation literature. The concluding section suggests some way-forward measures towards a computational social science approach to societal transitions.	computational social science;emergence;social simulation;social system;sociotechnical system;theory	Flaminio Squazzoni	2008	Computational & Mathematical Organization Theory	10.1007/s10588-008-9038-y	psychology;social complexity;social relation;technological change;social entropy;social learning;social science;simulation;social order;economics;computer science;artificial intelligence;social philosophy;social system;social simulation;social change;sociology;social;management;social network	AI	-77.62655821783001	-7.2841067928649466	98074

Among these, the provision of government services via the web is becoming increasingly common. As government organisations have begun to enhance transparency, communicate and interact with citizens via the web, developing appropriate online services has demanded heightened understanding of the requirements of users and appropriate tailoring of solutions. In this paper, we examine the results of a quality survey of websites to enable online submission of self-assessed tax returns in the UK. Personal characteristics of respondents and data collected via the eQual instrument are used to model the perceptions of site users. The results point to specific factors determining the use of the e-government service and requiring attention in the development of similar e-government offerings. The paper rounds off with conclusions and an agenda for future research in this area.	e-government;interactivity	Stuart J. Barnes;Richard T.

We systematically vary four organizational culture-related parameters, i.e., organization structure, location of bad apple, employees’ propensity to become corrupted (“corruption probability”), and number of whistle-blowers. Our simulation studies find that in organizations with flatter structures, corruption permeates the organization at a lower threshold value of corruption probability compared to those with taller structures. However, the final proportion of corrupted individuals is higher in the latter as compared to the former. Also, we find that for a 1,000 strong organization, 5% of the workforce is a critical threshold in terms of the number of whistle-blowers needed to constrain the spread of corruption, and if this number I s around 25%, the corruption contagion is negligible. Implications of our results are discussed. 1 Maziar Nekovee (m.nekovee@sussex.ac.uk) is with University of Sussex, UK. 2 Jonathan Pinto (j.pinto@imperial.ac.uk) is with the Business School, Imperial College, UK.

Distributed work arrangement is an organizational innovation that has the potential to enable a firm to meet the challenges of an uncertain environment more effectively. This exploratory study employs a structural model to examine how environmental uncertainty affects organizational predisposition (adoption intention) toward distributed work arrangements through shaping organizational perceptions of distributed work arrangements (perceived relative advantage, compatibility and complexity). Environmental uncertainty is assessed in terms of environmental complexity and variability. Data analyses using partial least squares statistical technique revealed that environmental complexity is negatively associated with perceived relative advantage and perceived compatibility, which were in turn positively related to adoption intention for distributed work arrangements. Contrary to past findings, which suggest that distributed work arrangements could help organizations respond better to uncertain conditions in the environment, our study found that decision-makers operating in complex environments do not perceive distributed work arrangements as beneficial and compatible. The results suggest that these organizations could strive to develop expertise to deal with their complex environments by increasing their information processing capacity, thereby enhancing their perceptions of the benefits and compatibility of distributed work arrangements.

This study concluded that 13 of the 42 private sector applications provide examples of strategic operations research (SOR) when SOR is defined as operations research that creates a sustainable competitive advantage. In a follow-up study we tested our classifications, gathering longitudinal information on the continued success of the Edelman applications. We contacted people who were familiar with all the private sector applications that were Edelman finalists 1989-1996 and had at least five years of history since the competition. We describe the post-Edelman history of these applications and use this data to reassess their strategic role. We found that the longitudinal data provides evidence to support our original classification, but also suggests that several additional applications were more strategic than was originally apparent. We conclude that almost 60% (20 of 34) of these applications created a sustainable competitive advantage for their firms and provide examples of SOR.	digital history;franz edelman award for achievement in operations research and the management sciences	Peter C.

19c65dc6a4ae557af74addb9acee060f06decb57	process and e-service customization - for coordination in healthcare networks		Coordination in healthcare networks becomes increasingly important. A process-oriented coordination approach is introduced which enhances integrated care scenarios by an IT-driven coordination of interorganizational treatment processes – the concept of process-based e-service logistics. The allocation of e-services is based on a model describing services and coordination tasks between roles in a healthcare network. The underlying system’s architecture is presented which implements process-based e-service logistics by designing and executing individual treatment processes, identifying coordination tasks between network actors and dynamically allocating e-services. A solution for automated individualization of processes and e-services based on Case Based Reasoning (CBR) technology is discussed. 1 HEALTHCARE NETWORKING The healthcare industry is an important economic sector in Germany causing annual expenses of about 230 billion euros and employing more than 4.2 million people. Starting point of the research project was an empirical study addressing German and Swiss ambulant healthcare networks (healthcare network managers as well as physicians) to evaluate the maturity of healthcare network organizations regarding strategy, processes and information technology (Schicker et al., 2006a). The empirical study reveals that 81 percent of the respondents expect that networking in the healthcare industry will increase in the next three to five years. Moreover, 88 percent of the survey participants agree that the demand for coordination and IT-support in healthcare networks is going to rise in the future (Schicker et al., 2006a: 21). An important driving force of networking is the concept of integrated care which is often associated with the following instruments: Intersectorial cooperation (Ramming, 2004: 147; Mühlbacher, 2002: 65) Financial responsibility (e.g. capitation) Coordination and control of medical treatment processes (Mühlbacher, 2002: 66) Information integration (Ramming, 2004: 147). Whereas many research projects deal with the integration of health data this project concentrates on the coordination and control of interorganizational processes within healthcare networks by providing patients and suppliers with a customized set of electronic services. To analyze the requirements the research team cooperates with the healthcare network “Qualitätsund Effizienzgemeinschaft NürnbergNord” which is organized as a gatekeeper system. The integrated care contract spans ambulant, clinical and home care service providers and is financed by a full capitation model (Wambach et al., 2005: 13). 2 PROCESS-ORIENTED COORDINATION Process-oriented coordination is seen as one important way to enable integrated care scenarios, to enhance patient satisfaction and to reduce costs of treatment processes (Güntert, 2004: 100ff). Schmalenbach argues for process-oriented control especially to cope with the problem of managing multiple interfaces (Schmalenbach, 1908/09; 211f.). Based on that belief the research project focuses on the treatment process from a cooperative view regarding the patient’s way throughout the whole healthcare network. 2.1 Process Characteristics and Requirements Process-oriented coordination faces important challenges to cope with. Therefore the characteris161 Schicker G., Kaiser C. and Bodendorf F. (2008). PROCESS AND E-SERVICE CUSTOMIZATION For Coordination in Healthcare Networks. In Proceedings of the First International Conference on Health Informatics, pages 161-166 Copyright c © SciTePress tics of healthcare network processes and their requirements will be discussed next. To transfer the general tasks and principles of coordination to the healthcare domain, it has been analyzed which processes (e.g. management, medical treatment and support processes) and coordination tasks exist within healthcare networks (Schicker, 2006b: 39). 2.1.1 Process Characteristics Table 1 depicts characteristics of interorganizational treatment processes that need to be considered when requirements for the IT-support in healthcare networks are defined (Schicker et al., 2006b: 39). Especially the uniqueness of one patient ́s treatment process (Müller-Mundt, 2001: 95) and the high degree of volatility are key characteristics which have to be considered when supporting healthcare network processes by information technology. During their execution processes have to be modified, detailed and customized to the patient ́s needs depending on his individual treatment context (cybernetic model of medical treatment) (Prokosch, 2007).

We also examine how the existence of certain organisational key variables in the OL process, not treated jointly from this perspective, positively affects OL and influences the generation of TDCs. The hypotheses proposed in this respect are tested on a sample of 140 Spanish industrial companies, applying a structural linear equation model according to the Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach. Our findings indicate that factors such as Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) of the organisation, its Learning Orientation (LO) and Information Technology (IT) have a positive impact on OL; whereas, the technological distinctive competences are the result of the OL. On the other hand, the EO of the organisation and the IT play an important role in the creation process of TDCs.

One of potential ways to promote competition among service providers is to introduce a mobile number portability (MNP) service. Consumer preferences are estimated using conjoint analysis. Results indicate that subscribers do not consider the MNP service an import attribute, while price and service quality are the most valuable attributes. The results of this study provide important information to implement the first service launch in mobile telecommunication and other similar information and communication technology (ICT) services.

These projects usually involve a distributed community of users and developers who jointly determine the software's future development. This paper presents the results of a web-based survey that examined which factors affect participant satisfaction with FLOSS projects. A total of 183 usable responses were received from people in 33 countries, representing over 30 different LIM FLOSS projects. Stepwise hierarchical regression showed that five factors (perceived project openness, perceived developer communication quality, perceived complexity, extent of participation, and perceived product openness) accounted for 44% of the variance in satisfaction. Community-oriented characteristics had the most influence, suggesting that in a FLOSS context, project participants need to focus on community development and support to increase overall satisfaction with the project.	expanded memory;free software license;information management;multilevel model;open-source software;openness;stepwise regression;web application	Brenda Chawner	2012		10.1145/2132176.2132206	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;world wide web	SE	-91.13154855379238	-3.873797209905339	99377

The literature has also uniformly agreed on the mechanism underlying this relationship: the sharing of tacit knowledge and recombination of ideas that occurs because of intra-firm mobility. But a second mechanism may also be at work: intra-firm mobility might help distant employees secure access to resources for their innovative projects. Using unique data on travel, employment, and patenting for 1,315 inventors at the Indian R&D center of a Fortune 50 multinational, I find that intra-firm mobility in the form of short-duration business trips from a distant R&D location to headquarters is positively related to higher subsequent patenting at the individual level.

Adopting the self-determination theory, this ERF paper builds a theoretical framework explaining the motivations for online customer review behaviors combining customer-driven, vendor-driven, and website-driven motivations. In particular, this study aims to provide explanation and support for the interaction effect of customer-driven motivations and vendor/website-driven motivations, offering a fresh angle in understanding customers’ online review behaviors. We plan to conduct a field study on Taobao.com to collect data and test the framework. SPSS and SEM software packages will be used for verifying the measurement and testing the whole model. The study will contribute to the literature about motivations for online customer review behaviors by providing a more integrated model based on the knowledge of self-determination theory. The study will also have practical implications by offering guidelines to online vendors and website designers.

Recent advances in computer and communications technologies have changed the way in which organizations perform these functions. Decision support systems (DSSs) are a major category of tools that an organization utilizes to support and enhance its decision-making activities. Traditionally, organizations are considered to have a predefined and static set of goals. However, in order to stay competitive and survive in today’s dynamic environment, organizations must be able to quickly respond and adapt to changes in their business settings. Such changes could be due to technological advances, growing and changing customer demands, competitive forces, changes in the labor force, environmental and political concerns, societal impacts, security concerns, and others. In recent years, the field of DSS has become more sophisticated to encompass such paradigms as expert systems (ESs), intelligent DSSs, active DSSs, and adaptive DSSs. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques are being embedded in many DSS applications, thus enhancing the support capabilities of the DSS. Such paradigms have application potential in both individual and organizational learning contexts. However, the degree to which current DSSs can support organizational learning has yet to be investigated in depth. This paper examines the learning strategies employed by organizations and DSSs and provides a framework to demonstrate how a DSS can enhance organizational learning. D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A suitable research method though relatively new in business management research is agent-based modeled simulations (ABMS). The aim of the paper is therefore also to develop an open innovation ABMS to explore the relative effects of innovation openness and initial capability endowment on firm innovation economics in a competitive context. In this respect the ABMS is applied as a data generating methodology of organizational behavior and industry dynamics. The ABMS acts as a combination of digital role play and experimental design. It is found that design and use of ABMS contribute to enlargement and testing of the usefulness and applicability of ABMS in social science.	agent-based model;design of experiments;open innovation;openness;organizational behavior;simulation	Kristina Risom Jespersen	2013	2013 Winter Simulations Conference (WSC)		simulation;innovation management;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management science	HCI	-78.726698248267	3.7438485362478966	99695

This paper explores how different proximities facilitate innovation development in a coopetition alliance through a longitudinal qualitative case study of firms of different sizes and capabilities within a Norwegian coopetition alliance. We found that the development of cognitive and technological proximities is essential for the development of innovations from coopetition, especially for smaller firms that can exploit the initial levels of proximity facilitated by coopetition to increase their cognitive and technological proximity to the larger firms. We also find that building social proximity in coopetition leads to less tension in the interaction between competitors and thereby less tension in the development of the other proximities important for innovation development.

The members of an engineering team must work together to identify design requirements, explore design spaces, generate design alternatives, and make both interactive and joint design decisions. Because of the latency of information and the disciplinary differences, it is often a difficult process for the members of a team to reach agreements when needed. Negotiation has been studied as a method for facilitating information exchange, mutual understanding, and joint decision making. An argumentation-based negotiation approach was previously proposed by the authors to support collaborative engineering design. In this paper, we present an experiment study that was conducted to evaluate the impact of this negotiation support approach on the process and the outcome of collaborative design. The results of the experiment show both positive effects and limitations of the approach.	complex systems;engineering design process;information exchange;requirement	Yan Jin;Mathieu Geslin	2010	AI EDAM	10.1017/S0890060409990151	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science;negotiation	HCI	-88.17875738874258	-1.5088425435261636	99867

There has been an increased interest and focus on how new technological innovations are enabling and facilitating co-creation; one such digital innovation is open government data (OGD). This paper examines a relatively new concept, that of co-created OGD-driven public services and aims to understand how the availability and exploitation of OGD to co-create new public services allows service users to become collaborators rather than customers of public service providers. An exploratory case study is conducted on a pilot project within Estonia where a new public service has been co-created through the exploitation of OGD. The initial results show that in order for an OGD-driven public service to be effectively co-created, a new understanding of the role of stakeholders is needed.

More specifically, we conceptualize the relationship between the cloud computing initiatives of firms and the market reaction based on resource-based and extended resource-based views. For this study, we analyze 212 firm-level cloud computing announcements between 2006 and 2011 by employing the event study methodology. Our empirical results indicate that the market positively reacts to the cloud computing initiatives of firms. Moreover, the market reactions to cloud computing initiatives depend on three key characteristics of cloud computing, namely, firm-specific, resource-specific, and vendor-specific factors.	cloud computing	Insoo Son;Dongwon Lee;Jae-Nam Lee;Young-Bong Chang	2014	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2014.05.006	cloud computing security;event study;economics;cloud computing;computer science;marketing;utility computing;commerce	DB	-82.86339977088268	3.7693692053438794	100217

Organizational research suggests the concept of ‘enabling formalization’ to design highly formalized organizational processes. Processes like IT-RM that are designed in an enabling way support organizational members through flexible guidelines that communicate best practices and empower them in resolving surprises and crises during process execution. It remains unclear, however, how organizations can implement enabling IT-RM processes. We conduct an exploratory study and identify four design decisions for IT-RM. We identify different solutions to these IT-RM design decisions and provide empirical evidence as to how these solutions facilitate enabling process design. Our results suggest that organizations need to balance rewarding and punishment-centered strategies in designing IT-RM to change it from an ineffective, costly, and detrimental endeavor into an enabling organizational process.	best practice;it risk management;organizational behavior	Manuel Wiesche;Michael Schermann;Helmut Krcmar	2015			computer science;knowledge management;management science	HCI	-81.09668204078427	-0.8349408460318866	100600

The difficulty of designing privacy-preserving information systems highlights the need for studying developers' privacy decision-making processes, as the developers' communities are well coordinated and they are the ones who can promote or hinder privacy in the systems they design. We conducted an online survey (n=101), to understand the effectors on developers' professional privacy attitudes and practices. We investigate whether developer's privacy decision-making is shaped by several factors, including organizational (organizational privacy climate, business and legal contexts), professional (privacy knowledge) and personal (personal perceived privacy).	information privacy;information system;security through obscurity	Oshrat Ayalon;Eran Toch;Irit Hadar;Michael Birnhack	2017		10.1145/3022198.3026326	privacy software;privacy policy;organisation climate;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;knowledge management;privacy	HCI	-85.26595069101872	-7.234456522416722	100852

This research empirically investigates whether Over-Requirement is partially due to emotional involvement of developers with software features they develop. Due to behavioural effects termed Endowment effect, I-Designed-it-Myself effect and IKEA effect, such involvement has been demonstrated when people come to overvalue physical items that they possess, self-design, or self-create. We conducted an experiment to explore these three behavioural effects in the context of a software development project. The 86 participants were randomly assigned to eight different experiment groups, according to whether they were responsible for (or not), specified (or not) and/or constructed (or not) a nice-tohave Over-Required software feature. The study's preliminary findings show that following these manipulations participants over-valued features that they were assigned to be responsible for, to specify or to construct, confirming our proposition that behavioural effects impact software development processes and influence Over-Requirement. The study is of relevance to theory about behavioural effects in software development and to practice via insights to Over-Requirement risk.	randomness;relevance;software development process;software feature	Ofira Shmueli;Nava Pliskin;Lior Fink	2014			software development process;software development;knowledge management;proposition;software;software feature;computer science;endowment effect;ikea effect	SE	-89.06747763180788	2.3758749078039285	101278

Instead of combating these causes with the application of even greater  numbers of formal project management methods, this paper suggests a different approach derived from the systemic theory of  the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. Projects are viewed and treated as social constructs. The approach is based on the  acceptance of the irrationalities in the project environment and attempts to counteract them by understanding and handling  them at their true roots instead of only treating the superficial symptoms. Additionally, this perspective leads to a new  “mindset” for a project manager who is facing complexity, uncertainty and irrationalities in IT projects.

In particular, is there room for socio-technical concepts such as technology affordance, derived from the constructivist tradition, in improving our understanding of operational business processes, particularly human-centric business processes? The paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding the role of business processes in organisational agility that distinguishes between the process-as-designed and the process-as-practiced. How this practice aspect of business processes also leads to the improvisation of various information technology enablers, is explored using a socio-technical lens. The posited theoretical framework is illustrated and validated with data drawn from an interpretive empirical case study of a large IT services company. The research suggests that processes within the organisation evolve both by top-down design and by the bottom-up routinisation of practice and that the tension between these is driven by the need for flexibility.	agile software development;bottom-up proteomics;business process;management science;scientific literature;sociotechnical system;top-down and bottom-up design	Charles Crick;Eng Chew	2015	Software & Systems Modeling	10.1007/s10270-015-0506-9	computer science;engineering;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;management science;process management;business process discovery;management;business rule;new business development;business process modeling	SE	-78.4134528920447	-0.832876162157879	101298

It is commonplace to have teams of employees working together in the workplace based on the belief that the exchange and leveraging of ideas can result in superior performance. Teams are typically comprised of individuals who come from different backgrounds, have varied experiences, knowledge and values, which they can use to address the tasks at hand. Such differences, however, can also result in conflicts within the team which can be detrimental to team performance. Among the different types of conflict, cognitive conflict is not the outcome of conflict of interest; rather the team members view a task from different perspectives even when they have similar interests in achieving an outcome. We propose and test a group judgment making process architecture supported by group support system (GSS) that we argue will reduce cognitive conflicts and result in solutions that the group members can understand and agree on. It utilizes the multi-attribute utility (MAU) multicriteria decision making technique to structure information and also includes a mechanism for incorporating participant feedback at various stages of the process that should contribute to participants being better able to share values, experiences, and information and obtain a better understanding of the trade-offs that need to be made. When we compared our group judgment making process to a conventional face-to-face group meeting approach as well as a GSS supported process without any required structured decision making process, we found it to be more effective based on four measures of attitude towards the formed group judgment.

0ea6b580efe62efacec7f01a8b56a10f15b4a039	rituals in information system design		Developing computer-based information systems is usually conceived as a rational process, intended to achieve identifiable and agreed upon goals. From this perspective, certain elements in the system development process are believed to enhance its effectiveness. For example, handoffs between one project phase and another, feasibility studies conducted prior to development work, and the use of project teams and steering committees are recommended in most texts as activities instrumental to effective system design. Recently, the political view of organizations has assumed greater stature in organization theory. This perspective interprets organizational events not only from the rational standpoint, but also in terms of negotiation and conflicting goals. From the political perspective, elements of the system design process can be interpreted as rituals which enable actors to remain overtly rational while negotiating to achieve private interests. This paper seeks to understand those rituals and to reveal their function in the systems design process.	information system	Daniel Robey;M.

It measures the tendency of Saudi organizations towards eCommerce. Our investigation considers the marketing, human interaction, knowledge support and e-Commerce dimensions within those sites. Today’s Saudi e-Commerce practices are generally immature, where most of the previous dimensions are either missing or very weak. This paper offers an insight into the status of e-Commerce in Saudi Arabia. Despite the fact that our survey is not exhaustive, we claim that the results reached in this paper reflect -to a large extentthe current situation, and could be used by responsible authorities to find means to encourage those practices and overcome weaknesses and barriers.	dvd region code;e-commerce payment system;internet	Mutlaq B.

Relationships between an organization’s investment in IT and the effect of such investments on the organization’s performance and productivity have long been the subject of discussion and research. Managers, interested in knowing the “payoff” of such investments, are continually seeking answers to this question. A failure to understand the benefits of IT investment, or an overor under-estimation of the benefits of a planned investment in IT relative to the costs, will likely result in less than optimal investment decisions.	experience	Mo Adam Mahmood;Mark Dubrow;Gary J.

With the proliferation of social media technologies in enterprise settings and the associated increase in visibility of communication ties, understanding their impact on boundary spanning becomes imperative to improving cross-boundary knowledge creation and management inside organizations. In this paper, drawing on log data from 415 unique work groups in an enterprise social media (ESM) system, we use a machine learning approach to automatically detect three distinct team boundary-spanning activities. Using zero-inflated poisson regressions, we further show the effect of group visibility as well as three distinct sources of group structural diversity -- geographic, functional, and hierarchical -- on the extent to which teams engage in boundary spanning through ESM. Implications for theory and practice around the use of data science approaches as well as visibility and diversity constructs for understanding team boundary spanning are discussed.	data science;file spanning;fractional poisson process;imperative programming;machine learning;social media	Wietske van Osch;Charles Steinfield;Yanjie Zhao	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.274	public relations;media;computer science;organization;knowledge management;diversity scheme;management science;management;cultural diversity;boundary spanning;collaboration	HCI	-89.47697349455866	-0.788277262229143	102295

The activities associated with these efforts are identified as organizational knowledge management (KM). While much has been written about knowledge management from the organizational level, the success of such efforts over the long run will depend upon on how KM activities impact important outcomes as perceived by those at the employee level who actually implement the activities. This study used the input-process-output framework of team effectiveness to investigate the relationship between selected KMrelated activities on integrated product and process development team members’ satisfaction with their project’s success and the impact they expected it to have on the organization. The results indicate that team-level leadership and support (i.e., inputs), along with knowledge generation and dissemination (i.e., processes), are key drivers of member performance-related ratings (i.e., outputs). Finally, and possibly most importantly, a number of interactions were evident suggesting that the KM processes moderate the effects of the KM inputs. These findings and their implications are discussed.

Design/methodology/approach – One major issue in a knowledge-based (KBV) view consists of delimiting the source of competitive advantage, that is, knowledge versus knowledge management processes (acquisition, transfer, generation). Based on the KBV and knowledge management literature, the current paper considers the importance of both elements. Specifically, the paper focuses on strategic knowledge and knowledge transfer process. Findings – The contributions of this paper are the proposal of strategic knowledge characteristics and the suggestion of a theoretical framework to study the internal transfer of strategic knowledge. The main conclusion is that the characteristics of knowledge that generate competitive advantage also create barriers for internal transfer. The research question addressed here is what firms must do to transfer strategic knowledge within the firm while limiting involuntary transfer. Originality/value – In order to answer this question, this paper suggests a theoretical framework that focuses not only on the implications of knowledge of a strategic asset, but rather takes a much broader perspective, considering the transfer process as a whole and highlighting the role of the different elements of this process (source, receiver and context) in order to facilitate the efficient transfer of strategic knowledge.	delimiter;knowledge management	Juan Carlos Bou-Llusar;Mercedes Segarra-Ciprés	2006	J.

IT academics and practitioners find themselves confronted on a daily basis with chaos, un-controlled change and more or less ordered change as new machines, software tools and techniques appear and have to be integrated into existing systems. Dealing with these challenges requires people who are knowledge seekers and problem solvers by inclination, endlessly curious on behalf of other people. This paper addresses the issue of where the role of knowledge seeker and problem solver developed in human history. Parallels are drawn between knowledge seekers in academic cultures and those in First Nation people's cultures. Three aspects of the experiences of past and present knowledge seekers are identified and examined. The first aspect is the initiation of new entrants, the second is the confirmation of acceptance by the group and the third is the vocation of being a knowledge seeker and problem seeker in the IT industry. Metaphor is used to identify these experiences linking together the crucial steps in the processes of becoming accepted as a knowledge seeker. The investigation finds close relationships between First Nations' knowledge seeker's roles and Information Technology roles.	experience;parallels desktop for mac;solver	Robert H.

a773cbbba4b82d29334a106bb2c25e09181f1511	a case study of open source software adoption in australian public sector organisations		Despite a considerable body of literature on factors involved in the Open Source Software (OSS) adoption process, there is little research into concerns of OSS by public sector organisations. So it was important to reassess the factors inhibiting OSS adoption in order to enhance OSS utilization within public sector organisations. This study explored various factors that may inhibit OSS adoption within Australian Public Sector (APS) organisations by interviewing those involved in software procurement. The findings were analysed through the lenses of technology adoption theories (i.e, Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)) and OSS adoption literature. Inhibitors to OSS adoption in APS organisations was contingent upon critical factors such as perceived lack of availability of support and training to sustain long-term usage, economical disadvantages associated with OSS applications such as higher support, maintenance and training costs, lack of product quality, inability to meet organisational business needs, and legal issues with licensing and intellectual property. The findings suggested Rogers’ compatibility and complexity constructs are important factor in OSS adoption.	business requirements;contingency (philosophy);ibm tivoli access manager;open sound system;open-source software;procurement	Kavitha Gurusamy;John Campbell	2011			marketing;knowledge management;software;intellectual property;public sector;procurement;technology acceptance model;computer science	HCI	-80.83118559916133	3.4070956624712445	102567

Drawing on a participant observation study of IT/management consultancy practice, this paper seeks to explore the different ways in which consultants are seen as experts in the light of the pressures of the consultancy market place. The ongoing construction of consultancy expertise through the interaction of consultants and their clients with an array of elements, including technical knowledge, skilled practice, individual and collective experience, and commercial interests is discussed. It is suggested that, rather than being a relatively-enduring property of individuals, based on their mastery of a body abstract knowledge or their skills at managing the perceptions of their clients, the precarious and multi-faceted character of their expertise means that consultants are continuously engaged in its active construction through their situated practice.  2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

22259c45a660cf6d620ef35e602c379dd84d186c	investigating the antecedents and benefits of soa implementation: a multi-case study approach		Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an emerging IT strategy. It is an architectural style for building loosely coupled distributed systems that deliver application functionality as services. Currently there is little academic research published on SOA. As a result, we know little about what factors affect SOA implementation such that reported benefits can be achieved. To fill this gap, we study multiple cases to investigate factors key to successful SOA implementation. Our preliminary findings suggest that SOA requires extremely high levels of organization-IT alignment to achieve reported benefits. Other factors key to successful SOA implementations include SOA registries, governance, effective pilot projects, top management support, trust among business units, personnel training, and change management. A model is proposed as a basis for future SOA diffusion study; implications for both practice and research are discussed.	americas conference on information systems;distributed computing;integrative level;loose coupling;oracle database;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture	Tom E.

Five dimensions of CRM (information sharing, customer involvement, long-term partnership, joint problem-solving, and technology-based CRM) and five aspects of innovation capability (product, process, administrative, marketing, and service innovations) are identified. The one-to-one associations between the two constructs are developed and verified. Design/methodology/approach – Data from 107 Taiwanese computer manufacturers are collected. Multiple regression analysis is employed to examine the effects of CRM on innovation capabilities. Findings – The following results are offered: computer manufacturers in Taiwan perform various levels of CRM and, consequently, display different levels of effects on each of the five innovation capabilities. Generally, firms are able to increase their innovation capability by ad hoc CRM; the relationship between customer involvement and process innovation; customer involvement and administrative innovation; and long-term partnership and marketing innovation are not significant; and technology-based CRM has positive effects on all five types of innovation. Practical implications – The findings suggest that not all CRM activities contribute to innovation programs, which clearly indicates the need for applying other mechanisms, such as supplier integration, to form a complete innovation program. Managers should align the development of their supplier management and CRM practices with the desired innovation capability. Originality/value – The one-to-one relationships between CRM practices and innovation capabilities have not been properly examined. The findings suggest the need for more research in this area, and the statistical results provide managers with useful guidelines for implementing appropriate CRM practices to develop specific innovation capabilities to respond to enhanced competitiveness.	align (company);customer relationship management;hoc (programming language);one-to-one (data model);problem solving	Ru-Jen Lin;Rong-Huei Chen;Kevin Kuan-Shun Chiu	2010	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635571011008434	innovation;customer relationship management;economics;design methods;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;scheduling;customer intelligence;customer retention;empirical research;regression analysis;customer advocacy	HCI	-82.17916124213095	3.2235276764816447	103341

b89f04179bb511deaafb508ef730c8fadf3dae6a	cultural richness versus cultural large scale insights: culture, globalization, and it workers	ethnography;research design choices;mixed method;culture	The increasing globalization of business and of the Information Technology (IT) workforce has increased interest in cross-cultural issues associated with distributed software development, virtual teams, and cultural conflict or collaboration using information and communication technologies (ICT's) [6]. We continue to see a reliance on studies using quantitative methods that compare a limited number of cultural variables (such as Hofstede's 1984), often because of the challenges associated with richer interpretive or ethnographic studies. Ethnography is a traditional design approach when studying rich cultural issues, deeply rooted in anthropology and goals of rich, emic description, and understanding [1]. Unfortunately, in information systems (IS) research, there is a predominant emphasis on quantitative survey designs, sacrificing cultural richness for broader sampling of more limited variables. Our extended abstract proposes mixed method designs that incorporate both quantitative and qualitative methods as a viable, richer alternative to survey research of cultural studies. For purposes of our presentation at ACM SIGMIS-CPR, we are providing some preliminary arguments from our larger study where additional research is analyzed and compared. To illustrate our points, however, we briefly compare two IS cultural studies, one using comparative ethnography and one using a sequential, phased mixed method design. Our goal is not to discourage rich cultural ethnographies, but to provide a viable alternative approach that may enable more culture research in IS.	agile software development;distributed computing;information system;sampling (signal processing)	Michelle L.

It also seeks to consider recent debates within information systems, that the field should develop its own social theories. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate that IS researchers need to engage more fully with the institutional theory literature as the body of work is conceptually rich and is more appropriately used to analyse and understand complex social phenomena. Design/methodology/approach – Reviewing the institutionalist literature from the field of IS, the paper shows that most accounts engage in empirically testing institutionalist concepts, rather than analysing the richness of these concepts to further develop and build the theory. Findings – The paper finds that most institutionalist accounts within information systems research adopt an organisational unit of analysis as opposed to a multi-level approach which encompasses societal and individual levels. Research further shows more studies on the “effects” of institutionalism than on the “processual” accounts. Research limitations/implications – It is argued that information systems researchers need to become more aware of the wider debates within the institutional theory literature, particularly as the theory is conceptually ambiguous, yet not amenable to over-simplification as a means to achieve methodological rigour. Practical implications – The use of institutional theory offers practitioners conceptual tools and techniques for understanding complex change management scenarios relating to IS work. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the IS literature through reviewing the range of studies using institutional theory. It illustrates the narrow use of the theory adopted by the IS community and suggests that a more fruitful approach is to use a wider multi-level and multi-method approach. The paper suggests that institutional theory offers a conceptually rich lens for analysing IS themes and issues and encourages further use of the theory for IS and management research.	change management (engineering);information systems research;information system;multilevel security;norm (social);systems theory;text simplification;theme (computing);visual artifact	Wendy L.

We ask to what different authorities do people report incidents of cyberstalking? Do these authorities provide satisfactory responses or interventions? And how can this be improved? Furthermore, we discuss the role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to encourage the implementation of cyberstalking-aware schemes by service providers to support victims. In addition, CSR can be used as a means to measure the effects of externality factor in dictating the relationship between the impact of a given individuals’ privacy loss and strategic decisions on investment to security controls in an organisational context.#R##N#Method#R##N#A mixed method design has been used in this study. Data collection took place by means of an online survey made available for three years to record both qualitative and quantitative data. Overall, 305 participants responded from which 274 identified themselves as victims of online harassment.#R##N#Result#R##N#Our results suggest that most offences were communicated through private channels such as emails and/or mobile texts/calls. A significant number of victims did not report this to their service provider because they did not know they could. While Police were recognised as the first-point-of-contact in such cases, 41.6% of our sample did not contact the Police due to reasons such as fear of escalation, guilt/sympathy and self-blaming. Experiences from those who have reported offences to service providers demonstrate that no or very little support was offered. Overall, the majority of participants shared the view that third-party intervention is required on their behalf in order to mitigate risks associated with cyberstalking. An independent specialist anti-stalking organisation was a popular choice to act on their behalf followed by the Police and network providers.#R##N#Conclusion#R##N#Incidents are taking place on channels owned and controlled by large, cross-border international companies providing mobile services, webmail and social networking. The lack of support offered to victims in many cases of cyberstalking can be identified as Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSI). We anticipate that awareness should be raised as regarding service providers’ liability and social responsibility towards adopting better strategies.	cyberstalking	Haider M.

We employ privacy calculus as our theoretical lens and conduct a ranking-type Delphi study among genomic data donors, genomics professionals, and health privacy experts to elicit 19 motivating and 17 discouraging factors that influence individuals’ willingness to donate their genomic data to human genomic research. Our results suggest that altruistic reasons form major motivators, whereas privacy concerns, trust issues, and a fear of adverse medical implications are major discouraging factors. We also see noteworthy differences in donors’ and nondonors’ rankings of motivating and discouraging factors. The study adds to ongoing research on health information disclosure and shows that genomic data, despite their unique characteristics, are not that different from other patient’s health information. The study also contributes to privacy calculus literature by highlighting the need to incorporate altruistic motivators into the privacy calculus.	information systems;information privacy;miles gordon technology;personally identifiable information;privacy;ws-trust	Scott Thiebes;Kalle Lyytinen;Ali Sunyaev	2017			knowledge management;public relations;business	Security	-86.84685081070846	-6.062841099254669	103680
e877135e0768900ae08ca2417950ce8a03ad4727	an evaluation of electronic meeting systems to support strategic management		Strategic management, defined as the overall process of formulating and implementing goals, policies and plans of organizational strategy, is an important organizational task that is typically performed by groups of managers. While information technology has long been used to support strategic management, it has only recently been used to support the group processes of strategic management through the provision of Electronic Meeting Systems (EMS). An EMS can affect meetings by providing process support, process structure, task structure, and task support. Process support improves communication among group members (via an electronic communication channel), while process structure directs the pattern or content of discussion (via an agenda). Task structure refers to the use of a structured technique to analyze the task (a mathematical or conceptual model), while task support refers to the provision of information or computation support without additional structure (a data base or calculator). The objective of this paper is to evaluate the capability of EMS to support strategic management. The results of a series of seventeen case studies indicate that use of EMS technology can enhance six capabilities that prior research has linked to increased strategic management success. Process support and process structure were perceived to be more important than task structure and task support in contributing to success. An analysis of less successful meetings suggests that a lack of communication between the group leader/meeting organizer and meeting participants and extenuating external circumstances were primary causes for the lack of success.	channel (communications);computation;database;electronic organizer;meeting maker;strategic management	Alan R.

Reports of shadow systems in post ERP implementations suggest that this is not always the case. Using an exploratory single case study method with grounded theory coding techniques this study investigates why shadow systems exist after an ERP implementation. This paper provides a theoretical framework which reveals that the causal factors found in the categories of technology, organization, business procedures and people all contribute to the phenomenon of shadow systems in an ERP context.	causal filter;data compression;erp	Sandy Behrens;Wasana Sedera	2004			simulation;computer science;systems engineering;distributed computing	HCI	-81.55921483599133	1.8939178261687488	103745
a58b20347468d96d0fc4d24110cdac42c14db8bd	analysis and implementation of m-commerce in education for developing countries (uzbekistan case)	developing country	M-commerce is one of the ways IT can significantly contribute to boosting economy of the developing countries. M-commerce project has a high potential in the developing countries and especially in the case of Uzbekistan because it is very novice concept and most importantly it will enable payment for online services via mobile, using reverse billing. In addition, number of Internet and mobile users increase steadily each year in the republic. Due to the fact that main computer and internet literate audience in Uzbekistan is young people, a web portal providing youth appealing content, and at the same time taking advantage of mobile technologies would become a highly viable business idea. Therefore this study is aimed to evaluate mcommerce readiness in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The evaluation has been undertaken from 2 perspectives: business and IT. Business aspect involved industry analysis, revenue model and demand analysis.

Nevertheless, the presence of information technology neither guarantees knowledge creation, knowledge distribution nor knowledge use. In addition to information technology, a job environment and a culture that encourage sharing and continuous learning should also be created and maintained by management. This paper provides empirical evidence of the relationship between information technology and learning in small businesses as well as their impact on organisational performance. Furthermore, the level of sector knowledge-intensity is taken into consideration. Results show that individual learning along with individual and collaborative information technologies have a positive and significant impact on organisational learning. On the other hand, unlike individual and collaborative information technologies, individual and organisational learning have shown significant and positive effects on organisational performance. Therefore, information technology has a significant impact on outcomes only when in a proper context of learning is in place. Small businesses in sectors with high knowledgeintensity levels are more likely to use more frequently information technology tools and organisational learning practices. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, research in membership relationship is modest, particularly for professional associations (PAs). The propose of this study is to investigate how dyadic interactions (communication and member networks) impact members’ commitment to PAs, and how this process in turn leads to behavioral outcomes of members (retention, advocacy, and knowledge acquisition). Data were collected through an online survey questionnaire. Participants were recruited from three Australian health care PAs, resulting in 158 usable surveys. Partial Least Square technique was employed to test the structural model and hypotheses. Results indicate that communication and strength of members’ internal networks are positively related to members’ commitment to PAs. Commitment, in turn, leads to member retention, advocacy for the PA, and member knowledge acquisition. The results suggest that the most valuable members are those being able to open communication and develop strong internal networks as they will benefit from their memberships while simultaneously promote the PA.	dyadic transformation;interaction;knowledge acquisition	Mei Hua Huang	2009	IJEBM		psychology;public relations;communication;social psychology	HCI	-85.19413578293681	-1.1062920425401603	104483

Generally, knowledge can be divided in explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge. Organizations focus on managing the explicit knowledge, but also on capturing the tacit knowledge embedded in the individuals' experiences. Through the interactions in social networks, community-based knowledge development has become a very effective tool. In this context, more and more organizations are developing communities of practice as a strategic tool for knowledge development and sharing within the organization and across organizational boundaries. In the last years numerous contributions and approaches pointed out the importance of communities of practice in the knowledge economy. The most relevant argument is that communities of practice are the core of collective learning and collective intelligence, relaying on a permanent exchange of knowledge and information related to the practice. Communities of practice enhance particular knowledge that exist in the organizations and contribute to its coherence. Communities of practice can provide a social reservoir for practitioners, knowledge producers and policy makers to analyze, address and explore new solutions to their problems. These communities are emerging in knowledge-based organizations. They can enhance the efficiency of production and can improve the innovative processes. The paper addresses the new trends and challenges of knowledge dynamics within communities of practice and examines the emergence of this type of communities. We show how computational techniques enhance collective intelligence within communities of practice and suggest a way to model communities' dynamics. The main objective of the paper is to simulate computational collective intelligence using agent-based models.	collective intelligence;computation;reputation system	Iulia Maries;Emil Scarlat	2011	Trans.

The IT alignment literature is dominated by a focus on strategy formulation within relatively simple organisation forms. In contrast, little is known about how stakeholder alignment is enacted to improve the use of mandated IT systems. To address this gap we: (1) identify the factors that influence the effective use of such systems; (2) investigate how strategic alignment among stakeholders within project related networks impacts on effective use; and (3) propose and test a stakeholder alignment model to explain effective use of a mandated sustainability system within the Australian building industry.	information system;strategic management;the australian	Byron W.

Service innovation is gaining more attention due to its potential value for creating competitive advantage and improving organizational performance. This research conceptualizes SIR to consist of two adopting contexts (i.e., u0027u0027strategic orientation toward service innovationu0027u0027 and u0027u0027enabling mechanism of service innovationu0027u0027) that, together, determine a firmu0027s preparation to adopt organizational changes involved in service innovation. Six dimensions are also identified from a literature review and verified by industry expert interviews to define the two multidimensional adopting contexts. Data collected from 312 Taiwanese firms provide evidence to support the proposed factor structure of SIR and show that SIR positively correlates with SI performance. The findings contribute to the literature by theorizing SIR with a parsimonious structure that captures the complex conditions necessary for adopting service innovation. This study also yields some insight into the management of service innovation by providing managers an assessment that can be used to gauge a firmu0027s status and direct its efforts in continuous improvement.	composite video;computer performance;exptime;emergence;itil;real-time transcription;sosi;service innovation;strategic management;time-sharing;traffic flow (computer networking)	HsiuJu Rebecca Yen;Wenkai Wang;Chih-Ping Wei;Sheila Hsuan-Yu Hsu;Hung-Chang Chiu	2012	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2012.05.015	innovation management;knowledge management;marketing;management science;management;service innovation	Embedded	-82.25674157009297	2.392231398245861	104655

The purpose of this paper is to focus on China and proposes a collaborative operational capabilities framework to illustrate the role of 4PL in industrial cluster competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows an extensive literature review and structured interviews in two types of clusters, drawing on resource-based view and importance-performance matrix analysis. Findings – The paper proposes six elements (that is, synergy of logistics, expansion of industrial chain, financial ability, creativity and innovation ability, cooperation of companies and flexibility of supply chain) that comprise collaborative operational capabilities, and highlights the role of “creativity and innovation ability” and “supply chain flexibility” in the use of 4PL for industrial cluster competitiveness in Chinese context. Research limitations/implications – The paper focusses on China and hence it could also be tested in the developed countries’ context with the support of large-scale empirical data to investigate further its usefulness and to identify other constraints. Originality/value – The study contributes to the 4PL literature in that it proposes a framework that extrapolates the importance of 4PL in industrial cluster competitiveness in China.	industrial engineering;logistics;matrix analysis;synergy;volatility	Nachiappan Subramanian;Angappa Gunasekaran;Thanos Papadopoulos;Pie Nie	2016	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/IMDS-06-2015-0248	economics;marketing;operations management;management;commerce;collaboration	SE	-80.52182205170594	4.072685589476096	104668

Recent wide-ranging European Union legal reforms, finalized in 2016, have enshrined the concept of data protection by design and paved the way for certification schemes to validate compliance. There is a need for those involved with the practical development of information systems for crisis management to understand these new developments and determine their practical implications. This paper presents a critical analysis of the reforms, focusing on the interplay between the law and technological design and predicting their impact on crisis management system development.	bureaucracy;embedded system;iscram;information systems;information privacy;information system;privacy by design;social media;sociotechnical system;winsock	Catherine Easton	2016				HCI	-79.26771284335865	-3.9751772181896707	104738
c730eaaa30b422574109346df8b6a5d64d53fe43	on the improvement of quality and reliability of trust cues in micro-task crowdsourcing (position paper)		Micro-task crowdsourcing has become a successful mean to obtain high-quality data from a large crowd of diverse people. In this context, trust between all the involved actors (i.e. requesters, workers, and platform owners) is a critical factor for acceptance and long-term success. As actors have no expectation for “real life” meetings, thus trust can only be attributed through computer-mediated trust cues like workers qualifications and requester ratings. Such cues are often the result of technical or social assessments that are performed in isolation, considering only a subset of relevant properties, and with asynchronous and asymmetrical interactions. In this paper, we advocate for a new generation of micro-task crowdsourcing systems that pursue an holistic understanding of trust, by offering an open, transparent, privacy-friendly, and socially-aware view on the all the actors of a micro-task crowdsourcing environment.	crowdsourcing;holism;interaction;real life	Jie Yang;Alessandro Bozzon	2017	CoRR		computer science;position paper;data mining;asynchronous communication;crowdsourcing	HCI	-84.87488864581923	-4.543899622398623	104739

Moreover, researchers have introduced many trust models in order to explain the factors that persuade consumers to trust electronic commerce (EC). However, the majority of these models are case-specific and loosely integrated. Thus, this paper attempts to review many of these models and makes an effort to integrate their findings with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to present an integrated trust model for business-to-consumer (B2C) EC.	e-commerce payment system;ibm tivoli access manager;trust metric	Radwan M.

Thus, the existence of standardized and widely accepted mobile payment procedures is crucial for successful business-to-customer mobile commerce. The acceptance of mobile payment procedures depends on costs, security and convenience issues. For the latter, it is important that a procedure can be used over the different payment scenarios mobile commerce, electronic commerce, stationary merchant and customer-to-customer. Current payment procedures can be categorized with strategic, participation and operational criteria, using the morphological method. The proposed scheme allows to unambiguously identify and characterize any given mobile payment procedure. The design of today's mobile payment procedures should less try to optimize on the future mobile commerce problems but focus on the ease of spreading in the electronic commerce setting as lead-in scenario.	aggregate data;anytime algorithm;categorization;customer to customer;e-commerce;floor and ceiling functions;mobile commerce;mobile device;mobile payment;norm (social);personal computer;stationary process	Nina Kreyer;Key Pousttchi;Klaus Turowski	2002			payment service provider;marketing;business;commerce;mobile payment	Mobile	-91.80869519407706	-6.541604052472958	104894

In this study, some plausible reasons for their failure are proposed from the socio-technical systems perspective. This study has two research objectives. First, it introduces and tests a theoretical model which views ERP systems as both an organizational change driver and a sophisticated information system in order to better explain the phenomenon of ERP systems adoption. For this purpose, the proposed model includes attitude toward change and computer self-efficacy, which may affect ERP systems adoption behavior through perceived usefulness for the systems. Second, this paper attempts to shed some light on how the localization differences of ERP systems may affect users’ intention to adopt the ERP systems. The results based on survey data using subjects from two different ERP systems support the proposed research model and identify the moderating effect of the localization differences. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed along with its limitations.	erp;enterprise resource planning;information system;organizational behavior;sociotechnical system;theory	Kee-Young Kwahk	2008			systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science	HCI	-81.77714080443832	1.895431618727426	105052

By taking a life-cycle approach and focusing on managerial challenges, the aim  of this paper is to analyze the growth process of small software firms. After forming a synthesis of possible growth challenges  from relevant literature, the results are reflected upon case software firms using thematic interviews and questionnaires.  According to the analysis of four software firms, managing human resources represents the greatest challenge for software  services firms. Additionally, other challenges stem from competition and sales-related activities. Comparative analysis of  the literature and the cases leads toward a theoretical conceptualization of growth challenges from small software firm’s  perspective.

77427f855c42ea23707d39ffda11739c49fbf0a5	corporate social responsibility, employer reputation, and social media capability: an empirical investigation		This study theorizes that firms engaging in socially responsible activities are more likely to be perceived as a more attractive employer, and this positive relationship may be amplified if firms have proficiency in leveraging social media platforms. This potential amplifier role may be explained through the greater social visibility enabled by social media. The proposed theory is tested using the structural equation modeling technique and the partial least squares method of estimation employing a secondary dataset on a sample composed of 100 large Spanish firms included in the Actualidad Economica’s Great Place to Work 2015. The empirical analysis supports our theory. This paper con-tributes to Information Systems research by theorizing and empirically demonstrating that social me-dia capability creates business value by maximizing the positive impact of firm’s implementation of corporate social responsibility activities on the building of firm’s employer reputation.	amplifier;dia;information systems research;information system;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;partial least squares regression;social media;structural equation modeling	Jose Benitez-Amado;Laura Ruiz;Francisco Javier Lloréns Montes;Ana Castillo	2017			social responsibility;corporate social responsibility;marketing;structural equation modeling;information system;social media;computer science;reputation;business value	AI	-85.36202514809642	0.046889908531631254	105159

The data were elicited by means of narrative stories, observations of project meetings, diaries, project memoranda and emails sent by project members to each other during these years. Glaserian grounded theory method was used as the technique for theory building. Three core categories were identified: governance, power and emotions. The study offers two key contributions: first, it builds a substantive theory of Emotions of Control in an IOIS project, presented in the form of propositions. The theory offers an approach to understanding the meaning of emotions in project work and the consequences of emotions in collaboration. Second, we offer a window into the theory building process using Glaserian grounded theory. We argue that the findings of this study have some implications of value to researchers studying emotional issues in IOIS projects or information system (IS) projects in general, because the role of emotions in project work can be pivotal in determining project success.

ef4fcbbe1a0c13c50194933e97c88aa8d64db584	the effect of perceived risks on users' intention toadopt location based service		With the development of 3G and a growing scale of mobile terminal holders, location based service (LBS) has the very broad market prospect. But now whether from the perspective of the cognitive degree or market scale, the application status of location based service are not satisfactory. At present, researches mostly stagnate in technical level, and less on consumers’ behavior. In this paper, we establish the research model of consumers’ intention to use location based service from the angle of perceived risks and apply the empirical test. The results of the study show that perceived service business risks, perceived service product risks and perceived financial risks have significant negative influence on users’ intention to adopt LBS. In addition, whether the users have experience of using the LBS will influence usage intention to some extent. Overall, the results of this study can help mobile agents understand the sources of business risks, so that they can regulate their own behavior, formulate rational policy and eliminate the risks in order to promote the long-term development of LBS.	mobile agent;mobile phone	Hong Peng;Rong Lei;Chun Zuo;Canhua Hu	2013				HCI	-87.88720172917225	-9.503250521270413	105512

The main goal of this paper is to analyse the information security awareness among academic staff, researchers, undergraduate students and employee within educational environments in the Middle East in an attempt to understand the level of awareness of information security, the associated risks and overall impact on the institutions. The results reveal that the participants do not have the requisite knowledge and understanding of the importance of information security principles and their practical application in their day-to-day work. This situation can however be corrected through comprehensive awareness and training programs as well as adopting all the necessary safety measures at all levels of the institution to ensure that the students, academic staff and employees are trustworthy, technology savvy and keep their data safe. Without such training programs and awareness, there will be negative consequences on IT systems and their application usage, as well as on users’ personal security now and in the future. From the weaknesses identified in this survey, some essential recommendations are put forward to remedy the situation.	security awareness	Samaher AlJanabi;Ibrahim AlShourbaji	2016	JIKM	10.1142/S0219649216500076	information security audit;standard of good practice;certified information security manager;public relations;cloud computing security;critical security studies;security studies;security management;security through obscurity;security information and event management;asset;computer science;knowledge management;information security;digital forensics;information security standards;management;computer security;information security management	Crypto	-84.84512527008218	-7.7690163393382985	105594

Translating this substrate into appropriate citizen services requires something more: an express recognition of citizen <i>values</i> and a projection of <i>value</i> that these services can generate for the citizens. We devise a method to design such citizen services by extending prior work in a number of streams including scenario-based design, service blueprinting, and the universality of basic human values. Our work follows a design science orientation treating these prior research streams as kernel theories. We describe our contribution as a method for Design of Smart Citizen Service 设计智慧市民服务 (Shèjì Zhìhuì Shìmín Fúwù), appropriate for the context where we do our work. The paper outlines the method, illustrates it with scenarios for long-term care; and concludes with pointers to future work and implications for research and practice.	smart city;universality probability;value (ethics)	Na Liu;Alex Gavino;Sandeep Purao	2014		10.1145/2612733.2612753	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;management science	HCI	-80.61939206419633	-4.170993334148273	105826

ICT tools are also essential for harnessing and capturing local farmer knowledge. Innovative use of ICT tools recognizes the importance of two-way communication, and ICT can be used more efficiently to achieve the goals of agricultural extension. Beyond connectivity ICT offers security and mobility to owners, and requires that users have basic literacy. In addition to voice communication ICT tools allow for transfer of data, which can be used in context for applications and in agriculture. New ways of managing knowledge have emerged across developing countries beyond the traditional farmer-extension systems.		Janet Achora	2016	IEEE Technol. Soc.

Indigenous societies have faced countless years of oppression at the hands of Western colonization and assimilation. Western literature on indigenous knowledge is expansive, yet a deliberate focal point on ethno-engineering in indigenous literature is missing. In this paper, we have collected literature on indigenous knowledge and synthesized articles specifically on ethno-engineering, setting the papers in contrast to Western-engineering praxis. Our literature review methods proceeded in two phases. During the first phase we accumulated relevant sources (N=87), compiled these in a database, and coded these with a 10-item coding framework. In the second phase, we sampled literature from the initial database (N=31) and coded these items more extensively using an inductively developed coding scheme. Our intent was to contribute to a starting conversation on indigenous engineering bringing it to forefront of social justice/engineering discourse.		Justin L.

A survey of Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) members was undertaken in order to understand more about the prevalence of IS project escalation and the factors that cause it. The results are startling: Escalation occurs in 30-40% of IS projects and projects that escalate are rarely completed and implemented successfully. What is more, escalation appears to be caused by a combination of project management as well as psychological, social, and organizational factors.	failure;isaca;information systems;information technology audit;privilege escalation	Mark Keil;Joan Ellen Cheney Mann	1997		10.1109/HICSS.1997.661582	project management;public relations;extreme project management;program management;software project management;opm3;knowledge management;project sponsorship;marketing;project risk management;project management triangle;management;project charter;schedule;information system;project planning;project portfolio management	SE	-84.55859076195675	1.0200052318121489	106329

Recent studies indicate that the use of e-government is growing throughout the world (Mossberger, Tolbert, and Stansbury, 2003 and Larsen & Rainie, 2002). Formally defined as “the delivery of government information and services online via the Internet or other digital means” (West 2000, paragraph 7), e-government offers many benefits to its major stakeholders. Implemented properly, it can be a cost effective method to deliver public services which can result in significant gains for the national economy. Through the Internet a government can provide information and allow citizens, businesses, and other governments to make a wide variety of transactions and to participate in various forums. E-government initiatives foster competitiveness by ensuring the integration of countries into the global community. A country that engages in e-government signals to the international community that it is open, transparent, and efficient, and creates an environment conducive to its users ABSTRACT	audio feedback;e-government;effective method;internet	Jayoti Das;Cassandra DiRienzo;John Burbridge	2009	IJEGR	10.4018/jegr.2009010101	public relations;e-government;computer science;socioeconomics;cluster analysis;trustworthy computing;world wide web;commerce	SE	-79.15586836246995	-8.094638280880154	106361

Considering the practical needs, we proposed STQP-SERVQUAL (customer satisfaction model of hospital foodservice) on the basement of SERVQUAL. Data from 281 questionnaires was analyzed. Using structural equation modeling, the results suggest that service, timeliness, and product quality have a positive significant impact on patients’ satisfaction with hospital foodservice. Moreover, the impact caused by price reasonableness is not significant. But price reasonableness is the lowest satisfied factor; it also calls for managers’ attention. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. Although the case study is in a large hospital, the application of the results can be extended to other health industries.

The purpose of this study is to offer a multi-disciplinary framework to examine the continuing digital participation divide and within-group use variance among millennials. We focus on millennials due to the size of their population segment. We further critically examine assumptions of homogeneous adoption of emerging Information and communication technologies (ICTs) among “digital natives.” We describe the concepts of digital fluency and capital enhancing activity to explore how and why millennials invest their time in using ICTs. Digital fluency reflects the knowledge, skills, and cognitive capabilities needed to maximize the use of ICTs, whereas capital enhancing activities increase human capital in such a way to offer individuals more opportunities for upward mobility. Employing theories from second language learning, economics, and communication studies we describe the antecedent and composite elements of digital fluency, and its role in motivating capital enhancing use of technology. Future research implications are also described.	digital native;natural language processing;theory	Oran Alston;Martin Dias;Brandis Phillips	2015			public relations;political science;multimedia;social psychology	HCI	-83.2804885077649	-2.2843143090510303	106511

Prior work, however, suggests that local governments place more emphasis on internal than on external M-Government projects. This paper takes an action design research perspective to provide insight into the often overlooked potential of citizen-centric, external M-Government services. We consider the scenario of a sensing application for reporting urban infrastructure issues to the municipality and present a System Dynamics model to estimate the diffusion, use, and municipal impacts of such service. The model is validated based on the case of a large German city, a dedicated survey, and further data sources. The simulation results indicate that, compared to internal information acquisition procedures, the use of urban sensing can improve a municipality’s availability of environmental information at a comparable level of cost. Furthermore, we discuss a number of aspects and learnings related to an urban sensing implementation and provide an empirical estimation of the diffusion model. Our results provide an impetus for researchers and government practitioners to reconsider the benefits of urban sensing applications in E-Government endeavors.	e-government;participatory sensing;simulation;system dynamics;ubiquitous computing	Till J.

a0802f1bf1b92ceeab80730f9db139ea735986c6	extending traditional eis use to support mobile executives online and offline		In addition to using executive information systems (EIS) in a fixed location, executives increasingly want mobile access, even when they are offline. Based on a framework for EIS use situations and on findings from an expert focus group with participants from multiple industries, we have identified the most important EIS use situations for executives. We classify executives as either Consumer (those who primarily consume EIS information) or Analyst (those who primarily work more interactively with EIS information). To evaluate the relevance of our findings, we participated in a project at Continental AG, a large European automotive supplier. We worked with Continental as it rose to the challenge of selecting the right mobile devices and appropriate software components for its executives' online and offline mobile EIS use preferences. Based on our research, we provide five recommendations for EIS design that will help CIOs in other companies to embrace their executives' growing need to access EIS from mobile devices. Some of these recommendations are generally applicable and will ensure executive buy-in. For Consumer executive use, we recommend first focusing on reducing reliance on paper-based reports, and for Analyst executive use, we recommend first focusing on increasing mobile EIS navigation functionality.	online and offline	Jörg H.

This paper has two specific goals in its effort to fill this gap in the literature. The first, so that these outcomes can be systematically investigated, is to develop a taxonomy of information privacy-protective responses (IPPR). This taxonomy consists of six types of behavioral responses—refusal, misrepresentation, removal, negative word-of-mouth, complaining directly to online companies, and complaining indirectly to third-party organizations— that are classified into three categories: information provision , private action, and public action. Our second goal is to develop a nomological model with several salient antece-dents—concerns for information privacy, perceived justice, and societal benefits from complaining—of IPPR, and to show how the antecedents differentially affect the six types of IPPR. The nomological model is tested with data collected from 523 Internet users. The results indicate that some discernible patterns emerge in the relationships between the antecedents and the three groups of IPPR. These patterns enable researchers to better understand why a certain type of IPPR is similar to or distinct from other types of IPPR. Such an understanding could enable researchers to analyze a variety of behavioral responses to information privacy threats in a fairly systematic manner. Overall, this paper contributes to researchers' theory-building efforts in the area of information privacy by breaking new ground for the study of individuals' responses to information privacy threats.	information privacy;internet	Jai-Yeol Son;Sung S.

Effort withholding is defined as the likelihood that an individual will give less than full effort on a job-related task. While an extensive body of work demonstrates that effort withholding is prevalent in all types of teamwork, little attention has been paid to an IT project context. In this study, we surveyed 473 IT project managers to address two questions: 1) what are key IT project and organizational factors that influence effort withholding, and 2) which project management approaches can suppress it? Our results indicate that the size of the team, the perceived importance of the project, the degree of uncertainty in the project requirements, and the degree of self-interest (organizational ethical climate) all contribute to effort withholding, while internal integration (project coordination) techniques suppress it.	requirement	Elizabeth Baker;Charalambos L.

The choice of local access providers is critical to a company since they furnish the physical connection between the company's location and the public telephone network. Using experimental research, this paper investigates whether price is an important factor to the telecommunications managers in deciding whether to stay with the current provider or switch to an alternate provider.#R##N##R##N#Fifty-two telecommunications managers participated in an experiment that provided them with a local access decision situation. The managers were given the opportunity to consider information associated with different decision factors and asked to determine the percent of service they would acquire from each of two competing local access providers. A software recorded actions taken by the managers during the experiment. The managers also ranked the decision factors in a post-experiment questionnaire. The experimental results show the most important decision factors for the managers to be price, technical quality, responsiveness, and maintenance ability. Price emerged as the most important factor in the experiment, although, it was ranked only fourth in the post-experiment questionnaire.		Jerry D. McCreary;Chetan S.

It continues to move studies from methods to evaluators and their customers. Thoughtful studies show when and why methods have specific impacts, supporting a focus on ways to better target method use. It is also the case that a focus on how evaluation customers use usability results reveals the fit between methods and customers. However, evaluation and its influence on redesign is not solely a matter of evaluators and designers or developers. Evaluation and redesign are activities within broader system development contexts. Improvements need commitment and support from management. Organizational fervor for user-centered design is key to effective evaluation. Without management support, usability evaluation cannot be well planned, properly conducted, or effectively exploited, leaving usability specialists to just play with the interplay between design and evaluation. This article reviews contributions in this special issue, noting where they address specific factors in the interplay between design and evaluation and identifying factors that require more attention in future research.	commitment scheme;usability;user-centered design	Gilbert Cockton	2006	Int.

The second category refers to the technical infrastructure that enables users to access artifacts, and that allows the community to communicate and coordinate their collective actions to create those artifacts. We collected qualitative and quantitative data from Wikipedia in order to show how a community's consensus gradually converts social mechanisms into algorithmic mechanisms. In detail, we analyze algorithmic governance mechanisms in two embedded cases: the software extension """"flagged revisions"""" and the bot """"xqbot"""". Our insights point towards a growing relevance of algorithmic governance in the realm of governing large-scale peer production communities.

So questions such as 'Which countries should be involved in the project?' and 'How large should the team size be?' need to be answered before hand. Project configurations are known to affect communication, coordination and collaboration aspects of a project, and as a consequence, its performance. Therefore, a challenge managers face is knowing which configurations promote better project outcomes when working with virtual software teams. This article reveals a set of configurations that have promoted the quality of software products developed by virtual teams to support the business of a Fortune 500 large IT multinational company. These configurations can be used as a guideline by managers to set up their own virtual teams. Recommendations on how to set up virtual teams based on the study are then suggested.	recommender system	Rafael Prikladnicki;Marcelo Gattermann Perin;Sabrina Marczak	2016		10.1145/2961111.2962638	simulation;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;project management 2.0	SE	-84.76868730963791	3.1164839543465432	107505

ABSTRACT 2. INTRODUCTION This study reports the findings of a pilot survey of MIS managers on the quality of training in the teIecommunications area. Overall, there was little satisfaction with the caliber of training. Some satisfaction was noted in the telecommunications training in existing applications (e-mail and voice mail). Surprisingly, there was also borderline satisfaction in the training in the technical areas of telecommtications (data security and equipment capability). However, training in the emerging telecommunications applications (voice/video teleconferencing), and in the managerial issues associated with telecommunications (strategic pl&g of telecommunication) received poor evaluations. Programs, seminars and workshops organized by professional agencies were the preferred method of training. Training classes provided by educational institutions were rated below average in quality. Discussion into the low evaluation of training in general and especially by the educational institutions and possible solutions are provided. There is a history of organizations utilizing information systems to gain a competitive advantage. Interorganizational systems, such as the direct link between customers and suppliers for automated order entry, are examples of strategic systems [13]. This example is not only a strategic use of information systems but also of telecommunications systems. The strategic systems of the twenty-first century will center on the use of telecommunications. For example, the package tracking system of Federal Express utilizes telecommunications to provide accurate and timely information about the location of their shipments. Swatch Company integrated pagers into a new line of watches and captured 28 percent of the Germanic numeric pager market. MovieFone has an 18 percent market share of the U.S. cinema audience through its interactive voice response system [lo]. Wells Fargo bank is opening “branches” in supermarkets. As a result, Wells Fargo has grown from 650 branches to over 1,000 branches in less than a year.

f8ee04cb76af842d14fb37ad9b540dafe81c0b92	group level versus society level of computing		In this paper, a meso-level of computing is added to the four-level model by Whitworth (1). This meso-level is called group-level computing. It exists between the individual level and society level. The main difference between group-level and society-level of computing is the social tie involved between the members. One function of the social tie is to give a regulation for the interaction between the members. One implication to design and development of systems is that group-level computing will need to consider a group-cognition model, instead of individual cognition model. For the society level, the design should focus on creating a regulation of its member behavior and interaction, since there is no social tie to regulate their interaction.

4f61452de55dcf2f3ac42080f7946cbbf968aece	linking student information security awareness and behavioural intent		This study analysed existing theories from the social sciences in order to gain a better understanding of factors which contribute to student mobile phone users’ poor information security behaviour. Two key aspects associated with information security behaviour were considered, namely: awareness and behavioural intent. Researchers have identified the most common cause of poor security practices on the part of mobile phone users, and which cause them to fall victim to social engineering techniques such as phishing, is their lack of awareness of existing security threats, vulnerabilities and risks. However, an increasing number of researchers consider human behaviour to be another cause of security breaches. Zhang et al. (2009) concur with this view and state that understanding human behaviour is important when dealing with the problems caused by human errors. Harnesk et al. (2011) expressed a concern that existing research does not address the interlinked relationship between anticipated security behaviour and the enactment of security procedures. Existing researchers in the field of information security still grapple with the ‘knowing-and-doing’ gap, where user information security knowledge/awareness sometimes does not result in safer behavioural practises. This paper proposes that the knowing-and-doing gap can possibly be reduced by addressing both awareness and behavioural intent. This paper explores the relationship between student mobile phone user information security awareness and behavioural intent in a developmental university in South Africa.	grapple;human error;information security awareness;mobile phone;phishing;social engineering (security)	Bukelwa Ngoqo;Stephen Flowerday	2014			critical security studies;security through obscurity;security engineering;knowledge management;political science;information security standards;social psychology;computer security;information security management	Security	-85.00764388399882	-8.072428336757095	107829

These concerns are frequently conceptualised as an extension to current theoretical approaches and practices in supply chain management (SCM). This paper raises the question of how SCM is actually addressing these issues. In particular, it is argued that SCM can be seen as amongst the causes of the problem rather than a viable solution. To clarify this challenge, three generic strategies are developed as a response: (1) enhancing the use of current SCM approaches, (2) aligning SCM with social and environmental concerns and (3) rejecting SCM in its current fashion to address environmental and social concerns and suggesting a replacement strategy.

Specifically, we examine whether working adults in Singapore experience cyber incivility when interacting with their supervisors via emails at the workplace. We also examine the impact of receiving uncivil emails from supervisors on employees’ work and organizational attitudes. The effect of supervisor’s gender on types of cyber uncivil behaviors were also investigated. Results suggested that male supervisors engaged in different kinds of cyber uncivil behaviors compared to female supervisors. Results of our study provided useful insights for researchers and managers in understanding the frequency and importance of email usage between employees and supervisors, as well as the role of information technology in facilitating cyber rudeness at the workplace.

A variety of expertise locator tools have emerged to help locate the right person. But there is little systematic study on what people are really looking for when such systems are used and how external factors such as job role may shape that search. We conducted a study of 75 employees who were current users of an expertise locator system. An analysis of the reasons for their search revealed that people in client facing roles are primarily seeking to have a dialog with an expert, while others are just as likely to seek answers to technical questions. We also surveyed various tools for finding experts and found that corporate directories and personal networks were most often cited as alternatives to an expertise locator. We discuss the implications of these results for the design of tools for finding experts and expert knowledge.	online locator service;dialog	Kate Ehrlich;N.

Within a European project, we observed and routinely analyzed ongoing development and assessment work of model based technologies and methodologies, in these companies. Based on an ethnographic study of Modelling sessions and Validation sessions, we performed an in depth analysis of people semantic and pragmatic perspectives (a necessary and needed ‘second step back’), and identified core disconnects on modelling concept use and language, and on motivations and goals, between technology designers – modellers and domain experts – users clearly hindering project progress -. These disconnects were addressed with user groups in the form of SPD sessions (‘second order’ activities), which consisted mostly in a series of design game and scenario-building workshops, enriched by open conversations and perspective sharing and comparison. The paper describes how these SPD sessions facilitated the creation of sense making and trust, enabling participants to engage and learn, and to act as change agents in the project, opening the way to co-construction of solutions with other actors. Observations of Modelling and Validation sessions showed that participants could not automatically build on a deep understanding of modelling and its trade-offs; they adopted the representational conventions they had learned to use. Lack of sense making and lack of co-construction were observed, along with lack of facilitation for genuinely participative conditions. Modeller-guided Modelling sessions showed no appropriation of object decomposition and relationship structures by domain experts, nor contribution from users to leadership in the modelling process; only imposition of hierarchical structures by modellers, in the midst of a cloud of mistrust and suspicion. Validation sessions of the model-based approach showed that ‘common’ users do not perceive the value of the approach, as they have not been helped to gain a conceptual understanding of modelling, of the tradeoffs of abstractions, and of how a model may productively interact with work practices. In this distributed project, different concepts of various user groups all conflicted with modellers’ concept. The SPD facilitation interventions helped participants in stepping back from the “official view” of the work process created in the course of the project, and in focussing more on their own experiences, opening up for creativity. SPD events were grounded in the belief that, when it comes to one’s own things, people with no special knowledge of the issues to be discussed can contribute something valuable, especially on those matters that they perceive as problems for themselves; it was impressive to witness how people with no management perspective can engage in strategy development within a very short time. The methods were easy enough to adopt without much preparation and rich enough to stimulate learning and valuable insights; people felt comfortable and not at risk at being judged. Participants expressed how important the experience of working creatively on solving “real problems” had been for them. We can understand this also as a result of the longitudinal character of our SPD engagement with people in the project, which had provided us with good knowledge about work practices, potentials and problems on the one hand, allowed trust building on the other hand.	distrust;enterprise system;experience;field research;mapper;modeller;scenario analysis;second screen;stepping level	Gianni Jacucci;Claudia Cattani;Gian Marco Campagnolo;Ina Wagner;Hilda Tellioglu	2008			public relations;experience design;knowledge management;management science;business	HCI	-81.77541500634649	-5.122951403827288	108347

It exists within the individual employees, and also in a composite sense within the organisation. Therefore, it is important that organisations find a way to tap into this knowledge and effectively manage knowledge processes in order to preserve and expand its core competencies to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of human resource systems (HR planning System, HR Training System, HR Reward System, HR recruitment System) on the successful implementation of knowledge management processes (acquisition, application, sharing). Respondents consist of top/senior managers, human resource managers, and heads of departments in the Jordanian mobile telecommunication companies. A questionnaire survey was developed to collect data from respondents, a sample of 150 were selected according to a simple random sampling technique. Different statistical tools were used to test study hypotheses. The study findings shows that overall human resource systems have a significant impact on knowledge management processes. Based on the findings, the study suggest future research which can seek an enhanced understanding of the relationship of HRS with knowledge management processes in other sectors and other countries as well, since cultural differences exist among organisations, which influence employee perceptions regarding knowledge management processes. This study has implications for HR managers or decision-makers to create an organisational environment that encourages employee empowerment, integration and socialisation by eliminating all forms of barriers and red tapes, which can allow people to participate for new opportunities and foster a positive social interaction culture before introducing knowledge management initiatives.	knowledge management;monte carlo method;sampling (signal processing);socialization	Faleh Abdelgader Alhawary;Hanadi Al-Zegaier	2009	JIKM	10.1142/S0219649209002300	questionnaire;decision-making;simple random sample;economics;knowledge management;environmental resource management;human resource management;management science;personal knowledge management;core competency;empirical research;knowledge value chain;management;human resource management system;competitive advantage	HCI	-82.60470540626083	2.5819412412516964	108452

However, little attention has been given to how or why social alignment should be developed. Further examining the concept this paper explores the development of social alignment within an innovation context. Using canonical action research the study is based within an innovation network. Primarily focusing on four organisations, a lack of social alignment was diagnosed. In particular, it was found the business executives did not fully understand the potential of the new technologies available. An intervention was then planned to facilitate the organisations in utilising a business model framework for developing social alignment by creating a common understanding between the business-technology executives. The study which took 24 months to complete involved over 110 hours of primary data. The results highlight the positive impact of the business model framework in developing social alignment. However, it was found that the business model framework alone is not enough to develop social alignment within an innovation setting. Careful thought should be put into who facilitates the development of social alignment and a shared understanding, as CTO’s are often too caught up in day-to-day operations to fulfill the role.

The central claim of this paper is that influencing forces of usage increase in MDS are different from those of usage decrease. We propose that information quality as the motivator (forces of usage increase) and system quality as the demotivator (forces of usage decrease) of MDS. A research model is proposed and subsequent hypotheses are empirically tested with partial least square (PLS) based on 478 responses from the users of mobile data service. We have found that information quality (as a motivator) is positively associated with usage increase in mobile data service, but system quality (as a demotivator) is not. Also, system quality is negatively associated with usage decrease, but information quality is not. Despite the recognized limitations, our study highlights the potential value of the two-factor theory in explaining user behaviors associated with mobile data services.	information quality;multi-factor authentication	Sang-Hoon Lee;Bongsik Shin;Ho Geun Lee	2008	Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)	10.1109/HICSS.2008.220	simulation;computer science;marketing;operating system;database;information quality;mobile computing;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-88.89145404877624	-9.425527154771244	108653

This research examines that balance in the case of electronic commerce and its relationship to state budgets and revenue raised by sales tax. Under the voluntary Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement of 2002, states can cooperate with one another and with sellers to collect sales tax on internet sales, yet only about half the states that levy sales tax have initiated this policy change. This research tests rival explanations for state membership in this interstate administrative agreement and implementation of its provisions from 2003 through 2007. State participation is enhanced by existing technological capacity and frustrated by requirements for shared governance and shared administrative responsibilities. Participation is fostered by more extensive implementation of e-commerce and certain political factors. State fiscal factors and e-Government implementation are not significant. Moreover, state legislative professionalism inhibits state participation in this agreement. These findings have implications for understanding the influence of future technological change on government practices and for intergovernmental relationships weighted toward shared governance.	e-commerce	Kathleen Hale;Ramona S.

Specifically, the paper focuses on the Akshaya project, a franchise of rural computer-service kiosks, which was implemented in Kerala as a public-private sector collaboration. The Akshaya project has the twin goals of social development through increased access to computers for rural people and financial viability through market-driven entrepreneurship. Using interview and participant observation methods, we examine the challenges that state actors and entrepreneurs face in simultaneously addressing social and financial sustainability. The preliminary evidence suggests that there is a tension between these goals at a macro level (within the state) and a micro level (for entrepreneurs and potential consumers) that makes it difficult to run a financially self-sustaining ICT kiosk project that also meets social development goals. The paper demonstrates that the implementation of ICTs for development is not simply a technical process of delivering services to the poor, but is a highly political process that involves tradeoffs and prioritization of particular goals to attain sustainability. Branding this project is a challenge for the state and entrepreneurs due to consumer perceptions of what development is, with particular expectations of state provided services, versus what business is	computer;goto;interactive kiosk;matchware mediator;need to know;public key certificate;refinement (computing)	Renee Kuriyan;Kentaro Toyama;Isha Ray	2006	2006 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development	10.1109/ICTD.2006.301849	public relations;politics;information and communications technology;innovation management;marketing;law;information technology;economic growth	SE	-82.71486272423331	-6.749337944933586	108817

This paper investigates IT addiction and aims to identify the mechanisms behind its development. Based on a thorough review of the literature, we conceptualize IT addiction as a psychological dependency on IT that involves excessive use of technology. Furthermore, we identify the elements that are associated with the formation of addiction. Based on the analysis of 12 in-depth interviews and 182 qualitative surveys, we developed a process theory of IT addiction that explains how these behaviors progress through time. The model highlights the key elements that are associated with IT-related addictive behaviors and shows how they relate to the technology, the user and the environment. It also highlights the problematic consequences of such behaviors on the well-being of addicted users.	whole earth 'lectronic link	Isaac Vaghefi;Liette Lapointe	2014	2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2014.553	computer science	HCI	-86.54491022125201	-8.515009471542845	109155

The low cost of mobile equipment, its mobility factor and a personalised device may however, herald them as the predominant means of e-government in developing countries. Inclusive participation to mobilise and engage the poorer, excluded and lesser-informed citizens has been the bane of e-government yet, but it may change by including m-government as an emphasis factor in the national e-government plans. This paper considers the case study of the Election Commission of Pakistan, which initiated a SMS-based voter verification system with the central database authority in order to inform over 85 million voters of their electoral registration in March 2012. This unique service is among the first public mobile based initiatives in Pakistan which builds upon an inter-agency collaboration drawing on the success of a digitized and central database.	database;e-government;formal verification;list of minor characters in the matrix series;mike lesser	Hasnain Bokhari;Mustafa Khan	2012		10.1145/2463728.2463761	public relations;political science;public administration;computer security	AI	-79.55901265798893	-8.051978320136508	109325
c9378da2d6c6ff88762a04d56fc68de18ee6ae5f	deterministic models for opinion formation through communication: a survey		Abstract A fundamental question in modeling opinion dynamics is to know how can opinion be formed and evolved in a social network? This is an thorny subject which has attracted a hulk of attitudes and whetted the curiosity of researchers from various disciplines. One of the major points of view rests on the fact that opinion can be formed and revised through a process called social influence. This latter lies at the heart of the opinion modeling process and it has two types: Informational social influence, where a user forms his opinion according to information he obtained from a certain number of agents in his friendship and neighborhood. normative social influence is the second type of social influence and it lead to conformity. A very few empirical studies indicate that, it is also important to consider the normative influence in the opinion modeling process. In contrary, informational Influence is one of the main underlying premises used by many well-known theoretical models of opinion dynamics In the literature two main approaches have been adopted on how each individual updates her opinion: deterministic and probabilistic. Here, we focus only with deterministic models. We present various forms of modeling opinion dynamics in social networks and we show how opinions change following to social influence. Within the course of analysis, we point out both the strengths and weakness of many approaches. We aim to provide theoretical insight which may serve as guidelines for scientists, practitioners, researchers, consultants and developers who intend to design new methods in this area of interest.	deterministic finite automaton	Ons Abid;Salma Jamoussi;Yassine Ben Ayed	2018	Online Social Networks and Media	10.1016/j.osnem.2018.02.002	friendship;conformity;empirical research;probabilistic logic;social psychology;social influence;know-how;political science;normative social influence;social network	Theory	-80.70005640530383	-3.7569727637705332	109342

The """"updated paradigm"""" for instrument development was followed to develop and validate the ISFS instrument. Construct validation of the instrument was conducted using responses from 346 systems users in 149 organizations by a combination of exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling using LISREL. The process resulted in an instrument that measures 18 unidimensional factors within the three ISFS dimensions. Moreover, a sample of 120 matched-paired responses of separate CIO and user responses was used for nomological validation. The results showed that the ISFS measure reflected by the instrument was positively related to improvements in business processes effectiveness and organizational performance. Consequently, the instrument may be used for assessing IS performance, for guiding information technology investment and sourcing decisions, and as a basis for further research and instrument development."""	information system	Jerry Cha-Jan Chang;William R.

However, since cloud computing technology is still known for unsolved security and privacy challenges, severe concerns could prevent patients and medical workers from accepting such an application scenario. Owing to the lack of similar studies, we investigate what determines an individual’s information privacy concerns on cloud-based transmission of medical records and whether perceived benefits influence the behavioral intention of individuals to permit medical workers to transfer their medical records via cloud-based services. Based on different established theories, we develop and empirically test a corresponding research model by a survey with more than 260 full responses. Our results show the perceived benefits of this health cloud scenario override the impact of information privacy concerns even in the privacy-sensitive German-speaking area and immediately after the NSA scandal. Somewhat surprisingly, we also find that in this scenario knowledge about information privacy has no significant effect on information privacy concerns although some relations have been observed in previous empirical studies. Finally, patient information privacy concerns can be mitigated by establishing trust in cloud providers in healthcare as well as in privacy-preserving technological and regulatory mechanisms.	cloud computing;itil;information privacy;programming paradigm;theory	Tatiana Ermakova;Benjamin Fabian;Rüdiger Zarnekow	2014			knowledge management;management science;internet privacy	Security	-86.71593821111895	-5.883261187741959	109706

It looks at the application of knowledge as requiring a change, and overviews a body of analytical work on change proficiency in business systems and processes. It looks at knowledge management as a strategic portfolio management responsibility based on learning functionality, and shares knowledge and experience in organizational collaborative learning mechanisms. It introduces the concept of plug-compatible knowledge packaging as a means for increasing the velocity of knowledge diffusion and the likelihood of knowledge understood at the depth of insight. Finally, it reviews a knowledge portfolio management and collaborative knowledge development architecture used successfully in a sizable cross-industry informal-consortia activity, and suggests that it is a good model for a corporate university architecture.	agile software development;knowledge management;plug compatible;velocity (software development)	Rick Dove	1999	J.

We argue that computerization should be conceptualized as a continuing process, not the commonly held static view. We also argue that computerization in the workplace is not as dynamic as portrayed in popular technology magazines. Conceptualizing computerization as a continuing process has implications for how work is transformed in computerized work settings, and how we study work transformations. Longer periods of time between implementation and observations of changes in work, and repeated observations are needed to capture the dynamics, and to distinguish between stable and transient patterns, of technology and work. We present findings from two years of survey data on the role of desktop computing in the work of 39 extensively computerized work groups. Data were collected from a self-administered survey and through in-person interviews in 1988 and in 1989. We characterize computerization interventions as consisting of four elements: equipment, infrastructure, social organization of computing, and control patterns. We present descriptive data for each of these four elements. Technological elements of computerization interventions (e.g., type of equipment, extensiveness of deployment and use) have become more elaborate between 1988 and 1989. However, the social patterns of interventions (e.g., computing infrastructure) have not changed much, while the use and availability of technology have. Our preliminary analyses of changes in work suggest that work groups are working harder.	desktop computer;software deployment	Mary Zmuidzinas;Rob Kling;Joey F.

A growing number of such organizations have explored the virtual environment as one means of achieving increased responsiveness. In particular, the use of virtual teams appears to be on the increase. However, the increased use of virtual teams has not been accompanied by concomitant research efforts to understand better the socialpsychological contributors to effective virtual teams. In this paper, we use a model of group effectiveness to propose a possible research agenda examining sources of virtual team effectiveness. Although much of this model offers insights relevant to the virtual environment, differences between groups and teams and between colocated and virtual environments suggest that modifications and additions to this model may be necessary. We offer a set of research propositions to advance future research on effective virtual teams beyond anecdote and description. Implications of this research agenda for managers of virtual teams and human resource professionals are also discussed.	colocation centre;responsiveness;virtual reality	Stacie Furst;Richard Blackburn;Benson Rosen	1999	Inf.

You may not engage in further distribution of the material or use it for any profit-making activities or any commercial gain. Abstract This paper introduces information and communication technologies as an innovative approach to managing sustainable tourism development from a destination management perspective. Specific attention is focused on the how destination managers utilise the various forms of technology in addressing both the positive and negative impacts of tourism. Building on Hjalager's (1997) analytical typology for sustainable tourism innovation, this research aims to advance tourism innovation research and demonstrate new uses of technology and the wider applications for sustainable tourism. Using a thorough literature review and primary research with destination managers, a collection of technology based tools and their uses were examined for sustainable tourism development and how these tools can foster destination innovativeness. 1 Introduction Tourism's phenomenal, sustained growth rate makes it highly attractive as a means of economic development (Mihalic et al. 2012) and like most commercial activities, tourism has produced both beneficial and detrimental environmental and socio-cultural impacts, some of which may be irreversible. Balancing economic growth with protection of the environment is a challenge, which today faces most tourism professionals and the tourism industry is focusing on sustainable tourism development (ST) as a mechanism to try to achieve the aims of economic development whilst protecting, preserving and enhancing the environment (Swarbrooke 1999). Destinations are inevitably the areas where the main tourism impacts occur are felt most powerfully (Wall and Mathieson 2006) and there has been a general and growing concern on how destinations can develop in a sustainable manner (Dodds 2012). A plethora of ideas, techniques and philosophies have been developed to both explore and explain ST (Swarbrooke 1999). Some examples of these approaches include indicators, monitoring, eco-labelling, codes of conduct and alternative forms of tourism. However, many of these approaches have been documented as having a """" lack of quality, technical content, reliability, maturity, equity and effectiveness """" (Van Der Duim and Van Marwijk 2006: 449). Despite more than 40 years of tourism research focusing on ST and its implementation (Mihalic et al. 2012), the case is still considered theoretically weak (Moscardo 2008; Sharpley 2010). Pigram's (1990) and Liu's (2003) arguments that ST research has to progress beyond the formulation and discussion of the principles and assumptions to effective solutions …"""	biological anthropology;capability maturity model;code;john mathieson (computer scientist);package manager;while;word lists by frequency	Alisha Ali;Andrew J.

The data were obtained by means of a questionnaire completed by 380 middle managers from 102 companies in Serbia. The main conclusions of the study are: 1. The average scores for the information technologies items are slightly above average. 2. All the correlations between the information technologies dimension and information technologies items and the dimensions of communication satisfaction as well as those between the information technologies dimension and information technologies items and the dimensions of organizational learning are statistically significant, strong and positive. Information technologies have a stronger connection with the performance at organizational level and a weaker connection with performance at individual levels 3. The moderators of professional respect for the leader and confidence in the actions of management have a weak moderating effect on the observed relations. The effects of these moderators indicate that good professional aspects of leaders lead to a greater influence of information technologies on performance at individual levels and that good strategic aspects of leaders' work lead to a bigger influence of information technologies on performance at organizational levels.

Going beyond the simulations and case studies through which complex adaptive systems have been approached so far, we study the relationship between incremental organizational reconfigurations and discontinuous organizational restructurings using a large-scale database of U.S. Fortune 50 industrial corporations. We develop two types of escalation process in organizations: accumulation and perturbation. Under ordinary conditions, it is perturbation rather than the accumulation that is more likely to trigger subsequent discontinuous change. However, organizations are more sensitive to both accumulation and perturbation in conditions of heightened disequilibrium. Contrary to expectations, highly interconnected organizations are not more liable to discontinuous change. We conclude with implications for further research, especially the need to attend to the potential role of managerial design and coping when transferring complex adaptive systems theory from natural systems to organizational systems.	complex adaptive system;organizational behavior;perturbation theory;privilege escalation;simulation;systems theory;tree accumulation	Stéphane J.

It then connects these findings to the underling intellectual capital tenets to introduce a conceptual model that explicates how ESM impacts strategic knowledge management, and vice versa.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThis paper concludes that ESM provides a unique complement to traditional strategic knowledge management. The authors argue that ESM differs substantially from other contexts in which intellectual capital has been applied, and extend intellectual capital with three appropriate dimensions (human, social and structural capital). Given the potentially disruptive nature of ESM, this framework helps firms understand the nature of the changes that are needed.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnThe paper provides the first review of the business needs that are served by the software functions and management processes under the ESM banner. This original contribution takes the intellectual capital and strategic knowledge management discussions from their usual high levels of abstraction and relates them to the real world of ESM, focusing on outcomes. Its unique “Intellectual Capital Framework for the Socially Oriented Enterprise” includes distinct, testable propositions that provide a practical approach to strategically planning, implementing and optimizing ESM.	knowledge management;social media	Chris Archer-Brown;Jan Kietzmann	2018	J.

It is argued that by making society aware of how a service is provided – its process citizens (clients) may develop a better attitude for interacting with government and other service users, by discussing problems, correcting previously-available information, increasing their knowledge about the processes. This paper presents a tool designed to support conversations about public service processes and the results obtained with a case study of its use. The results suggest that conversations have stimulated interaction among citizens and government services providers as well as allowed identification of service improvement opportunities.

Design/methodology/approach – After an exhaustive review of literature about corporate social responsibility, strategic planning of organisations and balanced scorecards (BSCs), a methodology has been developed that describes the process of designing and implementing a sustainability BSC for sustainability strategic planning and management. Findings – The methodology can be easily implemented at companies with a minimum of computer resources, but managers play a key role in its success, since they are the responsible for providing the necessary environment for overcoming such an important change. Research limitations/implications – The methodology has only been applied once and their results will only be able to be analysed after a long time. Meanwhile, more implementations have to be performed to test and improve the different steps und tools until the methodology can be considered definitive. Practical implications – The methodology could be used by many organisations, improving their social and environmental performance and contributing to their sustainability and the sustainability of all of their stakeholders, specially for society as a whole. Readers of this paper could see a practical application of methodology and its viability by means of the case. Originality/value – An innovative structure for BSCs which has been developed having in mind the sustainability since the beginning, but not justly adding environmental and social variables to a model designed with economical purposes.	binary symmetric channel;information system;strategic management	Raúl León;María Jesús Muñoz-Torres;Ricardo Chalmeta	2010	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635571011020331	sustainability organizations;strategic planning;economics;knowledge management;environmental resource management;marketing;management science;management;information system	HCI	-78.46230726873223	2.758203456147448	111431

User anonymization in personalized systems goes beyond current models in that not only users must remain anonymous, but also the user modeling system that maintains their personal data. Moreover, users' trust in anonymity can be expected to lead to more extensive and frank interaction, hence to more and better data about the user, and thus to better personalization.

Organizations can learn from their own crises but also from competitor’s crises by adjusting their crisis management strategies. Management practices towards the response of crises were discussed by experts. The experts agreed on a fast response strategy. Furthermore, a wide range of information has to be communicated to the public.

First we compare this approach with other theories of collective cognition (such as those focusing on situated cognition and communities of practice, distributed cognition and coordination mechanisms). We then present the core concepts involved in defining communities of action, the duality of goals and forms of knowledge and the operational, strategic, integrative and relational categories of collective activity on which the OSIR model is based. We conclude by presenting as an example the application of the model to a research project designed to assist the setting up of a health network.	action theory (philosophy);computer-supported cooperative work;distributed cognition;situated cognition	Manuel Zacklad	2003		10.1145/958160.958190	design;socially distributed cognition;human–computer interaction;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;situated cognition;management science;communication;management;social psychology	HCI	-83.03957230327809	-3.865142341272165	112670

The current research intends to explain how technology entrepreneurs can successfully utilise this theory to secure crowdfunding. Specifically, we predict that the innovativeness of a project, the skills, abilities, honesty and kindness of individual workers, can positively affect crowdfunding achievement. We also hypothesise and test that positive emotional characteristics in the workplace can strengthen the relationship between products usefulness and funding success. Data was collected from Kickstarter platform to test our theory. Our analyses show that specific individual skill (entrepreneursu0027 industry experience) negatively influences their funding success, but entrepreneuru0027s personal characteristics (previous funding experience and frequent updates) are positively related to crowdfunding achievement.

Along with other states and regions, the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) can benefit from preliminary scoping, evaluation, and assessment of the impact of connected vehicles and infrastructure and a wide range of potential cooperative system applications. With this in mind, ODOT is aiming to determine whether or not to pursue the next phases of federal connected vehicle application funding. It can also make an informed choice about taking a potential national leadership role in the connected vehicle arena, and assess opportunities to join projects with other partners. To assist ODOT in this assessment, this paper describes the empirical results of a survey that was distributed to agency staff to gauge perception of connected and automated vehicle technology. Most respondents have heard of this technology and were in favor of its application. However, many had concerns about cyber security and system failure having catastrophic consequences. Likewise, many voiced concerns about ODOT’s preparedness for connected or automated vehicles. ODOT and other agencies can use these findings to help prepare for a better future of connected and automated vehicles.	software deployment	Robert L.

Strategy and organizational theorists have emphasized the importance of balancing exploitation and exploration for organizations' sustainable success in regards to organizational learning and adaptation. However, few researchers have addressed the mechanisms or criteria in regards to an organization's resource allocation for exploitation and exploration with an ambidextrous balance, although previous researchers agree that exploitation and exploration are important for organizational success and that a balance between the two should be achieved in order to obtain sustainable competitiveness. The main purpose of this research is to make a logical argument on how team creativity evolves from the creativity revelation processes through knowledge creation by balancing exploitation and exploration. Specifically, this research presents a new logical mechanism to allocate a team's limited resources to exploitation and exploration, keeping a balance between the two activities. We prove the validity of the proposed logical mechanism by conducting longitudinal simulations.	simulation	Do Young Choi;Kun Chang Lee	2015	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2013.10.030	ambidexterity;simulation;exploration;knowledge management;management science	AI	-88.41174938486799	-1.3862289149484874	113368

We do so to advance conceptual and empirical insights about ICH governance. We are motivated by the simple observation that, increasingly, organizations are engaging in shared activities, often relying on a purpose-built digital infrastructure to support collaboration among organizations. Here we use the conceptualization of network governance to guide our analysis of characteristics of governance that distinguish low and high performing ICH. To do this we use fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis and data from 61 public safety networks (PSN) – a particular form of ICH. The analysis shows there exist six distinct configurations of PSN governance practices that lead to high performance. Common to all these configurations is competence in managing both stakeholders and the digital infrastructure. Building from the findings, we advance the role of specific competencies and network governance more broadly.		Jane Fedorowicz;Steve Sawyer;Arthur P.

It explores how the agency of IS has been articulated in the extant stream of accounting information systems (AIS) research and explains how a relational view of agency can enhance our understanding of IS in its organizational context. This reinterpretation highlights the limitation of viewing IS as technology (technocentric view) with predefined functionality and predictable effects. Attention is also shifted away from an anthropocentric conceptualization of IS; where the technology is seen as a tool and agency is attributed only to humans. We argue in the paper that both the technocentric and anthropocentric views of IS limit what can be learned about the agency of IS. Drawing on actor-network theory (ANT), this study conceptualizes IS as a relational network and proposes a relational view of the agency of IS. This relational view suggests that the social and material entities that make up IS have no absolute essence when viewed in isolation; rather, their collective force defines the agency of IS. The implications of the relational view of agency for AIS research are also highlighted."	information system	Habib Mahama;Mohamed Z. Elbashir;Steve G. Sutton;Vicky Arnold	2016	Int. J. Accounting Inf.

It takes a top-down perspective focusing on the role of public participation and public policies on eParticipation. The status of eParticipation in Austria as well as of social and political trends regarding civic participation and its electronic embedding are analysed. The results show a remarkable recent increase of eParticipation projects and initiatives. A major conclusion is that eParticipation is becoming a subject of public policies in Austria; however, the upswing of supportive initiatives for public participation and eParticipation goes together with ambivalent attitudes among politicians and administration.	top-down and bottom-up design;video game graphics	Georg Aichholzer;Doris Allhutter	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03781-8_3	public relations;political science;public administration	HCI	-77.90035657504944	-7.211872862808109	113671

It is generally believed that trust is dynamic and that a user’s prior experience with automation affects future behavior indirectly through causing changes in trust. Additionally, individual differences and cultural factors have been frequently cited as the contributors to influencing trust beliefs about using and monitoring automation. The presented research focuses on modeling human’s trust when interacting with automated systems across cultures. The initial trust assessment instrument, comprising 110 items along with 2 perceptions (general vs. specific use of automation), has been empirically validated. Detailed results comparing items and dimensionality with our new pooled measure will be presented.	automation;interaction	Shih Yi Chien;Zhaleh Semnani-Azad;Michael Lewis;Katia P.

It proposes some principles and axioms that are consistent with the evidence in management systems used in business practice. It then reviews previous research about nomology in philosophy, science and the humanities. It shows that the main issue preventing the completion of the foundation of nomology has been the lack of an explanation of the relationship between the objective “nom” part as in economics and the subjective “ology” part as in psychology. It resolves this problem by showing that there are four main objective activities: proposition, perception, pull and push, and for subjective decisions the pull activity becomes redundant. It then describes tests in China and Chinese culture to validate that the results are truly generic. It proposes that nomology will be useful in providing a rigorous foundation for criteria structures in multi-criteria decision-making, and beyond into wider fields, especially those that combine subjective and objective aspects such as in conflict, inter-cultural and inter-disciplinary studies, ethics, and group decision-making.	cognitive architecture;fits;nomology;systems development life cycle;triadic closure	Cathal M.

9d34d9b8578c267fb569817103a30aebe5a2ee9a	information aspects of new organizational designs: exploring the non-traditional organization	organizational design;organizational climate;information;information technology	The purpose of the study presented in this article aims at broadening our understanding of information and concomitant aspects of a non-bureaucratic organizational design. With current changes in organizational environments, the century-long domination of the bureaucratic organization is being shaken. New organizational designs have been proposed as alternatives to the bureaucracy, including the information-based organization, networked organization, and adhocracy. Our knowledge of these designs, however, is still meager. This particularly applies to their information aspects, such as the role of information technology (IT), and exchanges of information and knowledge. In order to fill the void, an organizational design which will be called the “non-traditional organization” was created on the basis of relevant literature and was preliminarily tested on a sample drawn from the public accounting industry. The study discovered a strong positive relationship between the amount of IT usage and non-traditional dimensions, invoking the notion of an organic, “informated” organization. This relationship primarily rests on the relationships IT forms with centralization and formalization (both negative), and trust and communication beyond team boundaries (both positive). Information and knowledgerelated interactions are in relation with team-based accountability in this networked, “information-rich” organization. Communication beyond team boundaries serves several purposes, including integration and creation of a dialogue-based, adhocratic, “interactive” organization. Hierarchy appears to be the most resilient dimension of the traditional organization in the sample studied. These findings bear implications for understanding new organizational designs.	bureaucracy;centralisation;collaborative software;discrepancy function;dominating set;interaction;knowledge acquisition;network-centric organization;organizing (structure);self-organization;source-to-source compiler;the void (virtual reality)	Bob Travica	1998	JASIS	10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(1998110)49:13%3C1224::AID-ASI8%3E3.0.CO;2-V	organizational commitment;organizational learning;social science;organisation climate;information;computer science;knowledge management;organizational effectiveness;sociology;management;information technology;organizational space;organization development;organizational architecture	HCI	-78.1781452257375	-3.3622643282972726	114187

The learning experience may itself be enough to help a decision and may also be codified into a knowledge base for use at another time. A modular structure, called a Pattern Language, provides both a base for recording this knowledge and also a format for the debriefing of experience to gain that knowledge. The modularity means that the modules, or prototypes of them, may be imported from other applications so speeding the process and encouraging the transfer of good practices. Two applications, in process engineering in a chemical company and strategy formation in a small charity, are given, which demonstrate the use of donor patterns as means of importing knowledge and stimulating learning. Although the circumstances of the two cases are quite different the processes are similar in duration and structure, suggesting a model for future application.

Our problem is that, given a particular case intended to be discussed in an electronic meeting room, we do not know how to design the meeting for best performance. The paper builds a framework for studying this problem based on the notion of mediation channels.

Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on a mixed method approach. The quantitative content analysis of mission statements was performed on a sample of 222 Slovenian companies. Mission statement’s keywords were analysed with exploratory factor analysis. Advanced network analytic approaches such as PathFinder algorithm were utilised to obtain better understanding of interrelatedness of underlying mission components. Three interviews with the top managers were performed as well. Findings – The mission statement content analysis identified five associated organisations’ orientations: concern for stakeholders, orientation towards stability, orientation towards cooperation and innovation, and development and growth. The interviews confirm missions’ role in communicating the espoused or declared OC, although different approaches to achieve employees’ commitment to the organisation’s mission can be identified in regard to the size of the organisation. Originality/value – The cultural approach to the analysis of mission statements confirms that the mission statements incorporate basic contents of OC. The methodology applied gives new possibilities in the research of OC perspective of strategic statements.	algorithm;exploratory factor analysis	Katarina Babnik;Kristijan Breznik;Valerij Dermol;Nada Trunk Sirca	2014	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/IMDS-10-2013-0455	organizational culture;economics;network analysis;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;marketing;management science;management;operations research	SE	-83.27595990815118	0.29544293260277127	114563

Some research found that system use has significant impact on job performance, as anticipated; other research does not confirm such a relationship. In this paper, we try to bridge this inconsistency by attributing this inconsistency to the simply conceptualized and measured system use construct. Subsequently, we introduce a “richer” conceptualization of system use, namely adaptive system use, and we examine its relationship with job performance. We suggest that adaptive system use accounts for a significant part of the impact of system use on job performance. Using a sample of 274 MS Office users, we were able to confirm that adaptive system use has significant impact on task productivity, management control, and task innovation.

This particular study, still in progress, will collect and analyze data on employee information privacy and security practices and perceptions. A complicating factor is that the classification of information as “private” may not be absolute. Privacy levels of organizational information will be dictated by company policy, while privacy concerns with personal information are based on the employee's own comfort level. Hence potential conflict arises if an individual uses a single mobile device for both personal and organizational information access. A summary and status of design activities and the planned implementation of the study is provided.

Adaptive stmcturation theory predicts that team adoption of new communication technologies will not be uniform but will vary depending on (a) ongoing structures and resources within teams as they implement new systems, and (b) the actions of knowledgeable agents, such as -gement and team leader% during the adoption process (DeSanctis and Poole, 19!34). Because these factors vary over time and across teams, we can expect variance in new technology impacts. Hence, some teams may remain hierarchical or fragmented while others become more participative and integrated.	collaborative software;emoticon;field research;information system	Gerardine DeSanctis;Marshall Scott Poole;Gary W.

However there is contention in academic discourse as to what qualifies as HS? Is there a distinction between multi-method, multi-paradigm and HS? How do we integrate methods from disciplines like OR and computer science that contribute to the success of a M&S study? How do we validate a hybrid model when the whole (the combined model) is greater than the sum of its parts (the individual models)? Most dynamic simulations have a notion of time, how do we realize a unified representation of simulation time across methodologies, techniques and packages, and how do we prevent causality during inter-model message exchange? These are but some of the questions which we found to be asking ourselves frequently, and this panel paper provided a good opportunity to stimulate a discussion along these lines and to open it up to the M&S community.	causality;color gradient;computer science;programming paradigm;simulation	Navonil Mustafee;John H.

Despite its widely accepted managerial importance, empirical studies could not provide significant evidence of a relationship between implemented management structures and project success. A major problem in finding meaningful empirical evidence is the conceptualization of the structure measure, which is derived from a typologist's perspective. In this study, we follow the taxonomists' perspective and empirically develop an alternative taxonomy of project management structures. We empirically compare both approaches, by using two different samples, collected in the United States and Germany, including together over 600 projects. Our empirical findings show that the validity of the widely accepted project organization typology is in question. The use of cluster analyses reveals an alternative taxonomy that encompasses five structural types, differentiated by the entities managing them: project coordinator, supervised project coordinator, autonomous project manager, supervised project manager, and autonomous functional project manager. The results strongly support the widely accepted proposition of a relationship between project organization and project success. The emerging taxonomy of project organization configurations enriches the theoretical and conceptual discussions of organizing projects and unravels the multiple aspects involved in organizing the execution of projects.	autonomous robot;biological anthropology;cluster analysis;conceptualization (information science);entity;organizing (structure);taxonomy (general)	Thomas G.

A comprehensive analysis was done involving data on economic indicators related to telecommunications services provided by the statistics division of the United Nations, and the current initiatives on agricultural market information systems in the two countries. The review reveals that Malawi needs more work to be done to improve service delivery of its ICT-based market information system projects than Ghana. Main areas for improvement are mobile phone subscriptions by low-income smallholder farmers, Internet access by the same category of farmers, and sustainability of offering the services in question without heavy reliance on governments and international donor agencies. The recommendations drawn from this review do not only apply to Malawi and Ghana but also to other Sub-Saharan African countries.

With every transaction in the digital world leading to the generation of data, big data and their analytics have received major attention in various fields and different contexts, examining how they may benefit the different actors in the society. The present study aims to identify how startups that develop products with both software and hardware parts can generate value from data analytics and what challenges they face towards this direction. To this end, we performed a multiple-case study with early-stage startups and employed qualitative analysis on a dataset from 13 startups. Through semi-structured interviews, we examine how these companies use data analytics. The findings show that although the benefits from data analytics are clear, multiple barriers and challenges exist for the startups to be able to create value from them. The major ones are about their resources, including human skills, economical resources, as well as time management and privacy issues.		Vebjørn Berg;Jørgen Birkeland;Ilias O.

Furthermore, lifestyle has been used to great effect in marketing and health research to predict attitudes, cognitions, and behaviors, but has largely been ignored in the IS field. In this study, we demonstrate the potential usefulness of incorporating lifestyle into IS research by using lifestyle cluster segmentation in the context of technology adoption. Based on a U.S. national random sample of 402 non-cloud service users, we propose, analyze, and validate a multi-faceted model of cloud technology adoption that integrates technology attributes-the dominant predictors in IS adoption and acceptance models-with a range of demographic, domestic, leisurely and professional variables for providing a holistic theoretical understanding of and practical insights into the technology adoption process."""

In this paper, we focus on the development of e-government as an example of such a system. First, we present an extension of Mumford’s ideas about the benefits and process of participation, based on an analysis of recent citizen engagement initiatives. We then examine the extent to which e-government reflects the principles she espoused. The evidence collated indicates that e-government development is currently characterised by a technocentric approach with minimal engagement of citizens. We discuss the implications arising from this analysis, and explore the benefits that governments could achieve from adoption of a sociotechnical, participatory approach to e-government development. The crucial enabling role of capacity building is highlighted. Providing citizens with the necessary skills and capabilities to engage effectively offers the key to the successful development of systems such as e-government which impact our lives in the 21st century Information Society.	e-government;enid mumford;sociotechnical system	C.

The distribution of the pool of skilled healthcare resources is uneven with a large concentration in cities. People from the rural areas have to travel to the cities to avail even basic healthcare facilities. In order to provide universal healthcare access, various Governments, hospitals, and NGO's (Non-Government Organizations) have started “task shifting”, where healthcare tasks are delegated to the less specialized workforce by leveraging the power of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). However, there has not been any publication on the technical challenges of deploying such ICT-based solutions at scale and on the effectiveness of such solutions in the field. The main problems in the effective implementation of ICT-based solutions in rural locations are limited skills and motivation of community health workers, lack of low cost technology solution affecting overall project sustainability, poor utilization of existing services due to low awareness and gender issues. The following paper highlights the challenges of deploying a Smartphone based healthcare system in rural areas, our approach to solving those problems and the insights obtained from a field trial.	mhealth;smartphone;software deployment	Nataraj Kuntagod;Sanjoy Paul;Senthil Kumaresan;Sreenivasan Ganti	2014	IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC 2014)	10.1109/GHTC.2014.6970287	knowledge management;environmental resource management;business;economic growth	Mobile	-79.89037691917352	-8.778804536027714	115697

d173c674e8ffc4b629ca98d5329e9d9da306c7a3	gauging e-government: a report on implementing services among american cities	best practice	Municipalities face a dilemma as they pursue technologically enabled modes of providing traditional services. The planning stages of e-government amount to triage: which specific municipal functions and services can a municipality afford to implement (or which services can they afford not to implement) given the costs of technology and technological capability? Little in the way of defining the leading edge of innovation among cities exists. To date, the literature on e-government “best practices” tends to stress creating standards for evaluating web-enabled services rather than for benchmarking the actual status of e-government implementation. In other words, a well-developed literature is emerging around standards by which municipal websites can be evaluated such as navigability and content standards. These standards do not give us insight, however, into the specific functions and services as they emerge on municipality websites. As a means toward addressing this lacuna, the authors created a rubric for benchmarking implementation among cities nationwide using a broad range of functional dimensions and assigning municipalities “e-scores.” In this paper, the authors describe these efforts, their approach and their findings. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Understanding post-adoptive IT usage is useful in realizing potential IT business value. Most previous research on post-adoptive IT usage, however, dismisses the unintentional and unconscious aspects of usage behavior. This paper advances understanding of the unintentional, unconscious, and thereby automatic usage of IT features during the post-adoptive stage. Drawing from Social Psychology literature, we argue human behaviors can be triggered by environmental cues and directed by the person’s mental goals, thereby operating without a person’s consciousness and intentional will. On this basis, we theorize the role of a user’s innovativeness goal, as the desired state of an act to innovate, in directing the user’s unintentional, unconscious, and automatic post-adoptive IT feature usage behavior. To test the hypothesized mechanisms, a human experiment employing a priming technique, is described.		Meng Zhang;Guy G.

Security is an important component in KS, and plays a key role in reducing the risks in KS. However, relatively little study has been performed on KS security in the public and private sectors, and even less in the developing countries. This research intends to find the relationship between organizational context and KS security which have not previously been dealt by other studies, to propose a research model. The potential constructs for the model are identified through literature review. Hence, the research model is divided in to three main parts: organizational context, organizational type and KS security. Organizational context includes factors in three dimensions, namely, organizational structure, organizational culture, and information technology. In this study organizational type is identified as a moderating construct. Therefore, this study illustrates the influence of organizational context and type in KS security.	windows legacy audio components	Azadeh Sarkheyli	2016			public relations;organizational commitment;organizational learning;organizational behavior and human resources;economics;knowledge management;environmental resource management;organizational studies;public sector;management;law;organization development;private sector	Security	-80.37231264852109	-0.22363865117622106	115980

This study is expected to provide an understanding on how communication patterns established in different roles and different levels. The authors not only measured OSS success from both developers and users’ perspectives, but also extended the existing research by including the potential relationships among these success measures in the estimation model. Following the panel data econometric analysis methodology, they evaluated their research hypotheses using the Three-Stage Least Squares model, accounting for both time-period and project fixed effects. The authors’ results indicated that according to the objectives of projects, a proper and planned control for the communication among team members is crucial for the success of OSS projects.

This extensive use of the concept has resulted in several interpretations and diverse classifications. These discrepancies in combination with the extensive use of the concept put its fundamental logic at the danger of losing its meaning. Using a systematic literature review, this paper highlights the similarities, differences and fragmented knowledge groups and consequently provides a possibility to move towards a unified view of IS capability. To consolidate the fragmented classifications, the paper advances a four ellipse model from prior classification to vividly conceptualize the IS capability construct and hence provide an integrated platform for future research.	fragmented object;information system;systematic review	Abayomi Baiyere;Hannu Salmela	2014			knowledge management;data mining;management science	AI	-77.46507577618056	-0.6290406623433885	116330

We conduct a qualitative multiple-case study using the lens of institutional theory through the analysis of intra-organization relations. The results show that the institutional logic of stakeholders can drive EA projects in different directions during the process of EA institutionalization, and thus organizations obtain different project outcomes ultimately. We contribute by extending the knowledge on EA institutionalization from a micro-level perspective, understanding and explaining how the organizational structure was shaped and influenced by stakeholders’ relations, as well as providing insight into stakeholders’ behaviors and activities during the process of EA institutionalization so that practitioners may improve the success rate of EA projects, particularly in the public sector.	enterprise architecture	Dinh Dang	2017			knowledge management;business administration;business architecture;enterprise architecture;public sector;institutional theory;computer science;institutionalisation	SE	-79.87407725361679	1.3766193760282999	116392

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships between system quality, attitude toward incentives and knowledge sharing in a VCoP. Additionally, individual and collective effect of system quality and attitude toward incentives on knowledge sharing are also examined. Design/methodology/approach – This is an empirical study that targets a major community of practice in human resource management (n 1⁄4 366), utilizing a survey questionnaire distributed on the internet as the data collection instrument to test the relationship among the three dimensions. Findings – The results indicated that: system quality and attitude toward incentives individually have demonstrated a significant effect on knowledge sharing behavior in a VCoP. Collectively, only factors within the attitude toward incentive dimension have demonstrated significant influences on the community participants’ knowledge sharing behavior. Practical implications – This study provides managers of VCoP with valuable information which aids in improving community members’ knowledge sharing. That is, a successful VCoP is an online environment which provides a variety of social exchange opportunities for the members to interact, as well as challenging topics or tasks enabling the members to practice or gain professional knowledge and skills. Social implications – Regardless of the fact that knowledge sharing processes are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, providing various kinds of incentive is still crucial in eliciting people’s engagement in knowledge sharing. Only reinforcing social exchanges and providing opportunities of self-growth will enhance knowledge sharing behavior. Originality/value – Knowledge sharing is a complex process. Literature indicated that some factors, such as motivation, attitudes, and individual preferences, are considered double-edged factors to knowledge sharing among individuals. The present study adds value by examining the individual and collective effects of these factors (i.e. the members’ perceived VCoP system quality and attitude toward incentives) on knowledge sharing.	interaction;knowledge management;lam/mpi;online community;stepwise regression;theory;on-line system	Li-An Ho;Tsung-Hsien Kuo	2013	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/IMDS-01-2013-0015	economics;knowledge management;environmental resource management;human resource management;management science	HCI	-85.42179700016032	-0.7101703714596277	116512
01aad17650823f8d0a159316da6dbe1323eb7c91	improving healthcare through human city interaction		The study of information technology has given insufficient focus to a) the structural factors and b) the community perspective. As information systems become increasingly integrated with human systems these wider influences are more important than ever. Human city interaction concepts including their interplay with cyberphysical systems and social computing are appropriated to healthcare. Through Structuration Theory, insights are given into how healthcare through the human city interaction lens can most effectively be improved.	emoticon;information system;smart city;social computing	Tim Woolliscroft;Simon Polovina	2017		10.5220/0006368401720177	knowledge management;human systems engineering;social computing;health care;structuration theory;management science;information system;computer science;information technology	HCI	-78.2530989013301	-3.57677856603965	116619

Knowledge sharing is a voluntary act which requires an individual's motivation. Based on the notion that an individual's motivation is of two types, namely intrinsic and extrinsic, a framework of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators of knowledge sharing was presented at the International Symposium on Information Technology (ITSIM) in June 2010, in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. There is a lack of research work which attempts to understand knowledge sharing motivation from intrinsic as well as extrinsic motivational perspective. Hence, the proposed framework incorporated extrinsic rewards, representing extrinsic motivation, and Organisation Citizenship Behaviour (OCB), representing intrinsic motivation, in Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). Apart from understanding the individual's knowledge sharing motivation from a two-dimensional motivation perspective, the primary aim of this study is to extend the framework proposed in ITSIM'10 by adding demographic variable as a moderating variable. This will help to understand individual di®erences in knowledge sharing behaviour. At the same time, the study will present the results of ITSIM paper in detail. This study has used training institutes of an oil and gas company in Malaysia as a case. The proposed framework will overcome the research gaps in the literature by re-analysing the impact of extrinsic rewards, OCB and demographic variables on knowledge sharing. To test six major and, in total, 19 hypotheses, the questionnaire method was used to gather data from the trainers and facilitators at three training institutes of the oil and gas company. The data was analysed by using multi-regression technique. The results have shown that intrinsic motivation, represented by OCB in this study, is one of the strongest motivating factors for knowledge sharing behaviour, whereas extrinsic motivation, represented by extrinsic rewards in this study, has a moderate e®ect on an individual's knowledge sharing intention. The results have also shown that individuals di®er in manifesting their knowledge sharing intention into behaviour based on their gender and education level, whereas there is no di®erence among individuals with di®erent experience levels in manifesting their knowledge sharing intention into behaviour. The study will help to understand the individual's knowledge sharing motivation from intrinsic as well as extrinsic motivational perspectives and, at the same time, individual di®erences in knowledge sharing behaviour. It will aid the managers at training institutes to promote knowledge sharing in their organisations.	diploma;emoticon;kerrison predictor;knowledge management;nl (complexity);nl-complete;numerical aperture;risk assessment;word lists by frequency	Aamir Amin;Mohd.

The research methodology involved semi‐structured interviews and staff surveys within a large public sector organisation. The results of the study show that many of the key CSFs identified for BPR in the private sector are equally relevant to the success of BPR in the public domain. The factors deemed most important for successful BPR in the public sector included items such as: top management support, commitment and understanding of BPR; communication; empowerment; and alleviation of downsizing fears. Also identifies a number of unique characteristics of public sector organisations which have a bearing on the application of BPR. These include: the existence of many intricate overlapping processes with multiple stakeholders; the existence of a professional workforce; and the existence of defined internal organisational boundaries.	business process	Rodney McAdam;John Donaghy	1999	Business Proc.

However, empirical research on enterprise systems has documented convincingly how situated workarounds undermine the unity of enterprise systems through local thus different practices and adoptions. This produces an apparently paradoxical character of enterprise systems: unity in the face of multiplicity. Our contribution is (i) to outline a theoretical middle-position effectively resolving the paradox and (ii) identify and analyse empirical strategies for how the paradox gets resolved in practice. The empirical basis for our study is a longitudinal (2007-2009) case study of a global oil and gas company with 30.000 employees operating in 40 countries across 4 continents.	enterprise system;situated;unity	Gasparas Jarulaitis;Eric Monteiro	2010			enterprise system;social science;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;management science;sociology;management;world wide web	SE	-78.19184682508083	0.6834561240028483	116706
59be61b57bdaca96fbb68a346208cb18ebd99070	a case study of physicians at work at the university hospital of northern norway		The knowledge management literature suggests that reuse of externalized knowledge is fundamental for improved efficiency, reduced costs and reduced dependency on individual know-how. Rather than considering knowledge as a specific thing the paper relates knowledge to the work people do. It suggest that knowledge management literature avoids to take into account how knowledge needs to be made credible, relevant and trustworthy in order to be used across time and across different contexts in large organizational contexts. The paper analyses how work is needed to render knowledge trusted through patient trajectories and how different contexts, people and situations shape the comprehension of trust associated with existing knowledge. Empirically, the paper draws on different medical contexts at the University Hospital of Northern Norway.	knowledge management;trustworthy computing	Gunnar Ellingsen	2003	InformingSciJ		explicit knowledge;body of knowledge;knowledge management;descriptive knowledge;domain knowledge;organizational learning;knowledge value chain;personal knowledge management;procedural knowledge;sociology	HCI	-81.92428630477833	-0.8697080248631728	116786

This study addresses middle managers’ views concerning the introduction of telecommuting programs in their organizations. Middle management views are important, because telecommuting directly impacts their positions, and their support is vital to ensure its successful implementation. The findings indicate that the majority of managers perceived cultural change as the most difficult issue to resolve when introducing a telecommuting program.	organizational behavior;telecommuting	Mahmoud M.

6622fe09a5ba4f748219da5b1f17b24cdc0bcbbe	organizational climate's role in enterprise social software usage: an empirical assessment		The focus of organizations’ internal communication and collaboration infrastructures has recently been extended from conventional intranets to enterprise social software platforms (ESSPs). However, as ESSPs rely on content creation and interaction through users, many platforms struggle. Previous research suggests that organizational climate plays an important role during IS adoption. Accordingly, our study quantitatively explores the influence of organizational climate on both contributive ESSP usage (knowledge sharing) and consumptive ESSP usage (knowledge consumption). Our results indicate that organizational climate – measured by the dimensions of trust, collaboration norms, and community identification – influences employees’ ESSP usage behaviors to a certain extent. In addition, collaboration norms appear to have a stronger impact on consumptive ESSP usage than on contributive ESSP usage.

Two recent phenomena add to the complexity of what IS programs should teach. First, Nicolas Carr (2003) claims that IT is no longer a source of strategic advantage. He suggests IT is now a commodity and should be managed as such. Second, offshore outsourcing has generated a growing concern over the loss of technology jobs. Many of them, the jobs for which current IS graduates compete. Thus, academicians face many questions. Such as: What jobs will be available for future IS graduates? What should we teach to best prepare them? What skills should they possess? This paper surveys recent literature on IT commoditization and offshore outsourcing. It contributes to the discussion about IS career path issues in the context of IT commoditization and offshore outsourcing. Further, it suggests areas of opportunity that exist and possible actions that the academy might take to better prepare students to compete for the IT jobs of the future.		John Benamati;Robert C.

Extant research pays little attention to the contingent efficacy of such global strategies from the perspective of MNC country subsidiary markets. We adopt the strategy–environment alignment principle and study how host country task and institutional environments might influence the efficacy of global strategies for MNC subsidiary performance. We assess MNC subsidiary performance using subjective managerial judgments, and on the basis of recent research on human judgments, we theorize that these judgments embody information about judgment magnitude and judgment uncertainty. A mean-variance function model simultaneously teases out the effects of the explanatory variables on the magnitude and uncertainty of MNC subsidiary performance judgments. To test the hypotheses, we analyze survey data from German and Japanese subsidiaries in the United States. The results support the use of the mean-variance function model and specific theory regarding the antecedents of performance judgment magnitude and uncertainty. Findings pertaining to interactions between global strategies and the facets of the local country environment reveal ways in which MNCs can adapt “global” strategies to navigate the complex array of country-markets they face.	contingency (philosophy);function model;global serializability;interaction	Rajdeep Grewal;Murali Chandrashekaran;F.

However, in some IS adoption models, as the most famous representative the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the relationship between user’s attitude and behavioral intention was found to be insignificant and was therefore excluded from later modifications of the respective models (e.g. TAM II and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology). Some authors in IS adoption literature indicate that there are operational and conceptual misconceptions of the attitude construct in IS adoption literature. To provide more information for this discussion within this paper, the descriptive results of a scientometric survey of fourteen IS top journals spanning 20 years and 147 articles, are presented with regards to the socio psychological grounding of attitude research. Several situational factors of adoption situations in literature e.g. adoption context or voluntariness of usage were captured in the data in order to analyze the occurrence of each characteristic in IS adoption models with reference to their influence on the attitude construct.	file spanning;ibm tivoli access manager;scientometrics	Julia Krönung;Andreas Eckhardt	2011			attitude;knowledge management;management science	HCI	-84.80166715605439	-6.235140393994198	117559

This raises the question about the impact of Mobile Product Information Systems (MPIS) on consumers’ perceived food quality and thus their food choices. Since most MPIS are not provided by producers of the food product, there is a risk that consumers no longer base their decisions on information provided on the product packaging, but instead on mobile information of third party service providers. As a first step this study provides a conceptual model to identify relevant influencing factors of MPIS.

However, few studies have addressed the issue of what type of leadership is most effective in which phase of the ES life-cycle. Given the different challenges to leadership in the different phases of an ES, a ‘one-style-fits-all’ approach is clearly inadequate. In this study, we analyze the contingent fit between the recognized leadership styles and the phases in the ES life-cycle. The evidence from a multi-case study provides support for our contingency propositions that transformational leadership fits best with the adoption phase, transactional leadership fits best with the implementation phase, and two variations of combined transformational and transactional leadership styles are most effective in the assimilation and extension phases. This study breaks new theoretical ground in information systems literature by highlighting the contingencies of leadership effectiveness in the success of ES at different phases. It also provides prescriptive insights for top executives in terms of who to put in charge and what type of leadership style to look for when considering adopting and implementing new ES, assimilating the implemented systems, or contemplating integrations with business partners.	enterprise system	Zhen Shao;Yuqiang Feng;Qing Hu	2016	EJIS	10.1057/ejis.2015.6	public relations;servant leadership;leadership style;transactional leadership;engineering;knowledge management;electrical engineering;shared leadership;management information systems;management science;information technology;cost leadership;transformational leadership;information system	DB	-80.38129824997004	2.643981790836851	117826

The role of user competence and its dimensions in facilitating the detection of online threats is still a controversial topic in the information security field. The dimensions used to measure the concept are self-efficacy, security awareness, privacy awareness, and cybercrime experience. The scales used to measure those factors can determine the level of user competence in evaluating risks associated with social network usage. The measurement scales employed here have been validated using an item-categorization approach that, to our knowledge, has never before been used in information security research. The result of this study provides evidence for the suitability and validity of the user competence dimensions and associated measurement scales.	categorization;cybercrime;information security;security awareness;sensor;social network	Samar Muslah Albladi;George R.

The main objective of our contribution is to make a quantitative analysis in order to assess the relationship between value co-creation and innovation in technology-driven firms: we are using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to investigate the relationship between value co-creation and innovativeness, and Self Organising Map (SOM) models to cluster firms in terms of their degree of involvement in co-creation and innovativeness. Results from the ANN show that a strong relationship exists between value co-creation and innovativeness; furthermore, SOM are well performing in identifying cluster of firms that are more involved in co-creation values. Our work makes a methodological contribution by adopting and validating a combination of techniques that is able to address complexity and emergence in value co-creation systems. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

M-Internet is a fast growing enabling technology for Mobile Commerce. However, despite its phenomenal growth and although M-Internet essentially provides the same services as stationary Internet, its adoption rate in many countries is very low compared to that of stationary Internet. The well-known Technology Adoption Model (TAM) has been used for explaining the adoption of traditional technologies. Most adopters and users of traditional technologies (e.g., spreadsheet, word processor) are employees in an organizational setting who use the technology for work purposes, and the cost of mandatory adoption and usage is borne by the organization. In contrast, adopters and users of M-Internet are individuals who play the dual roles of technology user and service consumer. Most of them adopt and use it for personal purposes, and the cost of voluntary adoption and usage is borne by the individuals. Thus, the adopters of new ICT, especially M-Internet, are also consumers rather than simply technology users. By adopting the theory of consumer choice and decision making from economics and marketing research, this study develops the Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) and explains customers’ M-Internet adoption from the value maximization perspective. The findings demonstrate that consumers’ perception of the value of M-Internet is a principal determinant of adoption intention, and the other beliefs are mediated through perceived value. The theoretical and practical implications of VAM related to M-Internet are discussed. D 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Moving beyond the collection of dyadic relationships of individual alliances, we examine more holistically the distribution of power imbalances and mutual dependences within alliance portfolios, as well as the impact of redundancies in portfolio partners’ resources. Building on resource dependence theory, we develop and test arguments on a sample of 59 firms in the U.S. passenger airline industry during 1998–2011. We find that nonuniform distributions of power imbalances and mutual dependences within the alliance portfolio as well as redundancy affect firm performance in different ways, which has implications for the management of alliance portfolios.	relevance	Manuela N.

This paper aims to investigate the perceptions of mobile users about the economic importance of security breaches. Instead of considering mobile users as a whole, they were examined as distinct user types based on Brandtzæg’s mobile user typology. These types are: (1) sporadic users, (2) socializers, (3) entertainment type users, (4) instrumental users, and (5) advanced users. In the context of the research part of this study, a survey was conducted in a sample of smartphone and tablet owners. The five user types were identified in our sample by setting specific classification rules, based on the frequency and the variety of mobile services used. Mobile users’ perceptions were assessed in terms of ten different kinds of security breaches. The findings indicated that the user types perceive differently the economic importance of security breaches, implying that the design of security policies and/or the development of tools totally for the community of users are not the appropriate practices. Our research could contribute to the knowledge considering mobile users and their perceptions about security breaches. Mobile content providers and developers could use the findings of this study to evaluate and redesign, if needed, their current strategies so as to meet users’ needs regarding security. & Emmanouil Stiakakis stiakakis@uom.gr Christos K.

This study aims to develop a preliminary framework to describe information technologies based upon 200 randomly selected technology descriptions taken from a comprehensive TAM meta-analysis effort currently in progress. We report on the use of a classification method involving both human judgment and statistical techniques. A manual sorting process is followed by multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis to aggregate the individual interpretations of the sorters into hierarchical cluster structures. The results of this method reveal several potential technology grouping solutions, one of which was selected for further discussion. Limitations and future research are also discussed.	aggregate data;cluster analysis;ibm tivoli access manager;image scaling;multidimensional scaling;randomness;sorting	George M.

The research reported in this paper follows a qualitative approach applied to three municipalities, focusing on current events in order to answer two question: Which emerging technologies are used by municipal governments in the State of Mexico? and How do these emerging technologies interact with organizational forms and outputs in municipal governments of the State of Mexico? Based on the Fountainu0027s Technology Enactment Theory, semi-structured interviews were conducted to ten participants. Findings show that emerging technologies in developing countries improve organizational efficiency, create new communication channels, break bureaucratic barriers, and help the decision-making process. Technology, boosted by laws, increases transparency, improves Government to Citizen interaction (G2C). Mobile technology is an important tool to generate emergent communication channels within organizations and to improve G2C. The dynamic interaction between emerging technologies, organizational forms and outcomes in municipalities in the State of Mexico, is driven by legislation. Technology Enactment Theory represents a suitable framework to study the interaction between technologies and organizations, especially in governments. However, with the evolution of governments, they are developing different kinds of technologies oriented to service delivery. So, it is important to add the citizenship component, in order to answer questions such as those generated in the current research. It is important to identify the answers to this kind of questions and it is also important to identify good practices, policies, and technologyu0027s implementation, that could be applied in similar governments, in order to have success in E-Governmentu0027s projects.	e-government;emergence;itil;information needs;information system;interviews;semiconductor industry;social network;uncanny valley	David Valle Cruz;Rodrigo Sandoval-Almazán	2017		10.1145/3085228.3085231	public relations;service delivery framework;knowledge management;computer science;management science;mobile technology;emerging technologies;developing country;government-to-citizen;citizenship;legislation	HCI	-84.01644137334486	-5.7176944863264865	118743

Many leading organizations face an uncertain environment involving complexity in information technology architectures and infrastructure, and more demands for top management to validate and secure day-to-day operations. This research has shown the significant factors of successful IT governance implementation, which are strategic alignment and value delivery. It proposes these findings from a case study by showing a snapshot of how IT governance contributes to an enriched operational planning/management and strategic performance protocol in organizations. It scrutinizes these data to identify the influences on the implementation of IT governance in achieving business objectives and meeting needs and shaping ongoing implementation within current organizational contexts. Moreover, this paper provides hands-on material for practitioners to address their IT governance challenge, which could be a sample case study illuminating lessons learned for other organizations.	baseline (configuration management)	Sureerat Saetang;Abrar Haider;Andy Koronios	2012		10.1007/978-1-4614-7540-8_37	environmental planning;environmental protection;environmental resource management;business	HPC	-79.70576286084906	1.7361680218877769	119108

Yet, past research also points at mixed findings in connection with the quality of the outcomes of collaborative tasks, generally suggesting that the use of electronic communication media has no negative effect on those outcomes. A new theoretical framework building on human evolution theory, called compensatory adaptation theory, has been proposed to explain these contradictory findings. This study provides a review and test of compensatory adaptation theory. It investigates the impact of the use of an electronic communication medium on 20 business process redesign dyads involving managers and professionals at a large defense contractor, with a focus on cognitive effort, communication ambiguity, message preparation, fluency, and task outcome quality. The study suggests that even though the use of electronic communication media seemed to increase cognitive effort and communication ambiguity, it had a neutral impact on task outcome quality. These results appear to be an outcome of compensatory adaptation, whereby the members of the dyads interacting through the electronic communication medium modified their behavior in order to compensate for the obstacles posed by the medium, which is suggested by a decrease in fluency and an increase in message preparation. The results generally support predictions based on compensatory adaptation theory.	business process;interaction	Ned Kock	2005	IRMJ	10.4018/irmj.2005040103	simulation;knowledge management;human factors and ergonomics;social psychology;computer-mediated communication	HCI	-86.34061707384026	-4.003437300669661	119257

19a16a1c0a0ed5c75bff09bcfcb2082ad50efcc0	conditions enabling effective multiple team membership	organizational design	There is a long tradition of research on work in teams and their increasingly important use as an approach to organizational design. While the implicit assumption has been that individuals work on one team at a time, many individuals are now being asked to juggle several projects and their associated multiple team memberships (MTM) simultaneously. This creates a set of interesting opportunities and challenges for organizations that choose to structure work in this way. In this paper, we review the limited existing research on MTM work. We then present the results of a survey documenting the prevalence of MTM work and the findings from a pilot interview study suggesting a number of challenges, benefits, and enabling conditions associated with MTM work. We discuss the implications for managers working in MTM environments as well as for scholars of teams and, in doing so we describe what we see as key items on the agenda for future research on this topic.	midwoofer-tweeter-midwoofer;software documentation	Mark Mortensen;Anita Williams Woolley;Michael Boyer O'Leary	2007			public relations;organizational performance;knowledge management;management science;business	HCI	-80.04276778743407	-2.5172617751378388	119304

The study attempts to identify whether the impact of these dimensions vary as per the difference in socio-economic demographics? Further, E-S-QUAL scale representing dimensions of e-core service quality is utilized and data collection is conducted from a survey of 600 mobile banking users of the Punjab State in India. The collected data is then put to test using Multiple Regression Analysis and Cronbach’s alpha. Findings of the study reveal that different customers perceive these dimensions differently depending upon their demographics. This study has important implications for academic research related to e-service quality or to any one doing research in the field of M-banking.

Information and communication technology (ICT) is considered to play a major supportive role for innovation in both MFIs which, nevertheless, approach them very differently. When discussing with KB management, GB was often mentioned as a best-practice example. Nevertheless, GB’s focus on the field level is not followed in innovation strategies. Restricting ‘microfinance technology’ to the automation of payment-data management falls behind GB’s understanding of microfinance as an ongoing recombination of financial, educational, community-building and empowering activities. The paper contributes to a better understanding of the specifics of work practices in MFI in developing countries – a domain which has not yet been thoroughly studied. The comparative analysis additionally reveals the impact of customer relationships on cooperative work and technological needs within banking organisations.	qualitative comparative analysis	Muhammad Adeel;Bernhard Nett;Volker Wulf	2013	IJSTM	10.1504/IJSTM.2013.054200	innovation;information and communications technology;microfinance;economics;marketing;community building;management;economic growth;economic system	HCI	-78.0121554230981	-6.7943684833151945	119462

Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with proper adaptation to the online environment, we propose a model comprising an external factor, namely brand name, and three constructs of technology adoption, namely perceived credibility, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use to assess customers’ intention to use IB. In addition, we investigate the difference in the brand name’s effect on customers’ adoption of IB between banks with larger market shares and banks with smaller market shares. We collected data through a questionnaire survey and analyzed the data using structural equation modelling (SEM) to investigate the inter-relationships between the constructs and assess the overall explanatory power of the model. The results provided support for the model and confirmed its robustness in predicting the impact of brand name on personal customers’ adoption of IB in Hong Kong.

An AC Nielsen Study found that Hong Kong’s online banking population was 926,000 in 2004 and the penetration rate was only at 26.6% (out of 3.48 million Internet users in 2004). Therefore, there are considerable business opportunities for Internet banking services in Hong Kong given the increasing number of Internet users. The Bank of East Asia and Dah Sing Bank pioneered IB services in Hong Kong in late 1999. However, their customers’ adoption rates are relatively lower than that of the HSBC Group, i.e., HSBC and Hang Seng Bank. The IB services offered by different banks are more or less the same because of keen competition, which results in quick replication of IB functions and security measures among rival banks. According to the figures of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (2008), there were 44 banks in Hong Kong offering IB services, of which 31 provided personal Internet bank accounts. Nonetheless, according to ACNielsen (2004), the IB market in Hong Kong was dominated by the HSBC group, with a market share of over 50%, while non-HSBC banks, e.g., the Bank of East Asia, Dah Sing Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, the Bank of China (Hong Kong) and Citibank, etc., held the rest of the market share. In view of this phenomenon, there is a need to identify factors influencing personal customers’ intention to use IB, which may include the impact of brand name (which is related to market share), and the perceived credibility, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of IB. There is an abundance of research on the impact of brand name on consumers’ intention to purchase physical goods. Nonetheless, there are few studies on the impact of brand name on consumers’ intention to acquire services, in particular IB services. While the studies of Berry (2000), de Chernatony and Dall’Olmo (1998), and Keller (1998) formed the basis for understanding the effects of brand name on customers’ acquisition of services, their notions lack empirical testing and validation. In this regard, an understanding of the impact of brand name on personal customers’ intention to use IB is desirable. We believe that brand name’s impact on service adoption can be empirically tested by using the traditional Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with proper adaptation to the online environment. The recent study by Cheng, Lam, and Yeung (2006) demonstrated the robustness of TAM in predicting customers’ intention to use IB with a focus on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and web security to meet their banking needs. Considering the potential impact of brand name on IB adoption and seeing that security and privacy issues have attracted increasing research attention in the web literature, we seek to fill the research gap by using brand name as an external factor and adding a new construct of perceived credibility that includes both the security and privacy factors in TAM for empirical testing. In summary, we aim to first identify factors that affect personal customers’ intention to use IB, which include brand name, perceived credibility, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of IB. Second, we construct a theoretical model to account for personal customers’ intention to use IB based on TAM, in which brand name is treated as an external factor and perceived credibility, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use as three constructs of IB adoption. Third, we study whether the brand names of IB providers with larger market shares have a different degree of effect on customers’ adoption of IB from the brand names of IB providers with smaller market shares. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the relevant literature on brand name, perceived credibility and TAM, and formulate our model. In Section 3 we discuss the research methodology and in Section 4 we present and discuss the results. In Section 5 we discuss the results and their theoretical and managerial implications and conclude the research findings, followed by some suggestions for future research. 18 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the publisher's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/empirical-study-impact-brand-"""	fax;ibm tivoli access manager;intel technology journal;internet security;lam/mpi;online banking;pa-risc;privacy;robustness (computer science);structural equation modeling;theory;uniform resource identifier;usability;web page	T.

We propose conceptualizing the plan's capacity to anticipate interdependencies at work as an emergent, distributed and artifact-mediated activity that might be uncovered studying plans, planning and the plans application as work objects and activities occurring within a multiplicity of coordinative artifacts and protocols. This way we can expand our knowledge on how the plans anticipation is maintained in changing environments to support work coordination and we might support designers of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) -- efforts for the design of CSCW systems.	computer-supported cooperative work;emergence;immutable object;interdependence	Ilaria Redaelli;Antonella Carassa	2015		10.1145/2675133.2675136	planning;simulation;knowledge management;anticipation;plan;management	HCI	-82.61801535125538	-4.516128126043651	119760

And do IT firms vary in their recruiting practices from other industries? In this paper, we empirically reveal that there are differences in employer and job seeker behavior distinguishing the IT and the non-IT world. The analysis explains particularities in job seekers’ and firms’ preferences and recruiting practices. Based on this, we derive recommendations for HR managers on how to effectively recruit qualified IT professionals and on how IT can assist in creating and maintaining a flexible workforce.

This study focuses on design issues that affect classification and aggregation options, such as corroboration, primacy and discord, and provides examples of classified key-factors that demonstrate the design issues.

Examining what motivate participants to be involved in OSS projects is one of the recently heated research areas. This study is motivated by the significance but lacking evidence on how personality traits may affect participants’ task effort on OSS projects. In particular, we investigate how personality traits namely psychological needs for autonomy and competence, and one’s altruism interact with motivations. Following Self-Determination Theory, we differentiate types of motivation in OSS communities. In addition, drawing upon the Affective Event theory, we submit that personality traits moderate the relationships between task effort and both external and identified motivations. The research model is largely supported by data from 204 participants in various OSS projects. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed.	autonomy;open sound system;open-source software;software industry	Weiling Ke;Ping Zhang	2008			simulation;motivation;self-determination theory;knowledge management;big five personality traits;social psychology	SE	-86.99587082884197	-2.2755751032822347	119933
582485069c8ba72a6ee6a6be106218a1b6103afd	the impact of social media as technostress inhibitor on employee productivity		The positive and negative sides of information technology and systems are of interest to the researchers across different domains. Technostress, being a negative and unintended consequence rendered by the use of various information systems, has recently obtained significant attention in the information systems (IS) literature. It has been demonstrated in various studies how technostress affects the overall organizational performance by increasing role stress and reducing employees' job satisfaction, productivity, and performance. We extend the existing literature on technostress by reasoning that certain information technologies (IT) and systems may induce technostress that can be inhibited by certain other IT and systems such as social media. Drawing on coping theory, we explain the role of social media as technostress inhibitor. We thus provide the research model depicting the moderating role of social media, in which, we posit that the negative impact of technostress creators on employee productivity can be mitigated by the use of social media. We also provide the potential implications of the study and outline the research methodology that will be taken up in the next stage of our present research.	information system;social media;unintended consequences	Anupriya Khan;Monalisa Mahapatra	2017		10.1145/3084381.3084407	organizational performance;coping (psychology);information system;technostress;psychology;job satisfaction;social media;information technology;employee productivity;knowledge management	HCI	-79.8306704507536	0.01488283818637838	120016

Empirically, we employ an advanced topic modeling methodology from computational linguistic research to compare the thematic content of a large sample of analyst reports issued promptly after earnings conference calls with the content of the calls themselves. Our results show that analysts discuss exclusive topics beyond those contained the conference calls and interpret topics discussed by managers during the conference calls. We refer to the former as analyst discovery role and the latter as analyst interpretation role. Additionally, we find that the proportion of new information in analyst reports relative to that in conference calls increases when firms face a higher level of competition, have a greater litigation risk, or operate in a more volatile information environment. We also find that the analyst interpretation function is magnified when information processing costs increase, specifically when conference calls include more uncertain or qualitative statements, firm operations are more complex, or firms convey bad news. Finally, we provide evidence that investors value both the information discovery and information interpretation roles. Overall, our results enhance our understanding of the important information intermediary role analysts play in capital markets.	information discovery;information processing;risk management;topic model	Allen H.

Our study provides a unique contribution to the IT security literature by studying effects of neutralization on both intentions (self-reported) and actual behavior, as well as examining the role of shame as a mediator. We surveyed employees from four organizations and found that the “metaphor of the ledger” neutralization technique predicts Shadow IT intention and actual Shadow IT usage. We also find that neutralization and deterrence effects influence shame.		Mario Silic;Jordan B.

Healthcare consumers increasingly seek and use health information to address their health concerns. However, many health consumers lack the time and expertise required to make solid judgments about the quality of health information they encounter. A full range of quality appraisal methods for health information offer help, yet health consumers use those methods infrequently. Health consumers need better support to overcome barriers to efficiency, scalability, and transparency often associated with this breadth of valuable methods. Furthermore, they need ways to assess the quality of health information they find in the context of their own, individually situated needs. Our goals were to investigate the concept of health information quality and to explore how we can provide health consumers with better support by highlighting, rather than hiding, important aspects of health information quality. First, by reviewing and synthesizing criteria used by a broad range of quality appraisal methods for health information, we identified four focal characteristics of health information quality: content, reference, authorship, and publisher. Together, these four characteristics of intrinsic quality provide an organizing framework for health consumers to assess the quality of health information along multiple dimensions according to their own needs. Next, we used a user-center approach to design a prototype tool that concretely illustrates our framework by allowing the user to highlight multiple dimensions of health information quality. We present a usage case example of this illustrative tool, which visualizes the quality of MEDLINE search results. Our work provides a new perspective on health information quality by acknowledging and supporting consumers’ needs for transparency and flexibility as they take a prominent role in health information quality assessment.	focal (programming language);information quality;information system;medline;organizing (structure);prototype;scalability;situated	Andrea Hartzler;Wanda Pratt	2007	CAIS		information needs;quality policy;knowledge management;marketing;data mining;management science;information quality;world wide web;health indicator	HCI	-83.66566446267883	-6.180602579554085	120445

A field survey of 131 employees from the selected virtual organisation was analysed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine the outcomes empirically. Our research offers a persuasive body of evidence supporting the notion that increasing employees’ sense of well-being can successfully form a bridge that can connect social capital tendency, organisational culture and employees’ knowledge-sharing behaviour. Surprisingly, and contrary to common belief, the integrated model shows that social capital tendency seems to play a more important role than organisational culture in affecting employees’ sense of well-being within the virtual organisation in a Chinese cultural context. Consequently, this research reveals the subtle interplay of employees’ sense of well-being, social capital tendency, organisational culture and knowledge-sharing behaviour, while the in-depth analysis provides strong support for knowledge management research and practice.

Based on an ethnographic examination in a software manufacturing organization, we present four episodes of practice that are related to two primary challenges: the lack of skilled staff and the lack of a shared image of the to-be developed system. The episodes are analyzed and discussed through a practice-lens but in doing this we focus on two somewhat distinctive practice views: one view which considers habitual practice that lead to reproducing and the other which considers how practice involves accommodations in response to resistance. Combining these two views, our interest is to understand how and when practices reinforce or change routines in technology implementation. The findings indicate the complex relationships among reproducing and accommodation practices in relation to objects, occupational status, and goal ambiguity. © (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.

7b8e99bb88ce08ca325d7066def684796a9c3570	knowledge complementarity and knowledge exchange in supply channel relationships	knowledge complementarity;knowledge exchange;supply chain management	Existing literature on knowledge exchange in inter-organizational relationships (e.g., a supply channel) reveals two opposing forces at work: (1) collaborative behavior and (2) opportunistic behavior. A concurrent assessment of the opposing perspectives and the contingencies under which each is relevant for supply channel performance can add valuable insights about the dynamics of knowledge exchange. We juxtapose the two behavior patterns using social capital theory and transaction cost economics (TCE) respectively as the explicators and employ knowledge complementarity as the contingency to reconcile the opposing behavior patterns. The choice of knowledge complementarity in this role stems from ample theoretical and empirical support in prior literature about the criticality of this factor in inter-firm knowledge exchange.#R##N##R##N#We propose a research model, and use data from a field study of 82 firms in the Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) industry to test our model. Our findings indicate that overall inter-organizational trust (a surrogate for social capital) and knowledge complementarity promote knowledge exchange behavior in a supply channel. The retarding effect of risk of opportunism (a TCE dimension) manifests only when knowledge complementarity is low. However, when knowledge complementarity is high, contrary to expectations, inter-organizational trust appears to impede knowledge exchange. Our post hoc analysis of this intriguing, counterintuitive result leads us to knowledge interdependence and dependence asymmetry as potentially critical antecedents to knowledge complementarity. Implication of our findings to academic research and supply chain scenario is also articulated.	complementarity theory	Kyung Kyu Kim;Narayan S.

Specifically, it explores a case of business process outsourcing (BPO), which is the transfer of a number of business processes, such as payroll, supply chain management, and customer relations to an external supplier. In this case, a company based in the US outsourced its business processes to a company in India. (1) If widespread proficiency in English is the reason for India's predominant position in outsourcing, then why do we hear about communication problems? (2) What are the causes of such problems? (3) In what forms and situations do they manifest? (4) How could technical communication offer solutions to ameliorate or minimize some of these communication problems? Similar cases studied include previous studies of call centers in the Philippines and outsourcing relationships in software companies have identified challenges in those relationships to problems of intercultural communications, such as language use and differences in culture. Three areas of inquiry informed this study. Intercultural communication theories provide frameworks and touch points for assessing the role of culture in communication. Previous studies of outsourcing and offshoring provided definitions of the broad range of arrangements that comprise outsourcing. Although these studies all concluded that communication is a crucial factor in the success of outsourced projects, they offered few details of communication problems, their causes, manifestations, and possible solutions. Accounts of India represent India as a rapidly-growing, dynamic economy with certain typical communication problems. The study was designed as a mixed-methods, single-case study with a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data were gathered through surveys that helped develop a picture of patterns in areas such as communication problems, preferred methods of communication, and patterns of escalation while qualitative data from 45 personal interviews and one group interview provided insights into the nature and resolution of communication dissonances. The case studied ABC Corporation, a captive Indian company that performed BPO for a major American corporation. Communication problems that arise in the outsourcing relationship include differences in corporate culture and differences in linguistic and rhetorical choices. Issues causing these problems include differences in education and training. Ongoing training in cross-cultural communication is needed at all stages of the outsourcing cycle, with an emphasis on communication skills in the early stages of the process, especially the hiring stage. Technical communication can offer solutions to these problems because our field can help structure suitable training applying theories such as Cross' Theory of centripetal and centrifugal forces, which provide frameworks for assessing and addressing communication problems.	business process;captive portal;centrifugal governor;customer relationship management;level of measurement;manifest (transportation);outsourcing;privilege escalation;software framework;software industry;theory	Ritu Raju	2012	IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication	10.1109/TPC.2012.2207834	public relations;economics;engineering;operations management;communication studies;organizational communication;knowledge process outsourcing;communication;management;outsourcing	Visualization	-80.63974467491474	1.240304456903379	120931

We modeled the relationships among the extent of IT outsourcing, the ZOT (the Zone of Tolerance), and IS success. We justified our model using the expectancy–disconfirmation theory, the agency theory, and transaction cost economics, and we empirically tested it using structural equation modeling with responses from IS users. We found significant direct and indirect effects (through the service quality) of outsourcing on IS systems’ perceived usefulness and their users’ satisfaction. Whereas the extent of outsourcing is negatively related to the service quality and perceived usefulness, the ZOT-based IS service quality is positively related to the user satisfaction. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As such, from a technological viewpoint, Green IT has become an important topic in contemporary organizations. Consequently, organisations are expected to be innovative in their business practices to become more sustainable. Yet, the popularity and adoption of such initiatives amongst employees remain low. Furthermore, the management practices for adhering to Green IT are largely dormant, lacking active incentives for employees to engage in Green IT initiatives. This study observes the phenomenon of Green IT through administrative innovation. In doing so this paper performs a comprehensive analysis of 137 papers published between 2007 and 2015. The paper reveals organizational factors for successful implementation of Green IT as administrative innovation that can be useful to both academia and practice.

Still, work tasks are usually considered and perceived as individual activities although the technology and the characteristics of the tasks require collaborative and cooperative handling processes. This viewpoint still produces technologies that, in general, assume individual information management and decision-making. Based on previous research on information culture (IC) and collaborative information seeking (CIS), this paper proposes an integrated framework where both environmental (cultural) as well as collaborative aspects of organisational information behaviour are present. This kind of framework would be useful in studies looking into how information is retrieved, how information is organised and managed, and how information is used as a resource in collaborative settings.

Results indicate uniformly positive consequences of content facilitation. In the context of this study, process support was found to negatively affect meeting structures. To some extent, these negative impacts were moderated by GSS use. These results are explored from the perspective of structuration theories and research on transactional and transformational leadership. Implications for meeting facilitation are discussed and future research directions proposed.	generic security services application program interface	Shaila M. Miranda;Robert P.

f73735654b6db924b186105186c5132616f32381	mastering the art of jugaad and guanxi: a western guide to business practices in india and china		Purpose: Successfully entering foreign markets is a major issue in the field of international business. Cultural ignorance increases uncertainty that hinders a firm’s international performance. Research has shown that the impact of cultural differences is one of the biggest obstacles to entering the Chinese and Indian markets, which are seen as one of the more important and growing markets in the last decade. This paper builds a framework for analyzing and choosing effective business strategies across the divide between very different business systems and cultures. It assists western firms in how to enter these complex markets and increase the probability of success. Design/methodology/approach: the proposed conceptual model hinges on social networking theory. Three different strategies are presented based on the different cultural, political and historical settings of China and India. Findings: the paper builds a framework for India and China structured around three core attributes to building social networks. It shows what international firms need to do in-order to build social networks that allow access to the local markets and decrease business risks. Practical implications: the proposed conceptual models enable marketers to cope even with the most complex markets and improve their probability for success. Originality/value: the literature review demonstrates that researchers have not dealt in-depth with the social constructs of social networks, especially in India. The paper depicts the commonality and differences between the two countries and serves as a basic business model when penetrating these markets.

e020c974cc7b5e798bb38547a5f6e6be80e007fa	the cognitive sciences of cyber-security: a framework for advancing socio-cyber systems		Traditionally, cyber security has been positioned and developed primarily from a computational-technology perspective. Unfortunately, this has been rather short-sighted as it provided solutions that fail to consider many human-related, cognitive, and social factors that underlie solutions of significance. While there have been substantial contributions from technology development that help the overall problem, a more comprehensive and effective approach is now needed that: (a) explores cognitive sciences and collaborative systems as a substantial basis to reify discovery and prediction, (b) produces incisive research results that inform the design of cyber tools and interfaces for active use, and (c) establishes new understanding of cyber situation awareness wherein the distributed cognitive activities of users, dynamic and changing roles of the threat and the environment, collaborative teamwork, and the promise of innovative cognitive technologies are intertwined and realized. This chapter outlines the perspective of social-cyber systems, a transdisciplinary approach designed to enhance information protection, reduce errors and uncertainty, take advantage of teamwork, and facilitate insightful understanding of what awareness and collective induction means for cyber defense and security. The Living Laboratory Framework is used to describe our approach and to implement specific aspects of social-cyber system research that inform dimensions of awareness and induction. Cognitive explorations underlying cyber situation awareness are presented that involve entwining theoretical foundations, models and simulation, and problem formulation - with - ethnographies of practice, knowledge elicitation, design storyboarding and technology prototyping. Integration of these important elements provides the basis of expanding individual cognitive processing into collaborative teamwork and collective induction that afford the goals of obtaining readiness and resilience in social-cyber systems. Finally, the chapter looks towards what future requirements will be necessary to sustain efficacy in protecting valuable resources and services.		Michael D. McNeese;David L.

This paper discusses the development and use of ICT applications to tackle the problem. The paper begins with a review to existing research on the possibilities of the ICT in social inclusion of young people. Secondly, as a way forward, a multidisciplinary approach is suggested, which would combine perspectives from social sciences, information systems, human-computer interaction, information technology and electronic commerce. The suggested approach combines technological and economic parameters of ICT development with social factors related to wellbeing, quality of life, gender, cultural and social conditions, and community values of young people. Particular emphasis is put into involvement of young people themselves in the development and innovation of ICT applications suggesting that a user-driven approach and participatory methodology are crucial in the successful development of ICT based applications for young people.

There is a new view that knowledge market can be helpful to promote knowledge transfer by knowledge trade. Knowledge transfer could be activated through the items of knowledge organisation, knowledge strategy, KMS and knowledge reward via knowledge sharing culture and knowledge trade market. We have proposed that the framework should be organically related to the above factors in the prior research. This paper examined survey results and various cases to analyse the effects of knowledge trade market and knowledge culture for knowledge transfer. We then considered real case researches of the Korean organisations and global firms to discuss how each factor activates knowledge transfer. This discussion suggests that organisations should harmonise both knowledge culture and knowledge trade market for knowledge transfer.	knowledge management;management system	Jong-Chang Ahn;Soon-Ki Jeong	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-20621-9_13	public relations;organizational learning;knowledge economy;computer science;knowledge management;body of knowledge;management science;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain	AI	-83.11811194362055	1.3575528296318704	122268

With this in mind, developing countries have been rushing to implement ambitious ICT projects in rural areas through the direct-indirect supervision of institutions such as, the World Bank, United Nations (UN) and other donor/local agencies. The main focus of the interventions has been the implementation the ICT project, rather than understanding their impacts at the recipient level. This lack of understanding has led to many failures of ICT projects reported in the literature. We argue there is a need to understand impacts of ICT projects in their local context considering the participants’ perspectives at the micro (community) level. Hence, this paper reports on the development and refinement of an extended framework to investigate ICT impact on development in three village areas in the developing country, Bangladesh. Through an interpretive study we argue that previous studies fail to encapsulate many socio-economic aspects of ICT impact, such as mobility restrictions, attitudes towards women and religious influences, especially at the community level. Our extended framework demonstrates that ICT projects can lead to development, but only when such social constraints are addressed.	refinement (computing)	Md. Mahfuz Ashraf;Paul A.

Both are being used to help improve the delivery of healthcare, but rarely are they used together. This paper explores from a theoretical and an empirical perspective the potential complementary roles of DES and lean in healthcare. The aim is to increase the impact of both approaches in the improvement of healthcare systems. Out of this exploration, the ‘SimLean’ approach is developed in which three roles for DES with lean are identified: education, facilitation and evaluation. These roles are demonstrated through three examples of DES in action with lean. The work demonstrates how the fusion of DES with lean can improve both stakeholder engagement with DES and the impact of lean.	itil;lean software development;simulation	Stewart Robinson;Zoe J.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores the concept of knowledge reuse by providing a new model of information and knowledge consistent with neuroscience and the demands of CUCA, using this model as an analogy to explore the social context of knowledge mobilization with its process of collaborative entanglement, and looking at the concepts of knowledge robustness and sustainability from the viewpoints of individuals and the community. Findings – Knowledge mobilization is modeled after the associative network of neuronal firings in the human brain. The process of collaborative entanglement among experts and stakeholders not only helps provide specific solutions to current issues, but seeds the ground for continuous community improvement, collaboration, and sustainability. Practical implications – The paper provides practical ideas and techniques for communities and individuals to move toward knowledge sustainability. Originality/value – The paper develops a new frame of reference for looking at social knowledge mobilization and knowledge sustainability.	quantum entanglement	Alex Bennet;David Bennet	2008	J.

The two examples use the classification scheme as a structural research instrument in two different phases of investigation: in framing the collection of data and in the analysis of already existing data. The discussion is focussed on usability and the issues related to the classification scheme. We conclude that the proposed scheme is a workable instrument for studying complex information interactions with different kinds of research designs. The either premisory or post-collection use of the classification scheme was recognised to have effects on the classification outcome. The principal issues of using the scheme seemed to relate to the frequent overlap of the facets and the tendency of the classifications to be highly dependent on the perspectives of the study.	comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;faceted classification;framing (world wide web);interaction;structural analysis;usability	Isto Huvila;Gunilla Widén	2006		10.1145/1164820.1164850	computer science;knowledge management;evaluation;methodology;data mining;management science	Web+IR	-88.69317455344644	-2.072573390409204	122801
125d7d0acb6233b634f731551b739ca4ca8633b9	exploring the sustainable logistics innovation process		Purpose –The development of more sustainable logistics calls for innovative thinking. In order to accelerate the development in the field, there is a need for increased understanding of the process behind successful implementation of sustainable logistics innovations (SLI). The purpose of this paper is to explore the SLI process, in order to identify critical factors, challenges as well as actors involved. Design/methodology/approach – A multiple-case study in six Swedish retailers and LSPs, successful in SLI implementations, was conducted. Both within-case and cross-case analyses were applied. Findings –The SLI process consists of five phases. The positive relationship between formalisation and SLI success is supported. Critical activities and challenges not known from literature were found in each phase. Examples are the use of logistics and customer KPIs, quickness, developing simple concepts, using a sustainability business case template and selecting where to test SLIs. Some phases are involving many internal and external actors, while others involve few internal actors. Customers are not particularly involved, and retailers involve their LSP suppliers. Research implications – This study addresses the lack of empirical research in logistics innovation and has bridged the gap of innovation studies in other companies than in LSPs. Furthermore it has combined two developing areas, sustainable innovation and logistics innovation, into SLI. A number of critical activities and challenges, and complex patterns for actors’ involvement in the SLI process phases are explored as insights from particular cases; these results could be analytically generalised to theory. Practical implications – The practical implications lie in guiding managers who wish to improve sustainability and innovativeness in logistics and, consequently, business success. Knowledge from successful companies about which phases to go through in which sequence, which challenges that can be expected and who to include in the SLI process could imply that more companies focus on SLI. Societal implications Knowledge on how to include sustainability in a clear innovation process e.g. by making strong business cases, should imply an accelerated development of sustainable logistics in society. Originality/value – This study addresses the lack of empirically-based research in logistics innovation and expands the concept to retailers.	actor model;formal system;logistics;word lists by frequency	Maria Björklund;Helena Forslund	2018	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/IMDS-02-2017-0058	service provider;empirical research;implementation;performance indicator;marketing;process management;engineering;sustainable business;innovation management;sustainability;business case	HCI	-78.71705075224419	4.040584957603444	122913

Given the complexity of experimental designs to investigate the problem, agent-based modeling can provide hypotheses that can work as theoretical guidance for future research. The purpose of this paper is to identify human motivations and biases in group information processing relevant to modeling the group decision-making process, and to develop a conceptual framework of a computational model. In this paper, we reviewed the group information-processing literature to identify commonly observed human motivations and biases in information processing. Specifically, we provided an integrated framework by combining the hidden profile model, the motivated information-processing model, and the information asymmetries model. Finally, we provided a design of agents for future modeling of group processes, which uses empirical findings from the literature as the fundamental assumptions about agent behavior.	agent-based model;computation;computational model;design of experiments;information processing	Taehyon Choi	2012	2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2012.439	information asymmetry;group decision-making;information processing;behavioural sciences;computer science;knowledge management;reliability;conceptual framework;management science;design of experiments;computational model;group dynamics;statistics	Robotics	-87.76907396140156	-3.419951393521284	123374

Based on a dataset of 163 samples from China, social subsystem risk is empirically found to negatively influence crowdsourcing performance, whereas technical subsystem risk affects the performance insignificantly. The negative impact of social subsystem risk on performance is stronger than that of technical subsystem risk. These findings reveal that different types of risk have diverse roles in affecting performance. Moreover, we provide novel knowledge to existing literature by empirically indicating that different risk types interact with one another to influence performance. Technical subsystem risk particularly enhances the negative effect of social subsystem risk on performance. Therefore, crowdsourcers should develop systematic but different risk management strategies to mitigate the two risk types.	crowdsourcing;risk management	Fan Xia;Shan Liu;Jinlong Zhang	2015			simulation;economics;risk management;knowledge management;management;computer security	Metrics	-88.97813087820379	-3.936024471824706	123501

SST is used to analyze the structuration process at the micro-level and its impact on the structures at the meso/macro- level. In addition, actor network theory (ANT) is used to analyze the role of he- terogeneous actors in altering the structures as the actor network adapts to the technological innovations and changing contexts.	data assimilation;failure	Ravi Anand Rao;Rahul De'	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-38862-0_34	engineering;operations management;management;operations research	EDA	-78.60403485701379	0.4680666198344809	123861

This paper analyses the proliferation of these concepts along different disciplinary perspectives by tracing their evolution. The analysis reveals that organizational learning is a diffused; ill-defined concept with little consideration made for its practical application. Knowledge management on the other hand is a medley of different approaches but lack a unifying vision. As a result, it is difficult to establish synergistic relationship between these two concepts. An attempt is made to show how knowledge management models may be used to facilitate organizational learning. The models discussed include the Intellectual Capital Model, the Socially Constructed Model and the Knowledge Category Model. Each of these models is assessed in order to determine how they contribute towards the practical realization of organizational learning. The review shows that although these models differ in terms of how knowledge is perceived and in terms of the dynamics of learning involved, each of them has the capacity to contribute in unique ways towards organizational learning. The paper proposes that attempts to seek synergistic relationships that link organizational learning and knowledge management should be examined more closely to facilitate the practical realization of organizational learning.	knowledge management	Rumesh Kumar Sharma	2003	JIKM	10.1142/S021964920300053X	organizational network analysis;organizational safety;organizational commitment;organizational learning;organizational behavior and human resources;computer science;knowledge management;organizational studies;management science;active learning;personal knowledge management;meaning;management;organizational space;organization development;organizational behavior management;measurement	AI	-78.69601957847163	-0.8076446103738539	123878

Drawing upon service science studies and Chinese m-government context, a research model is constructed by extending the technology acceptance model (TAM). Data collected from a field survey of 326 m-government users are analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results indicate that perceived value is strongly influenced by mobility, perceived usefulness and security, which is, in turn, significant impact on satisfaction and trust in technology, trust in agent and trust in government. These results contribute to drawing attention to the important role of perceived value in m-government continuance use and providing a new view that supplements to the extant technology acceptance research.

There is now an increasing reliance on PBL concepts to define and monitor contractual relationships in both public and private industry. Successful PBL relationships are certainly faced with a number of challenges and difficulties. As uncovered by the work of Sols, Verma, and Nowicki [Eng Management J 19(2) (June 2007), 40–50], the principle impediment to a successful PBL outcome is the proper formulation and mutual understanding, between supplier and customer, of the underlying financial reward/penalty model central to any PBL arrangement. The current state of the literature focuses on compensation structures based on only a single performance metric, which in most cases is insufficient to properly capture, reward, and penalize the supplier’s performance. Instead, it is imperative to define and monitor multiple Regular Paper *Author to whom all correspondence should be addressed (e-mail: alberto.sols@electroop.es; David.Nowicki@stevens.edu; Dinesh.

1c9a79a65c8fc546f3bdee7d3fa75ddbaade2e2e	the well-informed city: a decentralized, bottom-up model for a smart city service using information and self-organization	bottom up;complexity;open data;self organization;smart city;information	Smart Cities, a concept widely growing in popularity, describes cities that use digital technology, data analysis and connectivity to create value. The basic abstraction of a Smart City service includes collecting data about an urban issue, transmitting it to a central decision making process and “improving” the city with the insights generated. This model has spurred much critique, claiming Smart Cities are undemocratic, discriminatory and cannot significantly improve citizen's quality of life. But what if the citizens were active in the process? It was Jane Jacobs who said “Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.” In this paper we lay a conceptual groundwork to envision “The Well-Informed City” - a decentralized, self-organizing Smart City service, where the value is created by everybody. The agents, who are the citizens of the city, are the ones who use the data to create value. We base the model on the cities' feature of Self-Organization as described in the domain of Complexity Theory of Cities. We demonstrate its theoretical possibility, describe a short case study and finish with suggestions for future empirical research. This work is highly significant due to the ubiquitous nature of contemporary mobile based information services and growing open data sets.	complex adaptive system;digital electronics;jane (software);organizing (structure);self-organization;smart city;transmitter;what if;whole earth 'lectronic link	Eyal Feder-Levy;Efrat Blumenfeld-Lieberthal;Juval Portugali	2016	2016 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)	10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580767	public relations;simulation;engineering;management science	HCI	-77.93628615834857	-9.309057341335498	125008

Organizations need to understand the myriad of issues that will determine the success of mobile work. These issues can be best studied from the socio-technical perspective in order to gain a holistic understanding of mobile work. The premise of the socio-technical theory is that the social and technical systems are interdependent and must be jointly optimized in order to determine the best overall solution for the organization. Based upon the information gleaned from structured interviews conducted with the Chief Information Officers (CIO) of ten organizations, this study identifies the primary elements of the social and technical subsystems related to mobile work. Additionally, the study provides a list of recommendations for organizations in order to improve their mobile work environment using the socio-technical perspective.	sociotechnical system	Lei-da Chen;Ravi Nath	2008	Information, Knowledge, Systems Management		engineering;knowledge management;operations management;management science	HCI	-79.88341044801966	-5.303396555242629	125189

Information systems (IS) innovation, in particular, has become the main focus for many businesses and their CIOs because of its potential for business agility and competitiveness. However, creating a culture that can effectively exploit the innovative forces of an organization is challenging, and no shared guidelines exist. The purpose here is to examine empirically how the competing forces of organizational cultures in tandem with senior executives constructively influence the innovative efforts of organizations. Central to this investigation is the adoption of an IS architecture (SOA) whose implementation may entail radical transformation of traditional business patterns. Data were collected from U.S. top IS executives, and the results suggest that the adopters of SOA (45%) are organizations whose executives embrace certain collaborative behavior, which, in people-oriented and progress-oriented cultures, seems to be a catalyst for change and adoption of transformational IS architecture..	dbpedia;information system;service innovation	Sibylle Mabry	2010	IJEA	10.4018/jea.2010040101	public relations;organizational culture;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;management	AI	-79.45967947236757	2.980195844433308	125215

We examine this adoption behavior by utilizing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) that provides an integrative view of user acceptance. We found that performance and effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions all positively impact the use of the ICT.

MCPs enable users to exchange messages with unlimited images and videos free of charge and support group chat functions to enhance their communication productivity. Understanding the mechanisms underlying a user's continued use can help MCP providers increase their profits and revenue in the highly competitive MCP market. For a deeper understanding of continued MCP use, this study develops an integrated framework clarifying the effects of user loyalty and nonconscious inertia on the continued use. The results identify the user satisfaction, perceived value and trust in an MCP provider as key enablers accelerating user's post-adoption behaviour. In addition, the study examines the effects of perceived switching costs and habits on inertia. The empirical test results based on the partial least squares with data from 262 experienced users of KaKaoTalk indicate that user loyalty mediated the effect of inertia on continuance use. The results verify the salient power of user satisfaction and trust beliefs on user loyalty. The analysis results show differential effects of four dimensions of perceived value on user's post-adoption behaviour. Setup costs, learning costs and habit encouraged inertia development.

Agile methods have emphasized the relevance of social skills for an efficient and sustainable interaction of individuals. At the same time, employing companies have to provide working conditions which attract and support teams of high skilled and demanding software engineers.  In this paper, we evaluate the efforts of IT companies in acquiring software engineers by emphasizing socialness in their job ads. We analyze 75,000 jobs ads from the recruiting platform Indeed to quantify differences in the regional distribution of social factors, and about 2,800 job ads from StackoverflowCareers to investigate correlations between social factors and the employee satisfaction of a work place. Our findings show that many companies advertise socialness explicitly by aspects as extraordinary food offers, a great team, social events, a game room, or family friendliness. Well-established standard benefits such as health care, paid vacation, or retirement savings are non-unique job characteristics. Advanced jobs allow for higher degrees of freedom concerning the location and time of work being advertised by flextime, remote work, or unlimited vacation.	agile software development;job stream;relevance;software engineer;telecommuting	Jens Ehlers	2015		10.1145/2742854.2742879	public relations;simulation;engineering;operations management	HCI	-85.59622754350558	-3.641057602583529	126152

The integration of divergent cultures is crucial to maintain the performance of merged organizations. This paper examines post-merger IT integration of a Taiwan’s financial holding company which merged a government owned bank with its banking business, and argues that the understanding of IT culture conflict between two merged departments can contribute to effective post-merger IT integration. This paper identifies three types of IT culture conflict occurring in IT integration, and then discusses how to resolve IT culture conflict in post-merger IT integration. We assert that IT department can resume the productivity once IT culture conflict can be identified and resolved even IT infrastructure and processes of merging organizations are incompatible.

Thus two cases in Africa, Cape Verde, a small island of 500,000 inhabitants off the coast of Senegal in west Africa and South Africa, an emerging African country of 40 million inhabitants demonstrate that following the example of many governments around the world, Information and communication technologies have been used in the last decades to improve public service delivery and the operations of government. While these so called e-Government programs have started to yield significant benefits in terms of convenience, efficiency and service quality for citizens, businesses and public agencies alike, new trends are emerging which involve more than applying the technologies than promoting social and economic inclusiveness and furthering participation and democracy at large. This paper elaborates on key lessons learnt from Cape Verde and South Africa on the one hand, and envisages how those two countries and the African continent could still harness the new opportunities for deepening reform in public service delivery and citizen engagement on the other hand.	e-governance;e-government;itil;information;quality of service;visualizing energy resources dynamically on the earth	Pierre Dandjinou	2007		10.1145/1328057.1328148	geography;environmental protection;environmental resource management;economic growth	HCI	-78.62923607903572	-8.367466884136235	126264

To address this, drawing on information processing theory, this study proposes an integrated model that delineates the relationships among two design variables, risk resolution strategy, and software development success. Experimental design was conducted to test the model. Our results show that risk resolution strategy has a positive effect on software success. As expected, software projects with low goal conflict exhibit better performance of risk resolution strategy, productivity, and process satisfaction than projects with high goal conflict. In addition, organic coordination strategy demonstrates better achievement of risk management, productivity, and process satisfaction than those with mechanistic coordination strategy. Regarding the interaction effect, surprisingly, the findings show the effects on both risk management and process satisfaction are insignificant. Further, as expected the interaction effect on productivity is significant.

6ffd70f9a6669a09b0afb3720035f310eda2a1ed	enhancing the government service experience through qr codes on mobile platforms		Abstract Digital government is universally gaining acceptance as the public becomes more technologically advanced. It is critical for the government to embrace new technology for minimizing costs and maximizing utility of services to the taxpayers. While administrative services have been easily ported to the digital world, there are still many important citizen-centric services that have not yet been effectively migrated. Quick Response codes (QR codes) provide a means to effectively distribute many different varieties of information to the public. We propose to integrate QR code systems and corresponding smartphone applications into existing government services with the goal of providing a new level of interactivity for the public. We illustrate this through two case studies, examining the National Park Services and the Mobile Environmental Information Services (MENVIS). The focus is on developing a QR code waypoint system for park navigation, as well as incentivizing park use through gamification of site attractions. The system provides increased safety for park goers, disseminates information more effectively and accurately, and improves feedback.	database;e-government;interactivity;mobile device;qr code	David Lorenzi;Jaideep Vaidya;Soon Ae Chun;Basit Shafiq;Vijayalakshmi Atluri	2014	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2013.05.025	simulation;management;world wide web;computer security	DB	-81.03747440509629	-9.005089092694389	126975

The purpose of this study is to discuss the willingness to pay (WTP) for commercialization and creativity of cultural heritage. However, no general market price for cultural heritage exists. Thus, the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) in the non-market valuation method was applied to determine whether commercialization and creativity of cultural heritage through a personally inherent attitude and through different preferences could analyze the tourists’ willingness to pay, and to consider the factors that influence their WTP. In this study, 410 subjects were used for the CVM construction of the WTP based on three situations when cultural heritage and creativity are combined, as well as in the application of the double-bounded dichotomous choice model of survival analysis to estimate the WTP-influencing factors. The results showed that the higher the income of the subject, the higher of WTP for value-added services for preserving cultural heritage, participating in activities, and helping local development.	viewpoint	Phanee Thipwong;Chung-Te Ting;Yu-Sheng Huang;Yun-Zu Chen;Wan-Tran Huang	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-70942-0_49	environmental economics;valuation (finance);cultural industry;willingness to pay;added value;cultural heritage;contingent valuation;local economic development;market price;business	HCI	-90.22244248691298	-8.76174379473798	127056

Ourania Deimezi is Internet Executive at the traveldailynews.com in Athens. She graduated from the MSc in eTourism at the University of Surrey. Abstract Electronic commerce revolutionises both global economies and marketplace. A number of developed countries have demonstrated clear leadership in eCommerce, as demonstrated by the level of ICT penetration in organisations and households. However, traditional economies have experienced a much slower uptake of eCommerce. This is attributed to difficulties in enhancing the usage of personal computers and in increasing the utilisation of the Internet and Information Communications Technologies (ICTs) throughout their production mechanisms. This paper concentrates on Greece and demonstrates a number of indicators that synthesise the level of eCommerce penetration. The Greek economy is going through a major transformation and ICTs may be instrumental in its international competitiveness. The paper provides a comprehensive overview from both the production/supply (macro and micro) and consumption/demand sides. It focuses on the level of ICT penetration in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and concludes that eCommerce in Greece is still in its infancy. The paper provides essential background information for enterprises and policy makers interested in eCommerce in Greece and the competitiveness of the country in general.	competitive analysis (online algorithm);e-commerce payment system;embedded system;internet;knowledge base;online and offline;personal computer;point of view (computer hardware company);user (computing)	Dimitrios Buhalis;Ourania Deimezi	2003	Electronic Markets	10.1080/1019678032000135563	superconducting magnetic energy storage;e-commerce;the internet;computer science;marketing;operations management;law;information technology;commerce	AI	-81.9624742351809	-7.3084163243299205	127141

Therefore, workforce planning and policies that minimize the voluntary turnover of IT professionals are important. Using cognitive dissonance theory as a theoretical foundation, we propose and test research hypotheses that combine traditional voluntary turnover constructs with constructs of interest to the IT profession. Data are collected from a sample of 179 IT workers in one agency within a large multi-agency governmental organization. These initial results indicate skill-set obsolescence and fairness of rewards are direct antecedents of job satisfaction. Organizational commitment, job alternatives, and perceived workload directly impact turnover intention, but job satisfaction impacts turnover intention only when mediated by organizational commitment.	fairness measure	Sherry D.

The findings of this exploratory research further extend strategic alignment research and provide a deeper understanding of the process of ITbusiness strategic alignment. A theoretical model of the maturity levels of the management practices and strategic IT choices that enable alignment was empirically tested. A survey was conducted of 116 IT and business executives from ten business units across seven organizations. Confirmatory factor analysis validated six factors of maturity (Communications, Competency and Value Measurement, Governance, Partnership, Scope and Architecture, and Skills) and identified 23 criteria to measure the maturity of strategic alignment. A mixed model repeated measures ANOVA obtained significant results for both the main effect and interaction effect of differences for the six maturity factors across the ten business units.

The use of social theories in general and their use in information systems research in particular is explored leading to the use of the framework to examine the concept of what are termed humanchine networks in the context of clinical audit, within a healthcare Primary Care Trust. A particular focus is on the manner in which information systems based reflexivity contributes to both entrenching a networks’ structurated order as well as contributing to its emancipatory change. The case study compares clinic-centric and patient-centric audit and seeks to further extend the understanding of the role of information and information systems within structurated humanchine activity systems. Conclusions indicate that the use of more socially informed IS methods and approaches can incorporate more emancipatory ideals and lead to greater adoption and usage of more relevant and useful clinical information systems and practices.	html5 in mobile devices;information systems research;information system;systems theory	Laurence D.

A framework is created to deal with the contradictions, antagonisms and paradoxes caused by the inherent differences, which exist between the different stakeholders and the confrontation of multiple strategies between them. Based on the principles of a strategy of trust, developed from an in-depth analysis of the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the method’s originality lies in describing all the interpersonal interactions in a complex situation by making an inventory of the fears, attractions, temptations (FAcTs) that the participants could feel in relation to one another. With a new, common representation of the problem, the stakeholders develop structured recommendations, leading to processes of empowerment and co-operative action.

We introduce design principles as a new methodological approach to address this problem. Design principles extend the notion of design rationales that document how a design decision emerged. We extend the concept of design rationales by using theoretical hypotheses to support or object to design decisions. At the example of developing a new conceptual modeling grammar we demonstrate two main benefits of using design principles. First, the link between theory and design decision enables the design researcher to reason about the resulting behavior of the IT artifact prior to instantiation. Second, design principles allow deducing empirically testable hypotheses to foster the rigorous evaluation of IT artifacts.	design rationale;theory;universal instantiation	Michael Schermann;Andreas Gehlert;Helmut Krcmar;Klaus Pohl	2009			idef6;computer science;design elements and principles;software engineering;management science;design rationale;theory	HCI	-77.4831767500933	-1.920607100811444	128115

Although numerous case studies and evaluations show the contribution public venues can make to socio-economic development within certain contexts, the body of research provides a fragmented view of outcomes and impacts of public access ICTs in general. This paper uses a broad outcomes approach to review existing research on the impacts of public access to ICTs, including the extent to which public access ICTs are used and how they contribute to socio-economic development. We find that most research adds primarily to the body of knowledge on public access ICT operational conditions, users and uses. While some insights are provided into what may be classified as outcomes and impacts, there is relatively limited hard evidence at this level.	library (computing)	Araba Sey;Michelle Fellows	2011		10.1145/1940761.1940787	public relations;engineering;knowledge management;economic growth	HCI	-78.45713599163788	-6.790647706798952	128242
e5e2d071be65cc33f1796d0759325afeda0dc71d	security and privacy risks in electronic communications: a user's assessment		Most research today in electronic communications focuses on developing new technologies and “best practices” to enhance security and privacy. However, these technologies and best-practice codes are all too often not used, and in this failure the users are often their own worst enemies. It is thus important to develop an enhanced understanding of why users indicate concern about security and privacy, but when given the opportunity act contrary to their stated intention. We collect data from 435 participants about 24 electronic activities with a survey and a mixed effects model. We find a significant inverse relationship between their assessed risk and benefit (recognizing that the particular technology matters where some technologies are inherently perceived as more risky than others). This significant inverse relationship represents a departure from decision theories that assume purely cognitive information processing, and the separation of the probabilities and the utilities. We shed light on the role of affect, which commonly competes with cognition, and works as an orienting mechanism in security and privacy behaviors, and discuss business and policy implications of our findings.	best practice;code;cognition;decision theory;information processing;mental model;privacy	Fariborz Farahmand;Joshua A Ripple;Mikhail J.

This paper argues that a metatheory can reduce theoretical confusion. Ideas from the philosophy of the social sciences are used to develop a metatheory of e-government consisting of three dimensions: explaining/understanding, holism/individualism and change/maintenance. This metatheory is used to analyze a corpus of papers on e-government in both journals on public administration and information systems. The analysis of the 116 papers shows a bias towards explaining e-government (rather than understanding social constructions), analyzing holistic systems (rather than the behavior, attitudes and cognitions of individual actors) and studying incremental rather than transformational change. We conclude that the value of the metatheory lies in (1) facilitating debate about e-government between researchers with different perspectives, (2) enabling researchers to be clear about their social science perspective, and (3) developing educational programs that bring in various scientific perspectives.	conceptualization (information science);e-government;fragmentation (computing);organizing (structure);systematic review	Albert Jacob Meijer;Victor Bekkers	2015	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2015.04.006	metatheory;philosophy of science;social science;e-government;computer science;knowledge management;management science;sociology;management	Theory	-78.00355798153407	-2.036926422242122	128841
7b0e98e580b0dd85f92503bcc7247b129312f6f1	mobile device perceptions: differences in environment-based voluntariness		In order to complete work tasks, individuals are constantly engaging in new technologies that allow them to connect to the work place from locations and at time periods which in the past were not possible. The increased ubiquity of information and communication technologies, in particular the use of mobile devices has coincidentally increased the number of hours employees are spending on work related tasks. The research agenda of this paper is focused on post adoption and proposes that individuals who are required to use mobile devices and those who voluntarily use them will have differing perceptions on mobile device usage, usefulness, work overload, flexibility and, work-life conflict. Secondary data from a previous study, consisting of data from 185 working individuals of various demographics was analyzed. The results suggest different perceptions between the groups. The findings have practical importance as managers and firms consider supplying mobile devices to employees.	mobile device	Wiley S.

Notwithstanding the contributions of research to date, our knowledge of how culture influences-and is influenced by-the development and use processes and an information system itself remains fragmented. Knowledge fragmentation is amplified by the fact that conceptualizations of culture differ among researchers. Indeed, most researchers agree that culture consists of patterns of meaning underlying a variety of manifestations. Researchers diverge, however, on the degree of consensus on these interpretations that they assume to be reached within a collective. In order to integrate these divergent conceptualizations of culture, we adopt the view that no single perspective is sufficient to capture the complexity of interplay between culture, the processes of developing and using an IS, and the IS itself. We have, therefore, adopted a conceptualization that views culture from three perspectives-integration, differentiation, and fragmentation-that come into play simultaneously and jointly. Using this conceptualization, the paper synthesizes what is known about the role of culture in IS initiatives, and proposes a model of the relationships between culture, the development and use processes, and an information system.	information system	Antonio Kappos;Suzanne Rivard	2006	MIS Quarterly		psychology;social science;computer science;operations management;fragmentation;sociology;differentiation;management;social psychology;information system;culture	HCI	-78.82695893465706	-1.8434101503880773	129408
06f0eac2f72c8360399dc742d4360de95383a923	service-channel fit conceptualization and instrument development - a mixed methods study in the context of electronic banking		Electronically mediated self-service technologies in the banking industry have impacted the way banks service consumers. Despite a large body of research on electronic banking channels, no study has been undertaken to empirically explore the fit between electronic banking channels and banking services. To address this gap, we developed and validated a servicechannel fit conceptualization and an associated survey instrument. We applied a mixed methods approach and initially investigated industry experts’ perceptions regarding the concept of ‘service-channel fit’ (SCF). The findings demonstrated that the concept was highly valued by bank managers. Next, we developed an instrument to measure the perceived service-channel fit of electronic banking channels. The instrument was developed using expert rounds and two pretests involving approximately 300 consumers in New Zealand. Drawing on IS alignment literature, we created a parallel instrument allowing us to calculate SCF across three unique fit dimensions, including service complexity-channel fit, service importance-channel fit, and service routineness-channel fit. To explore the nomological validity of the SCF construct, we linked SCF to customers’ intention to use a specific channel for a particular banking task. We tested our model with data from 340 consumers in New Zealand using Internet banking applications for two different banking tasks. The results of our study have theoretical and practical implications for how clients should be serviced through electronically mediated banking channels.	conceptualization (information science);online banking	Hartmut Hoehle;Thomas Kude;Sid L.

dc9c296c6bd6ca06b59b5b2e9e448700b05d3969	a stakeholder model of organizational leadership	new business practices;leadership;complexity;effectiveness;stakeholder theory	Organizations are evolving from the bureaucratic form based upon hierarchy to the new-form or radix organization that has the value chain as its relatively fluid foundation. This article explores the relationship between the radix organization and leadership, viewed through an organization-environment coevolution framework. It explicates the changes in the leader’s role-sets and relationships brought about with the evolution from bureaucracy to the radix organization, developing a model of leadership that is referred to as the stakeholder model of organizational leadership. Stakeholder theory provides the appropriate theoretical basis for this model, as it offers the flexibility to accommodate various leader relationships. The stakeholder model of organizational leadership helps to predict leader effectiveness in organizations characterized by fuzzy organizational boundaries, flattened hierarchies, and work relationships sometimes brought about through contracts instead of employment. (Leadership; Stakeholder Theory; New Business Practices; Complexity; Effectiveness) Organizations are experiencing an unprecedented rate of environmental change due to such forces as globalization, rapid transformation and dissemination of technologies, and movement toward market-based socioeconomic systems. According to early organization-environment theories based on the principle of requisite variety (Ashby 1952), an organization’s survival depends on its adaptation to environmental changes. More recent theorizing transcends this view, highlighting that organizations also effect environmental change (Lewin et al. 1999, Pfeffer and Salancick 1978). Specifically, through their exploration activities (March 1991) individual firms develop new practices that may influence various levels of their environments (Dijksterhuis et al. 1999). One of the manifestations of organizational change is movement from bureaucracy toward a new organizational form, referred to here as the radix organization or the radix. This term, which means root or foundation in Latin, provides a meaningful critical contrast with bureaucracy. Radix stresses the organization’s foundation which must meet the challenges of fluctuating vertical, lateral, and external demands, while bureaucracy has come to connote a more narrow emphasis on relatively less fluctuating vertical demands. Just as bureaucracy is an umbrella term encompassing a wealth of related organizational forms, so too is the radix organization. Its related forms share a conceptualization of the organization’s foundation as a value chain, the primary and support activities that create value for customers (Denison 1997). The magnitude of the change associated with the radix has not been seen since the industrial revolution and the emergence of bureaucracy (Victor and Stephens 1994). This article revisits Daft and Lewin’s (1993) challenge for theory regarding the new-form organization. It addresses the research question: How do recent changes associated with the new-form or radix organization affect the practice of leadership? Leadership theories have assumed that the leader has power over those being led, specifically institutionalized power or authority. Changing business practices have blurred the concept of authority and the distinction between management and nonmanagement personnel. Can an organizational leader be effective with no reliance on institutionalized power or authority? Indeed, can one be an organizational leader but have no authority? It has also been assumed that the domain of organizational members is largely internal, and that relatively few members are in boundary-spanning roles (Thompson 1967). However, many members in the radix organization are in boundary-spanning roles. Can an organizational leader’s institutionalized power extend to those outside the leader’s hierarchical domain, including those outside the leader’s organization? In the attempt to answer these questions, recent theorizing regarding the radix organization is reviewed. A model is developed in which organizational leadership is MARGUERITE SCHNEIDER Stakeholder Leadership Model 210 ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/Vol. 13, No. 2, March–April 2002 shown to both respond to, and induce, environmental change. Stakeholder theory is drawn upon as the basis for the new nonhierarchical conceptualization of leadership, referred to as the stakeholder model of organizational leadership, as stakeholders may include those inside the firm or outside of it, with no assumption of managerial authority over stakeholders. A review of business practices associated with the radix is next presented, from which it is determined that we are witnessing the relative decline of traditional managerial authority in leader relationships and a concomitant increase in alternate types of authority. In the radix organization, authority tends to mean power to guide cooperation for task accomplishment, rather than power to direct the actions of a predefined group of persons within the organization. This is a change from “power-over” or authority of command, to “power-to,” the ability to implement (Ackoff 1993, p. 26). Propositions are developed regarding leader effectiveness, based on the changes in the leader’s role-sets and relationships that occur with migration to the radix organization. The stakeholder model of organizational leadership contributes to the management literature. It is aligned with ongoing organizational trends in which leaders increasingly rely on nonhierarchical relationships, and in which leaders may or may not be managers. The model extends the application of stakeholder theory, which has traditionally been applied at the firm’s executive level, to individual leaders at various organizational levels. The model also incorporates and extends research regarding leader complexity to the radix organization. Leadership and the Coevolution of Organizations and Environments Leadership is one of the most widely studied constructs in the management field (Bass 1981, Yukl 1994), and has many definitions. It will be defined here as “. . . influential increment over and above mechanical compliance with routine direction of the organization” (Katz and Kahn 1966, p. 302), connoting leadership with organizational change. This article will focus on the relatively unexplored relationship of organizational leadership with supraorganizational change, through adaptation of the coevolution framework (Lewin et al. 1999). The coevolution framework transcends previous theories. While theories such as population ecology and resource-based theory contribute to our understanding, they are single-themed and fragmented, placing insufficient emphasis on how environmental change may emerge from the organizational level (Lewin and Volberda 1999). Organizational change may indeed beget environmental change—and organizational leadership is instrumental in this process. The environmental force of information technology can be traced to firms such as Apple, Microsoft, and AOL, whose influence is inextricably linked to the leadership of Jobs, Gates, and Case, respectively. Globalization intensified through the transformational leadership of Branson of Virgin, Barnevik of ABB, and Simon of British Petroleum (Kets de Vries and Florent-Treacy 1999). And Toyota’s production system, spearheaded by its leadership, came to serve as a model for Japanese industry and the world (Womack and Jones 1996). The new-form or radix organization reflects the transition from the industrial to the postindustrial or knowledge-based age. The industrial age was characterized by the conventional wisdom that land, labor, and capital were the factors of production. The transition to the postindustrial age has brought to the forefront a factor of production—knowledge—which is critically different from the others. Land, labor, and capital are subject to diminishing returns; i.e., the output associated with greater use of the factor increases at a decreasing rate. Knowledge is not subject to decreasing returns; output associated with it instead increases at an increasing rate (Reich 1992). This implies that we have little experience upon which to understand this factor; indeed, our experience with other factors may be a hindrance here. Due to automation, a better-educated workforce, and other determinants, in advanced economies the human factor of production is largely shifting from labor, those who are employed to do as told, to human capital, those who are employed to think (Pfeffer 1996). The earlier distinction between managers/leaders and other employees has disappeared somewhat with the migration to the postindustrial age. For example, quality circles and other new practices are based upon the assumption that those who perform a function are capable of thinking about how to improve the function, and should be empowered to do so for the benefit of the organization. An implication, which is similar to that of the point above, is that relationships between manager/leaders and other employees have changed, and that use of industrial-age models may exacerbate rather than alleviate current problems. While knowledge is created by the firm’s human capital, individual employees are not the sole influence in knowledge creation. Knowledge might instead be the property of a collective, such as a team, in which it is generated and shared across members. The firm’s social capital, based upon its trusting relationships or networks, MARGUERITE SCHNEIDER Stakeholder Leadership Model ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/Vol. 13, No. 2, March–April 2002 211 also influences knowledge creation. Indeed, the acquisition and exploitation of knowledge are predominately social processes (Kogut and Zander 1992). The firm’s ability to generate social capital, and thus generate collective knowledge, is related to its structure, culture, and processes, its intangible assets or resources.

We investigate how specific characteristics of service level agreements (SLAs) impact relational governance in information technology outsourcing relationships. Eleven contractual elements (categorized into three SLA characteristics: foundation, change, and governance characteristics) are hypothesized to act as complements of three relational governance attributes: relational norms, harmonious conflict resolution, and mutual dependence. Data for the study were collected through a survey of South Korean IT executives. Results of the study support the fundamental proposition of complementarity between formal contracts and relational governance, and indicate that well-structured SLAs have significant positive influence on the various aspects of relational governance in IT outsourcing relationships. However, the study also reveals that change characteristics of SLAs may act as a substitute for relational governance as these characteristics were found to dampen the level of trust and commitment through moderation effects. Overall, the findings support the proposition that well-developed SLAs not only MIS Quarterly Vol. 33 No. 1, pp. 119-145/March 2009 119 Goo et al./SLAs in Relational Management of IT Outsourcing provide a way to measure the service provider’s performance, but also enable effective management of outsourcing engagements through the development of partnership-style relationships with high levels of trust and commitment.	categorization;complement (complexity);complementarity theory;grey goo;outsourcing;service-level agreement	Jahyun Goo;Rajiv Kishore;H.

Three perspectives were investigated to achieve this purpose. Firstly, the overall research interactions were analyzed to identify the dominant driving forces in advancing the development of N&N. Secondly, the knowledge diffusion intensity between N&N and nano-related subjects was investigated to determine the areas most closely related to N&N. Thirdly, the diffusion speed was identified to detect the time distance of knowledge diffusion between N&N and nano-related subjects. The analysis reveals that driving forces from the outside environment rather than within N&N itself make the foremost contributions to the development of N&N. From 1998 to 2007, Material Science, Physics, Chemistry, N&N, Electrical & Electronic and Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering are the key contributory and reference subjects for N&N. Knowledge transfer within N&N itself is the quickest. And the speed of knowledge diffusion from other subjects to N&N is slower than that from N&N to other subjects, demonstrating asymmetry of knowledge diffusion in the development of N&N. The results indicate that N&N has matured into a relatively open, diffuse and dynamic system of interactive subjects.	center for computational innovations;citation analysis;diffuse reflection;dynamical system;foremost;gnu nano;interaction	Guang Yu;Ming-Yang Wang;Daren Yu	2009	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-009-0090-2	computer science;dynamical system;citation analysis;world wide web	ML	-91.99397056455241	-0.3379922517563908	129737

However, these initiatives have proved to be difficult to implement and important challenges have been identified in previous studies. Existing literature deals with challenges and enablers as important success factors for inter-organizational information sharing initiatives. Most of this research is based on cases and there are few quantitative empirical studies about this topic. Based on a national survey of government managers in two policy domains, this study starts filling this gap by systematically identifying some important determinants of the success of inter-organizational information sharing initiatives through quantitative empirical analysis. Our analysis suggests four factors as the key determinants of inter-organizational information sharing success. We found that the following variables are statistically significant and clearly influence the success of inter-organizational information sharing initiatives: (1) availability of financial resources, (2) formally appointed project managers, (3) technical compatibility and (4) standards. As mentioned before, this is one of the first quantitative explorations and testing of success factors of inter-organizational information sharing in government settings and additional research is clearly needed.

These invade both the qualitative and quantitative information co-joined to create outcomes for policy and management in all the STEEPV (Social, Technological, Economic, Ecology, Politics and Values and Norms) themes. FTA then becomes an imaginative projection of current knowledge in which formal methods/techniques play a subsidiary role following Wittgenstein's dictum that ‘methods pass the problem by’. These contentious matters form a platform for discussion, concluding that FTA's practical outcomes are underlain by human behaviour, subsumed under subjective opinion in many dimensions and will be more so as FTA becomes involved with technologies of great social and commercial complexity.

E-Readiness assessments, for various countries, are associated with the investigation of their state of readiness for such integration. They help in understanding the problems that need to be resolved in order to avoid digital divide, or even digital isolation, from world development. Such assessments lack standard policies, which provide unified measures that ease evaluations, support analysis and comparisons, and help in diagnosing problems and deriving solutions. This paper is concerned with the development of a standard e-readiness assessment policy. It provides a base for the development of such a policy, and hopes that this base will contribute to a future standard international policy.

Such systems impose frameworks and structures upon the cognitive decision making process to a greater or lesser extent, requiring the developer to anticipate, if consideration is given at all, the ethical questions that the decision maker might face. However, the level of research in DSS ethics is disturbingly low. We turn to the area of medical decision support where the four bio-ethical principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy and justice have been identified as a useful framework for ethical medical DSS. We believe this framework is useful for DSS in general, and present a call to arms for further research into DSS ethics.	british informatics olympiad;call to arms;coat of arms;decision support system;mike lesser	Rob Meredith;David Arnott	2003			computer science;knowledge management;management science;management;social psychology	HCI	-80.52910685987825	-2.977906022741637	130361

England has attempted to introduce nationally procured EHR software--the first country in the world to do so. In this qualitative comparative case study tracing local developments over time we sought to generate a detailed picture of the implementation landscape characterising this first attempt at implementing nationally procured software through studying three purposefully selected hospitals. Despite differences in relation to demographic considerations and local implementation strategies, implementing hospitals faced similar technical and political challenges. These were coped with differently by the various organisations and individual stakeholders, their responses being shaped by contextual contingencies. We conclude that national implementation efforts need to allow effective technology adoption to occur locally before considering larger-scale interoperability. This should involve the allocation of sufficient time for individual users and organisations to adjust to the complex changes that often accompany such service re-design initiatives.	attempt;electronic health records;interoperability;large;sociotechnical system	Kathrin M.

20f5159580d6fefa49535e5a4280ab9ea4c9a60f	smart city and smart government: synonymous or complementary?	e government;open government;smart governance;smart city;smart government	Smart City is an emerging and multidisciplinary domain. It has been recently defined as innovation, not necessarily but mainly through information and communications technologies (ICT), which enhance urban life in terms of people, living, economy, mobility and governance. Smart government is also an emerging topic, which attracts increasing attention from scholars who work in public administration, political and information sciences. There is no widely accepted definition for smart government, but it appears to be the next step of e-government with the use of technology and innovation by governments for better performance. However, it is not clear whether these two terms coexist or concern different domains. The aim of this paper is to investigate the term smart government and to clarify its meaning in relationship to the smart city. In this respect this paper performed a comprehensive literature review analysis and concluded that smart government is shown not to be synonymous with smart city. Our findings show that smart city has a dimension of smart government, and smart government uses smart city as an area of practice. The authors conclude that smart city is complimentary, part of larger smart government movement.	coexist (image);e-government;information science;smart city	Leonidas G. Anthopoulos;Christopher G.

The main argument focuses on the reasons for system failure and how they relate to the diversity of knowledge and the understanding gaps that may exist between the business customers and the system developers.Findings – The study reveals that the understanding gaps mainly result from lack of business operations knowledge on the developer side, matched by lack of technical appreciation and knowledge on the user side.Originality/value – A practical approach using ...

The authors identified anticorruption capabilities of e-procurement through an extensive literature review and a theoretical model representing the impact of three latent variables: monopoly of power, information asymmetry, and transparency and accountability upon the dependent variable, the intent-to-adopt e-procurement. This research was guided by the PrincipalAgent theory and collected the perceptions of 46 government officers of the potential of public e-procurement to reduce corruption in public procurement processes. Results were analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. The findings suggest that the intent-to-adopt e-procurement has a positive and significant relationship with the independent variables that might inform developing countries in strategies to combat corruption in public procurement.

d41cc7da63884422a0a0fcb33bbccdaeb42793ac	e-government for national forest parks in greece		Electronic government services strengthen the internal market and complement European Union legislative acts and their effectiveness in a number of domains where ICT can improve delivery of services. Today, there has been observed an increasing interest in applying electronic government to different business sectors such as the environmental sector. Effective and successful management of National Forest Parks relies on a complete understanding of the goods and services which they provide to the society. This paper aims to study electronic government websites concerning the 10 Greek National Forest Parks and analyze the websites as to their qualitative and quantitative features. Then, the electronic services model adoption of the websites is assessed. The electronic government websites are classified in electronic services adoption stages starting from a simple presence of the government agency in the Internet to the total electronic services integration through multiple Information and Communication Technologies tools and applications provision according to content features accomplished by the websites. The findings can be helpful for managers, policy makers, web designers, environmentalists and government agencies.	business process;e-government;internet;web design	Christiana Koliouska;Zacharoula S.

Like many other developing countries, the e-government initiative in the state of Qatar has faced a number of challenges since its inception in 2000. This study utilises the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of technology (UTAUT) model to explore the adoption and diffusion of e-government services in the state of Qatar. 1179 citizens were surveyed using the UTAUT model. The empirical data reveal that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influences determine citizens’ behavioural intention. Additionally, facilitating conditions and behavioural intention determine citizens’ use of e-government services. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

This movement makes it difficult for the local government to understand citizens’ needs fully, particularly pertaining to public safety matters. Thus, in the city of East London where this issue is prevalent, a smart city project was introduced to help alleviate these concerns. During the first phase of the Public Safety Smart City (PSSC) project, it was identified that there is a need for a feedback loop to facilitate the effective communication of public safety issues between citizens and local government. Part of the problem is that local government is reacting to these public safety issues rather than being proactive. The study followed an interpretivism paradigm and the research methodology employed is the qualitative approach in order to gain a deeper understanding of the issues involved. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eleven East London citizens and four managers from the Department of Public Safety from the Buffalo City Municipality in order to gain further insights. It was ascertained that the lack of feedback concerning public safety issues between citizens and local government leads to citizens’ dissatisfaction. Based on the De Fleur model of communication, the paper concludes that the introduction of an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enabled feedback loop between citizens and local government can help to reduce these concerns.	buffalo network-attached storage series;feedback;proactive parallel suite;programming paradigm;semiconductor industry;smart city	Amanda Gopeni;Ntombovuyo Wayi;Stephen Flowerday	2016			environmental protection;civil engineering;business;computer security	HCI	-79.25610896096568	-6.142070095064674	131598
9dd4606fabee7fbb7b4c2f3377da8ed460a34e03	open generification: open generification		To what extent can software ‘travel’ to organizations and countries for which it was not designed for, and how important are local contexts for a successful design and implementation of generic software? Information systems researchers have differing views on this, some emphasizing the strengths of the generic and others the importance of contextual aspects. Contributing to this debate, Pollock and Williams have coined the term generification in order to describe how large vendors succeed in globalizing software packages through management by community, content and social authority. In this paper, we explore an approach that we call open generification, which extends Pollock and Williams’ work in the sense that we acknowledge the need for and the feasibility of generic software, but propose an alternative model for the governance of it. Open generification is not about managing the community of users attached to a software package by homogenization or segmentation but aims at addressing the diverse needs of the community the software is expected to serve. Our empirical basis is a longitudinal study of the development of an open-source health information system software (District Health Information software version 2), which is being used in more than 47 countries. Its success is attributed to a continuous interplay between generic and specific software and continuous cycles of embedding (implementing the global in the local context) and disembedding (taking local innovations into the global). We identify and discuss the contingent mechanisms of this interplay.	contingency (philosophy);information system;open-source software;software versioning	Abyot Asalefew Gizaw;Bendik Bygstad;Petter Nielsen	2017	Inf.

Towards these objectives, FinnSight 2015 engaged 10 expert panels which identified key driving forces and characterised focus areas of competences by making extensive use of Internet-based tools and by engaging in intensive deliberations at facilitatedworkshops.We also describe the policy context and methodological support of FinnSight: specifically, we report how challenges arising from the tight schedule were addressed through the process design and what policy developments have taken place after to the publication of foresight results, in the belief that our analysis may be instructive for the planning of large-scale foresight exercises that need to serve high-level policy objectives subject to demanding time constraints and expectations.	amiga reflections;high- and low-level	Ahti Salo;Ville Brummer;Totti Könnölä	2009	Techn.

9e7ddf1a6a40ceeda559539da487d8579409e552	master data management and its organizational implementation: an ethnographical study within the public sector		Purpose – Master data management (MDM) aims to improve the value of an organization’s most important data, such as customer data, by bridging the silos between organizational units and information systems. However, incorporating data management practices into an organization is not a simple task. The purpose of this paper is to provide a new understanding of the challenges in establishing and developing the MDM function within an organization. Design/methodology/approach – This papers report an ethnographic study within a municipality. The data were collected from two consecutive MDM development projects over the time period of 32 months by observing MDM-related activities and interviewing appropriate actors. Observations, interviews, and impressions were documented to a diary that was later qualitatively analyzed. Various project documentation were also used. Findings – In total 15 challenges were identified. Seven of these were not identified earlier in the literature. New challenges included legislation-driven challenges, mutual understanding of master data domains, and the level of granularity for those domains. Eight issues, such as data owner and data definitions, were MDM specific, others being more generic. All of the issues were identified as preconditions or as affecting factors for the others. Three of the issues were identified as pivotal. The issues emphasize strong alignment between the complex concept of MDM and the organization adopting it. Research limitations/implications – This research was based on a single qualitative case study, and caution should be exercised with regard to generalizations. The findings increase understanding about the complex organizational phenomena. The study offers public sector and private sector practitioners insights of the organizational issues that establishing a MDM function can encounter. Originality/value – The issues discovered in the research shed light on the strong alignment between the complex concept of MDM and the organization. The results of this study assist researchers in their endeavor to understand the organizational aspects of MDM, and to build theoretical models, frameworks, practices, and explanations.	bridging (networking);documentation;information system;master data management;precondition;software framework	Riikka Vilminko-Heikkinen;Samuli Pekkola	2017	J.

Mobile networked technologies are forming a multimedia mixed environment offering rich applications and services, called mobile data services. But the low diffusion of mobile data services in European societies asks for more investigation in order to explain the users' behaviour within mobile networked environments. Although the last two decades new user adoption models have been proposed, these cannot successfully be applied in the area of mobile applications and services because of their low explanatory power across different contexts. Thus there is a need to introduce new moderating factors to increase the explanatory power of adoption models within mobile networked environments. The results presented here suggest that place influences usage of mobile data services and for that reason there is a need to explore its moderating role in the usage process.

To improve competitiveness of product, the two aspects are combined to study. A structural equation modeling based approach to product form design analysis is proposed. Firstly, morphological analysis and orthogonal experimental design are chosen to determine the experimental samples. Secondly, taking affection and practicality as latent variables, the related manifest variables are set and measured. Finally, the relationship among the form design elements, affection, practicality and consumer's purchase intent are analyzed. Based on this, the structural equation model is built, solved, and evaluated.

2d98dbbb6f6668e9baf57c62b758b714b6c5978f	georgia on my mind: a study of the role of governance and cooperation in online service delivery in the caucasus		Georgia’s achievements in public sector modernisation have been lauded, since 2004, for their ability to increase transparency, fight corruption, ease the way of doing business and improve public service delivery to citizens. Information Communication Technology (ICT) played an important role as an enabler of public sector reform. Despite this, research into the Georgian model of governance and inter-governmental cooperation is extremely limited. Similarly, literature reviews have, in recent years, pointed out limitations in the understanding of technology use in public service delivery and, particularly, the role governance, cross-governmental decision making, and cooperation play when introducing ICT solutions and online services to citizens. As part of a larger qualitative, multi-country comparison, this article analyses the Georgian approach to electronic governance (eGovernance). The analysis highlights the influence of politically motivated and driven public sector reforms underpinned by ICT use for better service delivery, transparency and a fight against corruption in the period 2004–2012. Despite early success in relation to ICT infrastructure, standards and roll-out to key enablers, the article finds that the electronic government (eGovernment) eco-system is fragmented and that the use of public and private online service (eService) is limited, despite high internet penetration and usage. The key barrier found is the lack of an effective governance and inter-governmental cooperation model to improve cooperation between government actors (e.g. data collection, quality and reuse, shared infrastructure, systems and service), build on existing infrastructure and enablers to optimize the value-added of earlier investments – particularly in relation to electronic identity management (eID), digital signatures (eSignature) and eServices. Georgia would benefit from a more formalized approach to ICT related programmes and projects by considering an IT-implementation model to effectively manage risk, improve benefit realization and link individual key performance measurements (KPI) to those of the eGovernment strategy and action plan.	itil;online service provider	Morten Meyerhoff Nielsen;Nato Goderdzishvili	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-64677-0_7	service delivery framework;data collection;public relations;environmental resource management;public sector;corruption;economics;public service;identity management;government;corporate governance	HCI	-78.97836279151598	-7.536271598081472	133475

Extant reviews on virtual team research lack in two important aspects: First they do not explain the inconsistencies in virtual team research, and second they fail to explain how virtual teams achieve success. This paper, based on an extensive literature review of available research on virtual teams, identifies key drivers of virtual team effectiveness. Integrating the identified drivers, it develops a conceptual, analytical framework with 9 propositions, to explain virtual teams’ path to success. The new framework is termed as EAST (extended adaptive structuration theory). It goes beyond the generalized frameworks, such as AST (Adaptive Structuration Theory) and InputOutput frameworks to identify virtual team specific constructs such as Mission, Emergent SocioEmotional States, and Individual Dimension. EAST identifies potential areas of future research for scholars, and provides advice to IS professionals regarding how to deploy virtual teams.	emergent;responsiveness;virtual machine;virtual reality	Ninad Naik;Dan J.

The model is developed to fill the lack of models on RFID implementation in a hospital setting. Design/methodology/approach – The case study research and grounded theory approaches are combined. The data are collected through repeat interviews with the hospital’s RFID manager and the IT vendor. The data are analysed using the grounded theory approach. Findings – The main finding of the paper is the RFID implementation process model in a hospital. The model consists of key activities that have occurred during the unfreezing, moving and refreezing stages of the implementation. Research limitations/implications – The generalisability of the model may be limited because it is based only on a single hospital’s RFID implementation. Practical implications – RFID managers in hospitals need to be aware that the technology’s implementation is no different to other types of information systems implementation. However, they also need to be aware of the contextual differences in their hospitals before the model can be adapted. Originality/value – The RFID implementation process model could guide existing and future RFID managers in hospitals. The three stages of the model will enable the managers in identifying the different emphasis needed in each stage.	exponent bias;information system;process modeling;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification	Shamshul Bahri	2009	J.

In this paper, we adopt elaboration likelihood theory to investigate knowledge transfer processes in a knowledge management system (KMS). We report the results of an exploratory experiment conducted to examine the impact of argument quality, source credibility and validation on knowledge usefulness of a document in a KMS. Our findings indicate that while validation of knowledge in KMS positively affects perceptions of knowledge usefulness, higher argument quality was associated with lower usefulness ratings. Surprisingly, source credibility has no effect on perceptions of knowledge usefulness. The implications of these results for both researchers and practitioners are discussed.	elaboration likelihood model;knowledge management	Kelly J. Fadel;Alexandra Durcikova;Hoon S.

0ec17b9f7928f7a5c9876202d7d07337e84498a1	adoption of information systems innovations by individuals: a study of processes involving contextual, adopter, and influencer actions	information technology;it adoption;social influence;information system	The extensive literature on the adoption of information systems (IS) or information technology (IT) innovations by individuals has primarily used a variance approach, focusing on individual, organizational, and technological factors that influence the level of adoption. Probably due to this focus on factors affecting adoption, little is known about the processes by which individuals adopt IS/IT innovations. Considering IS/IT adoption as an emergent process involving actions by the potential adopter, actions by individuals who might influence the adopter, and actions within the adopter's context, we examined the ways in which these actions interacted with each other over time. We conducted optimal matching and cluster analyses using data from 27 interviews about the adoption of 30 IS/IT innovations. The emergent taxonomy includes three distinct processes by which individuals adopt innovations: Conscious Quest, Requisite Compliance, and Asserted Trial. The Conscious Quest process, which results in ''full adoption,'' seems to be driven by the adopter, with no social influence and no mandate. In contrast, in Requisite Compliance and Asserted Trial processes, both of which resulted in ''partial adoption,'' the adopter encounters considerable pressure, either from a contextual mandate (Requisite Compliance) or from influencers (Asserted Trial). Implications for research and practice are examined.	information system	Anand Jeyaraj;Rajiv Sabherwal	2008	Information and Organization	10.1016/j.infoandorg.2008.04.001	public relations;social influence;knowledge management;marketing;sociology;law;information technology;information system	HCI	-80.99268563737775	1.083721698662133	134344
a9e3d140b0eeae28e1247343db63c74be5864949	addressing users' privacy concerns for improving personalization quality: towards an integration of user studies and algorithm evaluation	user agent;research agenda;user study;data mining;machine learning;quality criteria;high performance;evaluation studies	Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of personalization using quality criteria both from machine learning / data mining and from user studies. However, a site requires more than a high-performance personalization algorithm: it needs to convince its users to input the data needed by the algorithm. Today’s Web users are becoming increasingly privacyconscious and less willing to disclose personal data. How can the advantages of personalization (and hence, of disclosure) be communicated effectively, and how can the success of such strategies be measured in terms of improved personalization quality? In this paper, we argue for a tighter integration of the HCI and computational issues involved in these questions. We first outline the problems for personalization that arise from the combination of users’ privacy concerns and sites’ current policies of dealing with privacy issues. We then describe the results of an experiment that investigated the effects of changes to a site’s interface on users’ willingness to disclose data for personalization. This is followed by an overview of studies of the sensitivity of mining algorithms to changes in the availability of these types of data. Based on this, we outline a research agenda for future evaluation studies and user agent design. Various personalization systems have been developed in recent years and their benefits described [26, 27]. Personalized systems require data about individuals to successfully adapt to the user. However, users are getting more and more concerned about their privacy. A meta-study of 30 surveys has shown that Internet users strongly dislike the collection and use of personal data [45]. These privacy concerns represent a major impediment for a more wide-spread use of personalization [29] and useradaptive e-commerce [14]. Yet, current Web privacy statements are typically written in a way that seems as if site operators do not want users to read them: whereas 76% of respondents indicated that they find privacy policies very important [16], it has been found that users hardly pay any attention to them.2 1 This research was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Berlin-Brandenburg Graduate School in Distributed Information Systems (DFG grant no. GRK 316/2). 2 For example, on the day after the company Excite@home was featured in a 60 Minutes segment on Internet privacy, only 100 out of 20 million unique visitors accessed that company’s privacy pages. Many site managers claim that fewer than 1% of all users read privacy policies [27]. 2 Bettina Berendt and Maximilian Teltzrow This situation has left site operators and researchers wondering how to better communicate their data collection policies and the advantages arising from them. In this paper, we address this question from an evaluative and instrumental perspective. In Section 1, concerns from a selection of consumer privacy surveys are highlighted. We then outline factors influencing users’ data disclosure behavior, which in return may impact the quality of personalization results. Section 2 describes the results of an experiment that suggests an influence of a site’s communication design on users’ willingness to share data. Section 3 then takes a more computational viewpoint and discusses quantitative methods of measuring the influence of data availability on personalization quality. Data availability will be operationalized in terms of levels of identity disclosure. The results also show that the availability of data interacts with the personalization algorithm chosen and with site characteristics. While personalization algorithm and site characteristics are the site operator’s decision parameters, the availability of data is the user’s decision parameter. A more user-oriented evaluation methodology will represent a shift in emphasis and require changes in methodology. Thus, in Section 4, we conclude by outlining requirements for the design of evaluation studies and site-user interfaces. In particular, we propose that an increased level of transparency of how a user’s data provision affects recommendation quality will prove beneficial for both users and sites. This work has implications for privacy research and practice, especially for managers of personalization sites. Moreover, it highlights links between HCI and computational aspects of personalization and suggests further work in the development of privacy-preserving personalization systems. 1 Problems for Personalization that Arise from Users’ Privacy Concerns and Sites’ Current Policies of Dealing with Privacy Issues Privacy concerns are a severe drawback to personalization. In this section, we describe data categories relevant for personalization and a selection of findings from consumer studies to give an insight into current user concerns. 1.1 A Categorization of Data Used for Personalization Personalization requires two types of knowledge: individual-user information, i.e., knowledge about the user to whom a recommendation is to be made, and background knowledge about what to recommend based on the individual-user information. The first type of knowledge consists of the (potentially personal) data that the individual user discloses; the second type consists of (i) information about the product catalog and business rules (e.g.: if a user is interested in action movies, recommend Terminator to him) and (ii) patterns derived from historical data (e.g., ratings given by previous users; site navigation patterns). This distinction is reflected in Kobsa, Koenemann, and Pohl’s [27] classification into user data, usage data, environment data (all concerning the individual user), and usage regularities. The P3P classification can be regarded as a further refinement of this idea. The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) [12] provides Web site managers with a standardized way to disclose how their site collects, uses, and shares personal information about users. Addressing Users’ Privacy Concerns for Improving Personalization Quality 3 It provides several pre-defined types of data. It specifies a “data schema” describing sets of “data elements”, which are specific items of data a service might collect online. For example, it differentiates data categories such as “physical contact information”, “unique identifiers”, “purchase information”, “computer information”, “navigation and click-stream data”, or “demographic and socioeconomic data”. Since background knowledge relies on individual-user information, in the following we will concentrate on the subclasses of individual-user information. Table 1 shows them, adding the types of data disclosed when typical shopping dialogue questions are asked (used in, e.g., [42, 45]). A closer look at user perceptions and concerns reveals that a further criterion needs to be taken into account for classifying data. Investigating the concerns of the “pragmatic majority” [2] of users who exhibit a medium degree of privacy concerns, Spiekermann, Grossklags, and Berendt [42] found that one group were particularly concerned about disclosing aspects of their identity, while others were particularly opposed to revealing a personal profile. This distinction groups data across the previous classifications, as shown in Table 1. The resulting complexity indicates that an analysis of privacy concerns and their effects on personalization should start by focusing on specific subclasses of these concerns.

CRM was designed for private sector companies for the management of customer relationships in the preand post-sales cycles. Our hypothesis is that CRM can be configured to meet the requirements of a university recruiting environment. We tested the hypothesis by actually configuring a commercial CRM system to meet the requirements of the university environment. Our conclusion is that there is a one-to-one relationship between the private sector “Campaign Management” business process and the university recruiting business process. Hence, the CRM methodology should be considered by universities as an option for enhancing the relationship between potential students and the university.	business process;customer relationship management;one-to-one (data model);requirement	Fitzgerald Barriento;Wen-bin Cheng;Thomas Gulledge	2003	IJEBM		customer relationship management;engineering;marketing;operations management;management	Networks	-82.2117768995353	3.311670455524777	134543

Specifically, information and communication technologies have become very useful tools in developing the ability of staff to accomplish jobs effectively and efficiently. Unlike developed countries which face only few issues in the adoption of e-government services, developing countries encounter several adoption problems from the stakeholders’ point of view. Government-to-employee (G2E) is one aspect of e-government that covers activities and services that transpire between government units and their workers. This paper identifies the factors that improve the adoption of e-government services by employees in developing countries. The selected success factors (website quality, awareness, computer-self-efficiency, IT workforce capability and training) extended with Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) – an extensively used model.

Cooperation, to the extent that is made up of communication and coordination, can be fully characterized under the assumption that an office is a special linguistic game, constituted by a set of rules defining the conversations possible within it, continuously changing under the perturbations created by the speech acts its member do performing the conversations. Within this conceptual context, a prototypal software package, CHAOS-1, is presented. CHAOS-1 aims both at supporting the conversations and at improving coordination of the office activities.This paper discusses CHAOS-1 with respect to similar proposals, presents its overall architecture, shows some examples of its use and sketches its new releases under development.	perturbation theory	Fiorella de Cindio;Giorgio De Michelis;Carla Simone;Raffaela Vassallo;Anna Maria Zanaboni	1986		10.1145/637069.637113	simulation;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;communication in small groups;computer science;operating system;role;ethical code;multimedia;sociology;communication;management;social psychology;law;world wide web;function;thermodynamic activity	HCI	-83.77377761227473	-4.665685619830164	134664
aa511a7fe5f1ea304253cbbf02a2f662aaf1a918	risk and information disclosure in google drive sharing of tax data		Risk abounds as individuals engage in activities involving the sharing of sensitive information through a third-party cloud storage tool. In this research, we investigate the storage and sharing of very sensitive information (an individual’s tax filing information) through a specific third-party technology provider, Google Drive. Within the specifics of such a potentially risky act we argue that information assurance mechanisms implemented by the cloud storage service provider reduce risk perceptions of individuals even when very sensitive information is being shared. Previous positive experience with a cloud service is likely to mitigate concerns on information sharing on the cloud.

However, with data leakages being discussed frequently in media, there is a rising consciousness of information security issues. These concerns are known to affect individual behavior. Despite the importance of this awareness, the role of information security for the acceptance of CT has not garnered significant attention in research. This paper accounts for this gap and extends the technology acceptance model by integrating the dimension of perceived information security. Moreover, it takes a socio-technical stance and incorporates the perspective of inter-personal trust. The study develops a theoretical model, which is then validated using data gathered from 121 network organizations in Germany. The results suggest that both perceived information security and inter-personal trust are important predictors for the intention to use CT and should be considered in the field of CT adoption research.	consciousness;information security;sociotechnical system;theory	Simon T.-N.

The focus is on people traits of the customer team (CuTe), that is, professionals from the client organization that contracts CISS projects who assume specific business and information technology roles in partnerships with external developers, given that both in-house and outsourced teams share project authority and responsibility. A systematic literature review based on a particular perspective of the socio-technical approach to the work systems enabled the compilation of measures that account for people traits assumed to improve CuTe performance. The resulting framework contributes to a much needed theory on the management of knowledge workers, especially to help plan, control, assess, and make historical records of CuTe design and performance in CISS projects.

Starting from the general lack of studies on IS professionals’ traits in team contexts (Siau et al., 2010), there is also a need to better understand the role and the social aspects of customers in CISS development. This article addresses the participation of customers in CISS projects by developing a set of people-oriented measures to design and manage that participation. We adopt Leavitt’s (1965) socio-technical model, that takes people traits as a dimension of the social subsystem, and apply it to the customer team (CuTe). A CuTe is formed by professionals from the client organization of CISS projects who are assigned special business and information technology (IT) roles for partnering with outsourced developers (the XTeam, named after the external team). Both XTeam and CuTe developers share project authority and responsibility, so we devise performance criteria to be complied with by CuTe personnel in CISS projects. Leavitt’s (1965) model, that include technology, tasks, structure and people as the key interdependent dimensions of any work system “displays the virtues of a good classification: it is simple, extensive, sufficiently well defined, and anchored in the extant theory” (Lyytinen & Newman, 2008, p. 594). Based on that, we searched for the following research question in a systematic literature review: What are the theoretically relevant cognitive and behavioral traits of CuTe members in CISS projects? Expected benefits from answering this question cover a wide range of academic and industry interests, such as in hiring professionals, in promoting the transparency of personnel assessment, and in unifying theoretical areas of great interest to the IS field, including customization, seller-buyer interaction, quality management, workforce management, and the effectiveness of teamwork. The research adds to the sociotechnical and the IS development literatures by addressing the people dimension of the social subsystem for managing CuTe work in CISS projects. The article is organized as follows: the first section presents the systematic literature review that was effected in order to compile CuTe members’ personal traits needed in CISS projects; the second section assembles the traits into measures, metrics and indicators according to their nature; the third section synthesizes the assembly according to the expected influence of each people indicator on CuTe performance and discusses some implications on the deployment of professional knowledge; and the last section reinforces the unique contributions of this review and makes suggestions for future research. THE SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are the recommended method for aggregating empirical studies (Kitchenham et al., 2010b). An SLR is an evidence-based method to produce and reproduce literature compilations of empirical findings, since it is assumed to be unbiased, auditable and repeatable (Kitchenham et al., 2010a). In the software engineering and IT fields, SLRs are increasingly popular, thanks especially to the efforts of Dr. Kitchenham and colleagues in spreading the word about the method by means of published guidelines and illustrative cases. SLRs are secondary studies that aggregate the findings of more basic research known as primary studies, with a special audience formed by practitioners (Kitchenham, 2010). Therefore, SLRs are a rigorous way to compile and communicate relevant academic findings to the professional community. Our research can be conceived as a mapping study. Mapping studies are a form of SLR that aims to identify and categorise research on a broad topic (Kitchenham et al., 2011), thus addressing more general research questions (Kitchenham, 2010). In a previous mapping study, Bellini et al. (2008) discussed the fundamentals and trends in the domain of software engineering and IT measurement, as well as the implications for research and practice in a general sense; our study reproduces much of their methodological procedures and primary 23 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/customer-team-effectivenessthrough-people/68171?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Business, Administration, and Management, InfoSci-Operations, Logistics, and Performance Assessment eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Select.

We hypothesize and find in a survey of 187 programmers that online forum commitment and trust lead to greater online forum participation, which in turn predicts a higher likelihood of confidential information disclosure. We also find that programmers with greater awareness of security policies exhibit a lower likelihood of deciding to risk disclosing confidential information. The study contributes to extant literature by raising and exploring the potentially negative, dark side of knowledge sharing through electronic networks of practice.	dark side	Antoinette L.

The coding scheme has roots in adaptive structuration theory (AST) with its emphasis on how technology is appropriated or used, and discourse analysis that requires one consider the context of the larger discussion when analyzing textual data. The macro-level coding scheme revolves around junctures that occur during group meetings such as when a group either chooses to use the GSS software or chooses to accomplish some aspect of the task without the software. After identifying a juncture, a brief description is written detailing how group members responded to the opportunity presented by the juncture. Qualitative analysis is then used to identify patterns in how the technology is used. Application of the coding scheme is demonstrated with data gathered from 17 groups that met three times over a two-week period.	text corpus	Katherine M.

The moderating roles of team cohesiveness and knowledge practice are also explored. Design/methodology/approach – This study used online questionnaire surveys by inviting 500 R&D team members of NPD from three Science Parks in Taiwan. The survey questionnaires were sent to the representative of R&D team members. Findings – The results indicate that members’ project management skills, entrepreneurial proclivity, and existing knowledge have significant impact on team reflexivity and product innovativeness of the NPD project, which then influence NPD performance. Furthermore, NPD team exercising higher levels of team cohesiveness and higher knowledge practice tend to moderate the influence of team reflexivity and product innovativeness on NPD performance. Research limitations/implications – The use of longitudinal research is suggested to confirm the results of this study. Moreover, other research settings, either different industry or other countries, could increase the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications – The study has high implications for managers of NPD to recruit qualified team members who have adequate knowledge and strong entrepreneurial proclivity. Moreover, managers should be aware of the moderating role of team cohesiveness and knowledge practices. Originality/value – The paper determines the antecedents and consequences of team reflexivity and innovativeness among NPD team members. The moderating role of team cohesiveness and knowledge practices are discussed.	cohesion (computer science);group cohesiveness;new product development	Les Tien-Shang Lee	2008	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635570810868380	project management;questionnaire;product innovation;teamwork;economics;design methods;engineering;knowledge management;marketing;management science;product management;management;new product development	HCI	-84.72484798274584	2.179700254159524	135508

Using the Internet, social media, crowd-sourcing and mobile technologies influence communication structures, expectations and behavior of citizens and businesses. At the same time, financial constraints in the public sector result in less staff available for keeping pace with these fast developments in the digital era. Strengthening the partnership and collaboration between government and private as well as civic sector actors has emerged as a strong demand of open government and new governance models of state. Based on these settings, this paper introduces a concept of social government (SocialGov) that unites methods, concepts and tools of co-creation, co-production and social communities (including the use of social media) with those of open government (enabling transparency, participation, and also exploring open data and open services) in public service provisioning. The social government concept includes an environment, in which governments, citizens and businesses collaborate in order to identify, design, create, execute, and monitor public services and to share ideas on how to tackle public and societal challenges.	crowdsourcing;internet;provisioning;requirement;social media	Sabrina Scherer;Maria Wimmer;Sergiusz Strykowski	2015		10.1145/2757401.2757417	public relations;knowledge management;political science;socioeconomics;public sector	HCI	-80.03656731855523	-6.827560350083011	135626

However, research has identified that traditional public warnings, such as generic text messages based on large geographic regions, often fail to promote appropriate responses by at-risk residents. Recently, there has been an increased focus on using map-based approaches for communicating public warnings. However, a systematic framework to guide the design of effective mapping instruments for this purpose is lacking. The researchers sought to fill this gap by merging the scholarly understanding of factors influencing warning effectiveness with the contemporary spatial capacities of the emergency management sector. The current paper presents the conceptual framework resulting from this merger, which can be used to direct the design and implementation of map-based warnings that offer personalised risk visualisation and provide personalised decision support to motivate...

In Cameroon, all the top e-commerce giants have deployed smartphone applications to facilitate m-commerce activities. However, little is known about the factors that influence m-commerce adoption in the country. As such, this study had as objective to determine the key factors that influence consumer’s adoption of m-commerce applications in Cameroon. Using data from 372 respondents, a modified version of the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) was validated in the Cameroon context. The findings showed that social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivations, perceived risk and perceived trust were significant predictors of the behavioural intention to adopt m-commerce applications. Also, the results showed that consumers who had a high intention to adopt m-commerce were more likely to recommend the technology to others. For researchers, the study depicts the relevance of extending existing technology acceptance models like the UTUAT2 with appropriate factors in different technological and geographical context. For practitioners, the study identifies customer-specific and environmental factors that m-commerce providers in Cameroon and other regions with similar characteristics could consider when designing and implementing strategies for attracting consumers to use their m-commerce applications.	mobile commerce	Silas Formunyuy Verkijika	2018	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2018.04.012	risk perception;marketing;unified theory of acceptance and use of technology;computer science;social influence;mobile commerce	HCI	-88.5310141107808	-9.284000367918637	135954

Conventionally, the approaches in explaining the innovation diffusion process assume that the process takes place in a stable and homogeneous system in which the innovation diffuses or spreads without being affected by the system's structural variables even under external influences. However, many studies have established that the presence of symmetry is not the general rule in innovation diffusion process. This work examines these models and recognizes that they need further modification to improve the holistic understanding of the dynamic structural complexities and forces driving the processes of innovation and diffusion. This paper shows the general but extended frameworks of innovation diffusion mainly propounded by Frank M. Bass, E. M. Roger, E. Muller, P. Milling, and Frank H. Maier and proves how the application of system dynamics modeling can contribute in a meaningful way to the area of innovation diffusion research. A proof-of-the-concept analysis has been done by calibrating a diffusion model of Indian foundry sector followed by discussion on simulation results and future direction.	simulation;system dynamics	Sanjay Bhushan	2013	IJSDA	10.4018/ijsda.2013010104	simulation;engineering;operations management;operations research	Robotics	-79.09186236085745	3.12077229594493	136073

This is accomplished by analysing the implementation of the ERP systems at a company, HealthSouth Corporation, longitudinally during two periods (1997 to 2003 and 2004 to 2007). During 1997 to 2003, leadership and culture in this organisation enabled accounting fraud to occur via the criminal misuse of a heavily-customised, unsupported ERP system. During 2004 to 2007, the leadership and culture enabled the company to avoid bankruptcy and a plain-vanilla (i.e., uncustomised) version of the ERP system was installed successfully. This paper provides valuable lessons to ERP practitioners on how ERP implementations are influenced by leadership, from the top management team, and organisational culture.	erp;enterprise resource planning	David M.

Nonetheless, the attainment of PB success has always been challenged by various factors, including ineffectiveness and inefficiency of PB practice, and scant citizensu0027 participation. This research examines the potential of multi-channel digitally-enabled PB platform adoption in overcoming those challenges. To do so, we review the existing literature on citizensu0027 participation and participatory budgeting in several research domains. We found that the adoption of multi-channel digitally-enabled PB platform could overcome such challenges and improve civic engagement. Evidence of the past studies also indicate that the adoption and use of such platforms could have positive political and socio-economic implications on the local community. This signposts that engaging citizen in the government decision-making through such platform yield better impact on governance and public good.	participatory monitoring	Amizan Omar;Uthayasankar Sivarajah;Vishanth Weerakkody	2018		10.1145/3209281.3209387	public relations;participatory budgeting;civic engagement;local government;public good;government;computer science;politics;local community;corporate governance	HCI	-80.04176598888789	-5.36081920200702	136904

Accounting standard setting has long offered such a possibility to participate via the due process approach followed by major standard setters. We review the literature on areas close to financial reporting and find arguments for why the possibility to participate in standard setting may have a positive effect on diminishing distortion of financial reporting. We also discuss reasons why such a compliance effect may be less pronounced in financial reporting. We conclude that the existence of this effect is an open question and conduct a lab experiment to examine whether the possibility to participate in accounting standard setting leads to reduced earnings management. Our results indicate that this is not the case. We interpret this result in light of recent evidence that enforcement and incentives are better predictors of accounting quality than financial reporting standards.	distortion;software quality assurance	Roland Königsgruber;Stefan Palan	2015	CEJOR	10.1007/s10100-013-0326-3	accounting;accounting management;positive accounting;actuarial science;economics;public economics;accounting information system;generally accepted accounting principles;financial ratio	ECom	-84.7109635413543	-6.546257535616394	136933

In this paper, we develop a new method of measuring centrality in the complex network of patent citations that can take political borders into account, where the national benefit of domestic citations relative to foreign citations can be controlled by a free parameter. We find that while some patent classes are of high importance both in the global and the domestic economy, there often exist patent classes in individual countries that are more central nationally than in global economy. We characterize the most important classes globally and domestically for six different nations, and describe their robustness to various perturbations to the model and to noise.	centrality;citation graph	Greg Morrison;Eleftherios Giovanis;Fabio Pammolli;Massimo Riccaboni	2014	J.

The existing literature presents an aggregate story of success, but the ways in which different countries are adopting these new technologies have received little critical attention. This empirical study of four Latin American countries ‐ Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Peru ‐ delineates a five‐phase development process during which each country sustained the momentum of its evolving strategy, grew in competence to forge technological solutions, and gained access to the Internet. The four countries’ original goals changed over time, but through experience they perceived new opportunities and established evolving Internet strategies that form the bases of new technological services provided at the national level.

Nevertheless, up until now, more attention has been focused on knowledge management inside organizations and less on knowledge management across organizational boundaries. Attempting to fill this gap and address the problems of cross-boundary knowledge management, this research first identified key boundary objects in the context of knowledge management, and then studies how actors from different organizations interact through boundary objects. The result links the performance of collaborative acts to the frequency of boundary object encountering in the course of interaction. In this study, although the context is described with """"actors"""" in mind, the unit of analysis is """"knowledge"""" itself, rather than """"actors,"""" and the interaction is termed """"knowledge interaction"""". Student assignments of information system projects serve as the cases of analysis. To analyze the performance of ten types of knowledge interactions, a max-min approach is applied, with one output factor, namely project performance, and four input factors, which are the frequencies of the encountering of four boundary objects. The result strongly suggests that identifying, creating, and facilitating useful boundary objects is the key to successful projects. Whether tacit knowledge is converted into explicit knowledge during the process is less important in achieving effective collaboration. Also, it is not always necessary to identify specific tacit knowledge in each organization."""	diversification (finance);information management;information system;interaction;knowledge management;maxima and minima;mind	Travis K.

WIL is an intrinsic component and catalyst for broader UBC. It has also been widely recognised as fundamental in the education arena to equip graduates with the required industry experience to innovate successfully. Despite its importance, the UBC literature places limited attention on WIL. Cooperation between university and business at the organisational level of relevant institutions as well as the individual level of participating managers and students is fundamental. Focusing on the student at the interface of UBC, this study contributes a framework for developing UBC through WIL. Managerial implications are discussed for universities and businesses engaged in UBC.

The focus is on the quality of cooperation and collaboration which we presume determines the agents’ readiness for change. Providing such a model facilitates decision making in process design such as organisation design or product/services design. The transformation feasibility of existing cooperation is determined through a collective operational effectiveness evaluation. Lillian T. Eby et al. (2000) outlined that little empirical research has focused on this phenomenon. Amenakis et al. (1993) have proposed a theory-based model where readiness for change is perceived as similar to Lewin’s (1951) concept of unfreezing. According to this theory beliefs and attitudes are core factors acting on organisational actors’ perception of the readiness for change. Readiness for change relates to the employees’ abilities and perceptions to face and support a pending organisational change. We consider the change in routines and practices of collaborating actors in interaction with the degree of activity change. In an organizational system based on cooperation, the various actors interact under a team spirit for a general interest and share a collective output. A certain degree of confidence and comprehension between actors is inferred. When change affects a company, technological or structural, organisational actors face change in roles, rules, methods, tools and habits. These transformations have an effect on the quality of cooperation and the related performance. We propose hereunder a methodology to measure the impact of change on activities accomplished trough cooperation. Our empirical research takes place in an organisation adopting a new technology in the maintenance sector.	capability maturity model;color gradient;list comprehension;logistics;operation time;organizational behavior;simulation;theory	Olivier Zephir;Emilie Chapotot;Stéphanie Minel;Benoit Roussel	2007			systems engineering;environmental resource management;operations management	SE	-82.64492274527713	0.2738620532639017	137343
cd82cb3ba721546ae735a3897ea02c2ac59c49af	investigating the level of desirability of information (di) at libraries' management information system (mis) in iran	library systems;computer software;academic libraries;iran;librarians;library automation	Purpose – The aim of this paper is to investigate the pros and cons of Iranian library management software, focusing on the usage of open source technology. It seeks to analyse the viewpoints of librarians in the University of Isfahan as a sample to extend the findings to the Iranian Library management software community. Design/methodology/approach – In order to get the opinions of librarians, the descriptive method is used. The required data are collected by literature review, questionnaire and open interview from university top managers, software technical staff, libraries managers, librarians, end users, and companies providing similar products. However, because of time limitations, the authors could only gather data by researcher-made checklist of the librarians (informants) who directly have worked with University of Isfahan in the libraries. Findings – The main problem of many library management software platforms in Iran is that the focus of development is mainly on technical issues rather than management, operational, and end-user concerns. This is highlighted when open source software is used because it is common for an off-the-shelf product to be used with less consideration of the nontechnical issues. This is the reason that Iranian libraries are moving to replace their software with commercial versions. Research limitations/implications – There was insufficient cooperation of some librarians in identifying capabilities and deficiencies of UILMS and limited cooperation of some technical experts in reviewing the software. Originality/value – Considering the lack of standard checklists, this paper presents a relatively complete checklist to evaluate the library software.	diagram;email;iranian.com;librarian;library (computing);management information system;open-source software;precision and recall;relevance	Asefeh Asemi;Ali Akbari;Manouchehr Kheradmandnia;Abbas Farazi	2012	The Electronic Library	10.1108/02640471211282136	world wide web;library classification	SE	-80.77732244284145	-0.4624595198367719	137372
a1bac004ec854486c22b840cac47af7f9221bdc2	personal characteristics and mobile internet use intensity of consumers with computer-centric communication devices: an exploratory empirical study of ipad and laptop users in germany	computer centric mobile communication devices;tablet pc;laptop;use intensity;consumer characteristics;mobile internet	Prior research on adopters of ubiquitous Internet access via cellular radio infrastructures of mobile network operators (MNO) has primarily focused on consumers equipped with enhanced web-enabled phones. In contrast, this work investigates personal characteristics and mobile Internet (MI) use behaviors of consumers who chose computer-centric appliance types for MI access. Two variants of tablet PCs (Apple's iPad1 and iPad2) and laptops are distinguished as computer-centric communication device categories. Data on two demographic variables, three MNO relationship characteristics and actual MI use intensity (average monthly volume of mobile IP traffic generated by a subscriber in May and June 2011) of 2001 consumers with a flat MI pricing scheme were extracted from customer files of the German subsidiary of a large international MNO. 1371, 367 and 263 of the sample members used an iPad1, an iPad2 and a laptop, respectively for MI access. Compared to the adult population in Germany, persons aged between 17 and 35years and males are overrepresented among MI adopters with the three studied device types. MI use intensity is highly positively skewed: in each of the three appliance groups, a small number of users disproportionately contributes to the total MI traffic generated by the subjects. MI use intensity is the main variable discriminating between Apple tablet versus laptop MI subscribers. On average, laptop users generate three times more MI traffic than iPad customers. MI use intensity does not differ significantly between iPad1 and iPad2 customers. Age and length of business relationship with the collaborating MNO are the two only studied personal characteristics, which consistently display a significant (negative) association with MI use intensity across the three appliance groups. Conclusions are drawn for MNO on aligning marketing measures to the peculiarities of users with different types of computer-centric MI devices and for scholarly research seeking to enhance the understanding of the influence of various appliance categories on MI adoption and use behaviors.	internet;laptop;ipad	Torsten J.

As a result, the number of eParticipation projects and relevant tools is rapidly growing. This makes the need for recording and reviewing such projects and tools both timely and critical. In this paper we present a framework for assessing eParticipation projects and tools. The proposed framework is based on distinguishing between participation areas and ICT support for these areas and suggests assessment to be performed using specific templates that are developed for this purpose. We further apply this framework in order to assess 19 relevant European Commission co-funded research projects. The preliminary results suggest that research in the domain of eParticipation is at its early stages. More specifically, the results suggest that projects focus on the more elementary eParticipation areas, such as information provision and opinion polling, while there is a trend for using multiple access channels, e.g. mobile technologies		Efthimios Tambouris;Naoum Liotas;Konstantinos A.

8442860239eda7401c524a134877b84734eb71b6	leader delegation in global software teams: occurrence and effects		Global teams are an important work structure in software development projects. Managing such complex global software projects presents many challenges to traditional leadership wisdom, in particular, how, why and when the leaders should delegate responsibility and authority. Delegation is considered an important leadership component to motivate and grow subordinates. Cultural differences, skill level disparity and potential competition between different software development sites creates a management context which is much different from where traditional leadership theories were developed. This study investigates leader delegation behaviors in global software teams and explores the reasons and impact of delegation strategies on global team performance. Semi-structured interviews and a survey was used to collect data from global software team managers and members from four countries of a Fortune 100 IT service company. The results of this study include in-depth analysis of hows and whys of leader delegation in global teams and a theoretical model for analyzing global team leader delegation occurrence and effects.

This paper reveals some of the reasons why accessibility still is a secondhand criterion when designing digital services. It also describes the authors’ experiences regarding the concept of accessibility and how it must develop in order to obtain the status of a basic business criterion for the benefit of disabled people who are currently excluded from public services and labour markets. The paper also questions the need of a separate accessibility standard. Additionally, we discuss some of the hindering in the market and limiting perspectives that are blocking further development. One of the problems in the market seems to be that accessibility as a concept has been more of an issue about creating equal opportunities and therefore probably does not have the quality of a business criterion. In order to bridge that gap, we argue for replacing accessibility with reachability, which is a concept based on a measure used by media when estimating the reached percentage of a population or target group.	accessibility;blocking (computing);experience;reachability;requirement	Jan Gulliksen;Hans Andersson;Per Lundgren	2003	Universal Access in the Information Society	10.1007/s10209-003-0073-7	usability;universal design;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;accessibility;management science;information technology;world wide web	HCI	-81.189111171997	-8.877152796288795	138063

This study extends research on second-order digital inequality to the realm of e-commerce. We introduce a novel conceptualization of effective, potentially beneficial, e-commerce use that encompasses two dimensions: (1) the diversity of e-commerce platforms used by an individual; (2) the degree to which an individual uses supporting e-commerce features. Building on technology acceptance theory and social psychology, we argue that socio-economically disadvantaged individuals are less likely to use e-commerce effectively than socioeconomically advantaged individuals. We empirically test our hypotheses on clickstream data that tracks the online behavior of 2819 US e-commerce users for six month. Our findings reveal that, despite equal access, the socio-economically advantaged use e-commerce more effectively regarding both dimensions.

Prior research in this area has suggested that by carefully selecting team members based on certain characteristics, like psychological type, team performance may be enhanced. This study examines the impact that individual goals and performance and team composition have on team performance. A number of individual variables are examined (self-efficacy, goal commitment, task complexity, motivation), as well as several team composition variables (team size, proportion of team members who are IS employees or are technologists, and whether or not the team leader is a technologist). Based on a regression model, we found that we can account for over 65 percent of the variability in team performance with four factors: team size, and individual goals, motivation, and performance. Furthermore, we found significant differences in team performance based on the proportion of team members who are IS employees and the average individual performance level.	cardiovascular technologist;spatial variability	Jonathan Trower;Kris K.

a01ba3cf4a46eb3c195038294c3e0f34fdcb13dd	crowdsourced system to report traffic violations - roadcop: bi-modular system		With increasing demand of transportation, implementation of the traffic regulations has become a major challenge for the developing countries. Most of the traffic accidents occur due to violation of traffic rules, thus, resulting in loss of human lives and property. The developed countries have addressed the situation by deploying surveillance systems at intersection, but the solution can be expensive; therefore, due to the cost factor the solution is out of reach for many underdeveloped countries. In order to overcome the situation, a framework is proposed that is based on crowdsourced model to report violations supplemented by the video evidence. The user reports are evaluated in multiple phases. In the first stage, spam is eliminated through evaluation, and associated user profiles are blocked. In the second stage, traffic law experts evaluate the report and on every valid report the users are rewarded with incentive points while ensuring the anonymity. The system is evaluated for usability, advantages to authorities, citizen involvement, skills and resources required and transparency. The results of functional testing indicate that the participants appreciated the purpose of the application and found it quite easy to use. With a large-scale deployment and an effective mechanism to identify offender, this system can lead to much improved implementation of traffic regulations.	crowdsourcing;functional testing;information retrieval;software deployment;spamming;trustworthy computing;usability;user profile;video evidence	Maryam Jameela;Hammad Afzal;Khawar Khurshid;Asad Waqar Malik	2018		10.5220/0006680303150322	modular design;distributed computing;computer science	Security	-84.15148202080677	-9.147827930854126	138272

This paper questions the agency and role of the crowd. Specifically, it questions how and to what extent can control over the crowd be exercised. To this end, the paper adopts an interpretive approach to the enquiry. It examines a case of crowdsourcing in the understudied area of humanitarian response. Concepts from structuration theory are adopted to interpret the data. The analysis reveals the paradox of crowd interaction and owner control in crowdsourcing. It shows the crowd to be made up of knowledgeable and reflexive groups that effectively tackle methods aimed at controlling them.

Contextual analysis of its processes, mechanisms, and effects are needed to understand factors that influence them. Technology â€“ market â€“ society nexus constitutes a context of ICT (Information Communication and Technologies) policies and applications. How could society make ICTs serve social and human goals? Various actors and stakeholders promote ICTs research, applications, and use. They use different means to act and also have different values and interests. Diversity is a typical characteristic of societies. ICTs generation, their multi-sided and multidimensional applications, and their effects depend on cultural abilities of societies to pursue information change. Human development goals, as realized by ICTs, should be analyzed at three levels: global, rational, and individual.	amiga reflections	Lech W.

The involvement and participation of these users and its impact on the effectiveness of IS planning has not been studied in the literature. In this article we address the effect of user involvement and participation on the quality of IS planning projects. This was done through an exploratory quasi-experiment study conducted in an academic setting. We studied the effects of user involvement using two sets of teams doing IS planning exercises, one in which the user was involved as part of the project team and the other where the user was outside the project team, but was involved in interviews and reviews of project artifacts. We also measured the extent of user participation through a survey of participants engaged in the IS planning projects. Results indicate that user involvement has significant positive effect on user participation, as well as on the quality of IS planning projects. However the effect of user participation on the quality of projects is mixed and needs further research.	exploratory testing;information system	Varadharajan Sridhar;Dhruv Nath;Amit Malik	2009	JOEUC	10.4018/joeuc.2009070105	social science;knowledge management;environmental resource management;marketing;critical success factor;exploratory research	HCI	-84.76407177270693	-0.7227292660566407	138776

However, we are persuaded that current approaches are underestimating the importance of social factors and group influence on individual beliefs. This paper adopts a complementary approach to previous researches based on normative assumptions. A social capital perspective is embraced to allow us to focus on the nature and quality of relationship among group members, especially those related to IT adoption. A theoretical model is proposed in order to have a usable theory. Empirically testable propositions are drawn, together with theoretical implications and possible future researches.	social capital;theory	Massimo Magni;Luigi Proserpio	2005			individual capital;social science;social capital;knowledge management;socioeconomics;social psychology	HCI	-86.07136518108445	-6.065066895583386	138828
59fef54a93053c9fd242241cd14558eff469c6b5	the determinants of individuals' perceived e-security: evidence from malaysia	encryption;technical protection;authentication;website design;online security	Despite the critical role of individuals' perceived security in an online environment, previous research has not attempted to comprehensively study the influences and interrelations between the determinants of online individuals' perceived security. This research employs five theories to examine the interrelations that might exist between the antecedents of individuals' perceived security in online environment in Malaysia. It is the first attempt to empirically examine the interrelations of the confidentiality related factors identified in the literature which is a significant original contribution. A questionnaire was the primary research methodology and structural equation modeling was employed to test the hypotheses. The findings suggest that individuals' perceptions about security are significantly influenced by their perceived technical protection while technical protection was found to be influenced by website design features. Moreover, it was found that individuals' perceptions toward internally provided assurances are highly influenced by externally provided assurances. However, the results found no significant relations between internally and externally provided assurances about a website's security. The findings imply that e-retailers should launch well-designed websites and communicate the technical protection capabilities of their websites to address individuals' security concerns. The results also suggest that e-traders should consider the factors influencing individuals' security perceptions when designing/developing their websites.	computer security	Mahmood Hussain Shah;Hamid Reza Peikari;Norjaya Mohd Yasin	2014	Int J.

Pair programming is supposed to be a practice suitable for this purpose. Unfortunately, the building of tacit knowledge is determined by factors that are difficult to isolate and capture because they concern personal attitude and capability. Thus, we have focused on the possible causes forming the individual ability, that can be isolated and studied, such as the individual education background. We have applied the practice of working in pairs to the design phase. We have made an experiment and a replica in academic environment, in order to understand the relationship between the building of knowledge through the practice and the individual background. In this paper we discuss the replica and compare the results with the first experiment's ones.	data assimilation;experiment;knowledge management;pair programming;software development process	Gerardo Canfora;Aniello Cimitile;Félix García;Mario Piattini;Corrado Aaron Visaggio	2005		10.1145/1066677.1067013	pair programming;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;body of knowledge;software engineering;knowledge-based systems;knowledge engineering;agile software development;management science;procedural knowledge;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;management;software development process;domain knowledge	AI	-88.7680932558118	1.1306438349489154	138899

Local adaptations are therefore bidirectional in nature. Although several studies stress the importance of local adaptations for the overall success of information technologies (IT) used across locations, more research is needed regarding what kind of local adaptations are required for a particular generic application system to work well in particular localities. The nature and extent of local adaptations are still poorly understood. This paper provides a concrete illustration of a historically situated local adaptation: the case of Veiling Holambra. This Brazilian cooperative has imported a generic auction marketplace model from Holland and adapted it to local conditions, to succeed in a globalized and competitive flower market. Using concepts drawn from studies on globalization, cross-cultural implementations, and IT-based organizational change literature, we put forward three propositions that help to explain the success of local adaptations. The results of our case study indicate that the immigration of Dutch people was critical for bringing knowledge of cooperative structure and flower production to Holambra and led to a relatively small design-use gap. The ability to take local, contextual requirements into account without neglecting the ‘generic’ knowledge led to the successful implementation of the generic auction model. This mutual influence was particularly enabled by the Brazilian culture of improvization.

0ddbbf60d63a5e31c119eec0d2ee4aaf203fc8ea	it takes a village: a community based participatory framework for privacy design		As data-centric technologies are increasingly being considered in social contexts that intervene in marginalized peoples' lives, we consider design paradigms to create systems that fulfill their unique privacy needs and requirements. Disempowered populations often experience disparate harms from the loss of privacy but, typically, have a limited role in formulating the scope and nature of such interventions, and accompanying (implicit or explicit) privacy policies and consequent engineering processes. This gap can be addressed by including recipient communities in designing these privacy policies. We propose a participatory design model for data-centric applications where privacy policies (norms) emerge out of participation of the community in the research/design process. The framework of Contextual Integrity which articulates privacy as respect for normative rules of information flow in specific contexts, lends itself well to enable a community-generated formulation of these privacy norms within the contexts of the proposed intervention. Employing formal logic, these privacy norms can then be used to engineer systems capable of regulating the flow of information as per the negotiated norms [1]. This entire process which we call Contextualized Participatory Privacy by Design, seeks to empower communities in negotiating and articulating their privacy norms, leading to the development of systems that are capable of enforcing what they deem as ethical, contextualized use of their data.	information flow (information theory);population;privacy by design;privacy policy;requirement	Darakhshan J.

Four distinct periods that roughly follow Friedman’s and Cornford’s categorization of IS development eras are analysed in terms of the rate and distribution of ISPI adoptions. These eras include early computing (1954–1965), mainframe (1965–1983), office computing (1983–1991), and distributed applications (1991–1997). We distinguish the following four types of ISPIs: base line technologies (T); tools (TO); description methods (D); and managerial innovations (M). We analyse for each era the rate of adopting different types of ISPIs, identify who made adoption decisions for those ISPI types and determine whether these ISPIs originated internally or externally. Within the three organizations, the types and rates of ISPI adoptions varied significantly. These variations can be attributed to learning mechanisms, the influence of legacy platforms and differences in the boundary spanning activities. With the exception of base line technologies, project managers were the most prominent decision-maker group, suggesting a situated ISPI adoption process. In most ISPI adoptions, internal search and experiments were the main source of innovation. The variation in ISPI adoptions can thus be partly explained by development environments, the types of IS involved and attention bias.

The objective of the survey was to gain a better understanding of the continent’s senior IT executives. The results show a grim reality for many of the region’s chief information officers. Australian IT executives are striving for recognition. Compared to their overseas counterparts, they rank lower in their respective organizations, do not report directly to their chief executive officers and are not members of their executive committees. Given these factors, the “senior executive” label seen as most descriptive of the role may be a bit of wishful thinking. Concludes that Australian IT executives’ roles are evolving from a traditional project‐oriented focus to a strategic decision‐making responsibility. IT executives would like to see their role in the organization elevated, giving them more “clout”, stature and visibility, as has increasingly been the case in North America a...

Practices to permit delegation can range from formal to informal arrangements and can involve spontaneous yet finely balanced notions of trust between people. This paper argues that delegation is a ubiquitous yet an unsupported feature of socio-technical computer systems and that this lack of support illustrates a particular neglect to the everyday financial practices of the more vulnerable people in society. Our contribution is to provide a first exploration of the domain of person-to-person delegation in digital payments, a particularly pressing context. We first report qualitative data collected across several studies concerning banking practices of individuals over 80 years of age. We then use analytical techniques centred upon identification of stakeholders, their concerns and interactions, to characterize the delegation practices we observed. We propose a Concerns Matrix as a suitable representation to capture conflicts in the needs of individuals in such complex socio-technical systems, and finally propose a putative design response in the form of a Helper Card.	spontaneous order	Paul Dunphy;Andrew F.

Most such systems try to capture employee knowledge pertaining to a specific domain of organisational interest. However, every employee has much more to contribute apart from knowledge in a particular area. The sum total of his/her skills, interests and experiences make for rich knowledge. Our research focuses on maximising the knowledge potential of every employee across different domains. We have developed a system to identify an individual's knowledge areas, based on his/her strengths, experiences and passion. It will enable an individual to contribute and share knowledge with other individuals. When applied to the organisation, it should help increase the span of knowledge areas reachable by KMS, and make them more effective. We move from a scenario where there are few experts towards one where everyone is an expert, and has something to share.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to advance further our understanding of the factors that influence the KMS adoption process among SMEs.rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnThe collected sample size was 247 respondents. For statistical analysis, Smart partial least square (PLS) (a structural model-based tool) was used to build, run and validate the process model. PLS regression techniques were used to analyze the latent constructs. Smart PLS exhibits both the measurement model and the structural model.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe results indicate that knowledge management capabilities, knowledge sharing, organizational learning capabilities and IT capabilities are the significant factors which influence KMS adoption. This study also identifies some unexpected results.rnrnrnrnrnResearch limitations/implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThe number of responses obtained from the survey was rather small. However, a larger number of responses would probably have resulted in a more accurate finding. Additionally, this study should be verified via a larger sample to increase its generalization.rnrnrnrnrnPractical implicationsrnrnrnrnrnThe result of this study will provide SMEs with valuable guidelines to better understand what factors should be considered as highly important and thus providing decision makers and managers with valuable insights to increase the adoption level of KMSs.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnThe study addresses the research gap by developing and empirically validating a research model of KMS adoption from a different perspective that incorporates critical issues which have never been simultaneously examined.	knowledge management	Fayiz Dahash Shrafat	2018	Business Proc.

The problem with many enterprise KM systems is that they are complex and hardly used, because workers lack motivation to engage in a collaborative process of knowledge sharing and learning. To address this, we developed a gameful learning component of an enterprise KM system (KMS). Our game features an innovative combination of trivia and strategy elements, put together to afford motivation within a KMS. It can be played by employees in the same organization to foster collaborative knowledge exchange and learning.	knowledge management	Dominic Elm;Gustavo Fortes Tondello;Dennis L.

The central question addressed in this article is how and why these communities form and grow over time. These questions are explored through a qualitative analysis of a CoP formed to help knowledge management practitioners. In this case study, a description of how the organization formed, survived, grew and matured over a five-year period (1999-2004) is given. Several practices and structures related to CoP development are identified; for example, operations, roles and responsibilities, communications, sub-group structures, use of information technologies and other aspects of organizing. Using data from several sources (e.g., membership surveys, interviews with key informants, document analysis), four sets of factors that have helped this organization succeed are identified: Individual, Content, Meeting and Organizational. These factors are arranged into a preliminary descriptive model of the function and structure of CoPs over the life cycle. To practitioners, the work sheds light on how to set up and successfully grow a community of practice.	knowledge management;organizing (structure)	Eric W.

bb9ec9342179baf134ad5aab9e30ea04bac197ee	the evolution of organizations and the development of appropriate knowledge structures	knowledge management;knowledge structure;organizations;knowledge organizations;knowledge organization;design methodology	Purpose – Beginning from the premise that organizations go through different stages of development and that different types of knowledge exist, this paper seeks to explore the extent to which organizations need to place greater emphasis on ensuring adequate and relevant access to knowledge, while protecting it from unwarranted dissemination. Design/methodology/approach – Using a stage of development framework, a conceptual argument is presented. It is suggested that, while significant attention is paid to knowledge management in organizations, of even greater importance is the need to develop systems and structures to support access, while protecting it from unwarranted dissemination and possible loss of critical capabilities and competencies. Findings – The paper suggests that there is no single knowledge structure that is appropriate. Instead, organizations must develop different knowledge structures depending on the stage of the organization’s development and the type of knowledge under consideration. In so doing, all efforts must be made to facilitate access to knowledge by those who require it but also to recognize that systems must be employed to prevent unwarranted access. Such unwarranted access may erode competencies and capabilities critical to organizational success. Originality/value – The ideas reinforce the need for organizations to better understand what knowledge they possess and the need to balance requirements for access and control.		Leyland M.

This model focuses on three primary dimensions of online innovation: perceived need, technical capacity, and risk mitigation. It is hypothesized that these three dimensions will have the greatest influence on the development of pre-adoption interest in a new online innovation. This model is then used to examine a single online innovation, personalization of online government information and services. Data from a survey of local governments is used to test the theory. A regression model was estimated from the survey data. Results suggest that perceived need, financial costs, and the ability to mitigate the risks associated with privacy issues each influence the level of interest in personalized online services. The results suggest that public organizations must find reliable means of determining external demand for online innovations, as well as reducing the risks associated with each specific type of online innovation prior to adoption.	e-services;personalization	Charles C.

After compiling significant information from the related literature, a Delphi panel was assembled by selecting a group of experts who has significant knowledge about m-commerce and wireless communications. The panel was requested to comment on a number of m-commerce issues and scenarios gleaned from the literature review, and members of the panel also were asked to indicate which issues were more important and which of the presented scenarios were more likely. Three separate rounds of the Delphi survey were carried out and the final results indicated that the short message service (SMS) and a killer portfolio were the two most likely killer applications of m-commerce. Additionally, four factors—convenience, ease of use, trust, and ubiquity—were identified as the most important to m-commerce success. According to the Delphi results and the experts’ comments, the highlighted features of the killer applications were found to match the most significant critical success factors as voted by the panel.	compiler;embarcadero delphi;exploratory testing;killer application;microsoft office project portfolio server;mobile commerce;usability	Gordon Xu;Jairo A.

Interactive planning and systems thinking provide a robust foundation for rethinking workplace activities, so as to prepare staff members for enhanced participation in an increasingly digital information environment. These organizational development tools activate and extend participants’ knowledge, skills, and abilities through purposeful dialogue that cultivates holistic perspectives. Enhanced appreciation of campus constituencies’ differing needs and preferences, complimented by ongoing user-focused data collection and analysis, informs strategic systems and services redesign. This practice serves to promote continuous learning, even as it advances the organization’s digital migration. Results-to-date suggest the efficacy of this staff development approach, which uses constructivist ‘building on what we know’ learning strategies to develop nimble organizational responsiveness, amidst dynamically changing external circumstances.

The propositions are based on a 6-year longitudinal qualitative case study and analyzed using critical incidents and content analysis. The propositions were discussed in a seminar with project participants. Finally the findings are challenged and sharpened and suggestions for further research are given.	information system	Bjarne Rerup Schlichter;Povl Erik Rostgaard Andersen	2010			implementation;distributed computing;computer science	Web+IR	-83.4253001329926	-3.7048060538479572	140670
8e92caa9be7b5be20b5cb31f6fd7cba35ba3f4f2	an empirical test for the expansion-control model for managing end-user computing		The purpose of this research is to determine if the expansion-control model as proposed, adapted, and refined (Munro and Huff 1985; Munro, Huff and Moore 1987) is useful for understanding and predicting changes in EUC management strategy over time. The long-term interest is not so much in understanding the specific problem of managing end-user computing as in understanding the general problem of managing new information technology in organizations. A field study was conducted with eighteen large firms in manufacturing and services to review their experience with EUC management over a nine year period. As predicted, most firms took a hands-off approach to EUC management during the initiation phase and evolved toward a balance between control and slack by 1987. However, changes in firms' EUC management strategy over time were more complex than predicted. In addition, the expansion and control constructs were not as independent as previously thought. The interaction between the two variables appears to be related, at least in part, to time and the stage of diffusion. The research suggests that current models of EUC management (and thus organizational learning about information technology) may be too simplistic. Suggestions for developing more general models of the process are offered.	control flow;end-user computing;field research;high-frequency direction finding;slack variable	James C. Brancheau;Donald L.

Rather, they provide a powerful platform for accessing information universally. This paper reports a study which scrutinized users’ preference levels with five new mobile phone design features facilitating universal information access through mobile phones: camera, colour screen, voice-activated dialling, Internet browsing, and wireless connectivity (e.g. Bluetooth, infrared, etc.). The survey study involved college students and investigated the degree to which each of the above features impacts the users’ overall satisfaction and enhances the potential of mobile phones to contribute to different aspects of universal access. Our results show that colour screen, voice-activated dialling, and Internet browsing feature can strongly predict users’ satisfaction level, and their preference levels together account for 22.7% of the variance of the users’ overall satisfaction. Users’ satisfaction levels are significantly different between models with colour screen feature and those without, and models with Internet browsing features and those without. Since mobile phone design needs to accommodate the needs and preferences of diversified user groups, the performed study also investigated the difference in users’ preference levels of the five new features for different ethnic groups, and difference in mobile phone owned by different genders. The result indicates that Asian female users in the U.S. market have higher preference level on colour screen feature than Caucasian female users. Significantly higher percentage of male users own phones with camera, Internet browsing, and wireless connectivity features than female users. The empirical study reported in this paper provides a comprehensive picture of how new design features can enhance the mobile phone as a universal access device, and what impact they have brought about. It can also help manufacturers adopt a universal design perspective in view of the differences in preference levels of users with different ethnicity and genders.	bluetooth;information access;mobile phone features;speaker recognition	Chen Ling;Wonil Hwang;Gavriel Salvendy	2006	Universal Access in the Information Society	10.1007/s10209-006-0028-x	mobile search;universal design;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-89.84822654846107	-8.086787317018773	140798
03e6a3ae97810b8c29bdea99e2fe30fed70e62ce	an investigation of iso 26000 and social responsibility practices applied in it companies		Social Responsibility (SR) concerns the way in which organizations achieve their goals. This paper focuses on the overview of the SR as well as the endpoint of the continuous development of SR, the ISO 26000 standard and its core subjects. The aims are to give Information Technology (IT) professionals a better understanding of how to identify the core subjects of ISO 26000 relevant for their organizations and thus behave more responsible by taking actions towards sustainability. As stakeholders demand information and transparency from companies, it is imperative for companies them to report their environmental, economic, and social impact on the community. This paper examines the social responsibility reports, published from corporate websites of some the top IT companies in order to identify the issues that IT companies deal with, as well as in which issues related to the core subject of ISO 26000, they primary focus. The rest of the paper provides an overview on how IT companies can shift towards social responsibility and how they can integrate practices and technologies that benefit community, environment and stakeholders.

25ee4a8ca70a69bc750e8ac3b8bd4f0d8a1476f4	incidental information exchange: a measure for assessing the affect of mediated communication on work relationships	information exchange	This paper proposes a relatively quick method, called incidental information exchange (IIE), for capturing the level of social exchanges which take place within a workgroup. The measure captures the incidental knowledge that co-workers have about each other’s daily life. It is argued that this mutual knowledge sharing is a necessary step in building work relationships. A pilot study was conducted to assess the application of this measure to a workgroup that has had desktop videoconferencing installed in its offices to connect them with another workgroup located in another city. The administration of the measure was then presented to test its validity and reliability.	desktop computer;information exchange;reliability engineering	Suling Zhang;Marilyn Tremaine	2004			management science;knowledge management;computer science;workgroup;validity;information exchange;mediated communication;mutual knowledge;videoconferencing	HCI	-84.9192487678693	-3.658873299142733	141086
f435aa5ff321ac822c6c6943e3333ecbbe962d9f	an effective approach for dealing with the pressure to compromise security during systems development		This study looks into (1) the frequency with which Australian IT professionals compromise security to meet deadlines; (2) the causes of unprofessional behavior in the IT work place; (3) the best approach for tackling unprofessional behavior; and the effectiveness of this approach. These issues were addressed using a mixed research methodology that involved three data collection stages with the input of each stage being the output of the earlier stage. In the first stage, we conducted a survey of 2,315 Australian IT professionals which the Australian Computer Society helped promote. In the second stage, we interviewed 43 Australian IT professionals from six different Australian state capitals to understand the causes of unprofessional behavior in the IT work place and the best approach for tackling unprofessional behavior. Following the research participants’ suggestions, I implemented the approach suggested by the majority of participants. I then shared the links of the approach I implemented with the Australian IT professionals via the Australian Computer Society. In the final stage, I interviewed 28 IT professionals to receive their feedback with regards to the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing young IT professionals’ abilities to recognize unprofessional behavior. This paper presents the results from the three stages of this study.

To the extent that computer software might enhance the creative performance of individual users, organizations might ultimately apply such tools to enhance the creative performance of their employees. Acontrolled laboratqry experiment was performed to determine whether two popular creativity support applications significantly enhanced the creative performance of individual users. The results suggest that responses generated with software support are significantly more novel and valuable than responses generated by pen and paper. The results also question the previous creativity research practice of not directly controlling for idea fluency prior to experimental manipulation. It is hoped the findings from this investigation can be used to improve individual creative performance, further research concerning factors relevant to creativity, and guide future ICSS development efforts.

However, progress in component-based software development has been slower than expected. A possible explanation for this slow progress is that there are not enough software components that can satisfy users (consumers). From this perspective, the purpose of this paper is to increase our knowledge about consumers of software components and to understand what aspects of software components are likely to affect consumer behavior. Specifically, this paper seeks to establish links between objective features of software components and consumers' preferences and purchasing behavior.The pragmatic utility of using objective features as predictors of consumers' behavior in regard to software components can be high. Since these objective features are under the direct control of producers, by understanding the relationship between the objective features and consumer behavior, producers can more effectively develop software components adapted to consumers' needs. We conducted this research in an artificial environment using a system called SofTrade, which was built for the purpose of teaching and studying the design, production, marketing, and purchasing of software components. Our results suggest that objective features of software components can be effective predictors of consumers' preferences and purchasing behavior, and therefore may provide practical guidance to software component producers regarding how to develop more marketable software components.	component-based software engineering;effective descriptive set theory;purchasing;software development	Se-Joon Hong;F.

Whereas conventional Decision Support Systems (DSS) help individual decision makers, GDSS are designed to help groups of senior management and professional groups reach concensus. The paper focuses on one type of GDSS, a decision room in which computers and communications are used by participants during their deliberations. The paper introduces the concepts of private work, public screen, and chauffeur. It then discusses how software and hardware are used in current GDSS. Practical experience has mostly been in laboratory setting. The paper describes existing facilities and reports on the experimental evidence thus far. Special attention is given to the potentials of using gaming and the opportunity for research replication. Although it is not yet possible to prove that GDSS will be viable in the long-term, some potential directions of change can be anticipated if GDSS proves successful.	decision support system	Paul Gray	1987	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/0167-9236(87)90178-3	computer science;knowledge management;operations management;management science;management	ECom	-84.16738715729723	-4.490747755046153	141375
0b395ede2e4b5747aca0b31d0e8794733c6034e4	relationships among open innovation processes, entrepreneurial orientation, and organizational performance of smes: the moderating role of technological turbulence		Open innovation processes have become important mechanisms that are integrated into organization’s innovation strategies to improve performance among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) under dynamic technological settings. This study explored the relationships among open innovation processes (outside-in, inside-out, and coupled), entrepreneurial orientation (EO), and organizational performances (innovation and financial) of SMEs and analyzed the moderating role of technological turbulence on these relationships. Drawing on the technology-based view, we proposed a conceptual framework that depicts how SMEs’ EO facilitates open innovation processes, which consequently affect performance. The empirical results from a sample of 161 Taiwan-based SMEs reveal that EO serves as a precursor for open innovation processes, and practicing specific open innovation processes improve specific performance outcomes. Outside-in process is positively related to both performance outcomes. Inside-out process is linked to financial performance, and the coupled process is linked to innovation performance. Under high degree of technological turbulence, the positive relationship between EO to outside-in and inside-out processes and the relationship between outside-in process to both innovation and financial performance are strengthened. However, high technological turbulence does not facilitate the relationship between EO to the coupled process or the coupled process to both performance outcomes.	open innovation;turbulence	Pei-Hung Ju;Deng-Neng Chen;Yu-Chun Yu;Hsiao-Lan Wei	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40823-6_12	knowledge management;marketing;process management;business	NLP	-80.955742212528	3.445290336325337	141558

Design/methodology/approach – The authors utilize moderated multiple regression (MMR) to explore the complex relationships by using the empirical data of Chinese information technology and electro-communication firms during 2005-2008. Findings – The results show that only a few knowledge properties have negative effects on innovation performance. Most knowledge properties have a positive effect on innovation. The results also claim that the relationship between properties of knowledge and innovation performance is more pronounced when the firm has higher absorptive capacity. Originality/value – The study indicates that properties of knowledge and absorptive capacity are two inseparable determinants for innovation performance, and absorptive capacity moderates the relationship between properties of knowledge and innovation performance.	meet-me room;separable polynomial	Changfeng Wang;Yan Han	2011	J.

Researchers have used the model to study many different IS adoption situations and contexts, and it usually demonstrates validity and reliability. Although TAM was developed in the U.S., the TAM model has also been used in other countries. Transferring a model to another cultural context should be subjected to rigorous testing, and a few studies have begun to examine the applicability of TAM in a small variety of cultures. This study contributes to the growing multi-cultural examination of TAM, and demonstrates that although the model has been successful in predicting adoption behaviours in some international settings, it might not hold in all cultures. Almost 4000 students from several universities around the world provided the data for the study. Data analysis revealed that the TAM model does not hold for certain cultural orientations. Most significantly, low Uncertainty Avoidance, high Masculinity, high-Power Distance, and high Collectivism seem to nullify the effects of Perceived Ease of Use and/or Perceived Usefulness. Since TAM has been shown to be widely applicable to various technological innovations, it is likely to continue to be applied broadly and globally. However, the results of this study suggest the need for caution in applying TAM in at least 20 countries.

This research proposes to resolve this inconsistency between theory and empirical findings. Drawing upon the context contingent model of implementation proposed by Yetton et al. (1997), it is hypothesized that management support is more important to successful implementation in high task interdependence contexts than in low task interdependence contexts.	contingency (philosophy);interdependence	Rajeev Sharma;Philip Yetton	1997		10.1145/353071.353227	sample size determination;meta-analysis;confidence interval;business process reengineering;marketing;operations management;management science;ethnography;standard deviation;management;statistics	HCI	-81.72824787135161	2.492899510350167	142059

In order to improve the efficiency of knowledge communication, organizations need to pay particular attention to the clarity of conveyed knowledge in order not to create confusion, misunderstandings, or misapplication of knowledge. In this contribution, we show where and how the concept of clarity matters for knowledge management in general, and for knowledge communication in particular. We review and operationalize the clarity concept so that it can become the object of a systematic management effort. Furthermore, we show ways of how clarity can be pro-actively and systematically managed. We have tested our conception of clarity in a survey on clarity in knowledge-focused presentations, and we present the results in this article. An outlook on future research on clarity in knowledge management concludes the contribution.	knowledge management;microsoft outlook for mac	Nicole Bischof;Martin J. Eppler	2011	J.

e5f608821f5caf6ef910d17a0955304c2a91ef62	national & municipal government websites: a comparison between the united states and china	united states;china national government web;china municipal government web;national andmunicipal government web;u.s. national government web;u.s. web;municipal web;u.s. municipal web;digital divide;government web;municipal government web	As the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) becomes more prevalent around the globe, the Internet has changed the way government and citizens interact with each other. The development of E-Government has been increasingly considered as a reflection of a country’s informatization, modernization and democratization. In China, as the Internet users increased rapidly (CNNIC, 2005), the E-Government development and innovation is regarded as one of the most important national strategies. Launched in 1999, the “Government Online Project” (Zhou, 2004; Zhang, 2001) in China has successfully helped the country to implement both national and municipal government websites. While the depth and scope of E-Government service is expanding tremendously in China, problems remain in various facets and layers. Meanwhile, the United States has become an innovative leader in E-Government practices. Researching and comparing the government websites in the U.S. and China could provide insights on improving Chinese national and municipal government websites. The motivation of this project comes from the following interests: 1. A big digital divide exists between developing and developed countries (Roisin Woolnough, 2001) . 2. The cultural, economic and political differences between the U.S. and China make government website services interestingly distinct and intriguing for research. 3. Although some research was found examining egovernment in China (Zhou, 2004; Zhang, 2001), little research was done in comparing the United States and China specifically on national and municipal government websites. Yet, it is highly valuable and significant to gain a comparative picture in order to bridge the digital divide. An on-going study, this project aims to explore the commonalities, discrepancies, and patterns by comparing U.S. national versus China national government websites and U.S. municipal versus 1 U.N. Global E-government Readiness Report 2004, http://www.unpan.org/egovernment4.asp China municipal government websites. The goal of the project is to statistically measure the patterns among them, examine how different users access government websites, identify the challenges and weaknesses in G2G (Government to Government), G2B (Government to Business) and G2C (Government to Citizen) services, explore factors that influence government website service level and provide insights on bridging the digital divide of national and municipal government websites between the two countries. This poster reports Phase One of the project: examining the content and services on national and municipal government websites in the United States and China. Through empirical Content Analysis methodology, a random sample of 15 national government websites and 20 municipal government websites were selected from the two countries respectively. They fulfilled a geographical diversity. Two coders, both fluent in Chinese and English, coded the websites and achieved satisfactory inter-coder reliability. The study tries to answer the following questions: what types of content and services are available on national and municipal websites in the two countries? How does U.S. national differ from China national and how does U.S. municipal differ from China municipal government websites? Moreover, the poster presents the patterns found in terms of the digital divide among municipal websites of different locations (coastal, inland; west, east) in each of the two countries. The study also examines indepth on the website functions available for citizens, interaction between the government and citizens, effective online services, etc. The results indicate the following key issues and challenges: • China national government websites tended to provide more information on policy and rules announcement, whereas U.S. national government websites provided more citizen-centered information. • Government websites in the U.S. offered online services to a wider variety of users than China. Disability resources and minority services were especially reflected on U.S. websites. • Many U.S. national government websites offered a clearly categorized structure in terms of G2G, G2B and G2C. However, such trend was not detected on most national level websites in China. • The digital divide among municipal government websites caused by geographical differences was seen bigger in China than in the U.S. The level of service on coastal municipal websites and inland municipal websites showed a large gap in China. Also, eastern municipal websites were generally more functional than western municipal websites in China. Although U.S. and Chinese national websites were found to equally provide timely information, small Chinese cities’ websites were weak on this. The digital divide between municipal sites of big cities and small cities were highly apparent in China. Many small cities’ websites exist, but not useful or functional. • Although some citizen service information was covered on Chinese municipal websites, they were in a format of basic introduction. Deep links and “do-it-online” functions were needed. Services such as e-payment, efilling were seen more common on U.S. websites. U.S. websites were stronger in providing information on emergency solutions and public health. • Government-citizen interaction was less seen on Chinese websites. For instance, many U.S. websites offered citizens the options to access statistical information, government directory, forms downloading, reporting streetlights trouble, etc. On the other hand, Chinese websites were less functional. • U.S. municipal websites were more persona-centered with menu categories specifically prepared for users such as residents, visitors, businesses; whereas, Chinese websites conceived users in a more general way. • Chinese municipal websites were found to provide more information specifically for peasant than U.S. websites. This is also a reflection of different economic structure. Chinese municipal websites did well on linking to other government agency websites and other municipal government websites. • Utility links were provided systematically on U.S. municipal websites such as city interactive map, public transportation information, etc. Chinese websites were on the way to provide some of these information, but less interactive. • Many U.S. websites provided customizable interface for the users to manage their own information needs such as the daily news they need or a specific government services they often desire. These functions were seldom seen on Chinese government websites. • U.S. municipal websites offered more foreign language versions than Chinese websites. The results indicate that a digital divide exist in various facets and layers in content and services of both national and municipal government websites between the United States and China. Interestingly, geographical locations and economic levels caused big gaps among websites of cities of different sizes in different regions in China. The study argues that both infrastructure and policy are highly influential to the success and effectiveness of government websites. Only improving the ICT infrastructure does not necessarily enhance the level of effects of serving citizens’ needs. The study advocates that government websites in China have gained a certain level of foundation, but systematic research and reform is needed in both technical and policy aspect. The study concludes with suggestions for China to bridge the digital divide of national and municipal government websites between the United States and China. These suggestions include enhancing G2G, G2B, and G2C services, facilitating communication and interaction between government and citizens, bridging domestic digital divide through advancing infrastructure and institutionalizing knowledge, providing effective, functional and timely services, and improving usability and ubiquitous accessibility for various citizens. In addition, policy reform is needed in China to allow more transparent information sharing between the government and citizens. The awareness of citizencentered design should also be a future focus in various kinds of egovernment activities. This poster presents the future plan of this project which includes surveying Chinese and American users about their pattern of use of government websites, examining how well citizens are informed about governance, how effective and satisfactory citizens participate in public affairs through government websites, and the barriers that limit their use of government websites.	accessibility;bridging (networking);categorization;china internet network information center;chinese room;directory service;download;e-government;e-services;itil;information needs;map;online banking epayments;usability;user-centered design	Quan Zhou	2005			public relations;marketing;advertising;business	Web+IR	-79.7582192406917	-9.694537016645842	142267

Grounded on two-factor theory and three-factor theory, we propose the features of MIM applications influence the active/passive usage of MIM applications through users’ satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The proposed features are categorized into three factors: exciting factors which contain design aesthetics, customization and enjoyment, performance factors which include sociability, convenience and privacy assurance, and basic factors which are application costs and technical functionality. To test hypothetical relationships in this study, we plan to use a survey method. The potential implications to both literature and practice are discussed.	categorization;instant messaging;multi-factor authentication	Tailai Wu;Yaobin Lu;Xiuyuan Gong;Mingyu Zhang	2015			multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-88.95335886371505	-9.74444677705508	142591

The project combined a research framework based on theories from information system research and regional economics in analyzing the development and diffusion of information and communication technology (ICT) to small, rural enterprises through that network. Our findings indicate that use of the Internet both locally and between the booktowns has strengthened the communication and collaboration between them, thus creating a better basis for the small bookshops to be competitive in the information society. Further, we have found that differences in local innovation systems to some extent have influenced the diffusion processes. Our data also show that the booktown network has been able to compensate for the lack of support in the regional innovation system, which makes the importance of the ICT-based virtual network spanning geographically distributed regions evident. This indicates that the booktown infrastructure and support system has been the most important factor in the bookshops ability to implement and use the new technical solutions.	file spanning;icis;information systems;information system;internet	Ingjerd Skogseid;Arild Jansen	2001			rural internet;virtual network;knowledge management;marketing;the internet;regional innovation system;network society;information society;information system;information and communications technology;computer science	Networks	-78.1734688189477	-8.250850268599283	142735

We start by presenting a quantitative study of the behavior of e-brokers and discuss the influence of regional and cultural issues on them. We then discuss a model that quantifies the efficiency of the results provided by brokers in the electronic marketplace. This model is a function of factors such as server response time and regional factors. Our findings clearly indicate that e-commerce is strongly tied to local language, national customs and regulations, currency conversion and logistics, and Internet infrastructure. We found that the behavior of customers of online bookstores is strongly affected by brand and regional factors. Music CD shoppers show a different behavior that might stem from the fact that music is universal and not so language dependent.  1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

41354da1d8b938d88899ce2d2cc76a02e4dec9d0	extending customer relationship management: from empowering firms to empowering customers	customer data;customer relationship management;service dominant logic;new media;article;customer centricity	Purpose – The focus of customer relationship management (CRM) literature has been predominantly on the firm perspective and on IT, not on customer or service orientation and value co-creation. This paper explores and analyses contemporary CRM frameworks and suggests future research directions. To achieve this, a thorough literature review on CRM is conducted focusing on recent advances within CRM. This provides a good basis for critically analysing the current status of both CRM theory and practice. Design/methodology/approach – We review CRM literature published 2003–2011. Based on the literature review, we introduce a conceptual framework of the changing role of customer data in the CRM framework. Findings – Literature has not adequately addressed the role of the emerging service orientation, value co-creation and the opportunities provided by new technology and communication channels. Drawing on a thorough CRM literature review, we argue that a fundamental change in CRM thinking is needed to shift the focus of CRM from empowering firms to empowering customers. Research limitations/implications – The paper is conceptual in nature and presents only a few empirical examples of the changing role of customer data within the CRM framework. The Accepted for publication in the Journal of Systems & Information Technology 3 paper calls for more research on the emerging service orientation, value co-creation and the impact of new media on the contemporary CRM framework. Practical implications – Customer data remain, and will remain, a critically important input resource informing a firm’s processes. However, using customer data for the benefit of the customer too, to serve customers better, is clearly an emerging phenomenon. Refining and giving customer data back to customers may represent a future mechanism through which companies deepen and develop their customer relationship management to a whole new level. Originality/value – The study is among the first attempting to critically evaluate the contemporary CRM framework from the perspective of empowering customers.

It suggests that the human challenge lies in accepting that individuals in the organisation have both an identity conferred by their role but also a personal and social identity that they bring with them to work. The challenge that faces organisations is to manage this while trying to achieve the optimum configuration of resources in order to meet business objectives. The paper considers the challenges for Information Security from an organisational perspective and develops an argument that builds on research from the fields of management and organisational behaviour. It concludes that the human challenge of Information Security management has largely been neglected and suggests that to address the issue we need to look at the skills needed to change organisational culture, the identity of the Information Security Manager and effective communication between Information Security Managers, end users and Senior Managers.	business process;information security;organizational behavior;security management;while	Debi Ashenden	2008	Inf.

This interdisciplinary area of research has examined interactions between ICT and culture at the group and society levels. However, there is debate within the literature as to the nature of the relationship between culture and technology. In this synthesis, we suggest that the tensions result from the competing ideologies that drive researchers, allowing us to conceptualize the relationship between culture and ICT under three primary models, each with its own assumptions: 1) Social informatics, 2) Social determinism, and 3) Technological determinism. Social informatics views the relationship to be one of sociotechnical interaction, in which culture and ICTs affect each other mutually and iteratively, rather than linearly; the vast majority of the literature approach the relationships between ICT and culture under the assumptions of social informatics. From a socially deterministic perspective, ICTs are viewed as the dependent variable in the equation, whereas, from a technologically deterministic perspective, ICTs are an independent variable. The issues of multiculturalism and ICTs attracted much scholarly attention and have been explored under a myriad of contexts, with substantial literature on global development, social and political issues, business and public administration as well as education and scholarly collaboration. We synthesize here research in the areas of global development, social and political issues, and business collaboration. Finally we conclude by proposing under explored areas for future research directions.	interaction;social informatics;sociotechnical system;technological determinism	Pnina Fichman;Madelyn Sanfilippo	2013		10.2200/S00543ED1V01Y201310ICR030	digital divide;international development;social determinism;computer science;knowledge management;technological determinism;globalization;multiculturalism;world wide web;collaboration	HCI	-78.99130637334598	-1.5800748810652347	143242

Design/methodology/approach – The study adopted a survey method and examined hypotheses by applying the structural equation model method. The unit of analysis was an individual. Findings – The research illustrates that individual knowledge acquisition is influenced by the recipient’s perceived value of knowledge content and knowledge source. The influence differs between those who are experts and those who are novices in the acquired knowledge domain. Research limitations/implications – The data were collected from organizations that were willing to participate in the study and not randomly selected; the possibility that the samples were atypical of a more general population exists. This study advances theoretical development by highlighting individual knowledge acquisition which fills the gap between two main knowledge management processes, i.e. knowledge transfer and knowledge application. Practical implications – Management interest in enhancing knowledge exchange should pay attention to value signals both from knowledge content and knowledge source that influence acquiring knowledge by recipients. Originality/value – By revealing the value factors associated with individual knowledge acquisition and providing empirical evidence, the study contributes to richer understanding of what should be perceived by potential knowledge recipients in order to enhance their acquiring knowledge from others.	knowledge acquisition;knowledge management;randomness;structural equation modeling	Tullawat Pacharapha;Vichita Vathanophas	2012	J.

cf5685f8bd5a492d2be8da13bb45cdbe792fb876	cloud data governance in-light of the saudi vision 2030 for digital transformation		Digital transformation in Saudi Arabia is one of the core elements to achieve the goals of Saudi Vision 2030. In this paper, we argue that data governance plays a vital role for the success of this vision. This role is further emphasized when considering the country’s appetite for emerging technologies such as cloud computing solutions. A thorough survey of literature shows that data governance in general and for cloud computing, more specifically, is under researched. This paper puts the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 for digital transformation under a test. Supported by an empirical study, this paper provides an early warning of a highly likely failure if data governance is not integrated in the vision as a driver for digital transformation. An empirical survey, using a self-administered questionnaire, is conducted to explore and evaluate the status of data governance in the Saudi Arabia. The results of the study reveal that despite the wide recognition of the importance of data governance, especially for cloud computing, there is a consensus that this area is really in its infancy and almost absent from the Saudi organizations.	cloud computing;data governance	Majid Al-Ruithe;Elhadj Benkhelifa	2017	2017 IEEE/ACS 14th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)	10.1109/AICCSA.2017.217	empirical research;management science;computer science;real-time computing;emerging technologies;cloud computing;data modeling;digital transformation;data governance;warning system	Visualization	-79.83984309648415	0.19084352218219153	143513

The cost of ERP implementation failures is exceedingly high in terms of quantifiable financial resources and organizational disruption. The lack of good explanatory and predictive models makes it difficult for managers to develop and plan ERP implementation projects with any assurance of success. In this paper we investigate the Klein & Sorra theoretical model of implementation effectiveness. To test this model we develop and validate a data collection instrument to capture the appropriate data, and then use multivariate adaptive regression splines to examine the assertions of the model and suggest additional significant relationships among the factors of their model. Our research offers new dimensions for studying managerial interventions in IT implementation and insights into factors that can be managed to improve the effectiveness of ERP implementation projects.	denial-of-service attack;erp;enterprise resource planning;multivariate adaptive regression splines;predictive modelling;smoothing spline;spline (mathematics);theory	Kweku-Muata Osei-Bryson;Linying Dong;Ojelanki K.

Design/methodology/approach Survey data was collected from 233 respondents across a variety of industries in Taiwan and the data was analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis. Findings The results showed that both knowledge sharers and knowledge recipients benefitted from knowledge sharing, developing deeper and wider knowledge, leading to better performance, and that the benefits were greater for the knowledge sharers. Practical implications It is suggested that managers advocate knowledge sharing as a learning activity for both knowledge sharers and knowledge recipients. Regular knowledge sharing activities are advised, with knowledge sharers engaged fully in active learning, and knowledge recipients encouraged to take a more active role, by not only listening...

Some researches were focused on the influence of perceived use (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) on attitude and symbolic adoption based on the theory of technology acceptance model (TAM). Others studied the critical success factors from organizational or personal aspects. However, few scholars put them together to examine the influence of critical success factors on PU and PEU, which are key factors to user acceptance to ERP system. This study develops an integrative framework that links leadership’s support, training abilities, change management abilities, business processing abilities and learning abilities with PU and PEU. The present structural equation model encompasses these relationships on the basis of a survey of 340 managers and end-users. This paper highlights two main results. First, leadership’s support and training abilities have significant impacts on organizational business processing abilities. Second, change management abilities, business processing abilities and learning abilities, have significant impacts on user perceived ease of use. These findings will help managers to understand that user’s perceived ease of use should be considered on organizational level in the construction and implementation of an ERP system.	business process;change management (engineering);erp;enterprise resource planning;failure rate;ibm tivoli access manager;one-class classification;structural equation modeling;usability	Dong Cheng;Dehong Yang;Jidong Han;Yuanfang Song	2007		10.1007/978-0-387-75902-9_29	systems engineering;knowledge management;process management;business	HCI	-81.97230010526424	2.6173995862882475	143793

44a929f6774df2957f8685ed6db223f1fbd98230	multi source feedback based performance appraisal system using fuzzy logic decision support system		In Multi-Source Feedback or 360 Degree Feedback, data on the performance of an individual are collected systematically from a number of stakeholders and are used for improving performance. The 360-Degree Feedback approach provides a consistent management philosophy meeting the criterion outlined previously. The 360-degree feedback appraisal process describes a human resource methodology that is frequently used for both employee appraisal and employee development. Used in employee performance appraisals, the 360-degree feedback methodology is differentiated from traditional, top-down appraisal methods in which the supervisor responsible for the appraisal provides the majority of the data. Instead it seeks to use information gained from other sources to provide a fuller picture of employees’ performances. Similarly, when this technique used in employee development it augments employees’ perceptions of training needs with those of the people with whom they interact. The 360-degree feedback based appraisal is a comprehensive method where in the feedback about the employee comes from all the sources that come into contact with the employee on his/her job. The respondents for an employee can be her/his peers, managers, subordinates team members, customers, suppliers and vendors.

A survey addressing KM perception, understanding, practice and implementation was distributed to a population of Irish IT professionals, with principal survey trends further investigated by virtue of a case study undertaken on an Irish IT Manager in an organisation with a history of KM initiatives. This case study narrative describes the level of involvement of the IT professional in organisational KM and the extent of the support role played by KMS, allowing the conclusion that KMS responsibilities do play an important part in his job role and that he plays a critical role in formal knowledge structures. The narrative shows how a lack of IT professional participation may be preferable for KM success in addition to illustrating the role of the IT professional as a KM change agent.	knowledge management;management system	John G.

However, abandonment of IS projects is an aspect of IS failure that has not gained much attention in either IS practice or research. This article examines the organizational practices resulting in the underlying characteristics of IS project abandonment. The results of a survey show IS project abandonment to be a complex multidimensional issue defying easy explanations. IS projects may be abandoned for any combination of factors including cost overruns and/or schedule slippages, technological inadequacies, and behavioral, political, or organizational issues. The last set of factors emerged as being the most dominant in most companies' decisions.	exploratory testing;information systems	Kweku Ewusi-Mensah;Zbigniew H.

The purpose of the service was to support civic participation and integration of immigrants in Finland. Open participatory design approach was used throughout the process. This paper presents critical issues and lessons learnt during the process of working together with a heterogeneous user group and multiple partners. We claim that constant meta-level discussion about the goals and participation practices with the users is vital for the design process. When designing services for civic participation, more focus should be put on designing and testing concrete participation processes. Clear ownership and community management are needed during the design and use of the future service.	social media	Asta Bäck;Pirjo Friedrich;Teemu Ropponen;Auli Harju;Kari A.

29b1c19df1540497516c3365cf5dc84c7294de5d	to use or not to use: modelling end user grumbling as user resistance in pre-implementation stage of enterprise resource planning system		The success rate of enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation is less than 49% around the world owing to its complex nature. The key focus of information system (IS) researchers has been to explore the ways to reduce threats to ERP implementation posed especially by user resistance. Although the reasons for user resistance have already been dealt with in previous studies, our understanding of how users assess a new ERP system in the pre-implementation phase and what prompts their decision to resist it is far from complete. In particular, an explanation for user resistance or end-user grumbling from the perspectives of status quo bias and technostress was found to be missing. In order to fill this gap in research, the model proposed in the present study integrates status quo and technostress, thus throwing light on the end-user grumbling behaviour that precedes the implementation of a new ERP system. Data was collected via a survey questionnaire distributed to 221 respondents from five different manufacturing industries in Bangladesh which are currently in the process of installing the popular SAP ERP system. Results of this tested model indicate a significant impact of the constructs of status quo bias and technostress on end-user grumbling. Additionally, end user grumbling has positive significant impact on symbolic adoption. Moreover, the paper discusses common method bias and the limitations of the study, while providing an outlook for future research.	enterprise resource planning	Imran Mahmud;Thurasamy Ramayah;Sherah Kurnia	2017	Inf.

9c2b3da3c3985211f43be1f2628955670f0041e5	towards successful crowdsourcing projects: evaluating the implementation of governance mechanisms	information management	The last decade has witnessed the proliferation of crowdsourcing in various academic domains including strategic management, computer science, or IS research. Numerous companies have drawn on this concept and leveraged the wisdom of crowds for various purposes. However, not all crowdsourcing projects turn out to be a striking success. Hence, research and practice are on the lookout for the main factors influencing the success of crowdsourcing projects. In this context, proper governance is considered as the key to success by several researchers. However, little is known about governance mechanisms and their impact on project outcomes. We address this issue by means of a multiple case analysis in the scope of which we examine crowdsourcing projects on collaboration-based and/or competition-based crowdsourcing systems. Our initial study reveals that task definition mechanisms and quality assurance mechanisms have the highest impact on the success of crowdsourcing projects, whereas task allocation mechanisms are less decisive.	computer science;crowdsourcing;strategic management;the wisdom of crowds	Shkodran Zogaj;Niklas Leicht;Ivo Blohm;Ulrich Bretschneider	2015			public relations;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;management science;information management;management;world wide web	Web+IR	-78.99899227228673	0.0650621392312221	144405

Despite the substantive economic and efficiency-related implications of OSS adoption, there is surprisingly little research into the determinants of the diffusion of OSS across public sector jurisdictions. In this article we explore the variation in OSS adoption among Dutch local administrations. The Dutch central government adopted a policy to stimulate the use of OSS in the public sector, but the non-mandatory character of the policy resulted in great differences in the degree of adoption of OSS at the local level. Using data from a new survey of municipalities in the Netherlands and proportional odds statistical models to analyze the data, we show that the degree of OSS adoption crucially depends on the presence of boundary spanners and political commitment within the local government. On the other hand, oft-suspected factors like financial stress and jurisdiction size have no discernible effects. Our findings have implications for understanding the spread of OSS in the public sector and for public policies designed to encourage OSS diffusion.	open-source software	Alexander van Loon;Dimiter Toshkov	2015	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2015.01.004	public relations;public economics;public administration;management	NLP	-84.24066888655068	-3.4741448860687303	144721

It was apparent the transactional process was being used to present consumers with optional extras (and other decisions) that not only slowed the process down, but also stressed and agitated users. The research identified some new and unusual decision constructs such as the 'must-opt'. This paper seeks to produce a taxonomy of the type and nature of decision constructs encountered throughout on-line Business-to-Consumer (B2C) transactional processes. The findings presented herein make an incremental contribution in theorizing, identifying and analyzing new decision constructs alongside established ones.	genesis;interaction;nudge (instant messaging);online and offline;online shopping;taxonomy (general);usability;user experience design	Ann M.

To better understand the enterprise analysts' ecosystem, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 35 data analysts from 25 organizations across a variety of sectors, including healthcare, retail, marketing and finance. Based on our interview data, we characterize the process of industrial data analysis and document how organizational features of an enterprise impact it. We describe recurring pain points, outstanding challenges, and barriers to adoption for visual analytic tools. Finally, we discuss design implications and opportunities for visual analysis research.	adobe streamline;ecosystem;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;imagery;pain;semiconductor industry	Sean Kandel;Andreas Paepcke;Joseph M.

Results are presented from questionnaires, interviews, and travel diaries from participants, and contrasted with results from non-participant questionnaires and interviews. Findings suggest that potential early users (innovators/early adopters) are initially motivated by curiosity, but that this must be transformed into practical motivations such as convenience and economic advantage if the users are to remain motivated to using the service. Concern for the environment functions as a bonus rather than a primary motivator, meaning that the environmentally friendly choice must also be the practical choice in order to promote sustainability. However, perceived impracticalities can act as deterrents to adoption. Therefore, the service cannot be perceived as economically disadvantageous, inflexible or inconvenient, or difficult to use; and the alternative transportation infrastructure must be extensive enough to reach the users.

Because cryptocurrency research has not gained much attention from Information Systems (IS) researchers and needs a more vivid discussion, this review summarizes the main concepts of 42 papers and aligns them to IS Research. Although, cryptocurrency research has not reached IS mainstream yet, there is massive potential for multifaceted research ranging from protocol development to designing alternative digital currency schemes. Cryptocurrencies entail a core digital artifact and present a rich phenomenon based on the intertwining of technological artifacts and social contexts. We argue that cryptocurrencies are an alternative payment method that may replace intermediaries with cryptographic methods and should be embedded in the research areas of SIGeBIZ and SIGSEC. At the end of this literature review, we discuss some open research gaps like new business models based on cryptocurrencies or the influence of culture on cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency	Marcel Morisse	2015			management science;computer science;cryptocurrency;knowledge management;information system;systematic review;open research;digital currency;ranging;business model;phenomenon	Crypto	-78.40781699529913	-0.6242597435261111	145346

Several strategies for reducing the threat of botnets have been outlined in the cyber security literature. These strategies typically call for both Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and home Internet users to adopt a greater share of the responsibility for overall security. However, to date no study has attempted to determine how accepting the public would be of these strategies. This study takes the first step in filling that gap. The results of this pilot survey suggest that, in general, individuals would be willing to spend additional time each month meeting security requirements set by their ISPs. The results also suggest that although only 50% of respondents would be willing to pay their ISP more per month to protect themselves from cyber threats, more people would be willing to do so if they perceived ISPs as being effective or very effective at reducing such threats. The findings provide important guidance for policy makers and ISPs seeking to gain support for such strategies.	botnet	Brent Rowe;Dallas Wood;Douglas S.

However, little is known about how people coordinate their work activities, especially when confronted with computer systems that are intended to support collaboration. This paper examines how a close-knit group of engineers attempt to collaborate when managing a networked system whilst at the same time trying to maintain coordination of their interdependent work activities. Drawing from theoretical constructs developed in distributed cognition, an analysis is presented that contrasts the role played by common objects and mediating mechanisms in coordinating such activities with the negotiative practices that emerge when they break down. The implications of the problematic and dynamic nature of coordination is subsequently discussed in relation to CSCW design.	computer;computer-supported cooperative work;distributed cognition;interdependence;while	Yvonne Rogers	1993	Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)	10.1007/BF00754332	socially distributed cognition;human–computer interaction;computer science;management;operations research;world wide web	HCI	-82.62773843492663	-4.595717709263342	145406

Recently, researchers in the field have suggested that designers of charging mechanisms must also pay attention to the type of information technology and to the phase of the diffusion lifecycle. Specifically, innovation-oriented organizations have been advised to design liberal low charges either for communication technologies or during the technology initiation phase.The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it organizes published recommendations under one conceptual framework, whereby charging is adapted according to both the technology type and the phase of the diffusion lifecycle. Second, where diffusion patterns are most sensitive to the charging policy, i.e., for communication technologies during the initiation and perhaps even the adaptation phase of the lifecycle, we go beyond existing recommendations and advocate negative charging. Mini-cases serve to illustrate the various recommended charging options.

On the one hand, it aims to define the concept of virtuality and provide a multidimensional approach to assess its different levels based on the main characteristics of virtual teams expressed in the literature. On the other hand, it analyzes how variations in virtuality influence team effectiveness. The effectiveness measures retained in this study are: work performance, attitudes and behaviours. A longitudinal qualitative study was conducted on ten virtual teams composed of three to five students involved in online Master degree programmes at a French university. The results highlighted the importance of differentiating technological and social virtuality to improve our understanding of team virtuality and to better apprehend its effects on team effectiveness.	computer performance;exploratory testing;virtuality (gaming)	Nabila Jawadi;Nabila Boukef Charki	2009			simulation;engineering;knowledge management;social psychology	HCI	-86.28667365100561	-1.077873920347163	145755

More recent research has recognized that co-worker advice, which represents situated and improvised learning, can also be an important factor that can enable or impede system use. In addition, because advice from co-workers represents the social context by which the impacts of other traditional CBs are embedded, they may have the potential to alter the relationships between traditional CBs and system use. Against this backdrop, we examined the direct effects of CBs about advice from co-workers on system use as well as its ability to moderate the effects of other types of CBs on system use. To accomplish this, we conducted a three-month study of 112 employees in one business unit of an organization. Results supported our hypotheses that CBs about advice from co-workers directly influence system use and moderate the effects of other CBs on system use.		Lionel P.

In local accounts, we see an emphasis on organizing together to create shared spaces for collaborative use of resources and joint ownership of projects and places. Whereas, many global business models feature significant elements of renting, leasing and hiring and focus only on resource management, sometimes at the expense of community growth. The service we discuss is based in the area we studied and has a collective model of sharing, but hopes to be part of the new global movement. We use this hybridity to problematize issues of culture, place and scalability in developing sharing resources and addressing sustainability concerns. We relate this to the motivation, rhetoric and design choices of other local sharing enterprises and other global sharing economy initiatives, arguing, in conclusion, that there is no sharing economy, but a variety of new cultures	crowdfunding;organizing (structure);scalability;sharing economy	Ann Light;Clodagh Miskelly	2015	IxD&A		knowledge management;sharing economy;political science;socioeconomics;management	HCI	-77.49107557787009	-6.876692992572887	145855

Semi-structured interviews with key healthcare stakeholders were conducted. The findings are sobering. First, privacy safeguards are driven by legal compliance, competitive advantages, available resources and best practices. However, organizations have to balance conflicting risks associated with these drivers. Second, this study identifies the operational and behavioral outcomes which results in major balance issues. Third, the adoption of a privacy impact assessment (PIA) allows the integration of a risk management approach to effectively assess the different types of privacy risks. The findings provide evidence for: (1) a gap between privacy responses and their outcomes on healthcare practice and delivery; (2) the importance of the privacy impact assessment as a risk management tool; and (3) the challenging context of the healthcare environment of how privacy responses are unfolding.	best practice;information privacy;message understanding conference;risk management;semiconductor industry;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Rachida Parks;Chao Chu;Heng Xu;Lascelles Adams	2011			public relations;social science;privacy by design;knowledge management;environmental resource management;grounded theory	ML	-80.2720302347435	-1.8662340749290127	145954

The paper reflects on the obverse condition where the lack of correspondence may facilitate failure. Design/methodology/approach – The paper applies Stafford Beer’s viable systems model to consider management and leadership’s relationship in the organisational context and draws on the practice of leadership and management to support the theoretical assertions. Findings – That management and leadership are key processes in organising that need to be in mutual correspondence in order to sustain the viability of the organisation. Research limitations/implications – The paper explores management and leadership from a systems perspective and so further practical work could be initiated to consider both successful organising and failure. Practical implications – The paper is attempting to demonstrate that organisations may need to develop leadership and management contiguously as control and viability drivers; and that the duopoly of management and leadership is at the heart of the cybernetics of organising. Originality/value – The paper attempts to consider the seminal cybernetic process of organising.	cybernetics;viable system model	James Rowe	2010	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684921011062728	leadership;cybernetics;transactional leadership;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;management science;neuroleadership;viable system model;strategic management	HCI	-79.21195920083464	2.492676772548973	146476

We emphasize the interplay of three different network processes: resource and information transfer, status signaling and certification, and social influence. Different mixes of these mechanisms characterize disparate networks because the obligations imposed by ties and the capacities of partners result in situations where mechanisms amplify or diminish one another. We test hypotheses about mechanism interactions using four years (1997–2000) of data on high-technology IPOs that situate organizational decisions about whether to withdraw an offering in two distinct networks. We find that network mechanisms exert multiple moderating effects on one another and that those effects vary systematically across venture capital syndicate and director interlock networks. These findings help to explain why different networks exert disparate effects, why the effects of some structures change as their larger contexts shift, and why even very successful organizations can sometimes find themselves hamstrung by their connections. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While the extant technology acceptance research has mainly studied user acceptance of various ICTs, there is a dearth of research on consumer acceptance of personal ICT services. In this paper, we extend the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology to the context of ICT services by examining the moderating role of ICT service type. We tested the proposed model in a large-scale survey of 4777 consumers, including both potential and current consumers of mobile data services (MDS), of two different types of MDS: communication and infotainment services. The results strongly supported the model with service type moderating key relationships. The findings have theoretical and practical implications for digital service management in particular and service science in general.		James Y. L.

This study, building on prior literature on continued usage in IS as well as the resource-based view, proposed a model to address this gap. Our model suggests that perceived value, a major driving force for members’ satisfaction and continuance intention, is affected by four kinds of resources embedded in virtual communities, which are relationship resources, technology infrastructure, knowledge resources and human resources. To provide additional insights on the pivotal role of perceived value, we also postulate that experience moderates the link between perceived value and its antecedents. Data collected from 235 members of a professional virtual community provide strong support for the research model. It was found that perceived value exerts a great effect on ...	virtual community	Chun-Ming Chang;Meng-Hsiang Hsu;Cheng-Se Hsu;Hsiang-Lan Cheng	2014	Behaviour & IT	10.1080/0144929X.2012.745607	psychology;knowledge management;social psychology	HCI	-84.98946749112834	-0.7074156066647646	146765

BIM enhances construction player to perform their activities in effective and efficient through the development of three dimensional (3D) model. However, BIM requires changes in current practices among construction players in terms of the processes and technology that use for managing projects. Therefore, this paper is aimed to discuss on roles and responsibilities of construction players in projects using BIM. This is a review paper that discusses on BIM, its definition, activities with roles and responsibilities of construction players in managing projects. The findings revealed that roles and responsibilities of construction players in projects using BIM are differ from conventional practice by the use of BIM tool. The findings of this paper provide useful information for construction players that considering implementing BIM in projects.	bim;building information modeling;information model	Aryani Ahmad Latiffi;Juliana Brahim;Mohamad Syazli Fathi	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-33111-9_16	building information modeling;construction engineering;engineering;civil engineering;transport engineering	Robotics	-82.87294597752138	-2.6952194293056233	146874

Although the role of tactical marketing in increasing awareness and enhancing adoption has been recognised, strategies required for realising the benefits of marketing e-government services have not been forthcoming. Given that citizens’ usage behaviour of e-government services remains sub-optimal and the potential contribution of marketing, we propose a set of marketing-based strategic approaches and argue that they can play an essential role in enhancing adoption of e-government initiatives and propelling citizen’s engagement with e-governance. Based on citizens’ differential levels of usage behaviour of e-government services and benefits sought from engaging in e-governance, this article classifies citizens into six distinct segments and suggests generic strategic approaches.

Managers and whole organisations must balance competing stakeholders, some of whom induce higher priority (salience) in the consideration of their wants, needs, claims, and demands. This paper introduces procedures that measure stakeholder salience, assign stakeholders to typology categories, and map stakeholder salience as suggested by Mitchell et al. (1997) in order for researchers and managers to identify important stakeholders and investigate why they matter. This effort extends their proposition that salience can be determined solely by three attributes of Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency with new measures that may be subject to more 'fine-grained' empirical analysis. These measures are introduced and demonstrated through the results of a pilot study.	theory	Steven A.

However, most of the research to date has focused on understanding, analyzing and designing for external interruptions. The causes of self-interruptions are not well understood. In this paper we present an analysis of 889 hours of observed task switching behavior from 36 individuals across three high-technology information work organizations. Our analysis suggests that self-interruption is a function of organizational environment and individual differences, but also external interruptions experienced. We find that people in open office environments interrupt themselves at a higher rate. We also find that people are significantly more likely to interrupt themselves to return to solitary work associated with central working spheres, suggesting that self-interruption occurs largely as a function of prospective memory events. The research presented contributes substantially to our understanding of attention and multitasking in context.	computer multitasking;interrupt;prospective search	Laura A.

It occurs for a multitude of decision types, and is enabled by IT support. However no systematic study of the use and impact of such IT-based environments on decision outcomes has been done. In this research I develop a taxonomy of information environments and the information and coordination mechanisms made available in a distributed collaborative environment (DCE). I will use this taxonomy to study the fit between use of the DCE and the information environment in which decisions are made. I hypothesize that use of appropriate coordination mechanisms for inputs and processes improves decision outcomes. I will test the model in an empirical field study of two different operational decision types made with and without a DCE in offshore oil production.	field research	Anne Quaadgras	2006			knowledge management;computer science;management science;multitude;group decision-making	Web+IR	-87.66448395569121	0.2330996599906511	147676

Indigenous knowledge focuses on that knowledge, frequently contained in oral systems, that has evolved over the time that Native Peoples have inhabited their homelands.

A set of supply chains that are interdependent is called a holistic supply chain network (H-SCN) in this paper. There is a need to focus on building the resilience (in short, the ability of a system to recover from damage or disruption) of an entire H-SCN as it is believed that such a network system is strongly relevant to the recent economic recession that is triggered by financial crises. The objectives of this paper are to provide a classification of different SCNs in literature, leading to the identification of a new type of SCN system, i.e., an H-SCN, and to discuss the state of knowledge on the resilience of SCNs, particularly of an H-SCN. A systematic review approach is applied in this paper. Another contribution of this paper is the provision of a more comprehensive definition and description of resilient systems, including SCN systems. A final contribution of this paper is the proposal of the future directions of research on resilient SCN systems, particularly resilient H-SCN systems.		Junwei Wang;Raja R.

Little attention has been paid so far to fully and unambiguously capture the complex nature of IT security risks and how to measure it. Against this backdrop, we first propose a comprehensive conceptualization of Perceived IT Security Risks (PITSR) in the CC context that is based on six distinct risk dimensions grounded on an extensive literature review, Q-sorting, and expert interviews. Second, a multiple-indicators and multiple-causes analysis of data collected from 356 organizations is found to support the proposed conceptualization as a second-order aggregate construct.

Current conceptualisations of CoPs don’t, however, acknowledge adequately the inherent tensions between practices and the organisations within which they function. This failure leads to an inadequate understanding of ways in which organisations should interact with relevant CoPs. It is assumed in these conceptualisations that CoPs can be managed, like any other asset, in the process of creating benefit for the organisation. This paper draws on MacIntyre’s understanding of practices and institutions and on Lave & Wenger’s notion of CoPs. The paper argues that the relation between organisations and practices can best be described as a duality. The concept of duality signifies a relation characterised by both mutual dependence and inherent incompatibility. CoPs need organisations to sustain them and organisations need CoPs to create value. Their incompatibility relates to their divergent natures and goals. The best benefit for organisations is gained when attempts are not made to neutralise this duality, but to learn how to work with it. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) should be developed and employed in such a way that this duality is respected and maintained.

Juxtaposing theories on crisis and strategies of image restoration the paper aims to analyze the recent Maggi Crisis. The case study takes Twitter and Facebook as points of analysis. The paper observes that although social networking site facilitates immediate communication, it can cause a lot of damage to the reputation of the organization if utmost care is not taken in the message that goes out. The paper will further analyze the possibilities and limitations provided by social networking sites to the companies at the time of crisis. The paper concludes that damage control to a great extent could be exercised through adoption of apt strategies right away.

This paper is the first report of a research project on the effects of information service to business in Japanese public libraries. The overall goals of the project are to develop a conceptual framework for understanding effects of a library service and then to examine them in business information service. The objective of this first report is to get an overview of current practice of business information service in Japanese public libraries and examine images of users and uses by librarians in charge.#N#Method. The project consists of three stages. At the first stage a series of field trips was conducted with semi-structured interviews in twenty-two libraries throughout Japan and a focus group interview of librarians in charge of the service was also conducted (not reported here).#N#Results. A variety of services is provided by public libraries. Levels of reference service and relationships with other agencies and organizations are the most important factors in determining the nature and kind of service provided. Providing the service is actually a complex process influenced by many factors. #N#Conclusions. Results suggest strongly the complex process of value creation. Images of users and uses are formed not only by direct contact with users but as a result of this complex process. Sometimes images have political connotations as both librarians and other stakeholders hope the service to be useful in promoting local business and/or industry and advancing local lives.	library (computing);public library	Shunsaku Tamura;Makiko Miwa;Yasunori Saito;Mika Koshizuka;Yumiko Kasai;Mamiko Matsubayashi;Nozomi Ikeya	2007	Inf.

In this context, this study aims to identify motivators, barriers and critical key factors affecting the adoption of GSCM activities in Lebanese manufacturing industries. With a positivist approach and a deductive reasoning, the use of a survey over a sample of 37 among 60 Lebanese companies having green initiatives, permits to study and verify established hypotheses with a 95% confidence level and a 10% acceptable error. Questions were asked to find the link between different factors and the GSCM adoption rate and to identify the most important ones. Quantitative analytical techniques were used to draw conclusions from this data regarding existing relationships among factors affecting the adoption rate of GSCM. The paper reveals that GSCM adoption is positively correlated with the competitive advantage motivators and partially with the stakeholders motivators. Where the negative correlation between resources and stakeholders barriers were both partially confirmed. ISO14001 certified companies have shown a higher adoption rate of GSCM. The research studied only the correlation between GSCM adoption with perceived benefits and pressures and couldn't establish the causality due to the proxy used for the adoption of GSCM; This is the first study looking for GSCM issues in the Lebanese manufacturing industry and hence will serve as a foundation for further studies in green and sustainable management in Lebanon, and can be adapted by sector and area of GSCM. The paper is original in the way it uses the dual factor theory to introduce the hygiene factors that, if they were nonexistent would limit the level of adoption of GSCM activities. An additional added value established the link between GSCM adoption and the top motivators and barriers and in Lebanon.	causality	Richard Saade;Mira Thoumy;Omar Sakr	2016	2016 3rd International Conference on Logistics Operations Management (GOL)	10.1109/GOL.2016.7731692	operations management;business;management;commerce	HCI	-81.65812089715526	0.0020518192971653837	148359

As the focus is turned to on-line technologies, the design question becomes one of privacy protection not privacy negotiation and conflict resolution. However, the findings from a large privacy survey and the outputs of several follow-up focus groups reflect a need for privacy systems to also support different types of privacy and consent dialogues. These dialogues are used to support the resolution of privacy dilemmas through the selection of effective privacy protection practices. As the face to face contact between service user and service provider decreases, the potential for these types of dialogues to become increasingly important grows. The work presented in this paper forms the initial part of a study to learn more about the types of privacy dialogue and negotiation that should be deployed in on-line services. In this position paper we outline the types of privacy and consent dialogues that service providers and service users want to have. We also explore how a socio-technical approach should ideally form the basis of the design and implementation of any dialogue system.	dialog system;focus group;online and offline;personally identifiable information;privacy;sociotechnical system	Lizzie Coles-Kemp;Elahe Kani-Zabihi	2010		10.1145/1900546.1900560	service provider;privacy software;computing;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;knowledge management;focus group;conflict resolution;privacy for research participants;internet privacy;privacy;computer security	HCI	-83.98294970109839	-8.182660358202433	148689
86317a91f9076db8fdb86a58fca8ef50fb1f341b	a conjoint analysis of a next generation network (ngn) in japan		A conjoint analysis on a Web survey in 2010 with 160 participants and 8 questions shows that a Marginal Willingness To Pay (MWTP) on a Next Generation Network (NGN) of Flet’s Hikari Next is lower than its actual price as provided by NTT East. Conjoint analysis is one application of conditional logit. MWTP is WTP when one unit of property is increased, and MWTP is used to verify how much each person evaluates each property. Higher transmission speed, digital TV availability, and higher Internet security affect the MWTP positively, and the amount of the monthly payment of NGN affects the MWTP negatively. Therefore, it is assumed that the NGN of Flet’s Hikari Next by NTT East will be accepted by potential customers and diffused as a major communications service of NTT East and NTT West. NGN providers may be able to maximize their benefits by adjusting the NGN of Flet’s Hikari Next property to meet customer demands, especially in digital TV availability, higher transmission speed, and communications security.	next-generation network	Naoki Takano	2013	The Review of Socionetwork Strategies	10.1007/s12626-013-0037-1	marketing;operations management;advertising	NLP	-88.29712576062506	-7.804790776688144	148757

Results from a two-semester study with 24 teams enrolled in global software development courses at Universities in Turkey, Panama, and the US reveal that the presence of different team leadership arrangements resulted in differences in the communication response patterns among group members. Assigned leader groups tended to show more distributed communication response patterns than those teams with Emergent leaders. Moreover, the communication responses within Assigned leader groups tended to be more directed toward non-leaders than those that occurred within Emergent leader groups. Finally, results of this study indicate that Assigned leader groups tend to develop a very different structure of communication than that which occurs in Emergent leader groups.	emergent;focus group;software development	Ian Brooks;Kathleen M.

43eec45367dc2925caca1e551593d160ab014098	observing organizational environments: a systematic approach for information analysts		Information Analysts observe the elements of an organization in order to gain information unavailable through interviewing and the investigation of hard data. In the past the process of observation has been intuitive at best. This article describes and develops a systematic methodology for analyzing the internal organizational environment. The approach is based on a framework used in film criticism called mise-en-scSne analysis. Seven major concrete and abstract elements which influence organizational decisions are identified: office lighting and color; office design, space, and location; clothing of decision makers; individual and group decision making; abilities of decision makers; attention to multiple objectives; and cognitive maps of decision makers. The systematic framework for observation developed in this article is an alternative to the common sense approach to observation. The major advantage of the mis-en-sc~ne approach is that it allows the Information Analyst to classify, document, and interpret important factors which usually remain at the subconscious level.	cognitive map	Kenneth E.

Although family firm is the predominant form of business organisation, no study has analysed their peculiarities in adopting teleworking practices. Family firms are characterised by the alignment of interests of ownership and management, long-term orientation and the pursuit of non-economic objectives. Grounded in the socio-emotional wealth approach and the Technology Acceptance Model, this study examines the idiosyncrasies of family governance in the perception of teleworking benefits and barriers to the adoption of teleworking. Using a sample of 200 Spanish companies, differences are found in the perceived barriers to teleworking. Although family firms perceive higher barriers, they do not influence on teleworking adoption. In contrast, in non-family firms, the decision to adopt teleworking is influenced by both the perceived benefits of teleworking and the perceived barriers. This means that Spanish family firms adopt teleworking evaluating only the perceived benefits. Although family firms may fear problems arising from teleworking when they decide to adopt it, they are more confident in their ability to implement it.

This paper analyzes the main IT governance domains (i.e., IT strategic alignment, IT risk management, IT value delivery, IT resource management, and IT performance management) and the presence of several IT governance mechanisms that constitute antecedents of IT governance effectiveness. We used partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses based on survey data from 87 large Brazilian companies.

In this study, we integrate constructs from two additional perspectives and discuss their interdependencies with ISCT. We argue that the promising framework proposed by Sørebø et al. [1], which extends ISCT with self-determination theory (SDT), can increase its managerial relevance by adding the variables of users' perceptions of goal divergence and risk aversion, selected from agency theory. The empirical results support Sørebø et al.'s main findings and strongly support the impact of perceived goal divergence on e-learning continuance intention. By replicating and extending the main findings of the original target study, the results of the present study support the demand for an integrative perspective on IS continuance intention which includes ISCT, SDT and principal-agent theory (PAT).	information system;interdependence;relevance;replication (computing);risk aversion;service description table;whole earth 'lectronic link	Tove Bøe;Boge Gulbrandsen	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.20	replication;self-determination theory;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;higher education;management;law;information technology;information system	HCI	-87.19902518975275	-3.2886151620982718	150066

However, few empirical studies have examined the effects of firms’ internal and external factors on their ISM processes. This study investigates the role of Need Pull and Technology Push on the ISM process, and examines the regulatory pressure within ISM process. To test the research model, the study considers data from a random sample of organizations obtained through the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), the Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (KOSDAQ), and the Korea Foreign Company Association (FORCA). Results demonstrate that need-pull and technology-push had positive effects on the ISM process. In addition, regulatory pressure as a moderator had positive effects between ISM awareness ISM development and ISM development ISM performance.	google moderator;information security;information system;sfiaplus;security management	Geuna Kim;SangHyun Kim;Aaron M.

Based on the descriptive analysis of two national surveys on ICT use by governments and citizens and the democracy cube framework, three main challenges were identified to promote e-participation in Brazilian public sector decisions via social media: i) reduce the digital divide; ii) improve the relationship between public organizations and citizens through social media platforms; and iii) increase availability of online participation initiatives by public organizations.	centrality;emergence;internet;networked society;social media;web 2.0	Manuella Maia Ribeiro;Maria Alexandra Cunha;Alexandre Fernandes Barbosa	2018		10.1145/3209281.3209373	democracy;public relations;e-participation;public sector;developing country;computer science;online participation;digital divide;social media;information and communications technology	HCI	-78.60438266899405	-6.702343634097716	150177

In search of answers, this study develops and tests a model that examines the antecedents and the consequence of psychological distance, drawing on construal level theory. The results reveal that psychological distance is a multi-dimensional construct consisting of responsiveness, subjective proximity, and accessibility. The results also demonstrate that the different dimensions of objective distance increase psychological distance in a nonlinear fashion; interaction between different dimensions of objective distance produces greater psychological distance than does their combination. Our findings contribute to the IS literature by conceptualizing psychological distance, showing that it can be directly modeled, and highlighting that it should be carefully managed to improve virtual workers' job performance.

For effective citizen empowerment and participation to become mainstream, at a greater scale, several challenges will have to be faced, which will require new tools to be developed. The research questions underlying the present paper are: which new ICT-enabled governance models and methods of monitoring, interaction, collaboration for policy making and enforcement are emerging, and which policy modelling mechanisms can be implemented in order to effectively involve citizens in decision making? The paper starts addressing these issues by defining the problem statement and discussing the changing role of the government in the Information Society, also proposing some elements for a conceptualisation of ICT for governance and policy modelling. It further presents the evolving debate on the e-Government and e-Governance agenda developments, as well as the state of the art and the limitations of research in these fields. Main emerging trends and future prospects within the evolving public sector are then anticipated in order to draw some preliminary conclusions outlining the challenges ahead and future research in the field of ICT for governance and policy modelling.	collective intelligence;e-governance;e-government;grand challenges;programming paradigm;simulation	Yannis Charalabidis;Fenareti Lampathaki;Gianluca Misuraca;David Osimo	2012	2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2012.306	computer simulation;computer science;knowledge management;environmental resource management;marketing;public sector;management science;management;law;government;collaboration	SE	-79.48493771543366	-6.066306409940627	150318

In this context, this research aims to answer the following questions: Do sponsors influence the organizational structures of free software communities by promoting differences between sponsored and non-sponsored communities? What strategies are adopted by the sponsor to influence the organizational structure of free software communities? Two constructs are central to the study: organizational structure and sponsorship. For this research, we adopted case study methodology and three free software communities were studied. In the analysis of the results it was evidenced that sponsors influence decision making, definition of community key roles, and a formalization of norms. In turn, non-sponsored communities were characterized by the centralization and informality of the norms. We conclude that differences were identified in the organizational structure of sponsored and non-sponsored free software communities, and this differentiation was influenced by sponsors. In addition, it was possible to describe strategies and mechanisms used by sponsors to influence the community organizational structure.	centralisation;distributed manufacturing;self-management (computer science)	Daniel Esashika;Carlos Denner dos Santos	2017		10.1145/3167020.3167060	knowledge management;organizational structure;computer science;software	SE	-78.98771177704373	2.3016798492392496	150355

Through the empirical investigation in an operative case study, the Avellino-Rocchetta S. Antonio railway line, in the South of Italy, an integrated evaluative approach implemented in a SDSS can make us go beyond space and hierarchical limits. Taking into account the different multidimensional components of decision-making process, making clear the weights and recognizing the different priorities, fit and situated strategies have been identified, according to an interactive and dynamic dialogue among expertise and local communities.

The data collection has been conducted through a systematic research of ProQuest databases. As a result, 536 publications have been found between 1983 and 2014 with the search terms. Through content analysis, the research has been refined to a group of 457 articles published between 1995 and 2014, considering nature of research, base theories, research strategy, and use of basic concepts. The results show that numerous studies are not using ITCG theory as a foundation to support their arguments. Only 110 publications deal with the context and definition of the seminal concepts. As a result of content analysis it is observed that 237 publications could be considered as inclusion errors because they do not address enough artifacts to be worked as the subject of IT Governance, most of them portray of best practice models in a conceptual basis. Through the preliminary results, it is possible to think about the extent to which these basic concepts even are enough to what is being researched as IT Governance, or at what point the researches has indeed addressed the proposed subject.	amiga reflections;best practice;conceptualization (information science);corporate governance;database;theory	Edimara Mezzomo Luciano;Guilherme Costa Wiedenhöft;Marie Anne Macadar Moron	2015			social science;sociology;management	DB	-77.44136135625146	-2.2334001362652875	150469

However, theoretical accounts to date have not addressed all three aspects of nomadic computing in a single effort. We investigated how the practices of individual nomadic computing users in a large mortgage finance company changed after implementation of a nomadic computing environment. Although users experienced contradictory outcomes as they sought resolutions to the dilemmas posed by work and nonwork demands, all users reported effectiveness in their computing practices. We attribute their effectiveness to skilled use of technologies to control the boundaries between their personal and business social contexts. The variety of patterns of boundary control across nomadic workers in the study is explained using a theory of human agency that focuses on the temporal, spatial and contextual conditions facing actors as they engage with their nomadic computing environments.	ubiquitous computing	Karlene C.

Thus, acceptance and use of information technologies remain a paramount issue in information systems (IS) research and practice. Extending previous research by integrating computer self-efficacy and perceived system complexity as external variables to the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study examines the direct and indirect effects of these two factors on system acceptance and use. The results indicated that computer self-efficacy and system complexity had significant direct effects on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use as well as indirect effects on attitude and behavioral intention. However, the effect of perceived ease of use on attitude was stronger than that of perceived usefulness. In turn, attitude demonstrated a non-significant impact on behavioral intention. These findings highlight several implications for research and practice.	computer;ibm tivoli access manager;information system;usability	Bassam Hasan	2007	IRMJ	10.4018/irmj.2007070106	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;social psychology	HCI	-86.2618727718914	-4.523624998228271	151165

DOI: 10.1002/asi.20172 In this study a perceived gap between the ideal and the reality of a community network (CN) is examined. Most proponents of CNs state that building a better physical community is their major service goal. However, there has been a concern that citizens might use the service simply as a means to connect to the Internet rather than as a means to connect to their communities. Using a survey research method (n 213), users’ perceptions of community aspects of CN service and the influence of such perceptions on their use were investigated. User demographics and alternative service accessibility were also examined as predictors of use. The present study found that the respondents were using the service mainly for general Internet features. More than two thirds of the respondents were not aware of the community content aspect of the service. Approximately 20% of respondents were identified as those whose perceptions of the community aspects actually affected their use of the service. They were both aware of community contents and using an additional Internet service provider. Findings suggest that the providers did not fully communicate the community aspects of the service with the users, while the user perception of community aspects is a key to further promotion of the service.	accessibility;internet access;john d. wiley	Nahyun Kwon	2005	JASIST	10.1002/asi.20172	service provider;questionnaire;community;the internet;internet access;telecommunications;law	HCI	-91.0598460132724	-8.967207756037121	151570

We suggest a top-down approach, which includes preliminary analyzing the possible consequences of introducing new technologies. Socio-economical and technical indicators can be connected with each other with the use of Activity-Based Costing (ABC). To cope with the difficulty of the problems emerging in ICTs we suggest expanding this method using Tensor Analysis of Networks (TAN) to represent the information about the activities in information and communication (IC) services and their structural relationships. An illustrative example is given where the introduction of new ICTs in the disaster warning systems is assessed.	top-down and bottom-up design	Nikolay Suschenko;Anatoly Nazarenko;Viliam Sarian;Alexander Lutokhin	2014	Proceedings of the 2014 ITU kaleidoscope academic conference: Living in a converged world - Impossible without standards?	10.1109/Kaleidoscope.2014.6858465	systems engineering;engineering;operations management;management science	ML	-77.83465018090453	0.6255795307805522	152174
8c91397be7849b4bfee8bb6ef7206302fd80cb46	shaping information and communication technologies infrastructures in the newspaper industry: cases on the role of it competencies	information and communication technology	This paper proposes an integrative theoretical model, drawn from the competence-based view of the firm in institutional economics and sociology, in order to examine the emergence of IT competencies as a key component of organizational distinctive competence in knowledge-intensive firms. In so doing, it addresses the paucity of in-depth empirical research on the role of IT competencies in building information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures. A conceptual framework drawn from the model is employed to test its empirical validity in two exploratory case studies of firms operating in the newspaper industry. Firms in this industry are information and knowledge intensive; consequently, their core business processes have increasingly become dependent on IT—so much so that competency in the planning, design and delivery of IT architectures has become the sine qua non for competitive success. The organizations studied—News International Newspapers Ltd. and Examiner Publications Ltd.—are industry leaders in the application of ICT in the United Kingdom and Ireland. They offer particularly fruitful examples of the phenomenon of interest. In providing empirical support for the proposed theoretical model, this paper makes a contribution to theory in the quoted referent disciplines. It also provides a theoretically-grounded, in-depth description of the key role that IT competencies play in the commercial success of today’s knowledge-intensive firms.	business process;emergence;noise shaping;theory	Thomas Butler;Ciaran Murphy	1999		10.1145/352925.352961	public relations;information and communications technology;computer science;knowledge management;management science	SE	-79.11824530115614	2.5943456013871344	152309

The reasons for this are manifold due to the complex nature of schools as organizations. Therefore, there is an essential need for a method to effectively capture the level of each factor's contribution to the overall schools' ICT uptake. Towards that end, a review of the existing eMaturity approaches to measuring ICT uptake in schools is performed and the results are used to evaluate whether this concept can adequately meet the above requirements. This leads to the proposal for a new framework for profiling schools' ICT competences, which incorporates currently excluded organizational competence dimensions. This could facilitate the identification of specific factors influencing school competence level and, thus, assisting in more informed corrective action planning.	automated planning and scheduling;profiling (computer programming);requirement	Stylianos Sergis;Demetrios G.

A survey was conducted on 129 firms out of the 150 samples randomly selected from both the public and the private sectors in the country with a response rate of 86%. The findings first revealed that the adoption rate of HRIS in enterprises is not a common practice in Ghana since two-thirds of the organizations have never adopted HRIS use. Major general denominators for adoption and use of HRIS include firm size, organization type (i.e. profit making limited liability companies and profit making government organization) and age as well as the industry to which firms belong. Firms attributed the slow rate of adoption to reasons including the low numbers of employees, high cost of system installation, unawareness and low priority for such a system. Again, it was realized that the companies’ readiness to adopt such a system was not encouraging. There were some technical, organizational and environmental factors that affect HRIS adoption which were unearthed.	human resource management system;information system;randomness	Peter K.

However, in absence of a formal knowledge management system this knowledge may not be available for use/reuse. In this research, we explore different scenarios in the healthcare sector to identify the factors which either facilitate or impede the knowledge flows while sharing knowledge. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the scenarios we theorize about use and reuse of knowledge items and the issues in accessing and retrieving them in knowledge sharing events. The barriers and enablers in different case studies are identified which can be applicable to any knowledge sharing event where its actors are working towards a common objective. We examine the patterns of accessibility of a knowledge item in knowledge sharing events and its effect on perceived usability, and perceived usefulness and relevance of a knowledge item.

This methodology will be based on three pillars. The first one is, the Organizational/Human Centred Design that link knowledge transfer on energy efficiency with behavioural and organizational change models, second, the Active Peer-Based Flip Teaching to convert individual to organisational knowledge trying to improve results and promote new knowledge and resources generation. Last pillar is a personal learning environment applied on an online open access platform to support and host this knowledge and community. Two approaches are proposed for testing the methodology. General test, based on surveys and focus groups with key actors on the one hand; and sector test, based on real implementation in the agrofood sector employing the INDUCE European project which will create an open access platform and will test the methodology in 15 pilot companies from the food and beverage sector from Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and France.	focus group;hoc (programming language);organizational behavior	F.

Hence, we consider a distrust relationship as well, allowing a user to rate poor experiences with other individuals in his web of acquaintances. We propose an algorithm to compose two of such networks in a single one, in order to merge the knowledge obtained in two different communities of individuals (possibly partially-overlapping), through two different trust management-systems. Our algorithm is based on semiring algebraic-structures, in order to have a parametric computational-framework. Such composition can be adopted whenever two trust-based communities (with the same scope) need to be amalgamated: for instance, two competitor-companies that need to unify the trust-based knowledge on their (sub-) suppliers.	algorithm;computer science;distrust;experience;linear algebra;terminator 2: judgment day;trust management (information system);vertex-transitive graph;ws-trust;web of trust	Stefano Bistarelli;Francesco Santini	2014	2014 Twelfth Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust	10.1109/PST.2014.6890964	knowledge management;theoretical computer science;computer security;computational trust	Robotics	-90.78342563255283	-0.7245311310302139	152875

a712ca63740253ea1f810c45ff15b1475594f28f	transformation towards the knowledge economy: an interpretive case study of policy formation in an asian country		Various Asian governments are launching strategic blueprints to transform their countries from a production economy to a knowledge-based economy whereby the production, distribution and utilization of knowledge constitute the primary bases for economic growth and wealth creation. These initiatives are seen as crucial to maintaining national competitiveness as new information communications technologies and globalization rapidly erode traditional advantages. The processes by which these k-economy initiatives are developed and implemented are complex social political decisions but sparsely documented. In this paper we describe the context, content and process of developing a knowledge-based economy blueprint in an Asian country. In the formulation and implementation of that blueprint, we were simultaneously action researcher and reflexive practitioner, generally guided by an interpretative methodology. From the analysis, we draw implications regarding the concept of strategy, the practice of strategy and aspects of reflexive methodology in an Asian context. We re-conceptualize strategy formation as a complex process whereby a reflexive practitioner constantly revises, modifies and adapts policy propositions in the light of incoming knowledge and new information from various actors and consequences, intended and unintended; consciously evaluates the sources of authority and individual perspectives; consciously leveraging on mindsets, power relations and divergent organizational values; and accommodates as many knowledge domains and influential stakeholder interests as feasible. We propose that the effectiveness of the strategy formation process can be enhanced with an approach based on structuration theory. From a methodological perspective, a key implication is the need to distinguish between the espoused theoretical framework and the theory-in-use as the action researcher interprets the reality of the problem situation.	blueprint;consciousness;knowledge-based systems	Chun-Kwong Han;Zainal Kidam	2003			market economy;economic growth;economic system	AI	-79.51769961496036	-3.031451677361204	153226

Past research in interorganizational collaborations has benefitted from employing rational choice and institutional theory separately but as organizations face dual pressures to improve performance and gain legitimacy in their social environments a fuller explanation must encompass both perspectives. This study examines the question of why ICT-enabled collaborations form in the public safety domain by employing rational choice and institutional theory perspectives as complementary. This study specifically examines the possibility of a neighbor effect in stimulating the establishment of interagency policing collaborations, while also attending to economic, geographic, and demographic factors influencing this decision to join-up. When completed, this study will contribute to IS knowledge by extending homophily research into the domain of public safety IS, and by incorporating institutional and rational perspectives as an analytical platform from which to apply findings from the public to the private sector.	data retrieval;entity;graph isomorphism;information systems;information system;jane (software);maximum parsimony (phylogenetics);occam's razor;self-organized criticality	Martin A.

These include efforts to codify knowledge in repositories as well as efforts to link individuals using information technologies to overcome geographic and temporal barriers to accessing knowledge and expertise. We suggest that Knowledge Management (KM) efforts, to be successful, need to be sensitive to features of the context of generation, location, and application of knowledge. To this end, we highlight the situated organizational learning perspective that views knowledge as embedded in individuals, in connections between individuals, and in artifacts as a useful lens to examine phenomena related to the establishment of KM initiatives. In an ethnographic case study of an effort to change knowledge-work processes in a market research firm, we apply the situated knowledge perspective to highlight the factors responsible for the limited success of the initiative in the firm. This study suggests that a consideration of the situated knowledge web and the alignment of the initiatives with the features of the knowledge web are central to success in knowledge management efforts in firms.	embedded system;knowledge management;situated	Sarma R.

Some projects have been undertaken successfully, whereas others failed and the reasons for success are not entirely clear. In this paper we focus on success factors for the development and implementation of multi-channel service delivery strategy. The factors are derived based on a document analysis and expanded and validated by public sector staff working in this field. In total 21 CSF were found and the top eight critical factors concern especially institutional and macro issues related to managing the interdependencies of strategic decisions, lobbying for strong political support and management buy-in, harnessing scarce resources, determining the right channel and services mix, enhancing inter-organizational integration and coordination, and managing clients’ perceptions. The findings should help to improve the development of service delivery strategies.	failure;itil;interaction;interdependence	Marijn Janssen	2010			knowledge management;environmental resource management;service delivery framework;operations management;business	HCI	-79.65566034258342	1.3639683434209962	153428

Organizational knowledge is the most salient resource at the disposal of SMEs in terms of availability, access, and depth. Successful SMEs are those who can leverage their knowledge in an effective and efficient manner, so as to make up for deficiencies in traditional resources, like land, labor, and capital. The purpose of this article to to discuss five peculiarities about knowledge management practices at SMEs. Design/methodology/approach – The article draws findings from a nine-month investigation of knowledge management practices at 25 SMEs. Findings – The research discovered that SMEs do not manage knowledge the same way as larger organizations. Viewing SME knowledge management practices as scaled down versions of the practices found in larger organizations is incorrect. SMEs have understandable resource constraints, and hence have to be creative in working around these limitations in order to manage knowledge. Originality/value – The paper sheds some light on peculiarities in SME knowledge management practices, which will hopefully entice scholars and practitioners to follow-up with more detailed research undertakings.	knowledge management	Kevin C.

We tested the hypotheses using survey data collected from senior executives in China. Our findings reveal that a target firm’s perceived mediated power would negatively impact its trust toward a dominant firm, while its perceived non-mediated power would positively affect its trust. Meanwhile, trust can positively influence the target firm’s eSCMS adoption intention. Further, an internally focused culture weakens the negative effects of mediated power on trust. Meanwhile, an externally focused culture weakens the positive relationships between non-mediated power and trust, and between trust and eSCMS adoption intention. The externally focused culture could weaken the negative relationship between mediated power and trust either. The theoretical contributions and managerial implications of the study are discussed.

Financial services have been recognised as one of the fundamental services that have the potential to achieve this objective and help move towards a more just and equitable society. This paper attempts to assess the impact of three information and communication technology-driven initiatives in the field of financial services by differentiating them on the basis of service design. This study goes beyond the stated objective of these services and uses Sen’s capability perspective to study their impact across three non-economic outcome variables viz. literacy, service-specific well-being and empowerment. The data for the study are collected from the urban poor across different locations in a large metropolitan city in South India where the three different services are being offered.

One of the significant problems in understanding emergence of innovation involves how virtual innovation organizations and communities govern and coordinate to maximize innovation output. An agent simulation study is conducted to examine the impact of culture and conflict management styles on collective creativity in open source innovation systems. Findings suggest that decentralized coordination schemes such as emergent selection such as found in utility communities and moderate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation for conflict management result in higher incidence of innovation.

Such community forms, in which organizational creativity and innovation rates are high, appear to be increasingly important to solving problems and sharing knowledge (van Maanen & Barley, 1984; Brown & Duguid, 1991, 2000, 2001; Hargadon & Bechky, 2006), and they are well suited for an information economy that relies upon the production and diffusion of knowledge. We choose OSS communities as a testbed to study, develop, and explore models of innovation in virtual innovation communities. OSS communities may experience reduced production loss through production blocking (Diehl & Stroebe, 1991; Gallupe et al., 1991) because all team members can contribute ideas simultaneously. They reduce problems with social influence such as evaluation apprehension and anonymity (Dennis & Valacich, 1993; DeRosa et al., 2007). Also, OSS communities, which often communicate through electronic media, reduce cognitive failures (Nijstad et al., 2006) and enhance the synergistic effects of group brainstorming because access to the data is unrestricted by individual recall (Dennis & Valacich, 1993). Traditional organizational archetypes are hierarchical organizations, in which employees have little or no control over their jobs (Lawler, 1992). In contrast, OSS communities accentuate emergent selection because individuals are given some control, which stimulates and motivates them (Von Hippel, 2005), so that individuals are adaptive as opposed to optimizing. Contributions compete for adoption and unanticipated innovations emerge as a result of interactions between the culture, organization, and the technology. Given these observations, the objective of this study involves using a computational model: • To explore and improve our understanding of the structural and behavioral assumptions for the emergence and sustainment of creativity in OSS communities under alternative community cultures and conflict management styles. To this end, the focus of this study is to use plausible and conceptually grounded operational OSS mechanisms to discover structural community constraints (e.g., size, organization) and behaviors (e.g., conflict management style) that confer incidence of innovation. Using the conceptually grounded, yet hypothetical OSS community we test propositions and generate hypotheses pertaining to the impact of (1) community cultures and (2) conflict management styles of project leadership. This ongoing line of inquiry is first concerned with the following questions to identify proper abstractions to study OSS communities: Can complex systems theory and genera• tive modeling provide a sound formal basis to study the dynamics of OSS communities? If they do, how can we represent co-evolution of the community dynamics and project growths as they reinforce each other? What are the underlying structural and • behavioral patterns of the mode of production in OSS communities, and how can we model them as self-organizing systems of agents? Based on the developed model of the hypothetical OSS community, we examine the impact of variation of OSS community culture in terms of their decision-making and coordination styles. Three alternative styles that are considered: (a) exploration-oriented, (b) utility-oriented, and (c) service-oriented (Ye et al., 2005). Using the model, we address the following questions: What types of coordination and decision-making styles are associated with higher innovation output in OSS community projects and which specific conflict management styles improve the incidence of innovation? Observed results reinforce and extend earlier findings on the wisdom of collectives, which suggest that aggregation of decisions of focused individuals in collectives consistently outperform experts in terms of prediction ac23 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/agent-simulation-study-conflictcommunity/41946?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology.

We must engage women as an untapped resource in our national effort to protect our country and critical infrastructure. Developing original ways to engage young women serves to address this recognized national need for recruitment through security education at the K-12 and undergraduate level. This would further address the widening gap between the availability and demand for qualified and diverse security professionals. Designing security iterations that are creative, socially relevant, and accessible to an underrepresented population in cybersecurity is a challenge that informs how education and outreach can be performed within other contexts. This research will discuss the CybHER model for engaging and supporting young women in cybersecurity while anchoring them to this field. By providing 5 different interventions, CybHER seeks to empower, motivate, educate, and anchor girls to cybersecurity. Further, existing CybHER outreach activities and lessons will be discussed.	computer security;cyber security standards;institute for operations research and the management sciences;iteration	Pam Rowland;Ashley L.

We present this discussion and comparison of PD and JAD (which some have classified, erroneously, as """"polarized views"""") in order to help researchers with cross-fertilization and to help practitioners understand their choices. JAD and PD are well-known methodologies for operationalizing user involvement and user participation.

The methodology used was the literature research on key concepts, followed by the discussion of the relationship between local governance and citizen participation and the presentation of experiences that produced findings on the impacts of the use of ICTs in participatory processes. Four Brazilian cases (Porto Alegre, Ipatinga, Belo Horizonte and Recife), one Peruvian (Miraflores) and one from Argentina (BellaVista) are presented and related challenges to local governance in identifying their real capabilities of building a new relationship between government policy and society in Latin American regions is discussed. Through the use of the Internet, these participatory government budgets can increase citizen participation and allow thousands of people deciding the allocation of public investment. This research considers that the use of ICTs, especially the Internet, can be a promoter of citizenship and citizen participation. However, this promotion may be limited by the condition of access to these technologies and the depth and quality of information available to citizens that would undermine the enjoyment of the rights of citizens.	experience;internet	Ricardo Matheus;Manuella Maia Ribeiro;José Carlos Vaz;Cesar A. de Souza	2010		10.1145/1930321.1930328	citizen media;public relations;environmental resource management;political science;participatory gis;economic growth	HCI	-78.97158925595525	-8.006919994624312	154010

However, in a marketplace characterized by myriad choices, one of the biggest challenges that Marketers face is to foster continued and frequent use, or stickiness. This brings forth two important questions: what factors affect consumers’ decision to use and “stick” to apps? What are the key outcomes of stickiness for both consumers and firms? This study maps the conceptual and research issues underlying consumers’ decision journey and outcomes with respect to mobile app use. The authors build a framework based on the central tenets of interactivity combined with the insights gleaned from a survey of interdisciplinary literature. They discuss the implications for research and practice in this emerging area of interest.

EKPs are organizational activity patterns that exhibit three characteristics in combination: an emergent process of deliberations with no best structure or sequence; requirements for knowledge that are complex (both general and situational), distributed across people, and evolving dynamically; and an actor set that is unpredictable in terms of job roles or prior knowledge. Examples of EKPs include basic research, new product development, strategic business planning, and organization design. EKPs differ qualitatively from semi-structured decision making processes; therefore, they have unique requirements that are not all thoroughly supported by familiar classes of systems, such as executive information systems, expert systems, electronic communication systems, organizational memory systems, or repositories. Further, the development literature on familiar classes of systems does not provide adequate guidance on how to build systems that support EKPs. Consequently, EKPs require a new IS design theory, as explicated by Walls et al. (1992).	emergent;executive information system;expert system;new product development;organizational architecture;requirement;semiconductor industry;software repository	M.

Countries, such as India, have dominated the discussion but now it also seems that not just the labor costs matter. In the future, service levels, dynamic competencies building and community-based activities are also needed for managing dynamic distributed software development (DDSD) work. Instead of the one-way migration of RDI operations there are increasingly voices questioning the rationale of moving operations to CCCs. The key driver of this research-in-progress paper is in searching a new frameworks, tools and practices for managing DDSD work and developing SD operations evaluation solutions. The forthcoming practical outcomes described are both the improvements in SD work in the industry level and provision of enhancements for their current SD work performance assessment. Academic results will be discussed with European, US and Indian partner researchers in the context of changing dynamic sourcing i.e. onshore, nearshore, offshore activities in global value networks. The general objectives are to improve ICT-services companies’ competencies and tools in i) assessing their SD work operations with more enhanced evaluation systems and ii) make visible practices in managing dynamic distributed sourcing network operations in global value networks.	global serializability;software development;value network	Mikko J.

Thus, identifying barriers and their impact on knowledge sharing and individual innovation behaviour is a potential research area to study. Considering lack of studies in the literature, this study provides further evidence regarding the implications of knowledge sharing barriers in the workplace. Data was collected from eighty three academic staff in a higher education institution and analysed with Smart PLS. The results showed that organisation related knowledge sharing barriers are negatively related to knowledge collecting and knowledge donating. The result also indicates that individual knowledge sharing barriers have negative effect on individual innovation behaviours. There was no link found in this study between knowledge sharing and individual innovation behaviour. These findings provide empirical evidence to the further development of knowledge management and innovation research, and insights regarding how to better implement knowledge sharing and foster innovation behaviour in organisations.

It has been argued that this may be due to many efforts being technology-driven rather than demand-driven. In agricultural development, technology is transferred through a demand-driven participatory approach which incorporates the ultimate recipients of the technology in the design, implementation and evaluation of projects. A project to demonstrate the use of GIS technology for wasteland development in India involving seven Indian research institutes was undertaken by the U.S. Agency for International Development. In the Indian GIS demonstration, technical approaches proposed by each institute were largely technology-driven. To counter this tendency, a set of evaluation criteria or guidelines based on the participatory approach was developed to refine proposals.	geographic information system	Charles F.

Its effect on using executive support systems (ESS), however, has not been studied. This research elucidates the effect of CSE on ESS use by undertaking a field study on a group of 16 executives in the construction industry. The results indicate that executives with a lower CSE prefer more powerful systems (i.e. ESS with both analytical and intuitive tools). Executives with a higher CSE, on the other hand, prefer systems consisting of tools that can cognitively fit the task they perform. Implications for future application and research are discussed.

Through a study of how employees interpret themselves as growing at three organizations, we develop a theoretical account of how employees draw from contextual and personal resources to interpret their growing in ways that embed their idiosyncratic experiences within an organization. The data suggest that employees develop three different types of growing self-construals: achieving, learning, and helping. We use our data to ground theory that explains the development of growing self-construals as deeply embedded in organizations. At the same time, we suggest that growing self-construals reflect individual agency through how individuals work with available resources to weave interpretations of themselves into their growing self-construals. We further suggest that growing self-construals influence the actions employees take to support a sense of progressive self-change.	embedded system;microsoft windows;self-censorship	Scott Sonenshein;Jane E.

The growing literature on knowledge management has focused largely on insights into its use in large law firms. There is very little writing on techniques of enhancing knowledge management in small law firms. Although large firms may be seen as logical users of sophisticated knowledge management systems, there is an increasing need for small firms to capture and intelligently exploit their knowledge.This is because in the knowledge economy, these firms continue to play a major role in generating gross income and in enhancing economic development. However, not much attention has been given to knowledge management in small firms. This research uses open- and closed-ended questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and a literature review to contribute to the body of knowledge on knowledge management in small firms and promote an awareness of its use amo...	knowledge management	Madeleine Fombad	2016	JOLIS	10.1177/0961000614536428	computer science;knowledge;management;economic system	ECom	-79.43348670015705	0.5499402512283755	155268

Despite this attention, there has been little progress toward a stream of research that is consistent and replicable. This lack ofprogress has been attributed to inadequate conceptual development of the US construct. Inadequate conceptual development has resulted in varied definitions and operationalizations of US, and has contributed to results that are inconsistent. Incorporating research done on satisfaction in the referent disciplines of organizational behavior and consumer behavior, this paper proposes and develops a broader and more comprehensive model of a user!y affective response (WAR) to an information system. The WAR model provides a framework for investigating critical dimensions of WAR that previous work may have neglected, and suggests that user dissatisfaction may be as important a construct in information systems as is I/S.	computer user satisfaction;discrepancy function;information system;organizational behavior	Jonathan B.

Developing and maintaining satisfactory customer relationships can help increase customer retention. From the customer’s perspective, the determinants of relationship satisfaction include factors such as trust, service quality, price perception, inertia, indifference, and switching barriers. The aim of the study is to examine the factors which influence and contribute to customer retention. Mobile industry in Greece was selected to find how customer relationships impact marketing practices in the Greek mobile sector, as well as the effect on customer retention. A questionnaire survey was used to collect the primary data. The author used factor and regression analysis and all tests had a in a 95% confidence level. A statistically significant relationship was found between the dependent variable Customer Retention and the independent variables concerning Price Perception, Inertia, and Customer Satisfaction.

Quality service is considered to be satisfactory only if it is perceived to be so by the customers. The performance and success of a firm should be assessed from a customer’s point of view. To retain customers, sending them occasional tactful reminders about the offerings of good service is often a wise strategy for an organization. Naturally customers expect a firm to provide them with solutions, so it is important that they realize the advantages derived when they buy the products of a firm. On the other hand, the arrays of services strategically offered by mobile phone providers are often influenced by customers’ behavior. The result is a fruitful relationship with the customer where providing quality service is the main concern of a firm. Mobile telephone companies’ first priority must be to achieve customer satisfaction if they are to hold their share in the market and operate successfully in highly competitive markets. On the one hand, the mobile phone providers must also focuses on cost reduction at the same time they seek to forge relationships with customer by creating a network which covers a wide range of services. Cost reduction can be achieved by adopting strategies which aim at forging relationships with customers and at creating a network of shops or premises all over the country As described earlier, keeping an old customer is profitable to an organization Since discontent may lead a customer to withdraw his/her custom from a firm, it is advisable to develop practices which aim at keeping customers satisfied. Customer service behaviour aimed at increasing customer satisfaction and fulfilling needs of a customer make up an essential part of a successful organization Zeithaml et al. (1996). According to White and Yanamandram (2004), surviving a constantly increasingly global and competitive market requires firms to acknowledge that their existence, development, and progress are directly related to customer satisfaction. The continuously changing customer needs are related to the flexibility that companies will show in quickly adapting to the shifting needs of their customers. While the marketing relationships may be a firm’s important driver towards the satisfaction of its customers, trust, switching barriers, price perceptions, inertia and indifference are also likely to influence retention. Furthermore, while the main effects of the factors on retention are quite apparent, and have indeed been supported in the existing literature, their interaction effects have not been examined to date in a holistic research. This paper describes a comprehensive model that incorporates the main effects of satisfaction, trust, switching barriers, price perceptions, inertia and indifferences. We believe that such an approach may uncover little researched effects on retention. In particular, it offers a continuous analysis on the role of the above factors in improving overall service and it may also uncover alternative means of retaining customers. Recent research has shown that while satisfaction and trust are closely related they are also conceptually different, has some distinct antecedents and also have different empirical effects on retention. It has also been shown that switching barriers may have interaction effects on retention and if they are high, service firms may continue to retain customers even if they are not highly satisfied. While Cronin’s research (2000) involving six industries showed that quality service was closely related to customer behavior, Gremler and Brown (1996) established that inertia is one of the factors that may stop customers migrating to another provider. Additionally, Fornell (1992) argued that even if the level of satisfaction is low there still exists an element which can positively contribute to customer retention; this element is closely related to the fact that the customer may simply be indifferent to take his custom elsewhere. We tested our model with the mobile telephony industry in Greece, since such an industry is particularly suited to the aims of this study. Customer-provider relationships in this sector are generally medium to long term which provides a suitable context in which to study the factors. Finally, these sectors provide an environment of high customer-staff contact.

5be24bbac079ed5537ea9789ae6c859604c43f76	towards genuine virtual collaboration: designing the use of mobile remote presence in offshore-outsourced projects		Informal communication between work team members is critical for collaborative tasks, building relationships and coordinating group activities. Achieving informal communication and collaboration is particularly challenging in in offshore outsourced projects. Supporting informal communication is difficult for most collaboration technologies. One approach is the adoption of mobile remote presence technologies (MRP). Such systems comprise a video conferencing system mounted on a user-controlled, mobile robotic base. This paper seeks to design the deployment of an MRP system in an offshore-outsourced software development team (located between Germany and India). The design process involved observing the use a MRP system in a distributed team in Germany. We observed the influence of the mobile remote presence system on types and frequency of team interaction over a 12-month period. It supported a wide range of collaborative interaction, including planned and unplanned meetings and social interactions. After an adjustment period of several weeks, local and remote users worked almost as if they were co-located. The paper concludes with plans for deploying the mobile remote presence system in an offshore outsourced team, which include an extended adjustment period and daily scheduled meetings to ensure usage and enable a range of interaction types.	interaction;media redundancy protocol;outsourcing;robot;software deployment;software development	Erik Wende;Rainer Alt;Gregory King	2017			knowledge management;operations management;material requirements planning;management;outsourcing	HCI	-87.8488803674224	0.44806778258230573	155645

This research note utilizes recent research findings that bear on the effectiveness of the implementation and use of ERPS in business organizations and extends these findings in the inter-organizational context. The major purpose of this essay is to present theoretical bases on which future research could justify theoretical models and present theoretically-sound arguments for the examination of the use of ERPS in the management and control of inter-organizational relationships. The implications of a number of theories are examined, including: (a) the theory of co-opetition from organizational strategy, as it relates to the necessity for carrying out simultaneous activities in inter-organizational cooperation and competition, (b) the economic theory of complementarity, as it emphasizes interactions in different elements of organizational design and explains how different elements of organizational strategy and management process relate to one another, and (c) the real options theory from finance as it relates to the degree of managerial flexibility in making infrastructure investment decisions. Each of these theories offers important implications for the examination of use of ERPS in inter-organizational relationships. This essay develops a number of research propositions in order to motivate research in this area. Future research not only could benefit from these theoretical bases but also could make contributions for the extension of these theories in the use of ERPS for the management and control of inter-organizational relationships.	enterprise resource planning	Andreas I.

Despite the fact that an anti-plagiarism system has been reported as an effective and efficient tool for detection, deterrence, and education, its adoption rate has been found to be relatively low. The objective of this study is to investigate the facilitators and inhibitors affecting the adoption of an anti-plagiarism system by faculty. Based on an extended protection motivation theory, this study first examines the persuasion effect of information vividness on threat and coping appraisal. In addition, the influence of threat appraisal (i.e., perceived severity and vulnerability, and rewards) and coping appraisal (i.e. response efficacy, self-efficacy, and response cost) on the system adoption is investigated. A quasi-experimental field survey is employed to predict adoption. The potential theoretical and practical implications are discussed.	information system;threat (computer)	Younghwa Lee;Jeong-Yeon Lee;Yucong Liu	2007			knowledge management;environmental resource management;business;commerce	Security	-85.00129060419698	-8.624582098139374	156002

Learning from failure is one of the ways to seek better performance, but it is extraordinarily rare for organizations to do it well. This paper reported a successful case study in Sangikyo Corporation in Japan. Since they succeeded in establishing a way to learn from failure, they had accumulated 41 failure case studies and lessons learned from the failures since 2005. In addition, they eventually earned thirty-five fold profits more over the past six years. In this paper, authors explored success factors for organizational learning from failure based on the case in Sangikyo Corporation, from points of willingness to serve, common purpose and communication. This paper however, just showed preliminary hypotheses for further research, and it is necessary to carefully examine them for being concrete hypotheses beyond this paper.

This paper examines the factors influencing adoption of e-government services by citizens. Factors that have been explored in the extant literature present inadequate understanding of the relationship that exists between ‘adopter characteristics’ and ‘behavioral intention’ to use e-government services. These inadequacies have been identified through a systematic and thorough review of empirical studies that have considered adoption of government to citizen (G2C) electronic services by citizens. This paper critically assesses key factors that influence e-government service adoption; reviews limitations of the research methodologies; discusses the importance of 'citizen characteristics' and 'organizational factors' in adoption of e-government services; and argues for the need to examine e-government service adoption in the developing world.	e-government;information systems	Hemant Patel;David A.

The model includes five elements which are knowledge of transfer, sources of knowledge, recipients of knowledge, relationship of transfer parties, and the environment of transfer. The conceptual framework includes ten key factors which are ambiguity, systematism, transfer willingness, capacity of impartation, capacity of absorption, incentive mechanism, culture, technical support, trust and knowledge distance. The research hypotheses is put forward. Empirical study concludes that the trust relationship among SPI staffs has the greatest influence on knowledge transfer, and organizational incentive mechanism can produce positive effect to knowledge transfer of SPI. Finally, some suggestions are put forward to improve the knowledge transfer of SPI: establishing a rational incentive mechanism, executing some necessary training to transfer parties and using software benchmarking.	software development process;technical support	Jiangping Wan;Qingjing Liu;Dejie Li;Hongbo Xu	2010	JSEA	10.4236/jsea.2010.32017	systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;pattern;knowledge value chain	AI	-83.58526136338686	1.437837393761238	156241

In Australia the national emergency warning system (NEWS) was instituted after the tragic Black Saturday Victorian Bushfires of February 2009. NEWS has enabled the provision of public information from the government to the citizen during emergencies anywhere and any time. Moving on from traditional short message service (SMS) notifications and cell broadcasting to more advanced location-based services, the paper explores the major issues faced by government, business and society at large, toward the realization of a fully fledged system for personal mobile devices. This qualitative study contains two phases: phase 1gathered issues from the general public via an open-ended survey question, and phase 2 gathered issues from key informant interviews. The data was analysed using both qualitative and quantitative content analysis. The results are presented in a narrative form granting detailed insight into the main issues into deploying a mobile government application. The complex interplay between government agencies, telecommunications carriers and the Australian public is presented, ultimately leading down a path of regulation. By adopting a qualitative approach it is hoped that the intimate lessons learnt in the Australian landscape can be applied to other nations as a foundation model towards deployment of other mobile government applications in other contexts. The outcome of the paper is predominantly practical providing a series of recommendations toward the successful deployment of mobile government applications.	e-government;location-based service;mobile device;nonlinear gameplay;software deployment;the australian	Anas Aloudat;Katina Michael	2011	Electronic Commerce Research	10.1007/s10660-010-9070-0	public relations;regulation;content analysis;computer science;marketing;location-based service;advertising;law;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-80.77197389157733	-8.616747297087514	156288

We find certain types of meaning-making (strategy worldview and benefits finding) can create the requisite psychological resources that facilitates employees engaging in change implementation behaviors. The “Meaning-Making Change Adaptation Model” (MCAM) we develop helps explain when and how employees adapt to change, thereby opening the “black box” of how to facilitate more effective strategic change implementation. We develop and empirically test the MCAM using qualitative and quantitative data from a Fortune 500 retailer.	black box;sensemaking	Scott Sonenshein;Utpal M.

Consumers' adoption of different mobile services could be influenced by their individual differences in demographics and personality traits. Therefore, we developed a mobile app and conducted an empirical study with 2043 Android users to understand the impact of individual differences on their mobile service adoption behavior. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we find that age, gender, salary, and personality traits have significant impact on the adoption of 16 different mobile services. Second, we propose a data-mining approach to automatically determine a user's personal profile based on her installed apps. The prediction precision and recall of our models are 70% and 35% higher than random, respectively. Our approach can be deployed in a non-intrusive and highly scalable manner as part of any mobile app thereby enabling better business intelligence and decision-making.	android;data mining;mobile app;precision and recall;scalability;smartphone	Runhua Xu;Remo Manuel Frey;Alexander Ilic	2016	2016 IEEE Second International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications (BigDataService)	10.1109/BigDataService.2016.15	marketing;business;commerce	SE	-89.45850357964301	-8.311979927374487	156604

The study was based on a well-established theoretical model, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We attempted to identify the relationships between IT acceptance and organizational agility in order to see how the acceptance of technology contributes to a firm’s ability to be an agile competitor. Structural equation modeling techniques were used to analyze the data. Results from a survey involving 329 managers and executives in manufacturing firms in Malaysia showed that actual system or technology usage had the strongest direct effect on organizational agility. Meanwhile, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of IT influenced organizational agility indirectly through actual systems or technology use and attitudes towards using the technology.

What is the effect of RFID technology on asset management-related processes in healthcare? What are the top-ranked asset management-related processes associated with the adoption and use of RFID technology in this sector? To answer these questions, a three-round Delphi study was conducted among experts working on RFID technology. In the study, a list of 12 processes related to the relative advantage of RFID and 10 processes related to RFID-enabled asset management applications in the healthcare sector were derived from literature and used in a questionnaire. Results indicate that all the top five processes related to the relative advantage of RFID and asset management applications reflect high levels of agreement.	barcode;delphi method;embarcadero delphi;object pascal;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification	Samuel Fosso Wamba;Eric W.

1057c3adff7508b893ea8b9cd42c45230fd11316	a conceptual framework for online stock trading service adoption		Globalization and recent advancement in the deployment of Internet and related technologies, have significantly transformed all sectors of the modern economy. For instance, electronic service has enabled the application of Internet platform in stock trading, thereby empowering individuals across diverse location to engage in trading activities. As established by extant theories on technology acceptance, individuals are expected to exhibit different attitude and behaviour towards new technology. This study aims to develop a conceptual model, which can explain the antecedents of individual investors’ intention to adopt online stock trading service. Specifically, this study identifies three new constructs (trust perception, investors’ knowledge and economic value) by integrating theory of planed behavior (TPB) and technology acceptance model (TAM), with perspective from transaction cost theory (TCT).	electronic trading;ibm tivoli access manager;internet;software deployment;the coroner's toolkit;theory	Alireza Abroud;Yap Voon Choong;Saravanan Muthaiyah	2013	IJEA	10.4018/jea.2013010104	economics;knowledge management;marketing;management;world wide web;commerce	ECom	-86.76599111573894	-9.444047955185445	157527

Not only it is known as the foundation for stable development, but also it is the source of keeping competitive nature of an organization which is an advantage for the organization. The two fold role of culture, both as the main obstacle and also as the empowering factor in knowledge management activities, makes the importance of this factor double in efficient managing of knowledge management processes. The present article is examining any kind of relationship between different kinds of organizational culture and different dimension of knowledge management. In order to analyze differences between different organizational cultures, the proposed conceptual framework by Comeron and Quinn has been used here. In this article the relationship between four kinds of organizational culture which are group, developmental, hierarchical and logical (market) culture and six dimensions of knowledge management has been examined.  This project is applied in nature and the methodology which has been used is correlationnal-descriptive; it is categorized as field study.  For analyzing the findings of the research and accepting or rejecting the proposed hypothesis, statistical techniques like step by step regression as well as pearson correlationnal coefficienal has been used. The results indicated that there is a meaningful relationship (about 99%) between different kinds of organizational culture and six dimensions of knowledge management.

Despite this realisation, many change projects fail due to a lack of acceptance on the part of the affected stakeholders, which the authors believe can be attributed to insufficient communication and a lack of understanding for the proposed changes by the management. The method presented here was developed in cooperation with a well accepted polytechnic university and eight corporate partners, within the context of a public funded research program. The method object’s is to systematise the target group-oriented communication of change, and thus to accelerate the change of mindsets. The method is a process-oriented approach, which is intended as an aid to those project leaders and communication managers responsible for change projects to avoid inefficiency in implementation and ensure that the affected parties understand the changes. The method is currently in development and thus represents findings of our research in progress.	process-oriented programming	Roger Buehrer;Christian D.

In this paper, we explore technology use mediation (TUM) processes in two cases of electronic medical record system use in two healthcare organizations. In our analysis, we examine contextual influences on mediation and consider TUM processes and outcomes in projects utilizing modern systems development methods. We found that crucial TUM actions occurred during systems development phases as well as during system use, that mediation was vitally important with these specialized IT artefacts, and that system configuration required changes to software infrastructure and code. Organizational size influenced the availability and the effectiveness of mediation resources; with adequate resources committed to the task, the institutional environment presented substantial, but not insurmountable, challenges to technology use mediation. We consider implications for practice and suggest future research directions.

Drawing on social exchange theory, we present a theoretical framework to examine the cost-benefit tradeoffs considered by potential users of mobile LBAs. A research model is proposed and tested using data collected from a sample of 222 respondents. Our study offers two explanations for why users would release location information: 1) the application's controls reduce privacy risk beliefs, and 2) the application provides opportunities for socialness. Understanding the motivations and concerns of different types of users and developing LBAs to meet those specific needs is both a challenge and a condition for the growth of the location-based market.	location-based service	Darren Roback;Robin L.

Although the flexibility of core stakeholders is principal to the negotiation of systems requirements and key to successful development, for this interpretive case study the inflexibility of the EC, as core stakeholders and external regulators, had a critical impact upon the project that impeded a successful outcome that has implications for practice. This paper presents a perspective gained through the empirical setting that provides evidential insights into the difficulties experienced by exploring the dynamics of the factors involved. It presents the real-life context, experiences and commentary that provide meaningful insight and validity to the findings. The aim is not to present another model, framework or proposal to address this issue but rather through the analysis of the data gathered to offer ‘rich insight’ and increase the understanding of such difficulties from which lessons can be drawn. Thus there is no one question that can be answered but rather it is important to draw upon such research experiences so that validated conclusions can inform the IS domain.	experience;real life;requirement;rich internet application	Hilary Berger	2007			public relations;knowledge management;environmental resource management;business;stakeholder analysis	HCI	-79.24747210847353	-1.1378481991763931	157875
de64f9321b92534fba195f244b6df740db9927aa	the challenge of incorporating smart city activities in medium-size cities: the case of greece		A major challenge affecting the potential of a smart city project in achieving local community expectations is the extent to which local communities are involved not only in the planning, but also in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation phases (or, to put it differently, in the co-production process). There is a need for a u0027co-smartisationu0027 process to evolve. The present paper provides a general analytical and policy framework for this co-smartisation process to be implemented successfully. Attention is given to medium-size cities as the risks associated with smart city projects in such cities are higher due to such factors as limited operational, managerial and cooperation capacity. Trikala and Heraklion, two Greek medium-size cities, are used as case studies in order to illustrate potential strategies for consolidating the participation of local communities in smart projects at the medium-size city level in the southern European regional context.	smart city	Harry Coccossis;Pavlos-Marinos Delladetsimas;Spyros Niavis	2017	IJSTM	10.1504/IJSTM.2017.10009860	smart city;marketing;environmental resource management;economics;local community;sustainability;urban planning;monitoring and evaluation	NLP	-78.32758013939807	-5.700164298879769	157926

In organisational settings, they may operate through both electronic and social interactions aimed at delivering information that is relevant, pertinent and current. Understanding these interactions can reveal the tensions in current awareness dissemination and help inform ways of making them more effective and efficient. We report an in-depth, observational study of electronic current awareness use within a large London law firm. The study found that selection, re-aggregation and forwarding of information by multiple actors gives rise to a complex sociotechnical distribution network. Knowledge management staff act as a layer of “intelligent filters” sensitive to complex, local information needs; their distribution decisions address multiple situational relevance factors in a situation fraught with information-overload and restrictive time-pressures. Their decisions aim to optimise conflicting constraints of recall, precision and information quantity. Critical to this is the use of dynamic profile updates which propagated back through the network through formal and informal social interactions. This supports changes to situational relevance judgements and so allows the network to ‘self-tune’. These findings lead to design requirements, including that the system should support rapid assessment of information items against an individual’s interests; that it should be possible to organise information for different subsequent uses; and that there should be back-propagation from information consumers to providers, to tune the understanding of their information needs.	awareness;backpropagation;information needs;information overload;interaction;knowledge management;relevance;requirement;sociotechnical system;software propagation	Simon Attfield;Ann Blandford;Stephann Makri	2010	Inf.

At a systems level there is a need for standards, guidelines and codes of conduct to support deployment of mobile technology at an individual level. The aim of this research was to explore findings of a previous focus group study to elucidate priorities for action, provide evidence and focus impetus for advocating progression of the installation of standards and guidelines at an organisation level. The study confirms nurse supervisors' preparedness and readiness to employ mobile learning at point of care. However, successful implementation requires organisations engaging with, and embracing the evolving digital landscape, and supporting this new andragogy. Organisational level commitment will promote contemporary nursing practice, support the best clinical outcomes for patients, and provide educational support for nurses. Nurse leaders and professional bodies must drive and guide development of robust standards, guidelines, and codes of conduct to prioritise mobile learning as a component of digital professionalism within healthcare organisations.

This implies that previous results, obtained almost exclusively from studies of large organizations, cannot necessarily be generalized to small organizations..This article presents an empirical investigation designed to study the relationship between organizational characteristics and the success of MIS in the context of small business. Several hypotheses were tested using data collected from 464 small manufacturing firms in the province of Quebec. The results show that several organizational computerusage characteristics are significantly associated to MIS success. It was also found that most of these characteristics are related to the length of a firm’s EDP experience.	electronic data processing;information systems research;management information system;systems theory	Louis Raymond	1985	MIS Quarterly		organizational commitment;organizational learning;knowledge management;marketing;organizational studies;management	HCI	-83.08697781860252	3.5125804408151007	158028

This paper addresses this relative gap by arguing that MacIntyre’s critique of utilitarianism in bureaucratic organizations with its alternative ‘virtues-goods-practice-institution’ framework offers a fruitful approach for an analysis of ethical concerns relating to information systems. We cast the notion of ‘best practice’, as embodied in an information system, as a central ethical concern. We briefly describe an empirical study of a Customer Relationship Management system implementation reflecting on the ways that MacIntyre’s ethical framework may be a suitable approach towards the ethical analysis of information systems.	customer relationship management;information system;management system	Alison E.

Longitudinal naturalistic methods provide an opportunity to observe information practices in context over time, but have infrequently been used in information research. This paper presents a qualitative ethnographic exploration of the changes over time in the information practices of a group of young parents in Canada, a population experiencing substantial life changes as young adults and new parents both. Using grounded theory, this analysis explores timerelated processes in the lives of young parents and they ways these processes affect information practices such as seeking, sharing, and use of information. Three case examples illustrate the interplay over time of individual characteristics, setting, and events, and the impact on an individual’s information practices. Based on these findings, a theoretical model to inform future investigations of information practice evolution over time is presented.	cross-sectional data;evolution;information behavior;risk management;theory	Devon L.

E-government research has failed to address the fact that the cognitive processes that take place when individuals evaluate the degree of trustworthiness of information and communication technologies (ICTs) are not uniform across cultures. This study will study how perceptions of trust in the government and the Internet influence the use of e-government services in two different cultural contexts: Mexico and the United States. Theories from different disciplinary perspectives will guide this study. A mixedresearch design will be used for the collection and analysis of data. This research will contribute to the production of a more culture-sensitive base of knowledge that supports the formulation and enhancement of e-government initiatives and technologies intended for different populations.	e-government;population;trust (emotion)	Carlos J.

Unfortunately, system-wide implementations such as these often fail to produce the outcomes desired by those that champion them. One noted reason for unsuccessful ES utilization rests in “workarounds”—the deviation or circumvention of the ES by users (employees) of the system. Our research question asks, “How do the outcomes of a workaround impact the downstream user and the system overall?” We assert that the motivation or why workarounds are employed is not as important as the outcomes these workarounds create. Using qualitative data from a longitudinal field study of a large organization in the U.S. Midwest, we categorize workarounds based on the outcomes they generate and consider the resultant effects these workaround outcomes have for the downstream user. In particular, we explore how workaround outcomes impact the effectiveness of accounting functions.	unintended consequences;workaround	Dawna Drum;Rhetta Standifer;Kristina Bourne	2015	J.

The promise of m-government to provide greater access to government information is progressing in many developed and developing countries. Current mobile government does not exploit the full potential of available technology. Research shows there is a lack of a perfect killer application or a framework to find killer application. Without this framework, the developing countries will lose an opportunity to accelerate the development where the potential inherently lies in the technologies. In this context, this paper aims to present a framework to find killer applications in M-government which can be followed by any country. Also the framework is explained with the case-study of Indian subcontinent which can be viewed as reference. The framework consists of three simple steps.

Similarly, attempts to measure alignment and relate it to performance have been made, but primarily based on work in larger firms. This study focused on measuring the alignment of business strategy and IT strategy (ITS) among small UK manufacturing firms and then investigated the link between alignment and performance. The method built on prior studies, developing approaches to alignment used with larger firms and integrating other concepts and measures from the small firm literature. Using a mail questionnaire, data from 250 firms was collected on nine strategy areas so that business and ITS responses could be compared. IT alignment was explored using both the matching and moderation approaches. The moderation approach appeared more effective in identifying IT alignment. The results indicated that a significant proportion of small firms had achieved high IT alignment. Furthermore, the group of small firms with high IT alignment had achieved better organisational performance than firms with low IT alignment. This is consistent with findings in large firms and opens up possibilities for further study of IT alignment in small firms. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We do this by developing a postmodernist perspective on software engineering, disputing the notion of a grand narrative of software engineering (that is, an exclusive and embracing account of software engineering as a technical, rational project) by offering a series of accounts of a key meeting in a software project. These accounts both trade-off and disrupt a technical, rational narrative and indicate that the current situation in software engineering is one of stasis.

An in-depth literary review on smart library concept is presented along the comparative insight into contemporary smart city and sustainable city literature. Based on these findings a proposition is depicted for smart and sustainable library as a central public institution of a sustainable smart city. Several library services of the new generation based on cutting edge technologies and user participation are proposed. The claim is made that sustainable library is to be an integral part of a sustainable city making not just an-other useful urban addition providing for some of the various smart and sustain-able services of the new city, but a central hub that carter for constant upgrade of information literacy of its users allowing for innovativeness and creativity of citizens of sustainable cities to come to the fore.	information literacy	Aleksandar Jerkov;Adam Sofronijevic;Dejana Kavaja Stanisic	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-28197-1_3	library science;construction engineering;engineering;economic growth	NLP	-77.87796906984073	-9.307773569174685	159054

In University courses related to Computer Sciences, this subject is sometimes trained through interviews with real companies. However, voluntaries of companies participating in the interviews do not act like real interlocutors, as their interest is not the project itself, but just the interview. In this regard, we miss custom dynamics such as conflicts or demanding requests, which are inherent parts of interviews. To include these conditions for a more realistic experience, we propose the students themselves to also take the role of clients, randomly playing different characters that are based on a set of features that define their personalities and technical skills. In this way, teams of analysts interview teams of customers, generating scenarios not only derived from the project requirements, but also the personal and strategic interests of each part. Results show that the main problems of analysts to handle meetings are precisely related to the emotional behaviors, which influenced quality, fluency, empathy and appropriateness in the analyst's conduct. Moreover, results show that after this experience the students achieved a strong improvement of abilities to dynamically manage an interview process, self-control skills, adequately express their ideas and anticipate client needs, compared to those who performed classical pre-designed interviews with real costumers. Students reported a gain of auto-assessment and a better empathy with clients, which increased the chances to successfully capture and prioritize requirements.	client (computing);norm (social);randomness;requirement;software requirements	Pablo Delatorre;Alberto Salguero	2016		10.1145/3012430.3012611	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;social psychology	SE	-89.15070773895259	2.3880314830158835	159083

By human capital, we do not mean the individuals themselves, but involves the range of knowledge and skills (i.e., human aspects) invested to create value during development. However, there is still no consensus on how these broad terms of human aspects relate to the health of a project. In this study, we reconceptualize human aspects of software engineering (SE) into a framework (i.e., SE human capital). The study presents a systematic mapping to survey and classify existing human aspect studies into four dimensions of the framework: capacity, deployment, development, and know-how (based on the Global Human Capital Index). From premium SE publishing venues (five journal articles and four conferences), we extract 2,698 hits of papers published between 2013 to 2017. Using a search criteria, we then narrow our results to 340 papers. Finally, we use inclusion and exclusion criteria to manually select 78 papers (49 quantitative and 29 qualitative studies). Using research questions, we uncover related topics, theories and data origins. The key outcome of this paper is a set of indicators for SE human capital. This work is towards the creation of a SE Human Capital Index (SE-HCI) to capture and rank human aspects, with the potential to assess progress within projects, and point to opportunities for cross-project learning and exchange across software projects.	human–computer interaction;software deployment;software development;software engineering;software project management;theory;web search engine	Saya Onoue;Hideaki Hata;Raula Gaikovina Kula;Kenichi Matsumoto	2018	CoRR		software engineering;computer science;software deployment;qualitative research;software development;inclusion and exclusion criteria;software;human capital	SE	-77.88338928602569	-4.622091135327669	159444

With the aim of investigating this question, we introduce a framework for comparative research that includes not only systemic but also circumstantial factors. The approach is tested in a comparative case study of three northern European countries--Sweden, Estonia and Iceland--that are all experimenting with e-participation but which are experiencing rather different levels of crisis. The results show that innovation and elite challenging aspirations are very much related to the type and degree of crisis. It is therefore argued that the interplay between institutional constraints and circumstantial catalysts needs further scholarly attention and elaboration.	crisis (dynamical systems);experiment;foremost;noise shaping	Joachim Åström;Hille Hinsberg;Magnus E.

Virtual team and its members are now the virtue of the organizations that work across the countries. There is no doubt that virtual team's give a competitive advantage to the organization but simultaneously faces challenge in its working. Working in virtual team becomes complex as its members have language difficulties, time -and -distance challenges, absence of face-to-face contact, and cultural differences. The important factor that has been emerged and examined in the preceding studies which builds a virtual team is trust. Only depending on emails and telephones doesn't merely build the trust, especially when members are far apart and belong to totally different culture. Even though a large repository of literature is available on virtual teams and trust but still many of the questions are still left unanswered. The paper focus on identifying the factors those are important for the functioning of the virtual team. A set of 45 questions from the available literature were prepared and responses on likert scale are collected, analysed and summarized in the paper.

Web store advice, which serves as a virtual salesperson to facilitate consumers' online purchasing, is an important example, considering how frequently successful e-tailers are using this information service. However, existing information system studies mainly test consumers' perceptions towards or re-usage of systems only: the information level has been largely neglected despite its popularity at actual Web stores. Specifically, few studies have uncovered why consumers continue to use Web store advice from the lens of information processing. This study thus pioneered the integration of perceived fit and trust into the expectation disconfirmation theory to explore consumers' satisfaction and continuance intentions towards Web store advice at the information level. Based on empirical data, findings supported all the hypotheses proposed.

Many managers, however, are often left with the quandary of how to evaluate their investments in technologies. Reasons of this difficulty have been suggested in the normative literature as centring on the socio‐technical (human, organisational and technical) dimensions associated with the adoption of IT/IS. The inability of managers to determine the true costs of deploying IT/IS is considered attributable to a lack of knowledge and understanding of IT/IS related costs. In developing a broader picture of such cost dimensions and their respective taxonomies, the research presented in this paper uses a structured case method to gain an understanding of how a construction firm embraced the IT evaluation process.

b807ad23982bc7644a6833ff68f41dff4a8ed84f	building city resilience through collaborative networks: a literature review		Cities are interconnected and interdependent systems rather than isolated entities that face risks. Building resilient cities requires not only the government will, but also the involvement of different city stakeholders such as citizens, emergency services, academic, educational and scientific entities, and public and private organizations. Collaborative networks are relationships and partnerships between different stakeholders which provide opportunities to share information, knowledge, and to negotiate shared goals and issues. The involvement of the city stakeholders in collaborative networks during the emergency management phases (mitigation and preparation, response, and recovery) can contribute to improving city resilience. We carried out a literature review for obtaining an overview of the academic research that analyzes the contribution of collaborative networks and information systems to improving city resilience. Based on the literature review, this study suggests five resilience principles (collaboration and networking, learning, training and preparedness, awareness and commitment) that can improve through collaborative networks. Furthermore, specific examples of disasters and emergencies in which these principles have been implemented towards building resilience are illustrated.	collaborative network	Raquel Giménez;Leire Labaka;Josune Hernantes	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-47093-1_12	environmental resource management	HCI	-79.65815500652707	-4.411115117370634	159860

The phenomenon of digital volunteers and their role in collecting and analyzing social media data provided by disaster affected populations has brought unprecedented opportunities and challenges to the humanitarian system. Central to these processes are the risks and vulnerabilities that these transformations might bring to existing humanitarian actors. Thus, this paper draws upon the work of Anthony Giddens regarding trust to account for the ongoing relational dynamics, and the unpacking of both it's institutional and inter-personal dimensions. The paper identifies two major approaches underlying their collaborative efforts. The first approach concerns a top-down and centralized process of developing a institutionalized forms of interfacing; while the second concerns the development of interpersonal relational infrastructure.	centralized computing;population;social media;top-down and bottom-up design;vulnerability (computing)	John Sabou;Simeon Videlov	2016			political science;public relations	HCI	-78.44289227125452	-4.228575289593649	160267

Motivation, training, performance planning and productivity are so closely interrelated that to attack them individually results in initiatives which often conflict with one another and lead to confusion of ends by professional personnel. Successful integration of these factors results in a management style and organizational form that supports the accomplishments of productive work.  The framework identifies five major areas contributing to performance and behavior: personal effort, knowledge and skills, attitudes and values, environment, health and sense of direction. These areas define the impact of training, personal development, management style, project control, performance planning and job/goal direction-setting on performance and behavior.	automated planning and scheduling	Robert A.

bbe09a1f7da39a50b5a05d70d0894366b8d36e3a	incorporating data analytics into design science to predict user intentions to adopt smart tv with consideration of product features		Abstract Adoption intention for a new product is significantly affected by demographics (age, gender, occupation), individual characteristics (innovativeness, product involvement, information searching), and perceived benefits (usefulness, ease of use, complexity, compatibility). Most users initially have very limited product knowledge, so functional characteristics or selling prices may dominate purchase intention. Therefore, this research presents a data-analytics oriented framework to predict user intentions to adopt smart TV. In particular, perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are respectively defined by technical engineering features (EFs) and ergonomic gesture features (GFs). Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and support vector machine (SVM) are used to justify the validity of the presented framework. Furthermore, behavior science is used to test the effectiveness of design science. Experimental results show that gender and prior experience in motion-sensing products are significant moderators for the causality between PU/PEOU and user intention. In summary, this study cannot only help smart-TV brand companies identify key product features that influence user intentions but also provide a basis of market segmentation for targeting the ad-hoc user groups.	smart tv	Chih-Hsuan Wang;Tze-Ming Chen	2018	Computer Standards & Interfaces	10.1016/j.csi.2018.02.006	computer science;support vector machine;multivariate adaptive regression splines;market segmentation;new product development;real-time computing;marketing;design science;technology acceptance model;data analysis;usability	HCI	-90.56597498272598	-7.144837119063644	160303

It is among the first to investigate the relationship between individual communicator traits and communications technology choice. Also, this study explores technology selection based on a broader, more universal set of technology capabilities rather than emphasizing particular technologies.

There have been a lot of new attempts and initiatives for promoting the sustainability by government, industries, and communities. However, for the survival and successful adoption of the innovative efforts to real world, they need to be institutionalized or established as stable formal/informal institutions or business models. Especially, the efforts in private sectors, incumbents or entrepreneurs, should develop and find out, even through trial and errors, a viable business model for the sustainability. This paper reviews the various initiatives from the business model perspective, analyze the characteristics of the sustainability business models and suggest key dimensions to design new business models for sustainability.

b137718a9a0233fb86335688bbff0c8467265df2	knowledge management system use and job performance: a multilevel contingency model		This paper seeks to develop a better understanding of job performance in the context of a knowledge management system (KMS) implementation. This work adopts the context theorizing approach that informs the conceptualization of KMS use and identification of contingency factors. Specifically, the literature on rich system use is adapted to develop the construct in the context of a KMS. The literature related to task, system, user, and leadership is also drawn upon to identify four contingency factors—task nonroutineness, perceived support for contextualization, absorptive capacity, and transformational leadership—that affect the KMS use and job performance relationship. The paper argues that rich use of a KMS positively affects job performance and the four contingency factors moderate this relationship. A mixed methods approach that includes a quantitative study (n = 1,441) among knowledge workers in seven business units of a large organization in the finance industry was used to validate the theoretical model. A follow-up qualitative study (n = 48) was conducted in one business unit to cross-validate the findings and explain unsupported findings. Data were collected from multiple sources (i.e., surveys, interviews, and system archives). The results largely supported the model. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.	act-r;information systems journal;knowledge acquisition;knowledge management;management system	Xiaojun Zhang	2017	MIS Quarterly		contextualization;management science;absorptive capacity;strategic business unit;knowledge management;contingency theory;transformational leadership;conceptualization;job performance;computer science;qualitative research	AI	-83.37068218955005	0.6939157569960986	160498

Research conducted on this topic has identified personality as one of the key factors influencing team performance. The Big Five model, a framework for assessing personality, has standardized five personality traits, of which openness is reported to have a positive relationship with creativity. Creativity is regarded as one of the most relevant qualities for innovation. However, creativity as an ability manifested by performance on creativity tests is associated with difficulties. We therefore present cognitive systems as an alternative way, to not only find creative potential but also as a strategy to enhance team composition. Within our pilot study, we attempted to find a linkage between variables of creativity tests and the Big Five personality traits. Although our findings showed no salient correlations between these variables, we believe that automated personality mining tools would outperform creativity tests in the long run.	artificial intelligence;cognitive computing;linkage (software);openness	Rangina Ahmad;Dominik Siemon;Susanne Robra-Bissantz	2018			computer science;knowledge management;personality;cognitive computing;creativity;team composition	HCI	-89.6955913023425	2.144330641858868	160662
5ca021afff23c74bf4ef80c16c66b83321893bee	evaluating online human rights resource centres		Online human rights resource centres (OHRRCs) serve a variety of information and communication needs for grassroots activists, policy formulators, researchers, advocates and others within the human rights and development movements. However, there are no effective models with which to evaluate the impact of these systems, or to determine how they support their ‘business ’ objective which is the promotion and protection of human rights. Drawing on three areas of literature, namely information systems evaluation (ISE), evaluation of information and communications technologies in non-profit organisations and human rights impact assessment (HRIA), this paper proposes a framework to address the problem. The model focuses on the need for stakeholder participation, and for ongoing evaluation triggered at key points in an iterative development life cycle.

This study therefore aims to apply a neural network system to predict fraud litigation for assisting accountants on audit strategy making. The empirical results show that neural network provides not only a promising predicting accuracy, but also a better detecting power and a less misclassification cost comparing with that of a logit model and auditor judgments. This suggests that an artificial intelligence technique is quite well in identifying a fraud-lawsuit presence, and hence could be a supportive tool for practitioners.

Based on the model developed, the authors’ objective is to identify those variables that are of strategic nature and are the root cause of the issue.Design/methodology/approach – Variables considered as barriers are identified, and utilizing the interpretive structural model approach, a relationship model is developed. Further, the impact matrix cross-reference multiplication applied to a classification approach is used to analyze the effect and dependence among these factors.Findings – The research in the area of M-commerce in the Arab world and related to the strategic aspect is limited in the extant literature. The present study tries to fill this gap by investigating the variables that inhibit the growth of M-commerce in Qatar. The research shows that there exists a group of barriers having a high driving power and low dependence requiring maximum attention and of strategic importance, while another group consists of those variables that have high dependence and are the resultant actions.Practical implications – There is a growing concern that although the numbers of mobile subscribers are increasing at a very fast pace in Qatar, actual M-commerce activities in the country remain low. The findings of this study can be used to understand the differences between the independent and dependent variables and their mutual relationships. The study would also help the policy makers to develop suitable strategies to facilitate growth of M-commerce in the country.Originality/value – This research was the first attempt to investigate the relationships among the variables inhibiting the growth of M-commerce in a fast-growing economy in a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Given that there is limited research on M-commerce in the GCC context, the study can be viewed as an investigation that provides a good understanding of the variables and their interrelationships affecting M-commerce proliferation.

Our study of the industry explored barriers to knowledge flow using a Cultural Historical Activity Theory framework. Our work was exploratory and qualitative in nature, and consisted of three phases: in-depth interviews to explore medical knowledge flow barriers resulting in a model; a case study using a survey approach to test and modify the model; and a Delphi study to validate the generalizability of the model. We concluded that knowledge flow experienced five barriers: knowledge source, knowledge receiver, knowledge transfer, knowledge flow context, and the organizational context.

There is a great need to develop alternative cloud-based care supports as traditional methods of care become more difficult to obtain. Contrary to some perspectives, many people with I/DD are capable of using cloud computing technology; they and their families are a viable consumer market. Advances in civil rights and self-determination principles regarding people with I/DD have secured their acknowledged position as a natural constituency of society; however, too often they are left out of consideration of social design. Excluding the needs of people with I/DD in cloud computing consideration, design and structure may put them at risk for further marginalization in human society. This paper discusses the profile of the global I/DD population, self-determination principles, and family perspectives of technology.	cloud computing	Ann Cameron Caldwell	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21663-3_30	actuarial science;political science;management;economic growth	ECom	-78.835179297087	-9.46664123166837	161181

Reflecting this practice turn, information systems research is specifically interested in what people think they do when confronted with technology, what they actually do in the process of using technology, and what using technology does to them and the organizations they are a part of. In the wake of this development, sociomateriality has been proposed as a concept to study these organizational phenomena. The concept of sociomateriality, however, is not without its difficulties. Much debate has ensued on the ontological assumptions the practice turn and the concept of sociomateriality should be based on, and many scholars using the concept report how difficult it is to empirically investigate the intertwining or entanglement of the social and the material in practice. In this paper, we revisit Parsons' and Shils' (1951) general theory of action to address some of these difficulties and develop a framework for researching the social and the material in practice. Particularly, we propose that Parsons' and Shils' orientations of action help to better understand and conceptualize what individuals do before acting, what role technology plays, and how individuals and technology shape and are being shaped by each other in action across time. Through ten methodological principles, we demonstrate that such a framework can improve conceptualization and guide the selection and design of research methods in order to generate the data needed for sociomaterial theorizing.	academy;action theory (philosophy);behavioral pattern;conceptualization (information science);emergence;information systems research;journal of the association for information systems;knowledge management;management information system;no silver bullet;organization studies;organizational behavior;organizing (structure);quantum entanglement;relevance;requirement;resultant;social network;social system;sociomateriality;systems theory;while;yet another	Benjamin Mueller;Uta Renken;Gijs van Den Heuvel	2016	DATA BASE	10.1145/3025099.3025107	psychology;knowledge management;management science;social psychology	HCI	-78.0764391284911	-2.2736019290778686	161208

For the exemplary case of Usage-based Insurance (UBI), this paper presents a design science approach to the mitigation of PC under parallel consideration of functional system performance. Based on long-term location trajectories from 1’600 vehicles, we assess the predictive power of emulated system designs that substitute location information, presumably the most privacy sensitive type of information in current UBI designs. We find that there are substantial grounds to challenge prevalent design paradigms in UBI and infer general insights from this example for IS researchers and IT professionals, who, when seeking to improve system privacy, often focus on privacy-enhancing technologies instead of considering the socio-technical context of ubiquitous IS.	consumer privacy;emulator;privacy concerns regarding google;privacy-enhancing technologies;sensor;sociotechnical system	Johannes Paefgen;Thorsten Staake;Frédéric Thiesse	2012				HCI	-87.9422103173948	-7.983493535295433	161408

However, there is a large variation in the intensity of use of e-commerce in the travel and tourism industry. While the Internet usage varies across countries, even within a country there are large variations amongst enterprises. These variations are mainly due to the impact of several factors associated with the internal and external environment of the enterprise. This study attempts to explore the impact of various factors on the Internet usage rate. The factors are classified into three broad groups: viz. factors associated with the location of the enterprise, internal factors of the enterprise and technological factors. An empirical study conducted with 95 hotels in seven locations in Thailand is used to assess the impact of the factors.	e-commerce payment system;internet;viz: the computer game	Sunil Sahadev;Nazrul Islam	2004	J. of IT & Tourism	10.3727/109830505774297201	the internet;location theory;economics;hospitality industry;computer science;marketing;sociology;empirical research;tourism;law;information technology;commerce	HCI	-89.00542646109886	-9.133432442506832	161422

Drawing upon practices in healthcare industry and conceptual developments in information systems research, this article aims to explain the latent relationships amongst user-oriented factors that lead to individual’s adoption of the new technology. Specifically, this study focuses on the introduction of chronic disease u-health system. Using the ordinary line square (OLS) regression analysis, we are able to discover the insights concerning which constructs affect service subscriber’s behavioral intention of use. Based on the data collected from over 440 respondents, empirical evidences are presented to support that factors such as medical conditions, perceived need, consumer behavior, and effort expectancy significantly influence the formation of usage intention.	information systems research;information system;ordinary least squares;systems theory;ubiquitous computing	Jongtae Yu;Chengqi Guo;Mincheol Kim	2008	IJHISI	10.4018/jhisi.2008070104	health administration;human–computer interaction;knowledge management;empirical research	HCI	-88.22351721298988	-8.690058505325396	161440
