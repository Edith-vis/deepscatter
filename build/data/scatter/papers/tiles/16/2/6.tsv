152d407e3f93fff88c24024061c0c1b74d552140	contributing high quantity and quality knowledge to online q&a communities	knowledge;motivation	This study investigates the motivational factors affecting the quantity and quality of voluntary knowledge contribution in online Q&A communities. Although previous studies focus on knowledge contribution quantity, this study regards quantity and quality as two important, yet distinct, aspects of knowledge contribution. Drawing on self-determination theory, this study proposes that five motivational factors, categorized along the extrinsic-intrinsic spectrum of motivation, have differential effects on knowledge contribution quantity versus quality in the context of online Q&A communities. An online survey with 367 participants was conducted in a leading online Q&A community to test the research model. Results show that rewards in the reputation system, learning, knowledge self-efficacy, and enjoy helping stand out as important motivations. Furthermore, rewards in the reputation system, as a manifestation of the external regulation, is more effective in facilitating the knowledge contribution quantity than quality. Knowledge self-efficacy, as a manifestation of intrinsic motivation, is more strongly related to knowledge contribution quality, whereas the other intrinsic motivation, enjoy helping, is more strongly associated with knowledge contribution quantity. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed.		Jie Lou;Yulin Fang;Kai H.

This paper focuses on whether taking a break with a smart phones (e.g., browsing the internet or using social network services) has a different association with regaining vitality after 'conventional breaks' (e.g., walking or chatting face to face with friends). We surveyed a total of 450 workers in Korea with a diary questionnaire to see if there were differences in the effects of breaks via two theoretical paths of association: positively in terms of vigor and negatively in terms of emotional exhaustion. Empirical results show that psychological detachments by breaks, independent of break modes, did increase vigor and reduce emotional exhaustion, consistent with the existing literature. However, we also found that the effects, particularly in reducing emotional exhaustion, were significantly lower for the smart phone break group versus the conventional group. We discuss some theoretical and practical implications of these findings. We examined the effect of psychological detachment (PD) on revitalizing energy.PD increases vigor through positive affect.PD decreases emotional exhaustion through negative affect.The two types of breaks moderate the relationship of PD and negative affect.Two types of breaks do not moderate the relationship of PD and positive affect.	smartphone	Hongjai Rhee;Sudong Kim	2016	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.056	psychology;simulation;emotional exhaustion;communication;social psychology	HCI	-87.3518563076732	-18.93415026996098	49102

From an economic perspective, people join peer-to-peer (P2P) networks based on the size of the networks. However, from a sociological perspective, when people adopt technologies, they create an alternative social network motivated by extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. In this study, we develop a conceptual framework for measuring the impact of economic and social factors drawn from theories of network externalities and social exchange. The preliminary data analyses show that perceived size of network influences perceived network externalities, and in turn, network externalities have an impact on intention to adopt P2P technologies. In addition, we found that social benefit is also an important antecedent of adopting P2P technologies. Our preliminary results provide insights on how people reconcile economic and social considerations when choosing to adopt a P2P technology.	interaction;peer-to-peer;social network;theory	Jaeki Song;Eric Walden	2007	IJEBR	10.4018/jebr.2007100103	organizational network analysis;public relations;social relation;social science;social competence;marketing;network effect;peer-to-peer;conceptual framework;social psychology;social exchange theory;social network	Web+IR	-87.29447938255771	-13.008426909654982	49229

A doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2011.07.006 ⇑ Tel.: +886 935 405 721; fax: +886 3 5509658. E-mail address: chuncheng@mail.nctu.edu.tw. The purpose of this study is to find the key factors influencing blog design, and explore the causal relationships between the criteria for each factor. Since design is a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, this study adopts a model which is a hybrid of factor analysis and the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method (DEMATEL). The DEMATEL method is used to simplify and visualize the interrelationships between criteria in making a decision. This study found five core factors that influence blog design: visual clarity, interface and usability, content and searchability, programming, and sociability. In addition, the key criteria for each factor were identified and the impact-relation maps obtained. The results of this study can provide useful guidance to blog designers for developing better blog platforms. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Ninety-seven participants estimated their chances of experiencing 31 positive and negative internet events compared to the average student at their school. The data indicated that students believed positive internet events were more likely to happen to them and negative events were less likely to happen to them compared to the average student. Heavy internet users reported more optimistic responses than did light users. Perceptions of event characteristics (controllability, desirability, and personal experience) were also significantly correlated with optimistic bias.

On the Internet, patients may encounter patient peers in online support groups (OSGs) focused on their particular chronic illness. We currently know very little about how patients assess the credibility of information posted by other patients in OSGs. This poster examines this issue, presenting data from a grounded theory study on health information seeking and personal health information disclosure in OSGs for CKD. The poster describes how patients use similarity as a credibility cue. The data demonstrate that information on OSGs is assessed differently than information presented on static websites, extending our notions of how users assess trustworthiness and credibility online. These findings also extend our understanding of how users make these judgments on the Internet by describing the development of criteria assessments over time, relative to the illness experiences of the seeker. This poster also highlights the importance of shared experience when judging trustworthiness in OSGs, a concept that has received little attention in the literature to date.	disease ontology;experience;information seeking;internet;intersubjectivity;social media;trust (emotion);web design	Kaitlin Light Costello	2014		10.1002/meet.2014.14505101105	multimedia;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-85.06959218629613	-20.81405452809453	49575

Unfortunately these experiences like reviews on products and/or services are sometimes conflicting and thus, do not help develop a concise opinion on these products and/or services. This paper presents a multi-stage approach that extracts and consolidates reviews after addressing specific issues such as user multi-identity and user limited credibility.

Several studies have addressed delays in the context of Web sites as well as interactive corporate systems, and have recommended a wide range of “rules of thumb.” Some studies conclude that response times should be no greater than 2 seconds while other studies caution on delays of 12 seconds or more. One of the strongest conclusions was that complex tasks seemed to allow longer response times. This study examined delay times of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 seconds using 196 undergraduate students in an experiment. Randomly assigned a constant delay time, subjects were asked to complete 9 search tasks, exploring a familiar and an unfamiliar site.

Focusing only on the familiar site, explained variance in attitudes and behavioral intentions grew to about 16%. A sensitivity analysis implies that decreases in performance and behavioral intentions begin to flatten when the delays extend to 4 seconds or longer, and attitudes flatten when the delays extend to 8 seconds or longer. Future research should include other factors such as expectations, variability, and feedback, and other outcomes such as actual purchasing behavior, to more fully understand the effects of delays in today’s Web environment.	blender (software);heart rate variability;human–computer interaction;icis;journal of the association for information systems;nonlinear system;purchasing;randomness;vex prefix;web page	Dennis F.

As socio-economic status at birth is a strong predictor of future socio-econ omic status, slum children seem destined to a life of poverty. Howeve r, merging examples of empowerment appear to demon strate possibilities of information technology to benefit the lives of slum children. In this paper, we use s ocial cognitive theory to study why children participate in IT learning in th e absence of formal training courses, using the con structs of symbolizing, forethought, visceral, self-regulating and self-ref lecting human capabilities. In doing this, we atte mpt to validate a theoretical basis for human capabilities of slum children to ov ercome the forces of environmental determinism work ing against them.	demon seed;kerrison predictor;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;planning;self-reference;urban computing	Vishnu Vinekar	2008			development economics;economics;socioeconomics;economic growth	HCI	-79.23329937004215	-10.055028197774845	49727

College students (N = 227) completed a questionnaire and reported on their trait Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism, and the degree to which they cyberbullied (i.e., both visual and text based bullying) others in the past year. Correlations revealed that all three Dark Triad traits were related positively with cyberbullying. However, multiple regression analysis revealed that of the three Dark Triad traits, psychopathy emerged as the unique predictor of cyberbullying. These findings reinforce extant research suggesting that personality traits are important predictors of computer-mediated behavior. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

At work, email remains the primary way for sharing information, despite years of knowledge management research. We examine the design of a system for lightweight organizational sharing called Mail2Tag, which augments email by utilizing existing email sharing practices to help gather content, implicitly organize that content, and evolve both the shared content and the groups of people interested in that content. The vision is to get the right information to the right people at the right time, without increasing overall information noise.	categorization;denial-of-service attack;email;habitat;knowledge management	Lester Nelson;Rowan Nairn;Ed Huai-hsin Chi;Gregorio Convertino	2011	2011 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS)	10.1109/CTS.2011.5928661	the internet;computer science;knowledge management;noise;internet privacy;management;world wide web;collaboration	HCI	-83.48729244355857	-14.946380230924024	49797

Most of these derive from the need for a strong, widely accepted research methodology which can discriminate between competing claims and support deductive theory. This paper reports an empirical study comparing the use of experimentation in computer science to its usage in other disciplines. Hemple (1966) divides scientific inquiry into the empirical and the non-empirinal sciences. """" . . [D]ependence on empirical evidence distinguishes the empirinal sciences from the non-empirical disciplines . . whose propositions are proved without essential reference to empirical findings."""" The empirical sciences obtain evidence by induction (primarily observation and experimentation) while the non-empirical sciences depend on deduction (logic and proof). Computer science employs the methods of both the empirical and the non-empirical sciences. Kaplan (1964) identifies experimentation as """". -a process of observation, to be carried out in a situation especially brought about for that purpose."""" He indicates that certain cultures, like that of ancient Greece, did not develop into successful modern cultures because they lacked experimentation and, hence, the ability to determine causation, even though they had highly developed powers of reason and observation. Bynum, Browne & Porter (1981) define an experiment as a """" . . contrived set of observations, carried out under artificially produced and deliberately controlled, reproducible conditions."""" Central to these definitions is the notion that significant factors can be separated into independent and dependent variables. A hypothesis is a formal statement which causally relates independent and dependent variables. An experiment is a controlled empirical test of a hypothesis.

The goal gradient theory has not yet been adopted to examine how relationship characteristics (i.e., length, depth, and breadth) impact online gamer loyalty. Therefore, this study develops hypotheses based on that theory and uses structural equation modeling to test them. Responses from 5,144 online gamers were used for the analysis and the results indicate that relationship length, depth, and breadth were positively related to goal proximity (defined as the perception that a goal is close), which was further positively related to motivation to attain gaming goals, and consequently online gamer loyalty. This study is the first to explore—by using the goal gradient theoretical perspective—how relationship length, depth, and breadth are related to online gamer loyalty.	customer relationship management;e-services;gradient;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;structural equation modeling	Ching-I Teng	2017	Int.

(2) Are monopolies possibly temporarily limited? (3) What does this mean for competition (or antitrust) law? Results: (1) Direct network effects (number of users) and indirect network effects (complementary products and advertising) facilitate the development of one standard und thus a quasi-monopoly. There is empirical evidence that there are indeed standards on SNS markets (Facebook in the U.S. and Germany, Vkontakte in Russia). (2) The standards seem to be temporary monopolies. Yet, no innovator survived as a standard. (3) The dominant market position of a standard on the SNS market alone is no problem for Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). But if a dominant company tries to immunize its leading position (e.g. by mergers and acquisitions), such behavior can be scrutinized. On two-sided markets, it would be possible to define the relevant market much broader than the small SNS market. When we consider the whole online advertising market as relevant, many of Article 102’s problems are avoided.		Katsiaryna S. Baran;Kaja Fietkiewicz;Wolfgang G.

In the formation of the European Community and the European Union, questions of identity have always been a crucial issue. While it is certainly possible to support the European Union without having a European identity, the creation of a cohesive force in supranational and international relations necessitates a shared sense of community. This chapter analyzes how much self-concepts differ among Europeans and in comparison to non-Europeans. It gives an overview of public opinion concerning important EU issues and describes how Europeans feel about Europe and the European Union. It then presents an explanation how individual characteristics, attitudes, and self-concepts inform their attitudes toward Europe and European integration. The chapter shows that important prerequisites for constructing a European identity are not in place. The EU commands little loyalty in its own right. Affective affinity to an abstract idea of Europe is widespread but is too general to provide a collective self-description. As a consequence, people’s willingness to show solidarity throughout Europe and to accepting re-distribution policies can be expected to stay fragile.  		R. B.

The privacy has become a vital issue in the modern age of information due to the complex, dynamic and fluid nature of privacy it is far from easy to define and understand what privacy means in certain situations. Consequently, designers of interactive systems often misunderstand privacy and even often ignore it, thus causing concerns for users. Using content analysis approach [1], qualitative data was collected and analysed from 130 online bloggers during the deployment phase of Proctortrack tool. The results and findings provide useful new insights into the nature and form of privacy concerns of online learners. Findings have theoretical as well as practical implications for the successful adoption of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and similar systems.

However, the way in which families articulate themselves to care for their older members depends on cultural and social factors, which are different across societies. Given these differences, the design of CSCW systems and related services to support informal elderly caregiving requires contextual understanding of the complex and diverse living experiences and needs of older adults. This paper presents a cross-generational study to better understand the cooperative nature of informal elderly caregiving in Chile and Argentina. The study results show that family members assume implicit roles to fulfill their duties, with practically no coordination and no visibility of the assumed commitments within the family network. This implies that the articulation of the elderly caregiving is inefficient, conflict prone, and unbalanced, where family members assume a separation of concerns based on gender and kinship relationship with the older adult.	biconnected component;care-of address;computer-supported cooperative work;experience;separation of concerns;tango;unbalanced circuit	Francisco J.

Thus, merchants are eager to attract more followers in order to maximize the marketing effect on social media platforms. In this study, we examine how to increase the number of followers through promotion tweets in micro-blogging site. Drawing on Expectancy theory, we argue that the number of followers would increase significantly if the promotion tweets from the merchant facilitate users with more attractive deal and require lower level of efforts. We contextualize our study on the micro-blogging account of a daily-deal group-buying merchant. The number of followers was recorded on hourly basis and the promotion tweets were collected. The results indicate the attractiveness of lucky draw product from the promotion tweet has significant effect on the increase of the follower number.	blog;social media marketing	Yi Liu;Bernadetta Tarigan	2016		10.1145/2971603.2971605	public relations;engineering;marketing;advertising	HCI	-85.92295648648167	-13.547125968607224	51216

Several authors have suggested that social media use erodes our strong ties by increasing the volume of social interactions and decreasing their depth. Using two-wave panel data representative of the Dutch population between 15 and 45 years, we examine changes in the core discussion networks (CDNs) of 5312 respondents (with 10,896 relations). Contradicting an erosion of strong ties, we found positive effects of social media use on CDN size, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Social media use was positively related to talking to CDN members in our cross-sectional model. Finally, we found that the CDNs of frequent social media users were more dynamic than those of less frequent users: they are more likely to both lose old and gain new ties. This suggests that Internet use is associated with more, and more dynamic, social interaction.

The core question investigated in this article is whether libraries as social and cultural institutions have a role to play in enabling individuals to acquire the types of skills and competencies that extend far beyond the realm of the library walls to encompass practices that translate into various spheres of individuals’ lives, including their participation in political, economic and civic life. Design/methodology/approach – Interviews were conducted in 1999 with 49 library policymakers in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic (and selected follow-up interviews were conducted in 2002), to shed light on the role of libraries in social and political reconfigurations of their nations. Findings – The library is a ubiquitous component of the information environment of any society and plays a critical role in connecting information resources and services with users. Yet, despite their ubiquity and centrality in the production, management and dissemination of information in society, libraries have been largely neglected in many CEE countries. Libraries can play a critical role in political reconfiguration of their nation by building the types of skills and competencies that will empower individuals and thereby contribute to shaping an information culture that meets the needs of the time. Originality/value – The paper contributes to one’s understanding of the political dimensions of the provision of information resources.	caidi;centrality;documentation;download;email;emerald;emergence;information culture;interviews;librarian;library (computing);noise shaping;organizational behavior;process (computing);top-down and bottom-up design	Nadia Caidi	2006	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/00220410610653299	library science;social science;design methods;library;role;information literacy;sociology	HCI	-77.72057137463081	-11.020204637001308	51664

Drawing on the relationship marketing literature, this study formulates and tests a theoretical model to explain B2C ecommerce consumer repurchase intention from the perspective of relationship quality. The model was empirically tested through a large-scale survey conducted in Northern Ireland. The results show that relationship quality impacts consumer repurchase intention positively. Meanwhile, relationship quality is positively influenced by vendor expertise on order fulfillment, vendor reputation, and website usability. Vendor opportunistic behavior influences relationship quality negatively. Implications for future research and practice are also discussed.

Previous studies have documented the importance of personality traits, class attendance, and social network structure. Because most of these analyses were based on a single behavioral aspect and/or small sample sizes, there is currently no quantification of the interplay of these factors. Here, we study the academic performance among a cohort of 538 undergraduate students forming a single, densely connected social network. Our work is based on data collected using smartphones, which the students used as their primary phones for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from a single population allows us to directly compare the explanatory power of individual and social characteristics. We find that the most informative indicators of performance are based on social ties and that network indicators result in better model performance than individual characteristics (including both personality and class attendance). We confirm earlier findings that class attendance is the most important predictor among individual characteristics. Finally, our results suggest the presence of strong homophily and/or peer effects among university students.	behavioral pattern;information;kerrison predictor;smartphone;social network	Valentin Kassarnig;Enys Mones;Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen;Piotr Sapiezynski;David Dreyer Lassen;Sune Lehmann	2018	EPJ Data Science	10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0138-8	data science;homophily;computer science;interpersonal ties;attendance;applied psychology;population;behavioral pattern;social network;personality;big five personality traits	Metrics	-86.91453618589966	-22.07444868482784	51713

In 2011 24% of venture capital in the US went into Internet companies adding up to a total of $6.9 billion (PwC & NVCA, 2011). With such high stakes the question of e-commerce success is more topical than ever. Google, one of the biggest e-commerce companies in the world, despite huge successful products like Google Search, has also seen failures. In this paper, we explore factors associated with successful and unsuccessful adoption of Google products using a literature study in conjunction with qualitative analysis of the Google Search, Google Health, and Google Plus products. Our research identifies key success factors for user adoption of Google products and predicts that Google Plus in its present form will lead to failure. The study shows that perceived compatibility, perceived usefulness, information quality, balancing risks with trust, and finally social pressure are important success factors for Google. Despite limiting the examination to Google products, results can serve as a guideline for other e-commerce ventures	google search;google+	Marcel Landeweerd;Ton A. M.

One hundred sixty seven children from varied ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds participated in the study. Regardless of gender, socio-economic status or ethnic group, most children had access to computers in and outside of schools. In both settings, pre-K through grade 2 children report that they primarily use computers to play games. Children’s attitudes toward computers are positive. Older children tend to use the computer more often, are better able to operate the computer and their attitudes towards computers are more positive. Boys’ attitudes towards computers are more positive than the attitudes of girls, but no gender differences were found for computer use nor ability level. While no significant differences were found between the attitudes of Dutch and immigrant children, the latter group indicated more frequent use. Also, children from a lower socio-economic neighborhood had more positive attitudes towards computers and used computers slightly more often than middle class children. The findings of this study inform the debate on the desirability of young children’s exposure to computers at home as well as in educational settings. Further, these findings may help educators and parents to both critically assess their current practices (e.g. the relative value of the most frequently used applications – games), and strive to integrate developmentally appropriate uses of technology at home and in classrooms. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a model suggested by flow theory in which shoppers are grouped into four categories (flow, anxiety, boredom, and apathy) based on their perceptions of task challenge and their skill in performing an online shopping task. Results show that anxious shoppers have lower perceptions of the dimensions of flow, believe online shopping Web sites are less useful, and believe they are less likely to use the system in the future compared to the other three groups of online shoppers. In addition to challenge and skill, having a clear goal and fast feedback also contribute to the flow experience.	channel (communications);online shopping	Yi Maggie Guo;Barbara D.

Social shopping sites emerged as the latest developments to leverage the power of social networking with online shopping. Despite enormous business interests and potentials, little is known about whether users will adopt such systems. This paper extended the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to understand the adoption of social shopping sites. Besides perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness as proposed in TAM, this study explores three additional constructs: an online shopper’s tendency to social comparison, social presence, and perceived enjoyment in using the website. Results suggest that perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment both affect behavioral intention to adopt social shopping sites. Users’ tendency to social comparison and perception of social presence are also significant antecedents in the model. Directions for future research are discussed.	e-commerce;ibm tivoli access manager;online shopping;social network;social presence theory;social shopping;usability	Jia Shen;Lauren B.

74714b194ae2abc61b14f0fdc5d6eb2769ff781c	how do the internet buyers' decisions be affected? - an experimental study of risky choice framing effect	framing effect	For Net-enhanced organizations (NEOs), business is conducted at a distance and risks are magnified. In effect, Internet buyers can solely rely on information provided by the Web sites to make decisions. Consequently, the way to present information favorable to the Internet business operators is very important. This study aims to understand whether positively and negatively framed messages result in different choices made by the Internet buyers. Further, the effect of subject’s intrinsic self-relevance to the framing effect is also considered in the current study. The research is conducted by using laboratory experiment. The results indicate that the risky choice framing effect partly exists in Internet buyers’ product decisions. Specifically, when the subjects are highly related to the research context, they won’t be affected by the framing of messages because they are eager to obtain the target product. As a result, most subjects are prone to avoid risks. On the other hand, there is significant risky choice framing effect for subjects with low intrinsic self-relevance. In this group, subjects are prone to avoid risks when they were presented with positive information, whereas most people incline to take risks, and thus choose the risky option if the problem are framed negatively.	dot-com company;experiment;framing (world wide web);framing (social sciences);internet;relevance;world wide web	Chin-Shan Wu;Fei-Fei Cheng;Hsin-Hui Lin	2004			framing (construction);instrumental and intrinsic value;marketing;the internet;framing effect;public relations;computer science	HCI	-89.56770439739647	-13.438402960492994	52349

However, creating a functional network of followers to whom to promote content is not a straightforward task. On the one side, collecting followers requires time. On the other side, companies need to establish a reputation to motivate users to follow them.  A number of websites have emerged to help Twitter users create a large network of followers. These websites promise their subscribers to provide followers in exchange for a fee or limited services free of charge but in exchange for the user's Twitter account credentials. In addition, they offer to spread their clients' promotional messages in the network. In this paper, we study the phenomenon of these Twitter Account Markets, and we show how their services are often linked to abusive behavior and compromised Twitter profiles.	credential	Gianluca Stringhini;Manuel Egele;Christopher Krügel;Giovanni Vigna	2012		10.1145/2342549.2342551	world wide web;computer security	Web+IR	-85.18631629903322	-13.436329465100155	52494

Many social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn) support new interpersonal interaction methods, some of which are neither directed nor reciprocated. For example, social media users can read online 'posts' (self-disclosures) of their friends without interacting with those friends. This is vastly different to traditional face-to-face communication. Our study investigated how reading online 'posts' affects relationship development. Using a longitudinal design sampling 243 participants, we focused on the effect of the posts' valence and intimacy. We found that high intimacy posts or negative posts decreased the social attractiveness of the self-discloser. The perception of the posts and the receiver's feelings of homophily to the self-discloser mediated this relationship. Studies of offline interpersonal interaction have found similar results. In offline communication, self-disclosure perception and homophily also mediate relationship outcomes. This suggests that reading posts on social media and interacting in real life trigger similar or identical relationship formation pathways. These results support the argument that passive consumption is a new method of interaction that does not fundamentally change human psychology. While novel, passive consumption is still based on the same principles as offline communication.	social media	Amy C.

The explosive growth of social media has intrigued many scholars to inquire into why people willingly share information with others. However, relatively little attention has been devoted to how people determine which information they share in the networked environment. In this study, a 2 (network density - dense vs. sparse)i?2 (knowledge - expert vs. novice)i?3 (information valence - negative vs. neutral vs. positive) online experiment was performed to examine how the three factors interact and cross over in shaping individuals' perceptions of the value of information for themselves and for others in the network. Results show that individuals' perceptions of information value are influenced not just by their level of knowledge, but also by how the network environment is structured. Implications for the findings are discussed.	social media	Dongyoung Sohn	2014	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2013.12.006	psychology;social media;computer science;knowledge management;knowledge;communication;social psychology;world wide web	AI	-86.8139948044481	-14.254523622397992	53413

Specifically, the work investigates the main effect of online ratings and its interaction with operation duration and the number of screens. An ordered logit model is employed with a sample of 1902 cinemas multihoming on O2O platforms. The findings show that online ratings have significantly positive impact on platform multihoming. A cinema’s operation duration negatively moderates the relationship between online ratings and platform multihoming, while its number of screens positively moderates the relationship.

In order to establish external validity, we collected data based on a set of realistic sport tracking apps and conducted an online experiment. Based on a sample of 2,042 individuals, we found that as in other online contexts (e.g., online shopping), e-Trust plays an important role in the context of mobile app transactions, significantly influencing an individual’s decision to download or purchase an unfamiliar app. Interestingly though, we found that e-Trust has a different factor structure in this specific context compared to previous studies. In addition, not only individual disposition to trust was an important antecedent of e-Trust, but also gender, though in a different way than we expected. Men reported lower levels of e-Trust than women.	landing page	Thomas Fischer;Anja Obermüller;Andreas Auinger;Harald Kindermann;René Riedl	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-91716-0_22	internet privacy;landing page;app store;disposition;download;computer science;external validity	HCI	-89.40841807689077	-14.77802102103871	54172

They provide information about the social characteristics of individuals such as interests, activities, affiliations, location and so forth. They’re also a rich source of subtle information that may help understand the type of person one is. Employers screen candidates’ SMPs during the recruiting process and reconsider their decision in light of what they find. Occasionally the information in SMPs leads to employment but often, it has a negative effect on hiring decisions leading to rejection. While no employability criteria appears to be used for social media screening, employers are negatively affected by profanity, reference to drugs, alcohol, or posts of sexual nature. However, positively impressed by references to voluntarism or charitable activities. Employability skills comprise soft skills, attitudes and personality traits. They are generic, non-subject domain specific, nontechnical, intangible attributes, related to one’s personality and profession‐ alism. The current work investigates how people can curate their SMPs to display employability skills. To do so, it presents ESCORT: Employability Skills COntent cuRation Tool which was designed and developed to support the assess‐ ment of SMPs and guide the curation of the same.	digital curation;rejection sampling;social media	Inmaculada Arnedillo Sánchez;Crysanthi Tseloudi	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-66610-5_55	employability;computer science;multimedia;knowledge management;soft skills;big five personality traits;social media;personality;voluntarism (action)	HCI	-82.57298543828924	-23.79200329804581	54537

This model hypothesizes that constructs, including shared vision, reputation, altruism, and self-efficacy, positively influence these attitudes and, by extension, positively impact knowledge-sharing intention. A conventional sampling method and the direct recruitment of physicians at their outpatient clinic gathered valid data from a total of 164 physicians for analysis in the model. The empirical results support the validity of the proposed model and identified shared vision as the most significant factor of influence on knowledge-sharing attitudes, followed in descending order by knowledge-sharing self-efficacy, reputation, and altruism.

AMOS software was used to analyze the data from the questionnaire survey. The results indicate that the effects of consumer ethnocentrism are significant in the case of domestic and foreign products in China, and the hypotheses of country-of-origin image on purchase intention of domestic products, animosity on perceived quality of both domestic and foreign products are not supported. Implications for managers of domestic and multinational companies are also discussed.	amos;foreign function interface	Xianguo Li;Jing Yang;Xia Wang;Da Lei	2012	JSW		questionnaire;machine learning;multinational corporation;marketing;artificial intelligence;china;consumer ethnocentrism;computer science;country of origin	HCI	-89.67993121955085	-10.24102281445392	55079

While friendships can be both an asset but also a burden, the impact friends have on goal attainment is not well established in the literature. We explore the influence that friend quantity and quality have on individual task-oriented goal-directed behavior using a unique set of online gaming data with a sample of about 33,000 individuals. Our results indicate a nonlinear relationship that suggests the number as well as the intimacy level of friendships positively impact individual goal achievement, but too much social friending becomes detrimental to individual goal pursuit. Females benefit slightly more from friendship amount and intimacy level, but also suffer more from too many exchanges with friends. Similarly, novice individuals not only benefit more from social influence than more experienced individuals in terms of goal pursuit, but also hurt more from friending behaviors. Our follow-up surveys with actual gamers provide additional evidence that friends indeed proffer information and emotional support that can promote goal attainment. However, too much friending can hurt goal completion due to information overload and time demands. These findings have important implications for consumers and managers regarding how social others influence individual goal attainment.	information overload;nonlinear system;virtual world	Chee Wei Phang;Zhang Cheng;Xueming Luo;Jessica Keech;Michelle Andrews	2014			e-commerce;public relations;social influence;computer science;social psychology;world wide web;commerce	ML	-89.36407611951233	-13.988913217291937	55564

c1a9252e0fc9aecbb5d04a6ac326b345aa9d5b3a	computing the everyday: social media as data platforms		We conceive social media platforms as socio-technical entities that variously shape user platform involvement and participation. Such shaping develops along three fundamental data operations that we subsume under the terms of encoding, aggregation and computation. Encoding entails the engineering of user platform participation along narrow and standardized activity types (e.g. tagging, liking, sharing, following). This heavily scripted platform participation serves as the basis for the procurement of discrete and calculable data tokens that are possible to aggregate and, subsequently, compute in a variety of ways. We expose these operations by investigating a social media platform for shopping. We contribute to the current debate on social media and digital platforms by describing social media as post transactional spaces that are predominantly concerned with charting and profiling the online predispositions, habits and opinions of their user base. Such an orientation sets social media platforms apart from other forms of mediating online interaction. In social media, we claim, platform participation is driven towards an endless online conversation that delivers the data footprint through which a computed sociality is made the source of value creation and monetization.	activity recognition;aggregate data;character encoding;computability;computation;entity;monetization;multimedia framework;noise shaping;online chat;procurement;social media;sociotechnical system;tag (metadata)	Cristina Alaimo;Jannis Kallinikos	2017	Inf.

Predicting which newly-submitted items will become popular is critically important for both the hosts of social media content and its consumers. Accurate and timely prediction would enable hosts to maximize revenue through differential pricing for access to content or ad placement. Prediction would also give consumers an important tool for filtering the content. Predicting the popularity of content in social media is challenging due to the complex interactions between content quality and how the social media site highlights its content. Moreover, most social media sites selectively present content that has been highly rated by similar users, whose similarity is indicated implicitly by their behavior or explicitly by links in a social network. While these factors make it difficult to predict popularity a priori, stochastic models of user behavior on these sites can allow predicting popularity based on early user reactions to new content. By incorporating the various mechanisms through which web sites display content, such models improve on predictions that are based on simply extrapolating from the early votes. Specifically, for one such site, the news aggregator Digg, we show how a stochastic model distinguishes the effect of the increased visibility due to the network from how interested users are in the content. We find a wide range of interest, distinguishing stories primarily of interest to users in the network (“niche interests”) from those of more general interest to the user community. This distinction is useful for predicting a story’s eventual popularity from users’ early reactions to the story.	extrapolation;interaction;news aggregator;niche blogging;social dynamics;social media;social network;stochastic process;virtual community	Kristina Lerman;Tad Hogg	2012	ACM TIST	10.1145/2337542.2337547	social dynamics;social science;computer science;machine learning;internet privacy;world wide web;social network	Web+IR	-85.40425816122472	-14.41868562651471	55971

Interactivity refers to the reciprocity provided by a site during the process of using it and it has been positioned conceptually as a process, a function a nd a perception. Implemented appropriately may affect the success or failure of commercial websites. Perceived interactivity should be based on consumer s’ actual interactions with the stimulus and means that consumers have perceived control over in fo mation and communication flow. Expected interactivity is the extent of interactivity that a person expects to experience during a prospective interaction with a medium. The paper explores the d ifferentiations between consumers’ expected interactivity towards the web, and their perceived interactivity of hotel websites. The top25 hotel websites are used for the analysis. A group of user s rate both expected interactivity towards the web and perceived interactivity of the hotel websites. Recently developed scales of perceived interactivit y are used, which emphasize response time, communicat io , control, responsiveness and personalization issues. A comparison of expected wi th perceived interactivity is performed. The findings indicate that the hotel web sites are info rmative and perform fast but they provide less cont rol than expected, while provide primarily one-way and no concurrent communication.	interaction;interactivity;norm (social);one-way function;personalization;prospective search;response time (technology);responsiveness;traffic flow (computer networking)	Costas Zafiropoulos;Vasiliki Vrana;Despoina Karystinaiou	2007			personalization;marketing;interactivity;reciprocity (social psychology);uniqueness;multimedia;flow (psychology);computer science;perceived control	Web+IR	-88.53679162653934	-14.184581747831992	56124

In this context, the focus of the paper is set on presenting the case of the first South East European (SEE) Science Festival developed in the framework of the SEE Science project. Then, the paper presents the structural design of the festival which ultimately enabled a proper integration of a transnational consortium's input into the framework of a locally managed event with the intended local outreach of science and innovation for youth. The positive outcomes driven by the structural design of the first SEE Science Festival can serve as a good reference point for other science centres from SEE that intend to boost youth's interest in science and innovation.

Unlike polls or sur veys, our approach does not elicit opinions but approximates what the public th inks by analysing the discussions in which they decide to take part. We measure the motional content of online discussions in three dimensions (valence, ar ousal and dominance), paying special attention to deviation around average value s, which we use as a proxy for disagreement and polarisation. We show that this m easurement of public opinion helps predict presidential approval rates, sug gesting that there is a point of connection between online discussions (often deemed not representative of the overall population) and offline polls. We also show that this measurement provides a deeper understanding of the individual mechanisms that dr ive aggregated shifts in public opinion. Our data spans a period that includes two U S presidential elections, the attacks of September 11, and the start of military action in Afghanistan and Iraq.	online and offline	Sandra González-Bailón;Rafael E.

NSA (need for social assurance) and NIC (need for immediate connection) were selected as mediating steps between the two. A total of 615 U.S. American participants were recruited nationally for survey participation. Research findings suggest that individuals who are lonely would rely on smartphone hoping to be connected with and get assurance from others, but might end up struggling with problematic use of smartphone. Those with ADHD showed higher levels of loneliness, NSA, NIC, and problematic use of smartphone, and also showed stronger associations linking loneliness, NSA and NIC compared to those without ADHD. Face-to-face (FtF) interaction decreased the association between NSA and NIC for those with ADHD.	smartphone	Jung-Hyun Kim	2018	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.11.025	social psychology;psychology;loneliness;covert	HCI	-86.92938752287738	-19.69483187101388	56351

The 1985 General Social Survey network instrument is used to evaluate the effect of integration on anomia and the probability of unhappiness. Results indicate that contact with religiously homogeneous others paired with personal religious belief reduces anomia and the likelihood of unhappiness. Additionally, while ego/alter closeness is important, alter/alter closeness is not. These results suggest that individuals benefit from religious association more so than religious community. Additional analyses indicate that these results are unlikely to be due to homophily.	motorola canopy;network theory	Matthew E.

4079000a2a135d28e81bcc38953b3189e641f1ac	collaboration technology in teams and organizations: introduction to the special issue		Information technology advances in recent years have facilitated new forms of information and knowledge sharing. Teams and organizations are increasingly exploring and adopting new technologies to support collaborative work. Such technologies range from collaboration and communication technologies that connect members of virtual teams across national and international boundaries to social media technologies that allow teams and organizations to disseminate and gather information from within and outside their institutional boundaries. The widespread availability of smart phones has given whole societies opportunities to participate in large-scale sensemaking, problem solving, and efforts to organize collaborative action. Some of the more popular modern collaboration technologies that have been widely employed in organizations include wikis, social networks, crowdsourcing, tagging plugins, and mashups (Andriole 2010; Van Osch et al. 2015; Go and You 2016). Awiki is a web-based application that allows users to collaboratively develop and modify web pages. The most wellknown example of a wiki is Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia that has been developed and maintained by thousands of volunteers for over 15 years. A wiki system can facilitate knowledge acquisition and support collaboration and communication among members of an organization. Specifically, wikis have the potential to serve as dynamically evolving organizational knowledge repositories by harvesting fragmented knowledge contributed by users. Compared to traditional knowledge management systems (KMSs), wiki systems put less emphasis on centralized control, strict discipline, and extensive monitoring, while users do not need to possess significant technical expertise to participate in the contribution process (Hasan and Pfaff 2006). Experiences with the organizational application of wikis have shown that although wikis require constant contributions to ensure sustainability, they provide a low-cost solution to knowledge management in terms of the creation and deployment of knowledge repositories (Almeida and Rocha 2011; Standing and Kiniti 2011; Arazy and Gellatly 2012). Furthermore, studies suggest that wikis are more effective in facilitating tacit and informational knowledge sharing among organization members than traditional KMSs (Cress and Kimmerle 2008; Standing and Kiniti 2011). Organizations can employ social network technologies both internally and externally. Using internal social networks, individuals can shorten their learning cycle by exploring shared experiences of colleagues (Lin and Hsueh 2006). * Kewen Wu kew259@mail.usask.ca		Gert-Jan de Vreede;Pedro Antunes;Julita Vassileva;Marco Aurélio Gerosa;Kewen Wu	2016	Information Systems Frontiers	10.1007/s10796-016-9632-3	knowledge management;management science	AI	-80.12624395348753	-12.571161343217131	56452

In this setting, pseudonyms (where a recording is reissued under a fictitious name) were used deceptively as a way to preserve a firm’s identity while selling profitable but identity-threatening products to the mass market. Firms founded in the Victorian Era actively sought alignment with the cultural elite and used pseudonyms to deceive observers into believing that their production of cultural products was consistent with their Victorian Era identity. In effect, pseudonyms allowed these firms to decouple their position in identity space from their position in product space by inflating production of identity-preserving products. Using product data from jazz discographies, record company directories, and record advertisements in major U.S. newspapers, we provide strong empirical evidence that Victorian Era firms were active in using pseudonyms to preserve their identities.	pseudonymity;serialization	Damon J.

Based on the Concern for Information Privacy (CFIP) scale developed by Smith and colleagues in 1996, we conducted an online survey using 15 items in four dimensions, namely, collection, unauthorized access, secondary use, and errors, to investigate Internet users’ concerns regarding the privacy of EMRs under health information exchanges (HIE). We retrieved 213 valid questionnaires. The results indicate that the respondents had substantial privacy concerns regarding EMRs and their educational level and EMR awareness significantly influenced their privacy concerns regarding unauthorized access and secondary use of EMRs. This study recommends that the Taiwanese government organizes a comprehensive EMR awareness campaign, emphasizing unauthorized access and secondary use of EMRs. Additionally, to cultivate the public’s understanding of EMRs, the government should employ various media, especially Internet channels, to promote EMR awareness, thereby enabling the public to accept the concept and use of EMRs. People who are highly educated and have superior EMR awareness should be given a comprehensive explanation of how hospitals protect patients’ EMRs from unauthorized access and secondary use to address their concerns. Thus, the public can comprehend, trust, and accept the use of EMRs, reducing their privacy concerns, which should facilitate the future implementation of HIE.	academic medical centers;authorization;contain (action);dimensions;electronic health records;electronics, medical;excalibur: morgana's revenge;health information exchange;hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy;information privacy	Hsin-Ginn Hwang;Hwai-En Han;Kuang-Ming Kuo;Chung-Feng Liu	2012	Journal of Medical Systems	10.1007/s10916-012-9851-1	internet privacy;computer security	HCI	-84.04740723790172	-22.671591881190793	56671

Social presence has been considered as a major design principle and important concept in explaining the relationship between online community artifacts and online user behavior. While most prior IS research adopts a unidimensional conceptualization of social presence and focuses on its effects on user attitude and/or behavior, this research employs a multidimensional conceptualization and demonstrates its suitability for understanding the effects of online community artifacts on social presence. More specifically, this research examines the effects of three categories of design artifacts (artifacts supporting self-presentation, deep profiling, and virtual co-presence) on three social presence dimensions (awareness, affective social presence and cognitive social presence). To validate the research model, a survey was conducted with four online communities. Different social presence dimensions were found to carry different weights in forming the overall sense of social presence and the effects of perceived usage of various online community artifacts varied for different social presence dimensions.	computer-mediated communication;online community;social presence theory;user experience design;user interface design	Kathy Ning Shen;Mohamed Khalifa	2008			public relations;political science;communication;social psychology;social computing;online participation	HCI	-87.06970522818688	-14.853937426974735	56791
e714429033b974ad518bdd0b028b212d5c0cbabf	access and equity in greenspace provision: a comparison of methods to assess the impacts of greening vacant land		Abstract#R##N##R##N#This research explores three methods of measuring access to greenspace in Philadelphia and their implications for assessing equity in access based on race and socioeconomic status. These three methods are then used to assess the impacts of a vacant land greening program which turns vacant lots into temporary greenspaces. This research explores the differences between findings when access to greenspace is measured based on distance to any greenspace, total amount of greenspace to which residents have access, or a hybrid measure in which access is determined based on proximity to a threshold amount of greenspace. Not only do assessments of equity differ between the three approaches, but so do determinations of the impact of greening vacant land. Blacks, Hispanics and renters are more likely to live close to a public greenspace than whites or homeowners, but live in proximity to smaller overall amounts of greenspace. Greening vacant land increases the proportion of all residents who live within walking distance of a greenspace and lessens but does not eliminate differences in total greenspace access. The greatest effects of greening vacant land are seen in addressing differences in relative likelihood of having access to a threshold amount of greenspace.		Megan Heckert	2013	Trans.

1def2be21a391ef1c0229b6d96af528278140009	assessing citizens acceptance of mobile voting system in developing countries: the case of egypt		"""In modern societies, information and communication technology is used to increase citizens’ participation in the democracy process. In developing countries, to enhance the democracy, there is need to utilize the ICT to enhance citizens’ participations in the elections. This created through making the voting easier for eligible voters and grant that their votes will be counted. This research identifies the factors that affect citizens’ intentions of adopting mobile voting systems by introducing a prototype of m-voting system to citizens in Egypt. Findings show that ease of use, usefulness, trust, and mobility have significant impact on citizens’ intention to use m-voting system.

Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. voting is considered inexpensive, fastest and the most efficient way to administer elections and count votes (Paul & Tanenbaum, 2009; Hajjar et al., 2006). Currently, there are different e-voting systems such as kiosks, voting through the internet, punch cards, and marksense (also called optical scan ballots) (Chaum et al., 2008; Hajjar et al., 2006). Most of the e-voting systems somehow have the same features such as ensuring voter authenticity while ensuring vote anonymity and vote-counting proof. However, there is a need for assuring the uniqueness of the vote and allowing for vote automation. This needs to be done while guaranteeing avoidance of software or hardware problems that could malfunction (Costa et al., 2008). Furthermore, the e-voting system is operated by diverse groups of people each with diverse training, experience, motive and opportunity that might influence the results (Paul & Tanenbaum, 2009; Villafiorita et al., 2009). Therefore, there should be a control over the combination of technology and human labor to ensure the success of any e-voting system. Mobile voting (m-voting) is considered to be an electronic voting system which removes the inherited limitations of the traditions and the e-voting systems that required, in many cases, the physical existence of the citizens in the polling location (Ayo et al., 2008; Ekong & Ekong, 2010). M-voting allows voting to be done via mobile devices which allow citizens to conduct voting from their home, work or on the move. Therefore, it enhances voter participation in elections. Reviewing the literature shows that there is a gap regarding investigating the factors that affect citizens’ intention of using m-voting system in developing countries. Moreover, many studies covered m-voting from technical perspective rather than usage side (Aditya et al., 2004; Chaum et al., 2008). In order to address this gap, a research question has been developed: “What are the factors that affect citizens’ adoption of m-voting system in Egypt?” Since there are no voting advice applications (VAA) available for investigation in developing countries, by identifying the factors affecting citizens adoption of electronic elections, a clear clue of which factors need to be considered if political parties would like to apply voting advice applications (VAA) in developing countries. To achieve this, a prototype of a mobile voting system was designed to show the users the interface of m-voting system that contains the major features for m-voting. This is followed by conducting a survey to examine which factors are significantly affecting the adoption of such a technology. The structure of this paper starts by reviewing the literature regarding mobile voting systems from technical and non technical perspectives which leads to developing the conceptual framework for m-voting adoption. This is followed by explaining the m-voting prototype and the survey construction. The paper continues with the data analysis, discussion of the research findings and the research limitations. 2. LITERATURE REVIEW In order to get in-depth understanding of the factors affecting citizens’ intention for adopting m-voting system, there is a need to understand the factors m-voting from both technical and non-technical perspectives. 2.1. M-Voting: Technical Perspective 2.1.1. Mobile Voting Architecture The electronic voting process normally follows five stages (Figure 1) (Daimi et al., 2005). Setup stage is the start used to initialize the voting parameters including candidates, voters, and authorities’ eligibility criteria, voting procedures, ballot validity rules and counting rules. Then registration and authentication of eligible voters is done and followed by the actual voting where voters select their candidates. The final stage of the voting is the Tally stage where the votes are collected, checked for validity and the final results are produced (Aditya et al., 2004). 11 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/assessing-citizens-acceptancemobile-voting/67137?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Journal Disciplines Computer Science, Security, and Information Technology, InfoSci-Technology Adoption, Ethics, and Human Computer Interaction eJournal Collection, InfoSciJournal Disciplines Business, Administration, and Management, InfoSci-Select.

It proposes an extended technology acceptance model, with perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and pleasure affecting the intention to continue using a technology. We hypothesized that these effects are moderated by the technology’s utilitarian and hedonic values. The model was validated for smartphone functions. A user survey showed that perceived ease of use significantly affected the intention to continue using only for high-utilitarian functions, whereas pleasure affected the intention to continue using only for high-hedonic functions. The effect of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness was stronger for high-utilitarian than for low-utilitarian functions. The effect of pleasure on perceived usefulness was stronger for high-hedonic than for low-hedonic functions. The results suggest that marketing should consider the nature of the functions.	smartphone;usability	Lingling Xu;Julian Lin;Hock Chuan Chan	2012	ACM Trans. Comput.-Hum.

The effect of relationship type was also taken into account in these investigations. The findings suggested that attachment style differences in interaction breadth and depth were present only in casual friendships. Preoccupied and dismissing individuals had a lower level of interaction breadth and depth than did secure and fearful individuals within this type of online relationship. A same pattern of attachment style differences was found in relationship satisfaction of casual online friendships.	attachments;cdisc sdtm relationship type terminology;fear (mental process);internet relationship	Jiali Ye	2007	Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	10.1089/cpb.2007.9982	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	HCI	-87.24835665738821	-19.73349592408282	57197

This study focused on how content defending and even celebrating anorexia as a lifestyle are circulated among social media users, and investigates the characteristics that promote wide propagation of such messages. We captured anorexia-related content on Tumblr, a popular blog for talking about eating disorders, during a one-month period. Among the 35,432 posts collected, we examined the most highly propagated posts and coded them for message characteristics. Our findings revealed that posts in which the source of a narrative (""""testimony"""") was identified (was either from an anorexic poster or about another's anorexia) and which were positive toward the pro-anorexia perspective were more likely to be propagated on Tumblr. In addition, posts containing content that references an anorexic person and contains an affective tone were more likely to be propagated. We also found that underweight bodies and bodies with a high degree of exposure were associated with propagation of posts. The present study suggested practical implications by focusing on the characteristics of highly propagated but potentially harmful content in social media."""		Mina Park;Yao Sun;Margaret L.

To understand popularity in OSN, we monitored a large sample of profiles from a highly popular network for three months, and analysed the relation between profile properties and their impression frequency. Evaluating the data indicates a strong relation between both the number of accepted contacts and the diligence of updating contacts versus the frequency of requests for a profile. Counter intuitively, the overall activity, gender, as well as participation span of users have no remarkable impact on their profile's popularity.	database;personally identifiable information;social network	Thorsten Strufe	2010		10.1145/1852658.1852660	computer science;internet privacy;social psychology;world wide web;behavior	Metrics	-88.96382462226926	-14.577625255211201	57439

It includes a comparison with an older study of the Journal Citation Report categories and indicators, and a determination of the factors most influencing the distributions. While all the specific subject areas fit a negative logarithmic law fairly well, those with a greater External JIF have distributions with a more sharply defined peak and a longer tail—something like an iceberg. No S-shaped distributions, such as predicted by Egghe, were found. A strong correlation was observed between the knowledge export and import ratios.

In fact, in Saudi Arabia, discussing political issues over Twitter has become a popular phenomenon among young Saudi citizens. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a pilot study to understand the underlying social structure of youth Saudi citizens' interaction and discussion of political issues over Twitter using the theory of Social Network Analysis (SNA). The result of SNA reveals relevant differences in the patterns of interconnection among different political topics. It also provides an insight into sociological characteristics of modern political issues in Saudi Arabia.	interconnection;social network analysis;social structure	Hend Suliman Al-Khalifa	2011		10.1145/2095536.2095604	public relations;political science;advertising;management	Web+IR	-80.90683616578636	-16.862697757329823	57729

One, the Thank You Board, was designed to give people an outlet specifically for publicly thanking and acknowledging others in the community. The other, SI Display, showed any Twitter post directed to the display and did not have explicit usage guidelines. People preferred the flexibility of the latter, but ambiguity about its purpose and norms of usage persisted even six months after deployment and made some people hesitant to post. Also, using Twitter as the posting mechanism facilitated participation for some but also created barriers for those not using Twitter and for Twitter users who were wary of mixing their professional and non-professional contexts.	look and feel;software deployment	Sean A.

The incentive problem can be overcome either by increasing the benefits to individual contributors, or by encouraging more pro-social behavior through group identity or other social processes.

On Wikipedia, groups called WikiProjects employ a variety of explicit coordination mechanisms to motivate and structure member contribution, with the goal of creating and improving articles related to particular topics. However, while explicit coordination works well for coordinating article-level actions, coordinating group tasks and tracking progress towards group goals that involve tracking hundreds or thousands of articles over time requires different coordination strategies.  To lower the coordination cost of monitoring and task-routing, WikiProjects centralize coordination activity on WikiProject pages -- """"micro-sites"""" that provide a centralized repository of project tools, tasks and targets, and discussion for explicit group coordination. These tools can facilitate shared awareness of member and non-member editing activity on articles that the project cares about. However, whether these tools are as effective at motivating members as explicit coordination, and whether they elicit the same kind of contributions, has not been studied. In this study, we examine one such tool, Hot Articles, and compare its effect on the editing behavior of WikiProject members with a more common, explicit coordination mechanism: making edit requests on the project talk page."""	centralisation;centralized computing;cohesion (computer science);group cohesiveness;mediawiki;routing;wikiproject;wikipedia	Michael Gilbert;Jonathan T.

Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, structural equation modeling was conducted, and data on Internet shopping habits of 382 consumers in Taiwan were examined. Findings – The findings of this study revealed that lowering perceived risks can increase switching costs, which leads to customer loyalty with the service provider in e-commerce. Research limitations/implications – A sample bias may exist because the sampling was conducted through an online survey in a specific Web site. This study affirmed the theoretical framework regarding the mediation effect of switching costs on perceived risk and customer-loyalty relationships.

The purpose of this paper is to synthesize the literature on user motivation in online communities into a conceptual framework. The framework categorizes motivational factors along motives and potential incentives and integrates the three major motives need for power, need for achievement and need for affiliation as well as the perspective of outcomeand action-related motivation. Psychological models, which explain motivation as an interrelation between different personal motives and situational incentives, demonstrate that effective incentives have to address matching motives. This paper adds to the existing literature by proposing a conceptual framework, which transfers theory of motivation psychology to the context of engagement in online communities and helps to apply successful incentives.	customer relationship management;online community;situational application	Esther Federspiel;Dorothea Schaffner;Seraina Mohr	2014			public relations;knowledge management;political science;social psychology	Comp.	-86.80965556316461	-14.525405234288293	58506

It is not clear that this is viable for homeless and other marginalized populations. The purpose of this study was to describe Internet access and use among a sample of homeless and indigent drug users. A brief questionnaire was developed to assess computer ownership, use, email, and Internet access and use. Participants were recruited through a community-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention program. 265 participants completed the questionnaire. While 55% had ever used a computer in their lifetime, only 25% had ever owned a computer, 24% had ever had their own email account, 33% had access to a working computer in the last 30 days, 10% had sent or received email in the last 30 days, and 19% had surfed or accessed information on the Internet in the last 30 days. Logistic regression predicting lifetime use of a computer showed predictive factors of having completed high school (Odds Ratio [OR] = 4.5; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 2.41, 8.38) and number of days used amphetamines in the last 30 days, per 5 days of use (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.18, 2.27). Inversely related were age, per 5 years of age (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.65, 0.93) and number of days used marijuana in the last 30 days, per 5 days of use (OR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.76, 0.99). Very low access and usage suggest that Internet-based public health education models be reexamined for this population. The association with amphetamine use may indicate a facilitating effect of amphetamine by heightening awareness and increasing wakefulness.	adverse reaction to drug;amphetamine;amphetamines;cannabis sativa plant;drug abuser;email;hiv infections;health care;health education;immunologic deficiency syndromes;internet access;logistic regression;population;qt interval feature (observable entity);wakefulness	David P.

The model integrates all aspects of how and why consumers use sales promotions and specifies the linkage between consumers' beliefs, attitude and behavior. The cognitive component included two dimensions: the overall evaluation of the benefits triggered by the promotion; and, the information search for potential price promotions. It is posited to influence the liking degree of specific price promotions as well as the liking of deals in general. This affective component is posited to influence behavioral intentions towards price promotions. A structural equation modeling analysis (SEM) offers strong support for the expected paths. Moreover, the potential influences on this pattern of consumers' traits are included; busyness, variety seeking, perceived financial wellness, market maven and brand loyalty.	e-commerce;linkage (software);structural equation modeling	Evangelos Christou	2005		10.1007/3-211-27283-6_42	e-commerce;economics;computer science;marketing;advertising;commerce	DB	-89.24118592468261	-11.694487646135453	59027

The eventual goal is to create a Decision Support System using the collective intelligence of online discourses. The research applies Jurgen Habermas' concept of basic Validity Claims for analyzing the content of three online discourses in Russia in the context of the e-petition calling to revoke the law mandating to destroy the foodstuffs imported from the West. The research found that (a) the use of Validity Claims is an effective instrument of content analysis to distil specific knowledge that is collectively generated by discourse participants to discover not only dominant issues, but also reveal participants' groups behind them; (b) the outcome of online discourses depends on the affiliation and ownership of media outlet hosting discourses. Due to their epistemic potential, policy discourses online, especially in association with e-petitions, can be considered as microdemocracy institutions in the field of discursive decision making.	collective intelligence;decision support system;emoticon;online petition	Andrei V.

For instance, with consumers going directly to or interacting with the artists or the authors, the traditional physical distributional channels are being challenged to restructure their delivery and marketing strategies. Indeed, with the dynamism as well as the unpredictability of the interactive media eco-system, new business models have to be constructed to accord revenue sustainability. This paper presents a conceptual framework to analyse the impacts of the disruptions of the traditional distributional channels arising from the interactive digital platform. It also identifies opportunities for players to re-think or re-formulate growth to sustain the business models.	algorithm;data compression;digital distribution;digital media;digital recording;download;ecosystem;file sharing;gcu grey area;interaction;interactive media;interactivity;internet;multimedia framework;new media	Margaret Tan;Miguel A.

This study explored the formation of self and the conceptualization of sports in the “Sports Blog” directory of BlogHer, a women’s blog network. A content analysis of 449 profiles in the directory revealed that women bloggers tend to use blogging to document personal experiences of participation in sports and to provide resources for others about physical activity, health, and fitness. Women’s active and participatory relationship with sports defies both stereotypical representations of women in mainstream sports media and hegemonic masculine discourses replicated in the blogosphere. We suggest that women who blog about sports challenge assumptions about sports consumption and engagement in sports. This study offers an alternative conceptualization of sports blogging as well as a broader understanding of the role of sports in women’s lives.	blog;conceptualization (information science)	Dunja Antunovic;Marie Hardin	2013	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444812472323	public relations;sportscenter;multimedia;advertising	Vision	-83.59751979975027	-16.541067681737157	59213

As Homeland Security (2008) explains, local EMAs (LEMAs) lay the groundwork for prevention and other activities, coordinating with nearby LEMAs and local entities, including private and nongovernmental organizations. LEMAs have been studied little; most research on online LEMAs and State Emergency Management Agencies (SEMAs) has been limited to website content, providing an incomplete picture of how they provide online service to the public. Bertot & Jager argue that functionality, usability, and accessibility are critical elements in evaluating e-government, noting that if users cannot get to or find the content, the content becomes irrelevant. This study contributes to addressing this gap by evaluating Alabama LEMA websites, based on a combination of content rubrics used in prior EMA studies and usability heuristics, factors that can affect user trust, and thus a site's usefulness. It also looks at how Alabama LEMAs are using social networking on	accessibility;e-government;entity;heuristic (computer science);local variable;online service provider;relevance;usability	Susan A.

A Web-based survey of political dissenters (N=307) conducted at the start of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq provides the data used to examine the relationships among informational media use, online and face-to-face political discussion, and political participation among the respondents, who were recruited through blogs, discussion boards, and listservs opposing the Iraq war. Analyses reveal that among these respondents, Internet news use contributed to both face-to-face and online discussion about the situation in Iraq. Online and face-to-face political discussion mediated certain news media effects on anti-war political participation. The study stresses the complementary role of Web news use and online political discussion relative to traditional modes of political communication in spurring political participation.	blog;digital journalism;internet	Seungahn Nah;Aaron S.

A sample of expert household end users was surveyed concerning privacy, risk perceptions, and online behavior intentions. A new e-privacy typology consisting of privacyaware, privacy-suspicious, and privacy-active types was developed from a principal component factor analysis. Results suggest the presence of a privacy hierarchy of effects where awareness leads to suspicion, which subsequently leads to active behavior. An important finding was that privacy-active behavior that was hypothesized to increase the likelihood of online subscription and purchasing was not found to be significant. A further finding was that perceived risk had a strong negative influence on the extent to which respondents participated in online subscription and purchasing. Based on these results, a number of implications for managers and directions for future research are discussed.	biological anthropology;exploratory testing;factor analysis;http 404;principal component analysis;privacy;purchasing	Judy Drennan;Gillian Sullivan;Josephine Previte	2006	JOEUC	10.4018/joeuc.2006010101	public relations;knowledge management;marketing;risk perception;social psychology	HCI	-87.8317152094378	-11.23473785621584	59881

However, in this process of transmission, information becomes susceptible to distortion. In this study, we assessed people’s semantic (i.e., prior expectations) and recognition memory for pop culture content, as a function of confidence and perceived information source. In Experiment 1, we investigated semantic memory for ubiquitous movie quotes (e.g., the famous Star Wars quote “Luke I am your father”). Notably this quote is incorrect, but we found that a majority of participants accepted these lure quotes as true with high confidence and indicated they had experienced the original source. In Experiment 2, participants viewed the original movie sources before a recognition test of the quotes. We found that while there was some improvement, people still preferred the lure quote with high confidence. We discuss the findings in terms of the strength of people’s prior expectations when reconstructing events from memory.	distortion;information source;social media;transmitter	Daljit Ahluwalia;Pernille Hemmer;Kimele Persaud	2017			popular culture;social psychology;psychology;cognitive psychology;misattribution of memory	HCI	-85.54350277572824	-17.66478258268426	60006

Question&Answer sites are one of the largest hosts of such communities where users reciprocally answer their questions. Research on expert identification in online communities tries to rank community members by their expertise or to separate experts from non-experts. Until now proposed algorithms for expert identification do not perform well on all datasets. We present an analysis of the structures of topic-induced sub-communities of Question&Answer communities. This analysis aims to provide a basis for expert identification research. The results from the analysis of the network structures explain why common expert identification algorithms are not suitable for all communities.	algorithm;online community	Michael Ovelgönne	2010		10.1145/1880071.1880090	social network analysis;social science;question answering;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;world wide web	ML	-79.67658305661814	-17.985930601552766	60437

With the growing popularity of the Internet, it is important for DMOs to understand the travel behaviors of Web site users versus nonusers. The purpose of this research study was to compare those who did and those who did not consult specific DMO Web sites in searching for travel information. DMO Web site users and nonusers were compared on three variables: actual visits to the subject destinations, intentions to visit, and demographics. In addition, the repeat travel patterns and number of previous visits of the two groups were contrasted. Several significant differences were found between the two groups. A significantly higher proportion of those who visited the DMO Web sites actually went to the destinations, and they also had a higher intention rate to return for future trips. Additionally, there were significant differences in the demographic characteristics of DMO Web site users and nonusers. This research study could serve as a potential foundation for further qualitative and quantitative studies on destination marketing.	directx;internet	Siu-Ian So;Alastair M.

cd86009dec5f03cb8634884f331802f393e53d33	friend or faculty: social networking sites, dual relationships, and context collapse in higher education	social media	Students and faculty have always interacted informally, on campus and off. Social networking sites (SNSs), like Facebook, introduce another space in which they interact, contributing to a blurring of boundaries between professional and personal personas. Communications on SNSs may be seen as simply an extension of on- and off-campus lives, and hence fall under the same policies governing institutional codes of conduct. The medium however, allowing for the capture and broadcast of events in academic and everyday lives, merits special considerations for contemporary faculty and administrators. The objective of this critical review is synthesize literature discussing dual relationships, context collapse, and digital persistence to contextualize and inform policy development regarding the use of SNSs in higher education. The review will contribute to discussions and decision-making on what should be done in response to these ubiquitous and novel channels for communication, connection and disclosure, and promote awareness of the implications for the connections fostered and the digital traces left behind in networked social spaces.

The article focuses on the influence of blog reliance compared to motivations for visiting blogs in determining blog credibility. The study found that blogs were judged as moderately credible, but as more credible than any mainstream media or online source. Both reliance and motivations predicted blog credibility after controlling for demographics and political variables. Reliance proved a consistently stronger predictor than blog motivations. Also, information-seeking motives predicted credibility better than entertainment ones.	blog	Thomas J. Johnson;Barbara K. Kaye;Shannon L. Bichard;W. Joann Wong	2007	J.

The theoretical model was tested via a questionnaire survey of 203 Taiwanese office workers. The empirical results not only confirmed TAM, but also showed that the relevance of information needs strongly determines perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user attitudes toward Internet use for information seeking, as well as strongly influencing individual performance during the information use stage. More importantly, relevance has greater positive effect on perceived performance and perceived usefulness for enterprise Intranet users than for simple/interactive Intraweb users. Enterprise Intranet users have more positive attitudes toward the Internet and more positive perceptions of system effectiveness for supporting office tasks than simple/interactive Intraweb users. Furthermore, perceived ease of use is the strongest determinant of user attitude toward Internet use in both enterprise Intranet and simple/interactive Intraweb applications. Overall, the extended TAM explains the behavior of enterprise Intranet users better than that of simple/ interactive Intraweb users. Limitations of this study are discussed. # 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on the broader organizational literature, we discuss relationships between these dimensions and derive predictions regarding differences and similarities in the four dimensions between industrial and academic science. We then employ detailed survey data from a representative sample of over 5,000 life scientists and physical scientists to examine key aspects of the framework. The descriptive results provide a nuanced and multidimensional view of industrial and academic science. Our analysis of relationships among dimensions suggests that the nature of work is a significant predictor of workplace characteristics and of the way in which research results are disclosed. However, important industryacademia differences in the latter dimensions remain even controlling for the nature of work, consistent with the view that sectoral differences in features of science also reflect distinct institutional logics.

Social network analysis provides a useful approach to moving beyond the concept of “group” in studying virtual communities and computer supported cooperative work and telework. Such computer supported social networks (CSSNS) sustain strong, intermediate and weak ties that provide information and social support in both specialized and broadly-based relationships. They foster informal workplace communities that are usually partial and narrowly-focused, although some do become encompassing and broadly-based. CSSNS connect workers within and between organizations who often are physically dispersed. The nature of the medium both constrains and facilitates management control. Although many relationships function offline as well as online, CSSNS have developed their own norms and structures. They have strong societal implications, fostering situations that combine global connectivity, the fragmentation of solidarities and the de-emphasis of local organization, and the importance of home bases.	computer-supported cooperative work;emphasis (telecommunications);fragmentation (computing);online and offline;social network analysis;social support;telecommuting;virtual community	Barry Wellman	1996		10.1145/238857.238860	public relations;human–computer interaction;knowledge management;political science;social network	Web+IR	-80.23338198832664	-12.770295041668355	61220
14c2671dfa7bf18fe25f1110024109720c06758a	understanding self-disclosure on social networking sites - a literature review		User-generated content is the backbone of any social networking site (SNS) and an important pillar of many business models online. While there is a growing body of research on self-disclosure on SNSs, existing insights remain scattered. To fill this gap, we undertake a systematic literature review by examining 50 studies to identify the factors behind self-disclosure on SNSs. We find that social exchange theory and its extension ‘privacy calculus’ represent a dominant theoretical perspective. Hence, we focus on perceived benefits and costs, as well as cost-mitigating factors as main areas of our investigation. Since personality traits are commonly controlled for or studied within the context of SNS disclosure, we additionally include an exploration of this factor group into our review.

In our first experiment, 62 participants observed either a moderated or an unmoderated online community and answered questions about their intent to participate in the community. The participants who viewed the moderated community reported significantly higher intent to participate than participants who viewed the unmoderated community. In our second experiment, 59 participants observed a different online community in which we manipulated both the rate (in time) of posted comments and the interactivity of each comment. We derived our manipulation of interactivity from Rafaeli’s (1988) definition of interactivity as message contingency. Participants reported significantly greater intent to participate in an online community featuring interactive messages, but only when response rate was slow. These results indicate that both structural features of interfaces and content features of interactions affect people’s intent to participate in online communities. doi:10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00313.x	experiment;interaction;interactivity;online community;web application	Kevin Wise;Brian Hamman;Kjerstin Thorson	2006	J.

The conceptual framework proposes a series of causal linkages among the key variables affecting customer commitment to specific online retailer, such as perceived value (as cognitive belief), satisfaction (as affective experience) and trust (as conative relationship intention). Three key exogenous variables affecting Internet online shopping experiences, such as perceived service quality, perceived product quality, and perceived price fairness, are integrated into the framework. This study empirically tested and supported a large part of the proposed framework and the causal linkages within it.

Surprisingly, the relation between immersion and the Big Five personality factors has not yet been examined. Hence, we assessed these traits in an online survey (N = 220) and relate them to immersive tendency, a disposition that determines whether someone is receptive to immersive experiences during media exposure. Using structural equation modeling, we can show that openness to experience, neuroticism, and extraversion are positively related to immersive tendency. The immersive tendency subscale absorption is related to openness to experience, whereas the immersive tendency subscale emotional involvement is related to openness, extraversion, and neuroticism.	antisocial personality disorder;experience;extraversion (psychology);immersion (virtual reality);openness;structural equation modeling;trait	David Weibel;Bartholomäus Wissmath;Fred W.

Moreover, based on the model and survey results, effective management policies for the system for better classification are examined. More precisely, the decision by residents to cooperate with garbage classification is modeled as a game between each resident and his/her society, consisting of the residents in the region. A mailing survey for residents in the eastern Tottori area and an interview visit to the garbage disposal facility of the Tottori Eastern Local Government Association are provided in order to collect actual data on the garbage classification level of the residents. From this study, it is clarified that the three policies of (1) public announcements, (2) education, and (3) incentive systems (punishment and subsidy) have different effects on the cooperation of households. An appropriate policy mix is necessary in order to effectively achieve the cooperation of the majority. In particular, policies (1) and (3) have different effects on cooperation, depending on how they are mixed. The model developed in this study can be used to examine policies for a more effective garbage classification system.	social system	Kei Fukuyama	2000		10.1109/ICSMC.2000.885043	game theory;social system;computer security	OS	-84.77172996482297	-10.369746828966658	62306

There is strong need to focus on this application area to empower these organizations by IT capabilities. As there is not much literature about the specific needs assessment of voulantary organizations, there is a need to carry out ethnographic studies to better understand IT requirements of this sector. In this paper we have investigated the organizing process of the World Social Forum 2006 event in Karachi, Pakistan.

7f8e9072d5539b3f6e348b40a8a28de27fbc004b	living labs - an ethical challenge for researchers and platform providers		The infamous Facebook emotion contagion experiment (Kramer, Guillory, & Hancock, 2014) is one of the most prominent and best-known online experiments based on the concept of what we here call “living labs”. In these kinds of experiments, real-world applications such as social web platforms trigger experimental switches inside their system to present experimental changes to their users – most of the time without the users being aware of their role as virtual guinea pigs. In the Facebook example the researches changed the way users’ personal timeline was compiled to test the influence on the users’ moods and feelings. The reactions to these experiments showed the inherent ethical issues such living labs settings bring up, mainly the study’s lack of informed consent procedures, as well as a more general critique of the flaws in the experimental design (Panger, 2016).	compiler;design of experiments;experiment;kramer graph;living lab;network switch;timeline	Philipp Schaer	2017	CoRR	10.3726/b11077	public relations;political science;socioeconomics;sociology of the internet	Web+IR	-84.94075225682386	-18.034975911697288	62701

c7dd7bfad461b9dc1af15a43150e71d2fa701613	emotional labor in the sharing economy		The peer-to-peer nature of the sharing economy encourages participants to alter their behavior in ways that resemble traditional notions of emotional labor. A key element in this shift lies in the coercive nature of feedback mechanisms which condition both providers and consumers to perform emotional labor during service encounters. Using survey data from 207 sharing economy consumers in the US, we show how different facets of the feedback mechanisms employed by sharing economy services influence consumers’ emotional labor. In addition, we show how platforms and their policies matter in encouraging emotional labor, indicating the need to analyze the topic on a fine-grained level. We conclude by deriving propositions for future research and practical recommendations.

The objective of this study is to test the validity of this assumption by uncovering the perceptions of college students toward IS professionals and the IS profession. Our study reveals that stereotypes found to be associated with computer science also seem to permeate the IS field. However, after students are exposed to IS careers, they appear to grasp the unique nature of IS. In other words, while describing an IS professional and the IS profession, men and women were cognizant that the IS profession is a blend of technical, systems, social, and managerial components. This study also sheds some light on the question - Is the IS profession perceived to be gendered? Based on the study's results, we conclude that the students' perceptions of IS careers are to some extent gendered with a greater emphasis on masculine than feminine or gender neutral traits and abilities."""	computer science;information system;neutral monism	Kshiti D.

1fe6186c9aa8f4d222d2f8853e523e343b160eb1	from structural assurances to trusting beliefs: validating persuasion principles in the context of online shopping		The topic of shopping attitude has received long lasing attention in the context of e-commerce. Previous studies have elucidated the different facets of online shopping attitude and have overemphasized a prevalent assertion on the relationship between web design artifacts and consumers’ psychological responses. However, the imitability of web design in practice makes no differentiation among a glut of shopping websites and probably leads to revenue declination due to the fact that the instability of attitude frequently leads to attitudinal ambivalence. Hence, understanding how to strengthen consumers’ attitudes toward online shopping should be fruitful for remedying attitude inconsistency in e-commerce. The current study extended related research by examining the simultaneous effects of trusting beliefs on consumers’ attitudes toward online shopping. We adopted the concept of structural assurance and the principles of persuasion as the theoretical underpinnings. The proposed model is expected to contribute to relevant literature by offering theoretical contributions and managerial implications that can help both researchers and online retailers to understand more clearly how consumers develop their attitudes toward shopping online.	e-commerce;instability;online shopping;trust (emotion);web design	Eldon Y.

This paper investigates the extent to which binary rating and component rating systems are able to provide consistent signals of sellers’ quality, focusing on the reputation system design under the Chinese context. Using field data from Taobao, we performed canonical correlation analyses and found that the reputation signals of the two systems are generally correlated. As expected, negative and neutral ratings accurately reveal buyer dissatisfaction. Our results, however, show that positive ratings exhibit negative correlations with the three component ratings (i.e., item-as-described, customer service, and on-time delivery), suggesting that large numbers of positive ratings on Taobao may encourage trust in the platform but do not help to choose credible sellers. Our results elucidate the role of cultural difference in explaining the negative relationship in China and provide important implications for the design of reputation systems.	customer to customer;reputation system;sports rating system;systems design;taobao marketplace	Xianfeng Zhang;Jifeng Luo;Qi Li	2012	Electronic Markets	10.1007/s12525-012-0092-4	marketing;advertising;commerce	ECom	-89.85820647538671	-12.256713539586391	63504

Numbers beginning with a 1 occur roughly 30% of the time, and are six times more common than numbers beginning with a 9. We show that Benford's Law applies to social and behavioral features of users in online social networks. Using social data from five major social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Pinterest, and LiveJournal), we show that the distribution of first significant digits of friend and follower counts for users in these systems follow Benford's Law. The same is true for the number of posts users make. We extend this to egocentric networks, showing that friend counts among the people in an individual's social network also follows the expected distribution. We discuss how this can be used to detect suspicious or fraudulent activity online and to validate datasets.	digit structure;google+;significant figures;social network	Jennifer Golbeck	2015		10.1371/journal.pone.0135169	biology;social media;network analysis;forensic science;behavior	Metrics	-83.34231667732772	-17.835325501550557	63653

We describe findings from longitudinal survey data on the use and social impact of community computer networking. The survey data show that increased involvement with people, issues and community since going online is explained by education, extroversion and age. Using path models, we show that a person's sense of belonging and collective efficacy, group memberships, activism and social use of the Internet act as mediating variables. These findings extend evidence in support of the argument that Internet use can strengthen social contact, community engagement and attachment. Conversely, it underlines concern about the impact of computer networking on people with lower levels of education, extroversion, efficacy, and community belonging. We suggest design strategies and innovative tools for non-experts that might increase social interaction and improve usability for disadvantaged and underrepresented individuals and groups.	online and offline	Andrea L.

Design/methodology/approach – This study extends the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) with flow experience, perceived enjoyment, and interaction to propose a theoretical model to explain and predict people’s behavioural intention to play online games. This model is examined through an empirical study involving 458 participants using structural equation modelling techniques. In addition, a competing model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) is proposed to evaluate whether TPB is more suitable than TAM to explain the use of online games. The two action-theoretical models are compared in terms of their predictive power and their practical utility. Findings – Although both models explain the players’ intention to play online games very well, the extended TPB model provides a better fit and explanatory power. Notably, this study finds that flow experience is a more important factor than perceived enjoyment in influencing customer acceptance of online games. Further analysis reveals that gender is a key moderator of online game acceptance. Practical implications – Online game developers need to search for flow experience building strategies that might assist in engaging players. This study suggests that game developers should consider focusing more on establishing the interactions between players (social interaction) and online games (human-computer interaction) in their marketing strategies. Originality/value – This study is significant for two reasons. First, it synthesises the theory of planned behaviour with psychological and interaction factors and, second, it presents a blueprint for an entertainment-oriented technology acceptance model.	blueprint;google moderator;human–computer interaction;ibm tivoli access manager;structural equation modeling;theory;video game developer	Ming-Chi Lee	2009	Online Information Review	10.1108/14684520911001873	structural equation modeling;social relation;social science;simulation;design methods;multimedia;marketing strategy;empirical research;social psychology;video game development;theory of planned behavior	HCI	-88.53337478533136	-12.778830472466908	64236

This study investigates the determinants behind the choice to use a social networking site (SNS) platform and predicts that the type of self an individual wants to express through the platform and their level of privacy concerns will play an important role in this choice. A total of 547 SNS users completed an online survey. Expression of multiple aspects of the self – true, actual, and ideal self – and online privacy concerns were empirically tested as the key determinants of SNS platform choice. The findings show that the expression of true and actual self are significant determinants for using Snapchat as a primary SNS, whereas the expression of ideal self and greater privacy concerns are associated with active Instagram use. The authors discuss the implications of these findings and recommend future research.	instagram;internet privacy;snapchat;social media	Tae Rang Choi;Yongjun Sung	2018	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2018.09.009	public relations;self;social media;computer science;social network;popularity	HCI	-88.7647577348697	-14.518001372099235	64462

However, these studies either focus on smartphones and social media addictedness per se or rely on sociological surveys, which only provide approximate estimations of the phenomena. We propose to bridge this gap by (i) parametrizing social media usage and academic performance and (ii) combining smartphones and time diaries to keep track of users’ activities and their smartphone interaction. By analyzing the logs of social media apps while studying and attending lessons, and comparing them to students’ GPA, we can quantify negative and positive correlations via smartphones.	approximation algorithm;smartphone;social informatics;social media	Josef Kittler;Moni Naor	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67256-4		HCI	-85.08520384253865	-20.639183754192103	64534

However, this guild’s normative culture helps its members better self-regulate and thus protect themselves from, among other things, their own impulses to over-play and thus compromise their offline lives. We suggest that cognitive anthropological “culture as socially transmitted knowledge” theories—combined with ethnographic methods—illuminate how socially learned gaming patterns shape online experiences. Our approach helps us refine theories judging socially motivated Internet activity as harmful. We affirm the potential for distress in these social gaming contexts, but we also show how a specific guild culture can minimize or even reverse such distress, in this case promoting experiences that strike a nic...	experience;world of warcraft	Jeffrey G.

Drawing on a random sample survey in Austin, TX, it borrows the concepts of cultural omnivores and univores to investigate how health information repertoire are related to social capital and digital inequalities. Results demonstrate that both the size and the composition of health information repertoires vary by social and digital connectivity. People with greater social capital have a larger repertoire and are less likely to be univores dependent on the Internet or interpersonal contacts. People with Internet access have a larger repertoire and are less likely to be univores dependent on television. More skilled Internet users are less likely to be univores dependent on interpersonal contacts, whereas frequent Internet users are more likely to be omnivores with a four-channel repertoire including the Internet, interpersonal contacts, television, and newspaper. The positive relationship between social capital and repertoire size is stronger among less-skilled Internet users. There are significant variations in health information repertoires in terms of media access and sociodemographic characteristics.

Investigating whether online trading has a significant effect on financial returns and risks is central to this inquiry. This study, using perceived usefulness and satisfaction categories, addresses how the IT trading platform affects the trader's trading risk-taking behavior and stock portfolio performance. We examined two unique data sets: 2,726 proprietary online trading accounts and 178 professional investors' field survey. The results revealed that while the perceived usefulness category presented significant differences between the risk-taking groups and significant impact on stock portfolio performance, the satisfaction category showed no significant results.	online shopping;trader media east;traders	Moustafa Abu El Fadl;Boris Abbey;Kyungsub Steve Choi	2015	2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2015.398	computer science;information security;marketing;trading strategy;finance;customer satisfaction;commerce;algorithmic trading	HPC	-89.98164371010297	-11.082067366521928	65458

The indicator aims to normalize citation counts for differences among fields. We critically examine the theoretical basis of the normalization mechanism applied in the crown indicator. We also make a comparison with an alternative normalization mechanism. The alternative mechanism turns out to have more satisfactory properties than the mechanism applied in the crown indicator. In particular, the alternative mechanism has a so-called consistency property. The mechanism applied in the crown indicator lacks this important property. As a consequence of our findings, we are currently moving towards a new crown indicator, which relies on the alternative normalization mechanism.	bibliometrics;crown group;database normalization	Ludo Waltman;Nees Jan van Eck;Thed N. van Leeuwen;Martijn S.

This article studies the effects that publication age and field normalization have on h-type citation values of German Leibniz Prize winners.

Perceived certainty of punishment, perceived stigma of label, awareness of the laws and consensus with the laws were found to be negatively correlated with both current and likely future file-sharing activities. The regression analyses revealed that both current and future file-sharing activities were best predicted by the legal factor perceived certainty of punishment. The extralegal factors, perceived stigma of label and consensus with the laws, played important roles in deterring both current and likely future file-sharing activities, while awareness of the laws played a weak role in deterring likelihood of future file-sharing. The findings provide an empirical basis for developing alternative strategies to deter online file-sharing that involves massive users.		Xigen Li;Nico Nergadze	2009	J.

ec7a708143b748e083aa9240c3961955d7258201	computing journals and their emerging roles in knowledge exchange	knowledge exchange	"""Scholarly journalS are reliable meanS of communicating knowledge and findings in a scientific discipline. Researchers rely on articles published in the journals to support and extend their work while acknowledging them in the form of citations. A journal (citing) sends a citation to another journal (cited) when an article published in the former makes a reference to an article published in the latter. This creates a network in which journals are connected by citations made to each other. These journals play three unique but overlapping roles as sources, storers 6 and synthesizers 2 of knowledge communication. An understanding of these roles is useful for researchers, editors and institutions alike. Earlier studies have used various perception and citation based measures 1,2,4,5,6 to assess the influence of journals. However their roles and influence as sources, storers and synthesizers remains unrecognized, in general. Also, a smaller sample of journals as used in the past studies has a likelihood to bias the results because of the inadequate representation and omission of relevant journals from the network. 12 This study addresses the intercon-nectedness of journals from four perspectives. First, it expands the network to include 50 computing journals to enhance the reliability of results. Second, it simultaneously analyzes the importance of journals as synthesizers, sources and storers of knowledge communication in the network. Third, since the dynamism and """" continuous evolution """" of computing discipline warrants journal ranking studies on regular basis, 9 it analyzes data from 2000 to 2004 and extends the time-period used in some recent studies. Finally, it draws on visual analysis of the inter-citation network along with dependence calculations to provide an insight about the domains and roles of computing journals. A journal's role as a knowledge source is based on the number of citations received. A journal tends to be cited more if its articles are perceived as important and are regularly utilized by researchers. The role as a storer can be judged by the extent of journal's assimilation of knowledge from various sources. Articles in such journals mainly illustrate, test or apply existing knowledge to enrich and build cumulative tradition of the field. As a synthesizer, the journal plays the role of maintaining order and achieving cohesiveness in the network. 2 Their interconnection is based on significant reciprocal citations and results in independent clusters of mutually dependent journals.

Despite this proliferation,, however, there remains a gap, a """"Digital Divide"""", between Americans who have access to technology and those who do not. According to the most recent report from the Department of Commerce', only onequarter of those making less than $15,000 a year have computers. White households are still more than twice as likely to own a computer than Black and Hispanic households. In addition, 60.2% of adults with only a high school degree and 87.2% of adults with less than a high school education currently do not have access to the Intemet. This divide in access, especially in relationship to finding health information, is a substantial barrier to underserved audiences who are already at greatest risk for poor health outcomes. Addressing this issue, however, will require a multi-dimensional approach combining innovation with proven public health approaches that tackle not just the lack oftechnology but the myriad of issues facing underserved audiences related to seeking and using health information. To elucidate how low-income minorities feel about having access to Internet information, we conducted focus groups with urban African Americans and rural Latinos who were clients ofcommunity nursing centers. In addition to the focus group a paper survey was administered to assess whether clients had any computer or Internet skills and whether they would be interested in utilizing technology if it were offered at the nursing centers. Overall, clients of these centers had similar responses, although the rural participants were more concerned with transportation issues than the urban participants. In general, nursing center clients were positive about having computers and Intemet access where they would be able to retrieve health and cancer information. Both groups conveyed that having access would help them be more confident about their health and would help them talk to their doctors. The urban group, especially, felt that the Intemet would give them the opportunity to get the """"whole picture"""", meaning they could get all the information about a disease or condition, not just what a doctor """"chose"""" to tell them. Comments are directly related to the theoretical constructs of self-efficacy and patient-provider communication(see Table 1). They also highlight the need to have help available for people to interpret and access health information. Both groups were apprehensive about using computers. In the two groups, only two participants had ever used computers and neither ofthem had ever used the Intemet. Participants said that they would be willing to try only if there were people who could help. Many related the fear of breaking the equipment if they touched it. Many also felt they needed someone they trusted to help interpret health information they would retrieve. In conclusion, while it is important to have access to quality Intemet health information, it is equally important to address the barriers that low-income communities have to adequately access and assess that information. Qualitative focus group research is one way to understand these issues."""	bridging (networking);computer;focus group;internet;new media	Sarah Bauerle Bass;Linda Fleisher;Nancy McKeown-Conn;Denise James;Evelyn Gonzalez	2002			library science;medicine;data science	HCI	-84.16102774092798	-22.646159240957044	66323

ae62e025e7ea6a1087f707715c4f1afbce0250b2	quantifying public response towards islam on twitter after paris attacks		The Paris terrorist attacks occurred on November 13, 2015 prompted a massive response on social media including Twitter, with millions of posted tweets in the first few hours after the attacks. Most of the tweets were condemning the attacks and showing support to Parisians. One of the trending debates related to the attacks concerned possible association between terrorism and Islam and Muslims in general. This created a global discussion between those attacking and those defending Islam and Muslims. In this paper, we provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of data collection we streamed from Twitter starting 7 hours after the Paris attacks and for 50 subsequent hours that are related to blaming Islam and Muslims and to defending them. We collected a set of 8.36 million tweets in this epoch consisting of tweets in many different of languages. We could identify a subset consisting of 900K tweets relating to Islam and Muslims. Using sampling methods and crowdsourcing annotation, we managed to estimate the public response of these tweets. Our findings show that the majority of the tweets were in fact defending Muslims and absolving them from responsibility for the attacks. However, a considerable number of tweets were blaming Muslims, with most of these tweets coming from western countries such as the Netherlands, France, and the US.	adversary (cryptography);crowdsourcing;hashtag;sampling (signal processing);social media;streaming media;virtual world;wiki;word lists by frequency	Walid Magdy;Kareem Darwish;Norah Abokhodair	2015	CoRR		internet privacy;world wide web	NLP	-79.16205234841905	-15.747637585253525	66589

Our findings indicate that the number of investigations into the impact of IT on various areas of everyday life, increased considerably during this period, given that 63 percent of the articles were published between 2010 and 2013. From these articles, eight dimensions emerged which were classified by IT and lifestyle experts. Moreover, theme analysis was applied to all contents extracted from the various articles, leading to an eight-sided lifestyle model. The domains are: health, learning, social, work and environment, energy, art, spiritual life, and miscellaneous. A comprehensive list of papers with classifications is presented.

The research topic of 'spatial justice in planning theory and regeneration practice' follows the researcher's experience over three decades as a regeneration practitioner in south-eastern England and London. The component of 'digitality' is contained within the three measures proposed to account for spatial justice: spatial relations within an urban setting, longitudinal socio-economic comparisons in an area, and the level of intra-urban/regional governance applied in the case study area.  These measures will aid the identification of principles and basic institutions of governance which, if applied, would support improved 'spatial justice' outcomes in large-scale regeneration programmes. By focusing on the impact of digital technologies on urban geographies, this paper seeks to spotlight assumed values and underlying principles for spatial justice. While digitality makes many positive contributions to reductions in inequality (more accessible resources, better services, more freely available information), some aspects of digitalization can give cause for concern, often in the area of values and ethics, the most prominent being privacy issues.  The analysis of the concept of spatial justice may help to uncover how established values might be maintained, if indeed these values are those that our liberal-democratic society wishes to perpetuate, and may serve to highlight positive prospects for increasing the democratization of space through the application of new digital technologies.	dbpedia;privacy;social inequality	J.

This paper investigates moderating roles of user experience on the relationship between the personal innovativeness and the ERP adoption motivations. This issue is important because if the user has more experience with the systems then the power of influence of personal innovativeness on ERP adoption motivation would be different. Thus, this paper tests these important insights of ERP systems adoption with the two different field samples with high (more than three years) and low (less than three years) user experience, based on the innovation diffusion theory, self determination theory, and different types of motivations such as intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. The findings, based on the PLS analysis of the model using 107 ERP end users, show that there are clear moderating effects of user experience—such as impacts of personal innovativeness on ERP systems adoption motivations are higher in case of low user experience samples, as expected. Academic and practical implications are discussed in the paper based on these empirical findings. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For convenience, many applications have been installed in smartphones instead of desktop computers. As a popular platform, Google Play presents thousands of mobile applications. Because there are so many dazzling applications, it is difficult for users to determine which are suitable for their needs. Many factors are likely to influence the purchase of an application, such as advertisements, word of mouth, and other media. In deciding whether to purchase an application, users probably refer to customer reviews. Indeed, users may take a significant amount of time to evaluate the legitimacy of the reviews. In this paper, we introduce a concept for recommending applications. Based on pointwise mutual information, we calculate the positive or negative score of semantic orientation in each review. We also consider subjective factors (i.e., public opinion, anonymous opinion, and star rating) and objective factors (i.e., download number and reputation).	customer relationship management;desktop computer;download;mobile app;online advertising;play store;pointwise mutual information;recommender system;smartphone;star (classification);subject (philosophy)	Hao-Ting Pai;Hung-Wei Lai;Shuli Wang;Mei-Fang Wu;Yung-Ting Chuang	2017		10.1145/3109761.3109771	pointwise mutual information;computer security;word of mouth;sentiment analysis;marketing;computer science;legitimacy;download;reputation;information and communications technology;public opinion	Web+IR	-84.83601724339452	-13.03929978897338	67265

The specific ways F/LOSS instantiates notions of openness in everyday practice exacerbates the exclusion of women. ‘Openness’ is a complex construct that affects more than intellectual property arrangements. It weaves together ideas about authorship, agency, and the circumstances under which knowledge and code can and cannot be exchanged. While open source developers believe technology is orthogonal to the social, notions of openness tie the social to the technical by separating persons from one another and relieving them of obligations that might be created in the course of other forms of gift exchange. In doing so, men monopolize code authorship and simultaneously de-legitimize the kinds of social ties necessary to build mechanisms for women’s inclusion.	open-source software;openness;software development	Dawn Nafus	2012	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444811422887	psychology;public relations;social science;knowledge economy;knowledge management;marketing;sociology;social psychology;world wide web	SE	-78.52946882969717	-14.137842526231243	67283

To separately identify the impacts of effectiveness and side effects, we augment the observed prescription choices with unique data on self-reported reasons for switching in our estimation. Results show that the two new drugs Levitra and Cialis have higher mean effectiveness than the existing drug Viagra, but physicians have large uncertainty regarding the effectiveness for Levitra and side effects for Cialis. Detailing is effective in reducing the uncertainty for effectiveness but much less so for side effects. Based on the results, we investigate the roles of effectiveness and side effects in physiciansu0027 prescription choices, and the importance of detailing for new entrants in competing with incumbent drugs.

Data from a sample of 1500 Internet users (distributed evenly among six selected major cities) was collected by a structured questionnaire covering demographic profile and the factors influencing online shopping. Factor analysis and multiple regression analysis are used to establish relationship between the factors influencing online shopping and online shopping behavior.

In 2001, the company Cape Wind LLC submitted a proposal to construct the nationpsilas first offshore wind farm in the waters of Nantucket Sound, off the coast of Cape Cod. The groups which support and oppose wind power, and specifically the Cape Wind project, have published an enormity of information that is available by accessing the resources of the World Wide Web. Much of this information is conflicting. Based on the analysis of the content of these websites, in accompaniment to a survey of 600 individuals, conclusions have been drawn regarding the factors which have triggered either the support or the opposition of wind power in Southeastern Massachusetts. The secondary information gathered suggests that the majority of information available online supports not only wind power in general, but the proposed Cape Wind project specifically. Opposition seems to primarily stem from the efforts of one group. The survey examines and contrasts the opinions of residents of The Cape and Islands, as well as the opinions of residents of neighboring towns. These areas which comprise Southeastern Massachusetts have become a national focal point for the wind debate because of the controversy surrounding the potential site of Americapsilas first offshore wind farm. Cape and Islands residents were found to have a distinct outlook pertaining to this debate.	focal (programming language);microsoft outlook for mac;the legend of zelda: the wind waker;towns;world wide web	Joseph Coleman;Robert M.

Because a number of reviews that vary in usefulness are posted every day, much attention is being paid to measuring their helpfulness. The goal of this paper is to investigate the various determinants of the helpfulness of reviews, and it also intends to examine the moderating effect of product type, that is, the experience or search goods in relation to the helpfulness of online reviews. The study results show that reviewer reputation, the disclosure of reviewer identity, and review depth positively affect the helpfulness of an online review. The moderating effects of product type exist for these determinants on helpfulness. That is, the number of reviews for a product and the disclosure of reviewer identity have a greater influence on the helpfulness for experience goods, while reviewer reputation, review extremity, and review depth are more important for helpfulness in relation to search goods. The interaction effects exist for average review rating and average review depth for a product with review helpfulness on product sales. The results of the study will identify helpful online reviews and assist in designing review sites effectively.

An important, yet under-researched privacy risk results from social inferences about user identity, location, and activities. In this paper, we frame the 'social inference problem'. We then present the results from a 292 subject experiment that highlights: 1) the prevalence of social inference risks; 2) people's difficulties in accurately predicting social inference risks; and 3) the relation between information entropy and social inference. We also show how to predict possible social inferences by modeling users' background knowledge and calculating information entropy and discuss how social inference support systems can be deployed that protect user privacy.	computer-mediated communication;entropy (information theory);privacy;web 2.0	Sara Gatmir-Motahari;Sotirios G.

bb9df9340075d8d01f4549d833abd3d0d7dbf6e7	the intricacies of time in news recommendation		It is commonly accepted that time is a critical issue in news recommendation. As opposed to book or movie recommendations, news articles have extremely short life spans and should normally not be recommended after a few days. Most current news recommender systems use time as a decaying factor in ratings or just cut off older articles according to some simple mechanism. An experiment done on four different newspapers in Norway reveal that the time issue is somewhat more complicated. The life span of articles varies substantially from one newspaper to another, and from one category to another. Social media like Facebook may affect articles’ life span, though the influence of social media is highly category-dependent.

As consumers use the Internet, the increase in their control may result in changing expectations of their interactions with businesses in general. The accumulation of successful experiences in obtaining information and negotiating terms during active, self-initiated and self-controlled online interactions may lead consumers to expect more responsiveness and control over offline marketing interactions. This paper reports a study conducted to examine the hypothesis that greater amounts of Internet experience would be associated with higher service expectations for offline transactions. The results of the study suggest that consumers with moderate levels of web usage expertise have higher expectations than do consumers with low or high levels of web usage expertise. In other words, this study finds a inverted “U” relationship between web usage expertise and consumers’ expectations of service providers.	interaction;internet;online and offline;responsiveness;tree accumulation;user experience	Linda F.

Detecting and analysing such topics could prove to be beneficial in understanding the sentiments of trending topics in developing regions. In this paper, we perform a systematic sentiment study of trending controversial topics on Pakistan's Twitter user-base. From the data collected we build retweet graphs, partition graphs into communities, measure community influence, and label the communities as 'for' or 'against' per topic. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to categorise and study sentiments attached to controversial topics in a developing region.	categorization;sentiment analysis;social network	Sarim Zafar;Usman Sarwar;Zafar Gilani;Junaid Qadir	2016		10.1145/3001913.3006644	political science;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web	Web+IR	-81.06114712081754	-17.759172930505578	68645
2de523814597f3ae5b18e6fd57ec7e9e8bf1de11	understanding online information disclosure as a privacy calculus adjusted by exchange fairness		Current studies on information privacy fail to explain widely observed contradictions between online consumers’ privacy concern (treated as a general personality trait) and online information disclosure. These contradictions occur because situation-specific factors are not taken into account. This paper contributes to the literature on information privacy by theorizing and empirically testing how information disclosure is driven by competing situation-specific benefits and risk factors. The results of this study indicate that, in the context of an e-commerce transaction with an unfamiliar vendor, information disclosure is the result of competing influences of exchange benefits and two types of privacy beliefs (privacy protection belief and privacy risk belief). In addition, the effect of monetary rewards is dependent upon the fairness of information exchange. Monetary rewards could undermine information disclosure when information collected has low relevance to the purpose of the e-commerce transaction.	e-commerce;fairness measure;information exchange;information privacy;online community;personally identifiable information;relevance	Rathindra Sarathy;Han Li	2007			public relations;marketing;commerce	Security	-89.42777083080748	-13.031184096088404	68735

A randomized national sample of six hundred and two participants ( N  = 602) ages 25-years-old to 35-years old was procured by a private company. They were asked to take a survey and answer questions about their own video game play habits related to the theories and variables. It was found that high brand loyalty video game players who perceived themselves to have high perceived emotional intelligence were inclined to seek out discernible gratifications from video game play, were aware of their feelings during video game play, and were able to obtain sought after gratifications. Practitioners should create strategies to evaluate high brand loyalty video game players’ awareness during video game play, as this is a niche audience segment that possesses strong brand loyalty toward video game play and is likely to replay select video games.	experience	Anthony Palomba	2018	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2018.03.024	social psychology;psychology;feeling;emotional intelligence;brand loyalty;media consumption	HCI	-88.90204097319706	-20.990465066794567	68775

While its use and adoption is well-studied, the same cannot be said for abandonment. This study examines the reasons for the abandonment of two popular social media platforms, namely Face book and Twitter. A survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to abandoners of Twitter and Face book. The findings indicate that Face book is preferred over Twitter and the reasons for the abandonment of both platforms are similar, with privacy concerns being one of the main reasons.	blog;cross-sectional data;multimedia framework;privacy;sampling (signal processing);social media	Yanru Guo;Dion Hoe-Lian Goh;Nor Aishah Binte Mohamed Rashid;Pyae Pyae Han;Shengbo Sun	2014	2014 11th International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations	10.1109/ITNG.2014.10	media;social media;social media optimization;computer science;microblogging;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web	DB	-85.54865335761455	-16.77915991705347	68851

As a result, Cubans have developed a unique and robust offline system for distributing digital content through removable storage media like USB thumb drives and portable hard drives called El Paquete Semanal (The Weekly Package). In this paper, we describe and analyze the contents of El Paquete and how those contents vary over time and between distributors. We compare it to a less-popular state sponsored alternative called La Mochila (The Backpack) and discuss their respective distribution systems. We also compare these offline content distribution systems to available online access points such as those in public WiFi parks, tourist hotels, and universities. Finally, we reflect on how this system, developed in the Cuban context, could be useful in other environments.	digital distribution;digital recording;hard disk drive;internet access;linear algebra;online and offline;removable media;usb flash drive;wireless access point	Joel Lenin Pinargote Bravo;Rafael Beto Mpfumo;Luis Alejandro Madruga Milanés;Ximena Michelle Cueva;Gretel García Gómez;Amalia Gómez Marcheco;Alberto Fernández Oliva;Jeanna Neefe Matthews;Sam P.

To perform this goal, we performed a bibliometric study, by applying the mapping study technique on top-quality software engineering venues, and developed a dataset of 14,456 primary studies. As the ranking metric for institutions, we used the count of papers in which authors affiliated with this institute have been identified in the obtained dataset, whereas regarding scholars we computed the corresponding rankings based on the number of published papers and the average number of citations. Finally, we identified the top-20 rising scholars in the SE research community, based on their recent publication record (between 2015 and 2017) and their research age.

However, the effect of the home community has so far been ignored. Besides, almost all journey-to-crime studies were done in Western societies, and little is known about how the distinct features of communities in major Chinese cities shape residential burglars’ travel patterns. To fill this gap, we apply a cross-classified multilevel regression model on data of 3763 burglary trips in ZG City, one of the bustling metropolises in China. This allows us to gain insight into how residential burglars’ journey-to-crime distances are shaped by their individual-level characteristics as well as those of their home and target communities. Results show that the characteristics of the home community have larger effects than those of target communities, while individual-level features are most influential. Older burglars travel over longer distances to commit their burglaries than the younger ones. Offenders who commit their burglaries in groups tend to travel further than solo offenders. Burglars who live in communities with a higher average rent, a denser road network and a higher percentage of local residents commit their burglaries at shorter distances. Communities with a denser road network attract burglars from a longer distance, whereas those with a higher percentage of local residents attract them from shorter by.	structure of observed learning outcome	Luzi Xiao;Lin Liu;Guangwen Song;Stijn Ruiter;Suhong Zhou	2018	ISPRS Int.

The proposed model focuses on commu~ nication medium, task characteristics, group composition, and their interaction as explanations for the outcome of group polarization and the process that precedes it..An experimental research method is used to test the relationships suggested by the model. In this study, group polarization is recorded by comparing decisions at the individual level, face-to-face group settings, and GSS mediated settings. The initial agreement index indicates the diversity of individual stances within the group. This index is used as a covariate to enhance understanding of the extent of group polarization. The group process is documented by protocol analyzing transcriptions of the FTF and GSS group sessions for persuasive content. A 2x2x2 factorial design was used to analyze the results. The analysis indicates that, for both process and outcomes, the medium of communication and task characteristics interact with one another to provide the dominant explanation. Surprisingly, group composition had no impact on either polarization or persuasive arguments. The findings reported in this study are of importance to organizations that increasingly rely on groups as units of decision making. The results also provide insight to researchers of group decision making and to future developers and users of group support systems.	polarization (waves)	Maha M. El-Shinnawy;Ajay S.

Information sharing and ICT use are especially important for immigrants and expats, but further research is needed into immigrants' use of ICTs and their information value judgments. This poster presents in-progress research on how the ICTs used by expat and immigrant members of Twitter interact with the information values of community members. Findings show information value determination and negotiation are important for immigrants and expats online, with cultural, contextual, and economic values being most frequently invoked both explicitly and implicitly.

During the three month non-stop campaign period, more than a hundred experienced bloggers, supporters of the three main political parties, created three non party-sponsored blogs. These blogs were the focal point of the political blogosphere during that period and ceased their activities at the end of the electoral campaign, thus providing a unique opportunity to better understand the political blogosphere. Web mining techniques were used to obtain data concerning the visits to those blogs (from Sitemeter) and the blog’s content itself (posts, comments, and links). Data suggests that blog readers don’t look for different points of view, blog commentators usually limit themselves to one blog, bloggers do not comment on other blogs other than their own, and relatively few links exist between all three blogs. These results undermine the idea that the political blogosphere can enhance the deliberative character of the public sphere.	blog;blogosphere;focal (programming language);web mining	Rui Pedro Lourenço	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15158-3_10	public relations;political science;internet privacy;world wide web	AI	-81.74157437809694	-16.64702601977598	70243
122e9c390626243a68e3758b4ab728f916adbd11	a twitter case study for assessing digital sound		Academic and cultural heritage institutions around the world have made measurable strides in the development of digital sound archives oriented towards research and access, but their impact on scholarship and society has been little studied. Traditionally, impact has been measured by citations; yet these are problematic metrics for non-traditional outputs like sound recordings. Social media data provide a promising avenue of investigation for measuring scholarly as well as societal impact. Twitter in particular has been shown to provide a high number of references for cultural and research outputs in all disciplines. This study analyzes Twitter references pertaining to the collections of five digital sound archives: British Library Sounds, Europeana Sounds, the Internet Archive Audio Archive, PennSound and UbuWeb. Using text analysis methods to identify high frequency events and trends, and labeling them with a rubric designed for measuring the impact of digital heritage resources, this study provides preliminary insights on user values as they relate to digital sound collections.

Based on survey data collected from 306 undergraduate students, results reveal that for the donor registration model, respondents’ utilitarian and value-expressive functions predicted intentions to register, regardless of their self-monitoring tendency. For intentions to discuss organ donation with family, self-monitoring was a significant moderator such that for low self-monitors (vs. high), the utilitarian function was a more important predictor of intentions, whereas for high self-monitors (vs. low), the value-expressive attitudes were more important. The ego-defensive function was negatively associated with intentions to register but was positively associated with intentions to discuss organ donation. Both theoretical and practical implications of the findings are provided.

7760f76fb42c04867bbb7eec414fbf21b2d25fa6	privacy and security concern of online social networks from user perspective		Personal data sharing has emerged as a popular activity on online social networks such as Facebook, Google+, Twitter. As a result, privacy issues have received significant attention in both the research literature and the mainstream media. In this study, we designed a set of questions aimed to learn about user views of online privacy, user knowledge about OSNs privacy settings, and user awareness of privacy disclosure. Our goal is to find out from the users whether and how well users are knowledgable of, satisfied with, and able to effectively use available privacy settings. The information obtained from this study can be used to help OSNs adjust their privacy settings to better match user expectations, and help privacy advocates design better ways to help users control the disclosure of their online information. We collected answers to the questions from a group of 377 users, selected via several methods, who have experiences with multiple OSNs, including Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn. We analyzed the data with respect to user demographics. Our study shows that 44% of the users lack the knowledge about privacy policies and mechanisms of their OSNs; 34% and 41% of the users, respectively, are seriously and somewhat concern about their privacy protection; and 80% of the users do not think their OSNs have provided sufficient privacy control or default privacy settings that match their expectations. Based on our analysis, we propose several options for OSNs and OSN users to improve the user privacy.	google+;internet privacy;privacy policy;scientific literature;separation of mechanism and policy;social network	Al Amin Hossain;Weining Zhang	2015	2015 International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy (ICISSP)		privacy software;information privacy;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;government	Security	-89.70716565159798	-15.441217929178338	70555

While research indicates that these reviews influence consumers' shopping attitudes and behaviors, questions remain about how consumers evaluate the product reviews themselves. With the current research, we introduce a new methodology for identifying the review factors that shoppers use to evaluate review helpfulness, and we integrate prior literature to provide a framework that explains how these factors reflect readers' general concerns about the diagnosticity (uncertainty and equivocality) and credibility (trust and expertise) of electronic word-of-mouth. Based on this framework, we offer predictions about how the relative importance of diagnosticity and credibility should vary systematically across search and experience product types. By analyzing secondary data consisting of over 8000 helpfulness ratings from product reviews posted by shoppers on Amazon.com, we find that, while review content affects helpfulness in complex ways, these effects are well explained by the proposed framework. Interestingly, the data suggest that review writers who explicitly attempt to enhance review diagnosticity or credibility are often ineffective or systematically unhelpful. Our findings have implications for both IS developers and retailers for designing online decision support systems to optimize communication practices and better manage consumer-generated content and interactions among consumers. Online review helpfulness is well-explained by a framework that incorporates diagnosticity, credibility, and product type.The research introduces a methodology for identifying review factors pertinent to consumers for evaluating helpfulness.Review writers who explicitly attempt to enhance diagnosticity or credibility are often ineffective or unhelpful.This research leads to actionable recommendations for designing more effective online review systems.	categorization;credential;image;product type;self-information	Danny Weathers;Scott D.

4cbb5c03c4847ce03e98387126c6777758edf929	a factor-identifying study of the user-perceived value of collective intelligence based on online social networks		Purpose An important issue for researchers and managers of organizations is the understanding of user-perceived values of collective intelligence (UPVoCI) in online social networks (OSNs) with the purpose of helping organizations identify the values that cause internet users and members of OSNs to share information and knowledge during they participate in collective intelligence (co-intelligence) activities. However, the development of measurement instruments and predictive models and rules for predicting UPVoCI are inadequate. Design/methodology/approach A novel measurement scale was developed to measure UPVoCI using a user-oriented research strategy that is based on qualitative and quantitative research methods. This work also identified critical indicators and constructed predictive models and rules for forecasting UPVoCI by multivariate statistical methods and data mining. Findings A 17-item scale of UPVoCI was developed and 17 measurement items were associated with two major dimensions, which are the...	collective intelligence;social network	Sung-Shun Weng;Ming-Hsien Yang;Pei-I Hsiao	2018	Internet Research	10.1108/IntR-03-2017-0103	the internet;management science;marketing;collective intelligence;computer science;multivariate statistics;social network;quantitative research	ECom	-79.7663639784322	-17.27357024429304	70830

f07bb1d13c3eb5f2fd87cc593f58275800d4333e	a detailed analysis of the impact of tie strength and conflicts on social influence		"""Group Recommendation Systems (GRS) are personalization systems that provide recommendations to groups of people considering the initial preferences of each group's member, with the aim to maximize the satisfaction of the whole group. Since recent psychological studies evidence that people's satisfaction is influenced by the satisfaction of other people with whom they perform an activity, it is important to consider human aspects and social characteristics that affect the changes in individual's satisfactions in the recommendations generation process. In this work, we start an experimental analysis on how ties' strength and possible conflicts in a relationship can influence the individual's satisfactions, with the aim to derive a model that can be used to adapt individual utilities to the """"Group Context"""" before aggregating them into the group's ones. Our hypothesis is that there is a direct correlation between tie strength and positive shifting, but the presence of conflict, instead, can lead to a negative influence, causing a drifting further apart between people's satisfactions. Results confirm these hypotheses, but also suggest that these two factors are not enough to define a general model and that other factors must be considered."""	naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;personalization;recommender system;usability testing	Francesco Barile;Judith Masthoff;Silvia Rossi	2017		10.1145/3099023.3099056	business;social psychology;recommender system;personalization;social influence;social group;knowledge management	HCI	-88.92139621492599	-18.47532309108383	71054

Adopting a uses and gratifications approach to the web-based survey, to determine why the contributors to this website return so regularly and what uses they make of the site, the study adds to the limited information available on Turkish internet users. The major finding of the study is that diversion drives most reading on the site, but social interaction provides the largest gratification to those who participate through writing confessions, commenting on others’ confessions and meeting people offline. Some differences in use patterns were found among Turkish respondents who lived in other countries. A rapidly changing social environment in the country provides a partial explanation of website activity.	online and offline;web application	Christine L.

The results show that both the intentions and the causal links between these intentions and their predictors vary among the four behavior categories.	causal filter;causality;information system;kerrison predictor;taxonomy (general)	Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta;Saiyidi Mat Roni;Terri Trireksani	2015	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2015.07.008	psychology;structural equation modeling;developmental psychology;social psychology;theory of planned behavior;clinical psychology;statistics	HCI	-87.82298721224788	-20.07931927687147	71303
27b412ffaf0061bb8de4d609eac35d300f702522	visualizing collaboration: central authors and strong ties in evolutionary game theory		Abstract#R##N##R##N#Co-authorship patterns in 753 articles with two or more authors in the literature of Evolutionary Game Theory (1973–2009), were examined using social network analysis tools. There were 246 separate components in the data set; the main component included 386 authors, 1/3 of the complete author list. Network visualizations focusing on the number of co-authors linked to a given author (degree centrality=collaboration breadth) did not distinguish well between authors who published a few articles with many co-authors and those publishing more articles with one or two co-authors each. Adding a minimum publication requirement of two articles per co-author (tie strength=collaboration persistence) fragmented the main component (and other networks) but allowed more substantial patterns of collaboration to appear. The combination of collaboration breadth (degree centrality) and persistence (tie strength) is a simple way to identify co- author network structures worthy of additional investigation.	game theory	Katherine W.

There have been continuing efforts to understand new media and promote the importance of becoming new media literate among researchers, educators, and policy makers. Fundamental understanding to what is new media literacy still remains unclear. There is only one paper providing the preliminary work in unpacking the framework of new media literacy. Although the developed framework has its merit, more details and information need to further elaborate and refine. In this paper, we acknowledge the two continua framework and endorse four types of literacy comprising of this two-continua. Moreover, we provide ten fine-grained indicators to reflect these four types of literacy. We also propose another new divide that distinguishes Web1.0 from Web2.0.	entity–relationship model;information needs;new media;web 2.0	Tzu-Bin Lin;Jen-Yi Li;Feng Deng;Ling Lee	2013	Educational Technology & Society		critical literacy;comprehension;the internet;social science;evaluation;information literacy;multimedia;law;information technology;media literacy;pedagogy;mass media	HCI	-79.87807133894641	-16.486597752026942	71466

While its changes in this domain have often prompted privacy advocates and news media to critique the company, Facebook has continued to attract more users to its service. This raises a question about whether or not Facebook's changes in privacy approaches matter and, if so, to whom. This paper examines the attitudes and practices of a cohort of 18- and 19-year-olds surveyed in 2009 and again in 2010 about Facebook's privacy settings. Our results challenge widespread assumptions that youth do not care about and are not engaged with navigating privacy. We find that, while not universal, modifications to privacy settings have increased during a year in which Facebook's approach to privacy was hotly contested. We also find that both frequency and type of Facebook use as well as Internet skill are correlated with making modifications to privacy settings. In contrast, we observe few gender differences in how young adults approach their Facebook privacy settings, which is notable given that gender differences exist in so many other domains online. We discuss the possible reasons for our findings and their implications.

We also consider some factors that influence consumers’ perceived benefit and perceived risk such as a third-party payment platform, reputation, e-commerce experience, lower price, variety of product, convenience, and ease of use. The model is tested using data gathered from 146 participants. The data analysis is conducted using a structural equation modeling. The results obtained show that both perceived benefit and perceived risk have strong effects on the purchasing intention, but the effect of benefit on intention is stronger than the effect of risk on intention. Reputation, e-commerce experience and lower price have strong effects on consumers’ perceived risk, while e-commerce experience, variety of product, convenience and ease of use have strong effects on consumers’ perceived benefit.	e-commerce;performance rating;purchasing;structural equation modeling;usability	Siqing Shan;Fan Hua;Qinqin Zeng	2010	2010 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government	10.1109/ICEE.2010.561	e-commerce;structural equation modeling;computer science;marketing;advertising;consumer behaviour;statistics;commerce	HCI	-89.68414739076005	-11.433431279484784	71547

Exemplar-based information processing, attribution theory, and heuristic policy decision-making formed the theoretical foundation for the study. A 2 × 2 factorial experiment (N = 363) exposed participants to stereotypical or counterstereotypical exemplars representing the in-group (Whites) and the out-group (Blacks). The experiment revealed that exposure to stereotypical African American media characters compared to exposure to counter-stereotypical ones influenced real-world beliefs of African American stereotypes, internal attributions for perceived failures of this out-group, prejudicial feelings toward this out-group, and lack of support for pro-minority affirmative action policies. A structural model established “internal attributions for outgroup failures” as a crucial mediator. Implications for entertainment studies and political communication are discussed.

The high profile nature of the site means that the RG Score may be used for recruitment, promotion and other tasks for which researchers are evaluated. In response, this study investigates whether it is reasonable to employ the RG Score as evidence of scholarly reputation. For this, three different author samples were investigated. An outlier sample includes 104 authors with high values. A Nobel sample comprises 73 Nobel winners from Medicine and Physiology, Chemistry, Physics and Economics (from 1975 to 2015). A longitudinal sample includes weekly data on 4 authors with different RG Scores. The results suggest that high RG Scores are built primarily from activity related to asking and answering questions in the site. In particular, it seems impossible to get a high RG Score solely through publications. Within RG it is possible to distinguish between (passive) academics that interact little in the site and active platform users, who can get high RG Scores through engaging with others inside the site (questions, answers, social networks with influential researchers). Thus, RG Scores should not be mistaken for academic reputation indicators.	active platform;reputation system;residential gateway;social network	Enrique Orduña-Malea;Alberto Martín-Martín;Mike Thelwall;Emilio Delgado López-Cózar	2017	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-017-2396-9	social science;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;sociology;management;law;world wide web	HCI	-80.20465724419061	-20.987716994622872	72147

We conduct a structured, qualitative analysis to characterize the salient dimensions of their risk experiences, such as severity, level of agency, coping strategies, and whether the teens felt like the situation had been resolved. Overall, we found that teens can potentially benefit from lower risk online situations, which allow them to develop crucial interpersonal skills, such as boundary setting, conflict resolution, and empathy. We can also use the dimensions of risk described in this paper to identify potentially harmful risk trajectories before they become high-risk situations. Our end goal is to find a way to empower and protect teens so that they can benefit from online engagement.	cybercrime;experience;information security;online diary	Pamela J.

Various domains shape the construction of HIV/AIDS as chronic disease with the societal construct circumscribing the body of knowledge concerning the pathological, mirroring the complexities of the malady itself. Disease, and the respective body of knowledge, co-exist within a social reality; consequently, a controlled vocabulary designed to facilitate knowledge organization and access relative to HIV/AIDS must reflect the complexities of this socially constructed reality.	angular defect;controlled vocabulary;disk mirroring;framing (world wide web);imperative programming;interaction;knowledge organization;moral hazard;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;population;simulation;social reality;socialization	Jeffrey T.

Collecting this information, however, raises privacy concerns of customers. In this work, we provide the results of an empirical study which reveal that privacy concerns have an impact on the probability of participating in loyalty programs. We identify a privacy-sensitive segment of customers using demographic and psychographic data that, in principle, would participate in a loyalty program, however, refrains from doing so because of privacy concerns. Moreover, we found that people participating in customer loyalty programs are more concerned about their privacy than non-participants, which is an interesting though counterintuitive result.	privacy	Oliver Hinz;Eva Gerstmeier;Omid Tafreschi;Matthias Enzmann;Markus Schneider	2007			public relations;customer to customer;privacy software;information privacy;loyalty business model;marketing;customer intelligence;business;internet privacy;customer retention;customer advocacy	Security	-87.6205628889286	-11.41890441888726	72980
26e236065c6d8789bb8c47fcf6b7a6a2a040445e	internet minimal group paradigm		Over many years, social psychologists have sought to understand what causes individuals to form themselves into groups. Initially, it was believed that groups were formed when people bonded around a common goal. Later, it was found that, when individuals were divided into groups on a random basis, this in itself was sufficient for them to feel part of a group and show a preference for their own group over others. Since the environment in cyberspace is different from that of the offline world, for example, there is no physical proximity between participants; it may be assumed that it would be difficult to achieve feelings of affiliation among potential or actual group members. This pioneer study seeks to discover which components are requisite to the creation of a group identity among individuals surfing the Internet. For this experiment, 24 people were divided into two Internet chat groups according to their intuitive preference in a decision-making task. It was found that group members perceived their own group performance as superior on a cognitive task as compared with that of the other group. These results demonstrate that for surfers, the Internet experience is very real and even a trivial allocation of people to a group is likely to create a situation of ingroup favoritism.	assumed;cognition;cyberspace;decision making;internet;online and offline;paradigm	Yair Amichai-Hamburger	2005	Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	10.1089/cpb.2005.8.140	psychology;group decision-making;psychotherapist;communication;social psychology	HCI	-86.32049007348745	-17.95558233018365	73113
349dae136e1dd8753cdf3ed3dd6fe46d8b101c6b	cybersecurity indexes for ehealth		This study aimed to explore the cybersecurity landscape to identify cybersecurity indexes that may be relevant to the health industry. While the healthcare sector poses security concerns regarding patients' records, cybersecurity in the healthcare sector has not been given much consideration.  Cybersecurity indexes are a survey that measures security preparedness and capabilities of a country or organisation. An index is made up of a series of questions, often broken into categories. These categories target areas such as law, technical responses, organisational threats, capacity building and social context. Some indexes provide ranking capabilities against other countries, while others directly evaluate what it means to be cyber-ready.  In this paper, cybersecurity indexes were reviewed regarding the level of assessment (country level/organisation level), and their consideration of the wider community, the health sector, and their appearance in academic literature.  Results from this study found that there was no consistency between the indexes investigated, with each index having a diverse number of categories and indicators. Some indexes resulted in a score; others did not rank their results in league tables. Evidence to calculate the level of adherence was often obtained from secondary sources, with four of the country indexes using both primary and secondary sources. Eight (out of fourteen) indexes measured wider community indicators and only one index specifically measured eHealth services. Findings from the initial systematic review suggest that hardly any peer-reviewed journal articles exist on the topic of cybersecurity indexes.  The paper concludes that most of the indexes studied are broad and do not consider the eHealth sector specifically. Each index relies on a different process to gauge cybersecurity, with little to no academic rigour. It is expected that this research will contribute to the current (limited) literature addressing cybersecurity indexes.

The results suggest that the different dimensions of social capital affect scientific performance differently depending on the area of knowledge. Overall, dense networks negatively affect the creation of new knowledge. In addition, the analysis shows that a division of labor in academia, in the sense of interdisciplinary research, increases the productivity of researchers. It is also found that the position in a network is critical. Researchers who are central tend to create more knowledge. Finally, the findings suggest that the number of ties have a positive impact on future productivity. Related to areas of knowledge, Exact Sciences is the area in which social capital has a stronger impact on research performance. On the other side, Social and Humanities, as well as Engineering, are the ones in which social capital has a lesser effect. The differences found across multiple domains of science suggest the need to consider this heterogeneity in policy design.	mike lesser;semantic network;social capital	Claudia N.

While there are a great number of studies on users’ continuance intentions for diversified IT, users’ IT switching behaviours are less studied. This research attempts to identify the features of users IT switching behaviours. We introduce a migration theory from social network perspective to explore the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing users’ switching intention in the context of mobile instant messaging (MIM) application. In particular, we develop a model that examines the role of networks, deprivations and trusts on MIM users’ switching intentions to WeChat in China. A survey research method is utilized to test this model and hypotheses. We found that functional deprivation, monetary deprivation and personal innovativeness could positively influence users’ switching intentions. Networks of obligation was found to have no significantly direct influence on switching intentions, but fully mediated by functional and monetary deprivations. However, trust transferred from MIMs provider has no significant effect on switching intentions. The findings are believed to theoretically contribute to further understand users’ IT switching behaviours and yield some practical implications for designers and managers in MIM providers and their products propaganda.	instant messaging	Xixian Peng;Yuxiang Zhao;Qinghua Zhu	2016	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2016.06.054	psychology;internet privacy;social psychology;world wide web	AI	-88.56653963775969	-12.962391571437635	73446

Academic performance is a key component in the development and subsequent empowerment of youth. It is affected by a large number of different factors, such as inherent ability and socioeconomic circumstance, which can vary widely amongst different individuals. In particular, children from disadvantaged families face unique challenges that do not occur in normal families. We analyze the Fragile Families Challenge (FFC) dataset using data science algorithms, and study the relationship between the features reported and GPA scores. We grouped GPA scores into three groups (top, middle and low) and used a random forest classifier to predict the GPA class for each subject. Then, we used a recently developed algorithm—Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)—to cluster subjects into subgroups based on the factors affecting each individual. We further analyzed the clusters to elucidate the differences occurring within different subgroups in the ∗Emails : {anahit.sargsyan, areg.karapetyan, wei.woon, aamena.alshamsi}@ku.ac.ae 1 ar X iv :1 80 6. 02 61 5v 2 [ cs .C Y ] 1 5 Ju n 20 18 community of disadvantaged individuals and figure out which set of features matter for each subgroup. Conventional studies seek factors which apply to all members of a population, and often overlook the unique needs of individuals with different backgrounds and characteristics or divide individuals into predetermined subgroups and study which factors affect each subgroup. The approach used here can find correlations which are specific to individual subjects, and can inform the formulation of targeted and effective intervention strategies. Our study contributes to the field of social science by highlighting the differences of indicators of academic performance in different subgroups. Also, our novel data science pipeline contributes to the fields of data science and computational social science.

First, complementing prior studies identifying its many favorable user outcomes related to technology adoption and use, this research demonstrates that it can also lead to adverse implications, such as nonwork-related technology use at work, or computer loafing, which has received little attention in IT research. Second, to ground playfulness in the larger individual trait literature, this study explores its conceptual foundation in the Big Five trait of openness to experience and demonstrates their empirical linkage.

This study attempts to investigate the causes of NWRC. The model was developed based on rational decision-making and tested through a survey of 167 employees in China and Singapore. Results reveal that NWRC intention is a significant predictor of NWRC behaviour, and NWRC attitude and subjective norms are significant predictors of behavioural intention as in many prior studies. Besides, the perceived benefits and costs affect NWRC attitude. However, it turns out that habit may overrule other rational decisional factors when habit is included in the model. Finally, the comparison between two groups with different levels of control mechanisms shows the moderating effect.	control system;internet access;kerrison predictor;rationality	Chun-Yan Zhang;Gee-Woo Bock	2006			public relations;simulation;internet access;habit;social psychology;theory of planned behavior	HCI	-87.8536626344237	-20.584006364202356	74077

Social Network Analysis, commonly known as SNA, is the multidisciplinary field of research under which researchers of different backgrounds perform their studies: one of the hottest topics in such diversified context is indeed Community Discovery. Clustering individuals, whose relations are described by a networked structure, into homogeneous communities is a complex task required by several analytical processes. Moreover, due to the user-centric and dynamic nature of online social services, during the last decades, particular emphasis was dedicated to the definition of node-centric, overlapping and evolutive Community Discovery methodologies.  In this paper we provide a comprehensive and concise review of the main results, both algorithmic and analytical, we obtained in this field. Moreover, to better underline the rationale behind our research activity on Community Discovery, in this work we provide a synthetic review of the relevant literature, discussing not only methodological results but also analytical ones.	social network analysis	Giulio Rossetti;Dino Pedreschi;Fosca Giannotti	2017	Online Social Networks and Media	10.1016/j.osnem.2017.10.003	management science;social network analysis;data mining;multidisciplinary approach;underline;homogeneous;social welfare;social network;cluster analysis;human behavior;engineering	Metrics	-78.39359070875551	-17.092684467769676	74267

Providing access to these online resources is costly, and it is difficult both to analyze the value of this content to the institution and to discern those journals that comparatively provide more value. In this research, we examine 1,510 journals from a large research university library, representing more than 40% of the university’s annual subscription cost for electronic resources at the time of the study. We utilize a web analytics approach for the creation of a linear regression model to predict usage among these journals. We categorize metrics into two classes: global (journal focused) and local (institution dependent). Using 275 journals for our training set, our analysis shows that a combination of global and local metrics creates the strongest model for predicting full-text downloads. Our linear regression model has an accuracy of more than 80% in predicting downloads for the 1,235 journals in our test set. The implications of the findings are that university libraries that use local metrics have better insight into the value of a journal and therefore more efficient cost content management.

Despite this heightened interest, guidance for effective engagement is lacking. In this study, we investigate customers' compliments and complaints and firms' service interventions on social media. We develop a dynamic choice model that explicitly accounts for the evolutions of both customers' voicing decisions and their relationships with the firm. Voices are driven by both the customers' underlying relationships and other factors such as redress seeking. We estimate the model using a unique data set of customer voices and service interventions on Twitter. We find that redress seeking is a major driver of customer complaints, and although service intervention improves relationships, it also encourages more complaints later. Because of this dual effect, firms are likely to underestimate the returns on service intervention if measured using only voices. Furthermore, we find an """"error-correction"""" effect in certain situations, where customers compliment or complain when others voice the opposite opinions. Finally, we characterize the distinct voicing tendencies in different relationship states, and show that uncovering the underlying relationship states enables effective targeting.

In order to utilise gaze patterns effectively, a model may have to be developed which can interpret intentions based on prior knowledge of gaze behaviour. Gaze behaviour while viewing advertisements needs to be investigated fully before such a model can be built. This study contributes by examining eye behaviour of three groups of viewers while viewing themed advertisements or print media. Findings corroborate those of previous studies in that faces and eyes attract attention. There were marked differences in the way participants paid attention to text with senior participants spending more time on text than their junior counterparts. Additionally, the younger participants followed a typical F-pattern when reading some of the content. In general, the younger participants tended to emulate behaviour found during web browsing, which suggests that advertisements would migrate well to an interactive medium. Image-rich print media resulted in higher concentration on images only, with very little attention being paid to text elements. This observation was common to all participant groups. More in-depth studies are required in order to generate more concrete patterns for a variety of advertisements if a model were to be developed.	differentiator;interactive advertising;online advertising	Tanya René Beelders;Luna Bergh	2014		10.1145/2664591.2664595	psychology;multimedia;advertising;communication	HCI	-86.44857339987175	-18.917590068169556	74636

In two mailings disseminated in a large university hospital we evaluated the impact of e-mail layout (three e-mail text versions, two e-mails with graphics) on the willingness of its approximately 6500 recipients to seek additional electronic information and open an integrated link. Overall access rates after 90 days were 21.1 and 23.5% with more than 70% of the respondents opening the link within 3 days. Differences between different layouts were large and artwork text, HTML text, animated GIF, and static image prompted 1.2, 1.7, 1.8, and 2.3 times more often access than the courier plain text message (p <or= 0.001).

This article presents an investigation of the role of social relations in the writing of scientific articles through the study of in‐text citations. Does the fact that the author of an article knows the author whose work he or she cites have an impact on the context of the citation? Because citations are commonly used as criteria for research evaluation, it is important to question their social background to better understand how it impacts textual features. We studied a collection of science articles (N = 123) from 5 disciplines and interviewed their authors (N = 84) to: (a) identify the social relations between citing and cited authors; and (b) measure the correlation between a set of features related to in‐text citations (N = 6,956) and the identified social relations. Our pioneering work, mixing sociological and linguistic results, shows that social relations between authors can partly explain the variations of citations in terms of frequency, position and textual context.

However, the term’s ambiguity, while denoting its wide applicability across movements, has led “safe space” to become overused but undertheorized. In both theory and praxis, “safe space” has been treated as a closed concept, erasing the context-specific relational work required to construct and maintain its material and symbolic boundaries. The emergence of online communities promising safety for marginalized groups calls for renewed investigations into the construction of these activist spaces. In this article, I draw on ethnographic fieldwork to consider the cultivation of safe space within Girl Army, a Philadelphia-based feminist Facebook group. Through participant observation and interviews with Girl Army members, I trace the group’s technical and discursive enforcement of safety and the role this space plays in members’ activism and everyday lives.	altran praxis;emergence;field research;online community	Rosemary Clark-Parsons	2018	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444817731919		HCI	-79.53243646870855	-13.97059548830678	75380

423067c08f6abe651c11dbbe042d93872ea80d12	a publication power approach for identifying premier information systems journals	information system;information science	Stressing that some universities have adopted unrealistic requirements for tenure of information systems (IS) faculty members, a recent editorial in MIS Quarterly contends that the group of premier IS journals needs to be generally recognized as having more than just two members. This article introduces the publication power approach to identifying the premier IS journals, and it does indeed find that there are more than two. A journal's publication power is calculated from the actual publishing behaviors of full-time, tenured IS faculty members at a sizable set of leading research universities. The underlying premise is that these researchers produce excellent work, collectively spanning the IS field's subject matter, and that the greatest concentrations of their collective work appear in highest visibility, most important journals suitable for its subject matter. The new empirically based approach to identifying premier IS journals (and, more broadly, identifying journals that figure most prominently in publishing activity of tenured IS researchers) offers an attractive alternative to promulgations by individuals or cliques (possibly based on outdated tradition or vested interests), to opinion surveys (subjective, possibly ill-informed, vague about rating criteria, and&sol;or biased in various ways), and to citation analyses (which ignore semantics of references and, in the case of ISI impact factors, have additional problems that cast considerable doubt on their meaningfulness within the IS field and its subdisciplines). Results of the publication power approach can be applied and supplemented according to needs of a particular university in setting its evaluation standards for IS tenure, promotion, and merit decisions. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	information system	Clyde W.

Following this, they were asked to write a short narrative of one of these experiences. Incidents reported by participants ranged from preschool to college age, and content analysis indicated that a majority took place at two or more grade levels, sometimes as early as the participant's first (preschool) visit to a library. Phenomenological analysis of individual narratives produced a thematic structure for each of the four grade levels represented in the data: elementary school and younger, middle school, high school, and college/adult. Themes common across all four levels include Atmosphere, Size and Abundance, Organization/Rules and Their Effects on Me, and What I Do in the Library. A theme of Memories was unique to narratives that took place during elementary and younger age levels. Although all remaining themes were noted across age levels, the relative importance of various themes and subthemes was different at different ages. Implications of the thematic structure for library practice are discussed.	experience;library (computing)	Jacqueline Kracker;Howard R.

These outcomes involve developing and implementing strategies which will achieve the desired objectives. Given interest in the strategy and governance mechanisms in virtual communities, in this paper, we examine ongoing strategizing of the stakeholders of an online community, through a strategy-as-practice perspective using a qualitative approach of content analysis. This longitudinal perspective, over a period of nine years, provides insight into the strategy praxis, practitioners and practices related to strategizing for the ongoing development of this online community.

This study is an attempt to examine how cultural contexts shape the use of communication technology by examining the motives for and patterns of using social network sites among college students in the US and Korea. The findings of this study suggest that the major motives for using social network sites – seeking friends, social support, entertainment, information, and convenience – are similar between the two countries, though the weights placed on these motives are different. Reflecting the unique social nature of the medium, Korean college students put more weight on obtaining social support from existing social relationships, while American students place relatively greater emphasis on seeking entertainment. Additionally, American college students’ networks in an online social venue are far larger than their Korean counterparts, which may reflect the cultural difference between the two countries regarding developing and managing social	milieu intérieur;social network;social support;venue (sound system)	Yoojung Kim;Dongyoung Sohn;Sejung Marina Choi	2011	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2010.08.015	psychology;social environment;social inertia;social science;motivation;social competence;gender studies;sociology;social position;social psychology;law;culture;social network;social transformation	HCI	-83.4138820488253	-22.10461623142957	75723

One of the important innovative business models is online peer-to-peer lending, which has received wide attention from government, industry, and researchers. Using the signaling theory, we compare the effects of various signals on the likelihood of successful funding in three models (i.e., first-time borrowing, repeated borrowing without prior lending, and repeated borrowing with prior lending). Using data collected from PPDAI.com, we verify the three proposed models by employing logistic regression. Results and implications are analyzed and discussed. ã 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We analyse the scientific production of the universe of Italian academic scholars , over a 10-year period across 2002–2012, from a national database built by the Italian National Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes. We demonstrate that all Italian scholars of SSH and LHS are equals, as far as their publishing habits. They share the same general law, which is a lognormal. At the same time, however, they are different, because we measured their scientific production with different indicators required by the Italian law; we eliminated the “silent” scholars and obtained different scaling values—proxy of their productivity rates. Our findings may be useful to further develop indirect quali–quantitative comparative analysis across heterogeneous disciplines and, more broadly, to investigate on the generative mechanisms behind the observed empirical regularities.	database;image scaling;microsoft forefront;proxy server;qualitative comparative analysis;scientometrics;star catalogue	Andrea Bonaccorsi;Cinzia Daraio;Gualtiero Fantoni;Viola Folli;Marco Leonetti;Giancarlo Ruocco	2017	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-017-2384-0	social science;computer science;data mining;sociology;management;world wide web	ML	-77.58551747785101	-21.830319730363797	75859

Studies have shown that diagnostic search can often lead to anxiety about the possibility that symptoms are explained by the presence of rare, serious medical disorders, rather than far more common benign syndromes. We study the influence of the appearance of potentially-alarming content, such as severe illnesses or serious treatment options associated with the queried for symptoms, in captions comprising titles, snippets, and URLs. We explore whether users are drawn to results with potentially-alarming caption content, and if so, the implications of such attraction for the design of search engines. We specifically study the influence of the content of search result captions shown in response to symptom searches on search-result click-through behavior. We show that users are significantly more likely to examine and click on captions containing potentially-alarming medical terminology such as “heart attack” or “medical emergency” independent of result rank position and well-known positional biases in users' search examination behaviors. The findings provide insights about the possible effects of displaying implicit correlates of searchers' goals in search-result captions, such as unexpressed concerns and fears. As an illustration of the potential utility of these results, we developed and evaluated an enhanced click prediction model that incorporates potentially-alarming caption features and show that it significantly outperforms models that ignore caption content. Beyond providing additional understanding of the effects of Web content on medical concerns, the methods and findings have implications for search engine design. As part of our discussion on the implications of this research, we propose procedures for generating more representative captions that may be less likely to cause alarm, as well as methods for learning to more appropriately rank search results from logged search behavior, for examples, by also considering the presence of potentially-alarming content in the captions that motivate observed clicks and down-weighting clicks seemingly driven by searchers' health anxieties.	norm (social);web content;web search engine;world wide web	Ryen W.

d4a44332b7b8e405daceeb39b03fec530779f212	prestige questions, online agents, and gender-driven differences in disclosure		This work considers the possibility of using virtual agents to encourage disclosure for sensitive information. In particular, this research used “prestige questions”, which asked participants to disclose information relevant to their socioeconomic status, such as credit limit, as well as university attendance, and mortgage or rent payments they could afford. We explored the potential for agents to enhance disclosure compared to conventional web-forms, due to their ability to serve as relational agents by creating rapport. To consider this possibility, agents were framed as artificially intelligent versus avatars controlled by a real human, and we compared these conditions to a version of the financial questionnaire with no agent. In this way, both the perceived agency of the agent and its ability to generate rapport were tested. Additionally, we examined the differences in disclosure between men and women in these conditions. Analyses reveled that agents (either AI- or human-framed) evoked greater disclosure compared to the no agent condition. However, there was some evidence that human-framed agents evoked greater lying. Thus, users in general responded more socially to the presence of a human- or AI-framed agent, and the benefits and costs of this approach were made apparent. The results are discussed in terms of rapport and anonymity.	artificial intelligence;form (html);information sensitivity;intelligent agent	Johnathan Mell;Gale M.

Introduction: Past evidence suggests parental mediation may influence their children’s online exchanges with others; for example, parental mediation of adolescents’ technology and internet use buffers against cyberbullying (Collier et al. 2016). Yet, no research has investigated how parental mediation and adolescents’ social capital relates to cyberbullying. The present study explores the associations between social capital and parental mediation with cyberbullying and cybervictimization. Methods: 215 adolescents (56% female) aged 13 to 17 in a parent-teen diary study were recruited across the United States via a Qualtrics panel. Two Hierarchical Linear Regression analyses were conducted with cyberbullying and cybervictimization as the outcome variables while taking into consideration sex, age, ethnicity (Block 1) and internet use (Block 2). Social capital variables were entered into Block 3 and parental mediation variables were entered into Block 4. Results: Both internet use and social capital positively predicted cyberbullying and cybervictimization (p u003c 0.05), suggesting trade-offs between frequency of internet use and the ability to bond with others online in direct relation to the risk of engaging in or exposing oneself to cyberbullying. As shown in Table 1, social bonding, internet use, and device use monitoring are significantly associated with cybervictimization (p u003c .05). Social bonding and online monitoring were significantly associated with cyberbullying (p u003c .05). Conclusions: Our research highlights the complex relationships between adolescent internet use, the benefits of engaging online with others, and the potential risks of cyberbullying. However, parental mediation linked to these cyber risks indicates that caregivers mediate when there are online concerns.rnrnrnTable 1.rnSummary of hierarchical multiple regression examining the influence of social capital and parental mediation on cyberbullying and cybervictimization.rnrnrnrnrnOpen image in new window	cyberbullying;social capital	Johanna Sam;Pamela J.

In response, traditional journalists are expected to engage in ‘news repair’ in order to reconfirm the authority of existing news institutions and the legitimacy of traditional models of journalism. This interaction between new media and journalistic practices must be contextualized within a media system. Built upon these premises, this study analyzes data from probability sample surveys of journalists in two Chinese cities. It finds that journalists regard mainstream media organizations’ websites as more credible than those run by commercial portals. The perceived credibility of these two types of news websites varies with journalists’ beliefs about journalism.

Using deliberative democracy as a theoretical lens, this paper proposes a coding scheme for understanding the progress of citizens' deliberation through content analysis from a naturally occurring online discussion of a local planning project. By comparing patterns of this online discourse with normative views of deliberative dialogues, we found that important indicators of the deliberative ideal are missing. Our results show that citizens were not able to move towards advanced phases of deliberation as prescribed by deliberative democracy theory; and explain why it failed to develop common ground and joint assessment of alternative courses of action. We further explore possible causes of such patterns and identified a number of barriers that make online discussions less optimal to achieve common ground and collective judgment. Based on such findings, we suggest ways to improve deliberative outcomes by introducing active facilitation and advanced information support.	computer-mediated communication;incidence matrix	Jessica Kropczynski;Guoray Cai;John M.

2c5747764b89280b181c697aa941a86f2587c98f	promotions, tenures and publication behaviours: serbian example		"""Introduction Bibliometric indicators became a common tool for evaluating universities (Geuna & Martin, 2003). Furthermore, individual academics and researchers are also evaluated, promoted, and tenured based on their productivity, particularly the one visible in international databases such as the Web of Science (WoS). This methodology is widely accepted even in non-English speaking countries (Pajić, 2014). Growing emphasis on bibliometric indicators is followed by a continuing debate on their suitability for the evaluation in social sciences and humanities (SS&H) (Nederhof, 2006). Secondary importance of journals and the prevalence of monographs are usually identified as the key features of """"publication behaviour"""" in SS&H (Hicks, 2012). Economics and psychology are often considered to be more similar to sciences (Engels, Ossenblok, & Spruyt, 2012). This paper presents initial results on the scientific productivity of professors promoted and tenured at the University of Novi Sad (UNS).

Versatility of a topic in this research refers to the degree to which a topic discussed in a social media covers different points of view or sub-topics. We introduce this notion of versatility for individual topics embedded in Twitter data originated from different regions over time. Uniqueness of a region with respect to a topic is first computed based on how its term distribution differs from those in other regions. Uniqueness values associated with all the regions for a topic are then used to compute its versatility. Since versatility of a topic captures its characteristics across different regions, identifying versatile topics can help understanding regional interests and thus providing region-dependent services. In addition, it becomes possible to identify regions with minority sub-topics, which can be buried easily. By analyzing topic versatility over time, furthermore, we can analyze the behavior of a topic in terms of when it is diverged or converged across the regions.	embedded system;social media	Gwan Jang;Sung-Hyon Myaeng	2015	2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1145/2808797.2809378	market research;social network analysis;social science;media;computer science;data mining;mathematics;multimedia;world wide web;correlation	DB	-81.68861789909354	-15.654144316261677	76463

We aim to evidence how, by adopting the co-creation value concept, thanks to the new technologies, specifically the innovative communication channels, the Olympic Games assume a greater value and are more successful in terms of followers, as athletes, fans, participants, and so forth. Thanks to the spread of social networks in the Olympic Games, the general consumers, mainly the fans, are able to give feedbacks, opinions, suggestions, and evidence criticisms about the same mega sporting events, by interacting directly with athletes, organizers and all the actors involved in this very complex managerial and organizing process. This study, conducted through a review of the literature and a comparative analysis of Summer Olympic Games editions during the period 1992–2016, represents a research starting point that allows us to evidence the crucial role played by the social networks in the mega sporting events improving their social value in the co-creation value perspective.

However, as personalization becomes increasingly commonplace, customers may feel personalized content intrusive and therefore not responding or even avoiding them. Many studies have investigated advertising intrusiveness and avoidance but a research gap on the effect of degree of personalization on customer responses based on field evidence exists. In this paper, 27,175 recommendation displays from five different online stores are analyzed. The results show that the further the customer is in the purchasing process, the more effective personalization is if it is based on information about the present rather than past browsing session. Moreover, recommendations in passive form are more effective than recommendations in active form suggesting the need to dispel the perception of intrusiveness.

Research question: How do individuals process a phishing email, and determine whether to respond to it? Specifically, this study examines how users' attention to “visual triggers” and “phishing deception indicators” influence their decision-making processes and consequently their decisions. Literature review: This paper draws upon the theory of deception and the literature on mediated cognition and learning, including the critical role of attention and elaboration in deception detection. From this literature, we developed a research model to suggest that overall cognitive effort expended in email processing decreases with attention to visual triggers and phishing deception indicators. The likelihood to respond to phishing emails increases with attention to visceral cues, but decreases with attention to phishing deception indicators and cognitive effort. Knowledge of email-based scams increases attention to phishing deception indicators, and directly decreases response likelihood. It also moderates the impact of attention to visceral triggers and that of phishing deception indicators on likelihood to respond. Methodology: Using a real phishing email as a stimulus, a survey of 321 members of a public university community in the Northeast US, who were intended victims of a spear phishing attack that took place, was conducted. The survey used validated measures developed in prior literature for the most part and tested results using the partial least-squares regression. Results and discussion: Our research model and hypotheses were supported by the data except that we did not find that cognitive effort significantly affects response likelihood. The implication of the study is that attention to visceral triggers, attention to phishing deception indicators, and phishing knowledge play critical roles in phishing detection. The limitations of the study were that the data were drawn from students, and the study explored one phishing attack, relied on some single-item measures, cognitive effort measure, and a one-round survey. Future research would examine the impact of a varying degree of urgency and a varying level of phishing deception indicators, and actual victims of phishing attacks.	cognition;email;information sensitivity;partial least squares regression;phishing	Jingguo Wang;Tejaswini Herath;Rui Chen;Arun Vishwanath;H.

A thriving anti-spam industry addresses some of the frustration. Regulation and various economic and technical means are in the works. All anti-spam measures aim at bringing down the flood of unwanted commercial e-mail. This paper contributes to the understanding of the UCE phenomenon by drawing on scholarly work in areas of marketing and resource ownership and use. Adapting the tragedy of the commons concept to e-mail, we identify a causal structure that drives the direct e-marketing industry. Computer simulations indicate that although filtering may be an effective method to curb UCE arriving at individual inboxes, it is likely to increase the aggregate volume, thereby boosting overall costs. We also examine other response mechanisms, including self-regulation, government regulation, and market mechanisms. We find that, of the various countermeasures, filtering appears to be the best currently available but that none are a satisfactory solution. The analysis advances understanding of the digital commons, the economics of UCE, and provides practical implications for the direct e-marketing industry.	aggregate data;anti-spam techniques;carr–benkler wager;causality;computer-mediated communication;effective method;email;homeostasis;mail (macos);online advertising;simulation;spamming	Oleg V.

However, in order for these benefits to be realized a household must adopt and consistently use the ICS. This paper documents the first phase of a stove adoption study conducted in Soroti, Uganda with a locally manufactured Tier 2 efficiency cookstove, tested under IWA 11. A market-based approach was used to disseminate ICSs in the local community to a group of 40 participant households. Study participants were divided into three groups non-users, new users and existing users. Initial field interviews were conducted with all participants to understand their perceptions of the stove and reported usage patterns. The most common reason cited for purchasing the stove by new users was fuel savings. Additionally, 130 days of usage was collected using a custom made Stove Use Monitor (SUM). The SUMs indicate that existing users consistently use the ICS. New users exhibit low and inconsistent usage during the initial 35 days of owning the ICS, but within approximately 75 days' increase usage and follow same pattern as the existing user group.	integrated windows authentication;purchasing;resident monitor;tier 2 network	Prithiviraj Sundararaman;Amit Gandhi;Daniel Frey;Acuku Helen Ekolu;Betty Ikalany;Megha Hegde;Kendra Leith;Daniel Sweeney	2016	2016 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC)	10.1109/GHTC.2016.7857271	simulation;engineering;operations management;advertising	HCI	-90.76143810994299	-9.890428963461808	77558
2013c4bf0f81b7f6677bfcb61d60bcf1df2cb6dd	a multinational study on online privacy: global concerns and local responses	privacy protection behaviour;privacy concern;national culture;online privacy	This study surveyed 1261 internet users from five cities (Bangalore, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney and New York) to examine multinational internet users’ perceptions and behavioural responses concerning online privacy. It identified a set of individual-level (demographics and internet-related experiences) and macro-level factors (nationality and national culture), and tested the extent to which they affected online privacy concerns and privacy protection behaviours. The results showed that individual differences (age, gender and internet experience), nationality and national culture significantly influenced internet users’ privacy concerns to the extent that older, female internet users from an individualistic culture were more concerned about online privacy than their counterparts. The study also identified three underlying dimensions of privacy protection behaviour – avoidance, opt-out and proactive protection – and found that they distinctly related to the individual and macro-level factors. Overall, the findings highlight the conditional and multicultural nature of online privacy. new media & society Copyright © 2009 SAGE Publications Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, Singapore and Washington DC Vol 11(3): 395–416 [DOI: 10.1177/1461444808101618]	experience;external validity;failure;futures studies;information privacy;internet privacy;new media;occam's razor;sampling (signal processing);triune continuum paradigm	Hichang Cho;Milagros Rivera Sánchez;Sun Sun Lim	2009	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444808101618	public relations;privacy policy;information privacy;computer science;marketing;advertising;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web	Security	-86.99642456338056	-20.237009456167502	78326

Previous literature has identified a number of strong determinants of online purchase intention including values, consumer experience, lifestyle, security, perceived risk, information, and subjective norms and behavioural control. The present study examined the relationship between online mobile gaming addiction and loyalty towards purchase intention of online mobile game in-game apps. The present study comprised 430 students from two major Indian universities who completed a short 28-item survey focusing on three variables (i.e., addiction, loyalty towards online games, and purchase intention towards online mobile in-game features). The results demonstrated that (i) online mobile game addiction shared a significant positive relationship with online mobile game loyalty; (ii) online mobile game addiction had a positive relationship with the purchase of online mobile in-game apps, and (iii) online mobile game loyalty increased game usersu0027 intention to purchase online mobile in-game apps. The present study is the first to investigate loyalty and gaming addiction in relation to the purchase of in-game apps. Game developers will always want to facilitate loyalty among its clientele. However, if the engagement strategies used by gaming operators facilitate addiction as a way of increasing purchase intention of online mobile game in-game apps, this raises serious ethical questions which the gaming industry need to address as part of its corporate social responsibility strategy.	virtual world	Janarthanan Balakrishnan;Mark D.

Several studies have examined the factors affecting corporate image, suggesting both emotional (e.g., feelings or impression) and functional (e.g., quality of products) components. While this body of research has examined corporate image, the present study measures corporate image from a communications perspective by employing social networking sites (SNS) and its fan page subscribers. Testing this study's hypotheses using an elaboration likelihood model (ELM) as a theoretical lens and using structural equation modeling (SEM) method, the authors invited Facebook users who subscribe to fan pages to answer survey questions. Research findings reveal that page subscribers rely on less cognitive routes of information processing to perceive an informative posting, thereby impacting corporate image. We also discuss the implications and limitations of this research.	elaboration likelihood model;fansite;information processing;social network;structural equation modeling	Soo Il Shin;Dianne Hall;Jiahe Song;Kang Bok Lee;Teresa Lang	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.657	public relations;media;uncertainty;information processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;marketing;mathematical model;database;advertising;management;world wide web;statistics	Visualization	-88.2600799190128	-13.006743296491672	78511

However, the complexity of modern spam filters aggregating evidence from various sources means few non-expert users of spam filters actually understand what their spam filters are doing. It also remains unclear how different spam filter settings would impact on what they see in their email inboxes.

Knowledge about which journals are the most influential forums for disseminating AI research is important for business school faculty, students, administrators, and librarians. To date, there has been only one study attempting to rank AI journals from a business-computing perspective. It used a subjective methodology, surveying opinions of business faculty about a prespecified list of 30 journals. Here, we report the results of a more objective study. We conducted a citation analysis covering a time period of 5 years to compile 15,600 citations to 1,244 different journals. Based on these data, the journals are ranked in two ways involving the magnitude and the duration of scientific impact each has had in the field of AI.	artificial intelligence;citation analysis;compiler;librarian	Chun Hung Cheng;Clyde W.

A decreasing trend in news consumption diversity is observed among users. The news consumption diversity of individuals is positively related to global information diversity. Furthermore, the news consumption diversity of males exhibits a stronger tendency to be influenced by global information diversity than that of females. The decreasing trend in news consumption diversity is less remarkable among males than among females. This study complements traditional motivation-driven perspectives of news consumption by mining the structural antecedents of news consumption diversity and further emphasizes the social implications of mobile news technology. Lastly, practical implications and limitations are discussed.	embedded system	Lun Zhang;Lu Zheng;Tai-Quan Peng	2017	Inf. Process.

The present paper investigates SMS in a representative sample of office environments in a Scandinavian town. The results indicate that SMS messaging is not integrated into office work, that the messages are highly informal, mostly from the private sphere and from persons well known to the receiver. Different explanations of the infrequent use of SMS in the workplace, e.g. cost sharing between employer and employee, are proposed. One explanation ties the difference in popularity in the private and business spheres to technical aspects of the system and its user interface. This explanation is based upon the Gricean concept of conversational implicature and Clark’s concept of common ground and is elaborated at length. This explanation suggests that SMS is an inherently informal communication system, ill suited to the business domain.	business domain;user interface	Gunnvald B. Svendsen;Bente Evjemo;Jan-Are K.

The author developed and empirically tested an integrated model combining the effects of organizational efforts on consumer concerns, process satisfaction, and purchase intentions. The results of this effort suggested that consumers are still skeptical of the organizational efforts in an online context and their concerns remain a critical factor in influencing their satisfaction and purchase intention.

Limited empirical evidence exists concerning social media infidelity-related behaviors and marital relationships. This study examined whether married/cohabiting individuals are using social media sites to engage in online infidelity-related behaviors and to what extent this related to relationship satisfaction, ambivalence, and relational attachment characteristics as reported by 338 married/cohabiting individuals from 176 families. Only a small percentage of married/cohabiting couples reported engaging in social media infidelity-related behaviors; however, more engagement in infidelity-related behaviors on social media was significantly related to lower relationship satisfaction, higher relationship ambivalence, and greater attachment avoidance and anxiety in both women and men. Additionally, attachment anxiety and gender interacted with relationship satisfaction in predicting online infidelity-related behaviors when controlling for other variables. Implications are discussed.		Brandon T. McDaniel;Michelle Drouin;Jaclyn D.

4e250f21d2b0a874093809df3f7558b81044a0b7	an online experiment on consumers' susceptibility to fall for post-transaction marketing scams		Post-transaction marketing offers are often designed to trick consumers into purchasing products they would not want. To increase the frequency of transactions, retailers use strategies such as subscribing consumers by default to offers, camouflaging post-transaction offers as part of primary transactions, and being unclear about the terms of the offer. Further, sharing agreements for personal consumer data and payment credentials between first and third-party retailers violate consumers’ expectations about privacy and business conduct. Some of these tactics have been mitigated in the United States with the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act (ROSCA). In this paper, we report the results from an online post-transaction marketing experiment. We involve over 500 consumers in a purchasing episode (i.e., a functional mock-up music store) followed by a post-transaction marketing offer with low value to consumers. In the experiment, we systematically vary important design characteristics on the offer page, and collect additional data through a post-experimental questionnaire. We investigate which factors are most predictive of acceptance of the low-value post-transaction offer. We find that ROSCA’s interventions are a step in the right direction and should be considered by European regulators, but do not go far enough.

In this paper we introduce two approaches aiming to improve the overall quality of email communication by means of reflection. For this purpose, we determine, rate and classify quality problems as encountered in today's email communication. Subsequently, we derive criteria to rate the quality of email communication, both objectively as well as subjectively. The results of these ratings are then presented to the authors of email messages to encourage them to improve their email communication behaviour. Preliminary results suggest that our approach might have the potential to overcome problems of email communication caused by ill-composed messages.	email	Guy Vollmer;Katrin Gaßner	2005		10.1145/1099203.1099225	public relations;quality management;working group;reflection;computer science;feedback;multimedia;communication;world wide web	HCI	-88.04548653898696	-17.25303235175015	79715

a1143a7b28e5ebfb2115f89936ea1584bb02fdd3	ict policies as a means to inhibit social exclusion: the south african case		Social exclusion is a multi dimensional phenomenon that manifests itself in the exclusion of an individual from one or more of the four following activities: production of goods and services, consumption, civil engagement, and social interaction. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been argued to have the potential to reduce these forms of social exclusion. However, the extent to which they deal with these different forms of social exclusion remains unknown. Therefore, in this study we examine how ICT policies in South Africa are being employed to reduce social exclusion. In particular, we analyze which dimensions of social exclusion are targeted in telecommunication laws and one of the ICT initiatives of the South African government, Multi-Purpose Community Centers (MPCCs). Using a framework that portrays the four forms of social exclusion within the discourses used in phenomenon debates (redistributionist, moral underclass, and social integrationist) for analysis, we find that ICT policies in South Africa address two of the four forms of social exclusion: production of goods and services and civil engagement, spanning both the redistributionist and social integrationist discourses of social exclusion.	file spanning	Edgar A.

Yet, it is important to gain understanding of these online behaviors as they might have consequences on the individual and organizational level. We provide a typology for work-related Twitter use based on a large-scale content analysis (N 1⁄4 38,124) of tweets sent by 433 employees across different organizations. We found that work-related topics were prevalent in 36.5% of all tweets. Employees’workrelated tweets paint a picture that is consistent with the archetypical social media behaviors e i.e., knowledge sharing and socialization e identified in earlier research. Employees share profession-, organizationand work-related tweets strategically with professional contacts, enhancing horizontal communication among organization members. Furthermore, Twitter enhances the integration of personal and professional life domains, as employees often tweet about their work outside regular work hours but also tweet on a personal title while at work. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

But problematically in the process of HFS, the personal information of search objects is posted on the Internet, which seriously violates the privacy protection of the search objects and affectes the real lives of others. In this paper, we apply the neutralization technology theory and deterrence theory, both prominent in criminology, with the construction of privacy awareness, to study the behavior of participants of the HFS. Using smartPLS2.0 software to analyze 574 questionnaires, we got our research conclusion. We find that the technologies of denial of responsibility, denial of injury, denial of victim, appeal to higher loyalties, avoidance of greater harm and privacy awareness significantly influence the intention to participate in the HFS, but the metaphor of the ledger technology, the certainty of sanction and the severity of the sanction have no significant effect on HFS participation intention. Based on the results of this study, we conduct a detailed analysis and give some appropriate instructions. At last, the research conclusion may have some potentially fruitful reference for related legislation and be helpful to guide the Internet behavior of netizens.	internet;netizen;personally identifiable information	Wenli Li;Na Wu;Yulong Ke;Xin Lv;Yulin An	2014			social science;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;sociology;advertising;management;social psychology;law;world wide web;computer security	Security	-89.33943369186545	-16.46665641657039	80099

Subsequently an online survey was applied to a representative sample of users. The scales were validated and refined, after which the hypotheses were tested by way of a structural equation model.Findings – Results confirm that readers motivated by aspects related mainly to differential attributes of the internet versus traditional channels perceive them both as information conduits and not as substitutive products. Meanwhile, motivations that could be satisfied through both channels positively affect the level of perceived substitutability between digital and traditional newspapers. Nevertheles...

However, when shared, search terms and links clicked reveal user interests, habits, social relations and intentions. In other words, CSE put privacy of users at risk. This seriously limits the proliferation and acceptance of CSE. To address the problem, we have carried out a qualitative study that identifies the privacy concerns of CSE users. In particular, our study reveals the range and type of concerns when sharing query terms and search results with different social groups, e.g., family members or colleagues. To control the information shared, the participants of our study have called for anonymity and reciprocity in combination with timeand/or context-dependent conditions. To facilitate the specification of privacy preferences, we define a general policy structure to express privacy needs in the context of CSE. We also give an approach to address the reciprocity condition identified in the study, and we discuss options to anonymize sharing of query terms.	adobe flash player;anonymous web browsing;context-sensitive language;operational system;privacy;web search engine	Thorben Burghardt;Erik Buchmann;Klemens Böhm;Chris Clifton	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-03354-4_8	social group;social relation;privacy software;privacy policy;information privacy;privacy by design;qualitative research;context-dependent memory;internet privacy;world wide web;search engine	Security	-90.20911134410979	-15.325345689049875	80378

However, decades of research on diversity in offline work groups have painted an inconclusive picture. On the one hand, the broader range of insights from a diverse group can lead to improved outcomes. On the other hand, individual differences can lead to conflict and diminished performance. In this paper, we examine the effects of group diversity on the amount of work accomplished and on member withdrawal behaviors in the context of WikiProjects. We find that increased diversity in experience with Wikipedia increases group productivity and decreases member withdrawal -- up to a point. Beyond that point, group productivity remains high, but members are more likely to withdraw. Strikingly, no such diminishing returns were observed for differences in member interest, which increases productivity and decreases member withdrawal in a linear fashion. Our results suggest that the low visibility of individual differences in online groups may allow them to harvest more of the benefits of diversity while bearing less of the cost. We discuss how our findings can inform further research of online collaboration."""	online and offline;open-source software;picture-in-picture;the wisdom of crowds;wikiproject;wikipedia	Jilin Chen;Yuqing Ren;John Riedl	2010		10.1145/1753326.1753447	working group;performance;brand;management;world wide web	HCI	-83.98059636296195	-16.065015825650867	80461

Specifically, it looks at how the authors’ news stories posting increase rate, the number of news story sources, the velocity at which comments to a news story start to appear, and the comment interactivity affect discussion participation. Results suggest that cues that signal expertise influence participation, while discussion among users also influences the decision of others to participate. However, the effect of these variables is stronger for some topics. Implications for the constitution of public spheres are discussed.	http 404;information cascade;interactivity;online community;social media;velocity (software development)	Alcides Velasquez	2012	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444812445877	public relations;social science;content analysis;marketing;multimedia;sociology;social psychology;world wide web;information cascade;online participation	HCI	-82.32512944224688	-16.90045416317966	80512

A survey of a national sample was conducted to empirically test the relationship between affective concern for and cognitive knowledge of information privacy online. We also tested for the interactive role of reward-seeking as a moderator among these relationships. Findings revealed that concern did not directly play a meaningful role in guiding users' protective behavior, whereas knowledge was found significant in moderating the role of concern. The interactive role of reward-seeking seems particularly salient in shaping the structure of the relationships. These findings suggest that the intersections between knowledge, reward, and concern can play out differently, depending on the levels of each. Policy implications in relation to users' cognitive, affective, and reward-seeking rationalities are offered, and future research considerations are discussed.	cognition	Yong Jin Park;Scott W.

To fill the gap, the presented study focuses on one typical individual psychological trait of Gen Y, i.e., narcissism, and aims to provide a conceptual framework which captures the moderating influence of product types, advertising types and different self (i.e., actual versus ideal self) in the relationship between consumers’ narcissistic trait and advertising persuasiveness. Two studies will be conducted to test the framework and relevant hypotheses, and the experimental design method will be adopted by these two studies ; the findings are expected to contribute to the consumer behavior and advertising literature regarding to narcissistic consumers and the effect of self-focused appeal.	design of experiments;online advertising	Cheng-Yue Yin;Nan Bi;Ying Wan	2016				HCI	-89.37957276871849	-12.808906292322614	80577
e1e287f71a4cf42c607c835116ed86fd5bb8df92	characterizing hpv vaccine discourse on reddit		Introduction: Approximately 23,000 women and 15,793 men in the United States are affected by human papilloma virus (HPV) related cancers. Many of the infections could have been prevented through vaccination [2]. The CDC has recommended a 3-dose vaccination series as a safe and effective method of protecting against HPV strains associated with cervical and other cancers for girls since June 2006 and for males since October 2011. However, vaccination rates remain low. Strengthening uptake efforts is a preeminent national public health concern, as demonstrated by the Healthy People 2020 objective to increase HPV three-doses vaccination series completion for adolescents aged 13–15 to 80% by the year 2020. In order to promote HPV vaccination through public health communication efforts, the mechanisms in which individuals utilize resources related to health information must be identified and understood. Surveillance of social media data can provide an alternative approach to observe patterns of information dissemination and knowledge exchange as related to HPV vaccination behaviors [1]. Understanding extant online discussions on HPV vaccination is pivotal in developing concerted, tailored health communication efforts to enhance HPV vaccination rates. There is a growing number of studies contributing to the literature addressing the nexus of HPV and social media data, but to date, no published study has examined Reddit content related to HPV vaccination.	effective method;social media	Yuki Lama;Dian Hu;Sandra Crouse Quinn;Amelia Jamison;David A.

Attitudes are measured using the Computer Attitude Scale developed by Gressard and Loyd [Association for Educational Data Systems Journal 18 (1986) 295]. A survey was conducted with 262 persons participating in mental health programs. Results indicate that people with severe mental illnesses have some experience with computers, have attitudes that are comparable to those of college students assessed in previous published studies, and both experience and attitudes predict interest in computer training. However, mediational analyses indicate that attitudes toward computers completely mediates the relationship between experience and interest in computer training. Discussion focuses on the need for more research that examines how experience and attitudes may interact in accounting for future computer-related interests. The results also suggest that the attitudes and interests of people with severe mental illnesses justifies the provision of computer training to those who are interested in order to increase their success in the labor market. # 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

aa46884daf15691b9242b7158a049e07367c2163	a bidirectional perspective of trust and risk in determining factors that influence mobile app installation		Abstract The purpose of this research is to consider how trust in and perceived risk of a mobile marketplace impact a consumer before installing a mobile application. In particular, trust is considered from the perspective of institutionalized trust, where consumers faced with ignorance rely on institutionalized mechanisms for personal safety. A bidirectional research model is presented based on trust and perceived risk as antecedents to the intent to install a mobile application. Data is collected from a survey of 214 participants and is analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results suggest that institutional loyalty plays a significant role in consumers’ intent to install mobile apps. Trust and its antecedent, security, had strong significant positive relationships with the intention to install mobile apps, while risk and its antecedent, privacy, had weak and insignificant relationships. The bidirectional model’s relationship between trust and risk was also insignificant in both directions, further suggesting that perception of risk is an insignificant factor in the intent to install mobile apps.	mobile app	Amita Goyal Chin;Mark A.

Design/methodology/approach – This study captures the characteristics of knowledge generation by examining the pragmatics and types of information needs of posted questions and by investigating knowledge related characteristics of discussion posts as well as the success of communication. Three online forums were examined. The data set consists of 55 threads, containing 533 posts which were categorized manually by two researchers. Findings – Results show that questioners often ask for personal estimations. Information needs often aim for actionable insights or uncertainty reduction. With regard to answers, factual information is the dominant content type and has the highest knowledge value as it is the strongest predictor with regard to the generation of new knowledge. Opinions are also relevant, but in a rather subsequent and complementary way. Emotional aspects are scarcely observed. Overall, results indicate that knowledge creation predominantly follows a socio-cultural paradigm of knowledge exchange. Research limitations/implications – Although the investigation captures important aspects of knowledge building processes, the measurement of the forums’ knowledge value is still rather limited. Success is only partly measurable with the current scheme. The central coding category “new topical knowledge” is only of nominal value and therefore not able to compare different kinds of knowledge gains in the course of discussion. Originality/value – The investigation reaches out beyond studies that do not consider that the role and relevance of posts is dependent on the state of the discussion. Furthermore, the paper integrates two perspectives of knowledge value: the success of the questioner with regard to the expressed information need and the knowledge building value for communicants and readers.	categorization;formal verification;information needs;information seeking;kerrison predictor;order of approximation;programming paradigm;relevance;thread (computing)	Joachim Griesbaum;Nadine Mahrholz;Kim von Löwe Kiedrowski;Marc Rittberger	2015	Aslib J.

Although there is extensive work on the influences on the buying decision process relevant to mobile phone purchasing, it is mainly set outside of a social media context. This paper assists in filling a gap in contemporary research, revealing the presence of different behavioural segments on Facebook. The authors analyse the consumer decision sequence in response to the notion of ‘brand presence’, manifested through online advertising, fan and group pages. The approach is interpretative. The study is based on young professional user’s experiences, collected through semi-structured individual and focus group interviews. The findings show that Facebook fan pages are shown to have a degree of influence, particularly in the early stages of buying behaviour. In this context, five novel behavioural segments of consumer interactions with Smartphone brands on Facebook have been identified by the research. These are the Avoider, the Suspicious, the Passive, the Receptive, and the Active. Future research of cross comparative studies could be taken on the issues the authors examine and consider them in relation to not only Facebook, but additionally, to other social network sites. Companies could utilise the findings in the future development of social media strategy. The research highlights the socially networked and collective nature of much activity on Facebook, which impacts on the consumer decision-making process for mobile phones.

A survey was carried out with 92 language schools located in Curitiba, South of Brazil. Results revealed that the Internet is adopted in 55% of the schools analysed. Both the model of linear multiple regression and the model of logistic regression predicted 77% of the cases of adoption and, therefore, represented satisfactorily the data from the questionnaire used. The variables observability and trialability were found to be the two most significant predictors of adoption. Adoption took place in 65% of the schools where pedagogical coordinators were brought under pressure by teachers to have the Internet adopted as a teaching tool, implying that this variable may influence the adoption rate. The variables size and amount of time the school has been functioning did not emerge as significant predictors.	internet	Cláudia Beatriz Monte Jorge Martins;Andrea V. Steil;José L.

Recently, these sites have presented opportunities for youth to experience cyber-bullying. Often resulting in psychological distress, cyber-bullying is a common experience for many young people. Continual use of SNS signifies the importance of examining its links to cyber-bullying. This study examined the relationship between online social networking and the experience of cyber-bullying. A total of 400 participants (Mage=14.31 years) completed an online survey which examined the perceived definitions and frequency of cyber-bullying. Users of SNS reported significantly higher frequencies of stranger contact compared to non-users. Spearman's rho correlations determined no significant relationship between daily time on SNS and the frequency of stranger contact. This suggests that ownership of a SNS profile may be a stronger predictor of some cyber-bullying experiences compared to time spent on these sites. Findings encourage continued research on the nature of internet activities used by young adolescents and the possible exposure to online victimization.	adolescent (age group);bullying;distress (novel);experience;kerrison predictor;social network	Bridianne O'Dea;Andrew M Campbell	2012	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-121-2-212	the internet;injury prevention;knowledge management;distress;occupational safety and health;human factors and ergonomics;suicide prevention;applied psychology;social network;medicine;computer security	HCI	-86.62081414773705	-20.678605011700355	81019
5b37a24a31e4f83d056fa1da4048ea0d4dd6c5e1	product type and consumers' perception of online consumer reviews		Consumers hesitate to buy experience products online because it is hard to get enough information about experience products via the Internet. Online consumer reviews may change that, as they offer consumers indirect experiences about dominant attributes of experience products, transforming them into search products. When consumers are exposed to an online consumer review, it should be noted that there are different kinds of review sources. This study investigates the effects of review source and product type on consumers’ perception of a review. The result of the online experiment suggests that product type canmoderate consumers’ perceived credibility of a review from different review sources, and the major findings are: (1) consumers are more influenced by a review for an experience product than for a search product when the review comes from consumer-developed review sites, and (2) a review from an online community is perceived to be the most credible for consumers seeking information about an experience product. The findings provide managerial implications for marketers as to how they can better manage online consumer reviews.	experience;internet;online community;product type	Soonyong Bae;Taesik Lee	2011	Electronic Markets	10.1007/s12525-011-0072-0	marketing;advertising;commerce	Web+IR	-88.87004494299744	-12.890017107247056	81091

Adopting trust-building foundations from cross-culture literature and focusing on a set of well-established cultural constructs as groups of culture (Type I and Type II), this study develops a theoretical model of self-perception-based versus transference-based consumer trust in e-vendors, and empirically tests the model using cross-cultural data. The results show that transference-based trust determinants (i.e., """"perceived importance of third-party seal"""" and """"perceived importance of positive referral"""") are more positively related to consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type II (i.e., collectivist-strong uncertainty avoidance-high long-term orientation-high context) culture than in a Type I (i.e., individualistic-weak uncertainty avoidance-low long-term orientation-low context) culture. Unlike the initial hypothesized expectations, self-perception-based trust determinants (i.e., perceived security protection, perceived privacy concern, and perceived system reliability) do not show stronger roles to consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type I culture than in a Type II culture, although the stronger negative effect of perceived privacy concerns is observed on consumer trust in e-vendors in a Type I culture than in a Type II culture.

82d65efca9217f20708946124b900f68f364aa97	is there agreement on the prestige of scholarly book publishers in the humanities? delphi over survey results		Despite having an important role supporting assessment processes, criticism towards evaluation systems and the categorizations used are frequent. Considering the acceptance by the scientific community as an essential issue for using rankings or categorizations in research evaluation, the aim of this paper is testing the results of rankings of scholarly book publishersu0027 prestige, Scholarly Publishers Indicators (SPI hereafter). SPI is a public, survey-based ranking of scholarly publishersu0027 prestige (among other indicators). The latest version of the ranking (2014) was based on an expert consultation with a large number of respondents. In order to validate and refine the results for Humanitiesu0027 fields as proposed by the assessment agencies, a Delphi technique was applied with a panel of randomly selected experts over the initial rankings. The results show an equalizing effect of the technique over the initial rankings as well as a high degree of concordance between its theoretical aim (consensus among experts) and its empirical results (summarized with Gini Index). The resulting categorization is understood as more conclusive and susceptible of being accepted by those under evaluation.	embarcadero delphi	Elea Giménez-Toledo;Jorge Mañana-Rodríguez	2017	CoRR		humanities;library science;media studies;sociology	NLP	-77.48900242497633	-20.922084861470246	81197
d103ce7ddf9d52fd7f59d09eac3fe0cbfe57487f	more options lead to more searching and worse choices in finding partners for romantic relationships online: an experimental study	romantic relationship	It is not surprising that the Internet has become a means by which people expand their social networks and form close relationships. Almost every online-dating Web site provides members with search tools. However, do users truly benefit from more complete searches of a large pool of possibilities? The present study, based on the cognitive perspective, examined whether more search options triggered excessive searching, leading to worse choices and poorer selectivity. We argue that more search options lead to less selective processing by reducing users' cognitive resources, distracting them with irrelevant information, and reducing their ability to screen out inferior options. A total of 128 Taiwanese late adolescents and adults with experience in online romantic relationships participated in an experimental study. After entering the characteristics they found desirable in a partner in such a relationship, participants were randomly assigned to receive one of three levels of available profiles. The dependent measures consisted of the number of profiles searched, the average preference difference for all profiles viewed, the preference difference for the chosen profile, and the degree of selectivity. These measures were used to determine whether more attention was devoted to better alternatives and less attention to worse alternatives. The data supported the predictions. Implications and directions for further research are discussed.	choice behavior;experiment;internet;personnameuse - assigned;randomness;relevance;search - action;selectivity (electronic);social network	Pai-Lu Wu;Wen-Bin Chiou	2009	Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	10.1089/cpb.2008.0182	psychology;medicine;computer science;communication;social psychology	Web+IR	-86.29850126866803	-18.792174405284182	81475

Results show a Matthew effect leading to 1 highly centralized employee participation around a few superactive employees who engage with many ideas and 2 highly centralized idea popularity with a few ideas attracting most employee attention. We find support for shared affiliations among employee-idea clusters in the first half of the participation, which is, however, less likely in the second half.

The disproportionate population of Chinese language speaking users is explored. Four stages of population growth and activity are examined: invitation, adoption, retention, and contribution. Using blog system logs we find that the Chinese language user population grew from just two invitations and demonstrates higher levels of invitation and retention which was highly correlated with contribution. Additional survey results confirm the difference between language communities on their attitudes and approaches to blogging systems. This suggests visible differences in the ways different cultures and language communities embrace and enact relationships through computer mediated publication.	blog;social network	Lei Gu;Paul Johns;Thomas M.

aac1b8e1b9ee3f7f5f447520c64a649cba6cbb7a	on the causal effect of badges		Awide variety of online platforms use digital badges to encourage users to take certain types of desirable actions. However, despite their growing popularity, their causal effect on users’ behavior is not well understood. This is partly due to the lack of counterfactual data and the myriad of complex factors that influence users’ behavior over time. As a consequence, their design and deployment lacks general principles. In this paper, we focus on first-time badges, which are awarded after a user takes a particular type of action for the first time, and study their causal effect by harnessing the delayed introduction of several badges in a popular Q&Awebsite. In doing so, we introduce a novel causal inference framework for first-time badges whose main technical innovations are a robust survival-based hypothesis testing procedure, which controls for the heterogeneity in the benefit users obtain from taking an action, and a bootstrap difference-in-differences method, which controls for the random fluctuations in users’ behavior over time. Our results suggest that first-time badges steer users’ behavior if the initial benefit a user obtains from taking the corresponding action is sufficiently low, otherwise, we do not find significant effects. Moreover, for badges that successfully steered user behavior, we perform a counterfactual analysis and show that they significantly improved the functioning of the site at a community level.	causal filter;causal inference;causality;counterfactual conditional;counterfactual definiteness;difference in differences;mass effect trilogy;mozilla's open badges project;online community;social media;software deployment	Tomasz Kusmierczyk;Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez	2018		10.1145/3178876.3186147	artificial intelligence;data mining;machine learning;software deployment;causal inference;computer science;counterfactual thinking;statistical hypothesis testing;natural experiment;difference in differences;causality;popularity	Web+IR	-85.56187928239284	-14.824746330791209	81654

Although they can support rapid communication and sharing of useful information, they can also facilitate the spread of rumors, which contain unverified information. The purpose of the work reported here was to examine several design ideas for reducing the spread of health-related rumors in a Twitter-like environment. The results have shown that exposing people to information that refutes rumors or warns that the statement has appeared on rumor websites could reduce the spread of rumors. These results suggest that social media technologies can be designed such that users can self correct and inactivate potentially inaccurate information in their environment.	information exchange;self-censorship;social media	Pinar Öztürk;Huaye Li;Yasuaki Sakamoto	2015	2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2015.288	public relations;media;information exchange;analysis of variance;computer science;particle detector;statistics	HCI	-83.30877341000411	-19.173985702309313	81657

All rights reserved. Readers may make verbatim copies of this document for non-commercial purposes by any means, provided that this copyright notice appears on all such copies. This paper utilizes the theory of compensating differentials for job risks from the labor economics literature to evaluate farmers' differences in wage-risk tradeoffs. In the context of job risks, the theory predicts that farmers who place a lower value on health status are willing to work for lower compensation on a risky job. The aim of the paper is to evaluate how the observed wage-risk tradeoff is affected by individual heterogeneity in risk preferences, by acknowledging variations in farmers' revealed attitudes toward risk, both in job-related and non-job activities. The job risk measure employed is self-reported job risk of low back pain, the most recurring health risk faced by farmers. The job-related risky activity is the application of hazardous agrochemicals. The non-job activity is smoking. The primary finding of the study is that individual heterogeneity in risk attitudes is an important determinant of the risk premium workers receive, i.e., individual differences in other health-related activities are influential determinants of the observed wage-risk tradeoff.	risk measure	Stefanos A.

abbc5db566bc499277b6f01dc1583d1cc1b719fc	the digital divide at work and home: the discourse about power and underrepresented groups in the information society	underrepresented groups;information society;conceptual framework;digital divide	The information society has often been described as a meritocracy that enables a level playing field for all participants. From this perspective, individuals from underrepresented groups can make it alongside individuals of wealth and privilege. All that is necessary is education and training, perseverance, and painstaking effort. But if, as some argue, it is not a level playing field, then how do various underrepresented groups cope and compete within this power structure? To find this out, a critical analysis of the responses from underrepresented groups to the dominant discourses about power and IT was carried out. A conceptual framework based upon a study of African-American men and women in low income urban communities was applied to the findings of two different studies of gender in the IT profession. The results show a consistent pattern of response across underrepresented groups. In addition, these findings suggest that positive interventions can be applied across underrepresented groups so that IT does not become simply the latest mechanism for stratifying society. Part 4: Mobilization of Power 274 This study involved interviews with African-American men and women taking classes at a community technology center in an inner city neighborhood in the U.S. (Kvasny 2002). 2 Both studies involved interviews with women IT professionals about societal influences on their career development as IT professionals. One was conducted in Ireland (Trauth 1995, 2000). The other was conducted in Australia and New Zealand (Trauth 2002; Trauth et al. 2000; von Hellens et al. 2001). 1 INTRODUCTION In classic works on the topic, the information society has been described as a meritocracy (Bell 1976) that enables a level playing field. Individuals from underrepresented groups can make it alongside individuals of wealth and privilege. All that is necessary is education and training, perseverance, and painstaking effort. Bill Gates, the college dropout who went on to found one of the most successful corporations in the world, perhaps best personifies the potential of IT to level the playing field. From the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies to the lyrics of rap music enjoyed by teens in the impoverished inner cities and the affluent suburbs, Gates has become synonymous with business savvy, technical acumen, and economic prosperity. However, Amsden and Clark (1999) pose the evocative question: Could Bill Gates have succeeded if he were Black?Or impoverished? Or a woman (we could add)? These authors argue that Gates may be the uncharacteristic IT success story because he is typical only insofar as he enjoyed membership in a privileged American economic and social elite. The odds that he would have succeeded had his social world been that of the urban ghetto may be predicted to be extremely small. Factors such as unemployment and underemployment, and the absence of influential business contacts pose significant barriers to entry into the new high-tech information sectors and challenge the assumptions of the meritocracy. If, in fact, there is not a level playing field, the question arises as to how various underrepresented groups cope within this alien power structure and whether there are consistent methods of coping that transcend the particular demographics of a given underrepresented group. To find this out, we took the findings from a study of power and IT among African-American men and women in low-income urban communities1 and applied them to the findings of two studies of gender in the IT profession.2 The goal was to see how the coping framework that was developed around one set of underrepresented people could be extended and applied to another underrepresented group. In this investigation, narratives generated from the transcripts of in-depth interviews with participants in all three studies were analyzed. These narratives explore the range of ways in which the forces underlying underrepresentation Kvasny & Trauth/The Digital Divide at Work and Home 275 manifest themselves and the range of ways in which underrepresented people cope with their situations. Excerpts from selected interviews are used to punctuate the discussion of the coping themes. The underrepresented groups represented in this paper include both consumers and producers of IT. One set of informants is African-Americans in a low-income community who are attempting to learn the fundamentals of IT at a community technology center. The other set of informants are professional and working class women in Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand who aspire to full participation in the IT profession. We chose both consumers and producers of IT in order test the strength of our coping framework across different types of underrepresented groups in different countries interacting with IT in different ways. In addition, we are able to examine the digital divide from diverse perspectives. We begin to address the research question, How do underrepresented groups react to this discourse of power? by discussing a framework of coping mechanisms that resulted from analysis of narratives of African-American informants. Following this, we apply the framework to another group of underrepresented people in the information societywomenin order to consider commonalities across underrepresented groups and the pervasiveness of certain coping mechanisms. We conclude by showing implications of our findings for future research.	apevia;dropout (neural networks);interaction;social reality	Lynette Kvasny Yarger;Eileen M.

To address the research gap, our study aims to explore several key dimensions of the social dynamics in co-authorship practices. In particular, we examine cohort differences in collaboration patterns across disciplines and cohort differences in negative collaboration experiences across disciplines. To conduct our analyses, we use data from a national survey of scholars and engineers in 108 top research universities. Our results indicate that the number of collaborators at one’s own university is correlated with an increase in negative collaboration experiences, while an increase in collaborators at other universities is not correlated with an increase in negative collaboration experiences. In addition, we conclude that junior scholars are more likely to have negative collaboration experiences than their senior peers. This result is true even after controlling for gender and discipline.	experience;negative feedback;social dynamics	Chin-Chang Tsai;Elizabeth A.

06c923c7359a0db6091ceee6430406da1a434a86	influence of social media marketing on the brand image of organizations in the hospitality industry of sri lanka		The research paper aims to identify significant factors affecting towards the Social Media Marketing which can influence and affect the Brand Image of organizations in the hospitality sector. The identified factors include the following; 1. Positivity, 2. Consistency, 3. Differentiation, 4. Personality, and 5. Engagement Opportunities on Social Media. A framework was developed to highlight the relationship of the factors and their direct influence and impact on the Brand Image. A questionnaire is used to obtain primary data, and the data is analysed using a variety of statistical tools to measure and evaluate the strength of the influence and impact of Social Media Marketing on Brand Image of Hospitality Brands. Assessing the influence and impact of Social Media Marketing on their Brand Image can help organizations in the hospitality industry to evaluate the success of their Social Media Marketing Campaigns, while organizations that are currently not engaged in Social Media Marketing can gain a better understanding on how to utilize Social Media platforms to enhance their Brand Image.

While there has been growing interest in these systems by businesses, government agencies, and universities, there remain important open challenges that must be addressed if the potential of these social systems is to be fully realized. For example, the presence of poor quality users and users intent on manipulating the system can disrupt the quality of socially-powered information and knowledge sharing applications. In this paper, we outline the SocialTrust++ project at Texas A&M University. The overall research goal of the SocialTrust++ project is to develop, analyze, deploy, and test algorithms for building, enabling, and leveraging community-based trust in Social Information Systems. Concretely, we are developing a trustworthy community-based information platform so that each user in a Social Information System can have transparent access to the community's trust perspective to enable more effective and efficient social information access.	algorithm;information systems;information access;information management;information system;programming paradigm;social system;trust (emotion);wikipedia	James Caverlee;Zhiyuan Cheng;Brian Eoff;Chiao-Fang Hsu;Krishna Yeswanth Kamath;Said Kashoob;J.

Design/methodology/approach – The study investigates the nature of social media interactions and networking strategies in the Korean government by extracting tweets, follower/following relationships, and hyperlinks for 32 ministries. Network patterns and networking strategies are reviewed through descriptive statistical analysis and social network analysis to map the government’s Twitter activity. Findings – The results indicate that the government’s direct networking strategy targeting citizens does not necessarily motivate their participation in the government’s social media activities but that it plays an instrumental role in reinforcing G2G relationships. Originality – This study investigates the social media use patterns (e.g. network properties and co-link analyses) and strategies (e.g. the reciprocity of relationships and content-push strategies) in the context of G2C and G2G relationships in Korea’s public sector.	e-governance;e-government;hyperlink;interaction;social media;social network analysis	Gohar Feroz Khan;Ho Young Yoon;Jiyoung Kim;Han Woo Park	2014	Online Information Review	10.1108/OIR-09-2012-0162	social media;social media optimization;computer science;law;world wide web;government	HCI	-80.83243532250539	-17.16092879843679	82208

Particularly, we approach narcissism as a two-dimensional construct—vulnerable and grandiose narcissism—to provide a better understanding of the role of narcissism in SNS usage. As one of the first studies to apply a two-dimensional approach to narcissism in computer-mediated communication, our results show that vulnerable narcissism has a significant positive effect on behavioral intention to control privacy on SNS, while grandiose narcissism has no effect. This effect was found when considering other personality traits, including self-esteem, computer anxiety, and concern for information privacy. The results indicate that unidimensional approaches to narcissism cannot solely predict SNS behaviors, and the construct of narcissism should be broken down into two orthogonal constructs. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

7ded83975924e9370c4c79b3e6c9309d68d50883	disclosing or protecting? teenagers' online self-disclosure		In the past decade there has been an enormous growth in the number of households using information and communication technologies.1 Also children and teenagers take part in this growing wired population. In Belgium, approximately 96% of 12to 18-year-olds uses the Internet regularly, most of them accessing the Internet at home (92.8%) or at school (62.6%).2 Parents often encourage their children to use the Internet, since they believe it assists them in developing valuable skills for education and future position in the labour market. An American study shows that a majority of parents (54%) considers the Internet as having a more positive influence on children than television.3 Following the recognition by the end of the nineties that the Internet could be used for commercial purposes, there has been a steep increase in commercially fuelled websites destined for children. Parallel with this growth, also the number of online advertisements targeting young people has exploded. Approximately two out of three of child-targeting websites has advertising as backbone of revenues.4	internet backbone;online advertising;population	Michel Walrave;Wannes Heirman	2011		10.1007/978-94-007-0641-5_14	social psychology	Metrics	-84.8697294129561	-23.05609086342871	82336

The moderating effects of gender on the observed relationships were also examined. An exploratory study of students in Serbia (N?=?485) revealed that: 1. Students in Serbia spend a daily average of 2.76?h on Facebook, while the average total daily smart phone use is 8:34?h 2. Facebook and smart phone use has no decisive influence on the allocation of time for leisure activities and college adjustment. 3. Facebook and smart phone use still has a certain positive effect on leisure activities, but this influence can become slightly negative if Facebook and smart phones are used too much. 4. In cases of a lack of time, students are more likely to sacrifice academic work, rather than time for Facebook, smart phones, or leisure activities. 5. The moderating effects of students' gender on the observed relationships are weakly expressed. Finally, Facebook and smart phone use has become a common and integral part of life for the majority of Serbian students, and the time for these activities is integrated into their overall time. Presented are the results of the influence of Facebook and smart phone usage.The questionnaires were completed by 485 students.Facebook and smart phone use has no decisive influence o leisure activities.Slightly negative influence if Facebook and smart phones are used too much.Sacrificing academic work, rather than time for Facebook.	smartphone	Branka Jankovic;Milan Nikolic;Jelena Vukonjanski;Edit Terek	2016	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2015.09.022	simulation;multimedia	HCI	-86.1726802423592	-22.533845134571653	82434

However, due to their short history, they are only just beginning to be systematically investigated. In an attempt to shed more light on the MOOC phenomenon, this study complements other approaches by eliciting institutional attitudes to MOOC provision using qualitative content analysis on responses captured in a series of semi-structured interviews with participants who hold senior positions in universities and who are involved in creating institutional policy and/or the design and delivery of MOOCs. A context for these interviews was created by looking at MOOCs from historical, pedagogical, monetary and technological perspectives. Five topics emerged that were subsequently used as common points of reference for comparisons across the interviews: motivation, monetization, pedagogy, traditional universities and public access to higher education. The analysis of attitudes to, and the importance of, these topics are summarized, and also illustrated through quotes from the participants. Interestingly, it does not appear that MOOCs are regarded by insiders as disruptive as the media presents them, but rather are seen primarily as marketing vehicles for global education brands.

However, it is unknown what factors may drive new consumers to continuously do mobile shopping without further promotional incentives. Motivated by the theoretical gap and practical salience of this question, in this study we propose a research model based on coping theory that highlights the critical role of active coping in handling mobile shopping procedures, and further identifies important dispositional traits of consumers and situation-specific factors that are either beneficial or harmful to their coping efforts. We recruited participants for a real mobile shopping task and collected pre-task and post-task survey data to test the research hypotheses. The results reveal important factors that are influential to consumers’ continued use of mobile shopping through a coping mechanism, which contributes to deepening the understanding of user behavior in mobile shopping both from an academic perspective and in practice.	mobile commerce;mobile payment;purchasing	Xue Yang;Yan Li;Qinyu Liao	2016	Electronic Commerce Research	10.1007/s10660-016-9224-9	marketing;advertising	HCI	-87.11081801159477	-12.56555235431355	82927

Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on the analysis of 944 answers provided to the questions about global warming in Yahoo! Answers. The answers were analysed by means of descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. Findings – Twelve rhetorical strategies serving the ends of classic rhetorical appeals, i.e. ethos, pathos and logos, were identified. The answerers drew most frequently on strategies related to logos (for example, appeal to reason) and ethos (for example, appeal to authority), while the strategies serving the ends of pathos (for example, argument ad hominem) were less popular. To support the rhetorical strategies, the answerers mainly used scientific sources such as websites of research organizations and persuasive material like Youtube videos. Research limitations/implications – The findings are based on the analysis of a Q&A site focusing on a controversial issue providing fertile ground for the use of rhetorical arguments. Practical implications – The findings can be used in information literacy instruction. It would be easier for the users to evaluate the relevance and credibility of information if they become aware of the specific ways in which askers and answerers on Q&A sites make use of persuasive communication. Originality/value – The study is unique in that it elaborates the ways in which rhetorical strategies are employed as ways of persuasive communication in Q&A discussion.	blog;digital rhetoric;ecology;email;focus group;futures studies;information literacy;information science;information seeking;information source;interactive media;interactivity;list of information schools;nl (complexity);relevance;social media;source-to-source compiler;user-generated content;yahoo! answers	Reijo Savolainen	2014	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/JD-11-2012-0152	rhetorical question;library science;social science;rhetoric;epistemology;linguistics;sociology;social psychology;world wide web;rhetorical device	HCI	-82.537366876439	-15.950862109382754	83254

Recent evidence indicates that social network use (e.g., Facebook) can serve as a chronic stressor to some users and contribute to poor health, however, mechanisms underlying these interactions remain unclear. In the current study we investigated if Facebook user behavior might help start to explain interactions between Facebook use, stress and health. In this prospective study, healthy college students completed online questionnaires assessing Facebook use, health and then were followed for 10 weeks to track incidence of upper respiratory infection (URI). Subjects who reported that Facebook provoked anxiety/stress demonstrated a significantly higher number of URI than those not reporting Facebook-induced anxiety/stress and having more Facebook friends was associated with increased anxiety/stress and the number of URI. Users who demonstrated anxiety regarding their Facebook use were more likely to demonstrate a pattern of increased number of log-ins to Facebook/day and these anxiety-linked behavior patterns were associated with poorer health. The other health practices and psychological processes assessed (e.g., physical activity levels, sleep, social support) do not appear to explain these associations. These results suggest an association between specific Facebook use, psychological anxiety and health might exist.

Based on bibliometric data, we demonstrate that the share of DM-related research articles in all published academic papers has increased substantially over the last two decades. We develop an ordinal categorization of countries according to essential aspects of the copyright system affecting the costs and benefits of DM research. We demonstrate that countries in which data mining for academic research requires the express consent of rights holders, data mining makes up a significantly smaller share of total research output. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an empirical study identified a significant negative association between copyright protection and innovation. We also show that within countries where DM requires express consent by rights holders, there is an inverse relationship between rule of law indicators and the share of DM related articles in all research articles.

This paper investigates the perceptions and attitudes of librarians towards social media as a tool for libraries; and explores the way librarians utilize social media to portray professional roles and responsibilities to young patrons. This author focuses on the pastoral role of librarians and discusses possibilities for performing this role through social media. Although presently under-researched, social media provides librarians with one more avenue to advocate for, engage with and support young adults. RUNNING HEAD: FACEBOOKING IT 4 Introduction With social media a normal part of the everyday lives of young adults, libraries have begun to use online tools to promote library services to this age group. According to a study released by the Pew Research Center (2013), 67% of young adults visit social networking sites daily with an additional 21% visiting weekly. These sites provide librarians with an avenue to engage with young adult patrons regularly and in ways have not been possible before. With a multitude of social networking sites already in existence, it is essential that librarians, particularly those serving young adults, understand how to use these sites to reach young adults. A quote from a recent report produced by Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) illustrates this need distinctly, “Clearly, if all libraries serving teens want to more effectively serve today’s ‘connected’ teens and demonstrate value to the community, they must ramp up engagement in areas beyond academic or formal learning” (Braun, Hartman, Hughes-Hassell, Kumasi, and Yoke 2014 6). Social media provide librarians with one possibility to engage with young adults in a way that is not rigidly focused on education. Social networking sites are defined as online services that permits individuals to create a public or semi-public profile within an enclosed system, identify a list of other users with whom they would like to connect, and view and navigate this list of users and lists created by other users within the system (boyd and Ellison 2007). The formats of social networking sites vary; from the imagefocused micro-blogging site Tumblr to the largely text-based micro-blogging tool Twitter. Typically, users of these sites are not socializing with strangers but with RUNNING HEAD: FACEBOOKING IT 5 “real life” friends, family members, classmates, and colleagues (boyd and Ellison 2007). Libraries and librarians exist within the daily lives of young adult patrons. Yet, library and information studies (LIS) literature offers little regarding how social media can be used to promote the roles libraries and librarians play in the lives of young adults. The sheer number of these sites, along with frequently changing interfaces and features, often leaves librarians confused and reluctant to incorporate social media into their existing collection of marketing tools (Carlsson 2012). However, social media provides librarians, and young adult librarians in particular, with an inexpensive and innovative avenue to advocate for libraries, engage with young adults, and present less obvious services librarians to young adults (e.g. library as a safe space, social/emotional/psychological support, mentoring). For the purposes of this study, young adults are defined as youth between the ages of 12 and 18. This paper presents the findings of an exploratory study investigating how librarians use social media to engage with young adult patrons and what roles librarians perceive social media as providing for promoting library services. One role focused on in particular is pastoral care. While the term “pastoral care” may be new to LIS, this describes a role that librarians have long filled (Cesari 2014; Jones 2008; Miller and Wallis 2011). In the context of libraries, pastoral care describes the social, emotional, and psychological support librarians provide patrons, primarily children and young adults.	blog;e-services;jones calculus;librarian;library (computing);library and information science;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;real life;semiconductor industry;social media;socialization;text-based (computing);young adult library services	Abigail L.

57dc06a677057e6ce067920d6876f256d0ea47dd	reviewing social media use by clinicians		Adoption studies of social media use by clinicians were systematically reviewed, up to July 26th, 2011, to determine the extent of adoption and highlight trends in institutional responses. This search led to 370 articles, of which 50 were selected for review, including 15 adoption surveys. The definition of social media is evolving rapidly; the authors define it broadly to include social networks and group-curated reference sites such as Wikipedia. Facebook accounts are very common among health science students (64-96%) and less so for professional clinicians (13-47%). Adoption rates have increased sharply in the past 4 years. Wikipedia is widely used as a reference tool. Attempts at incorporating social media into clinical training have met with mixed success. Posting of unprofessional content and breaches of patient confidentiality, especially by students, are not uncommon and have prompted calls for social media guidelines.	am broadcasting;awareness;confidentiality;nomenclature;requirement;review [publication type];social media;social network;wikipedia	Marcio von Muhlen;Lucila Ohno-Machado	2012		10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000990	medicine;data mining;multimedia	HCI	-80.37222824107353	-19.704460698828658	84024

It may be observed as a paradigm shift in business (Wigand, et al., 2008). It has affected e-commerce, resulting in the emergence of a new concept known as social commerce. This has also led to changes within many business plans in online markets. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) the author analyses some of the components of social commerce which affect the intention to buy among individuals by proposing and testing Social Commerce Adoption Model (SCAM). Most research undertaken in the area of social commerce has been descriptive and lacks a solid theoretical foundation. This research gathers survey data and applies structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the data. Participation on forums and communities and perceived usefulness are shown to positively impact the trust, leading to more intention to buy among consumers.	blog;e-commerce;emergence;ibm tivoli access manager;online shopping;programming paradigm;social commerce;social media;social network;structural equation modeling;utility;web 2.0;yang	Mahmood Hajli	2012			marketing;business;commerce	AI	-87.1745712784063	-10.871545911289834	84124

Despite being criticised for their supposed simplistic and exploitative nature, social network games have created a new game phenomenon, and have demanded a rethinking in the very meaning of social play. Through both empirical analysis of the Facebook game The Sims Social and participant observation of communities of players in Facebook, the paper discusses how social interactions performed within and around the game transform play in a complex articulation of cooperative and transgressive practices, and what implications it might have for the business model underlying social network games at large.	social network	Suen de Andrade e Silva	2013	First Monday		social environment;social relation;social learning;social competence;social engagement;game mechanics;social change;advertising;social;social psychology;social computing;social network	ECom	-84.0781135049197	-16.02357202403256	84252
e959b0c331664b96b6a1a64c0011d3310af8f8f3	the role of technology and social media in tacit knowledge sharing		Technology-mediated knowledge sharing has become almost unavoidable given the globalization of work. Co-workers are not necessarily in close enough proximity to have face-to-face interactions despite the fact that these are the most effective means of sharing knowledge. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) differ in a number of key attributes. While traditional technologies are well suited for sharing explicit knowledge, that has been articulated and documented as text or other media, tacit knowledge is more challenging. Tacit knowledge is typically experiential knowledge that is very difficult to put into words or document in any way. This paper proposes an ICT selection method based primarily on media richness (extent to which multimedia content can be shared) and social presence (extent to which people feel they are connecting with other people and not technology). These characteristics can serve as a preliminary basis to select the most appropriate channel for sharing tacit knowledge.

Focus is on users of websites, blogs and forums on eating disorders, often dubbed 'pro-ana' and 'pro-mia'. Despite widespread fears that they contribute to maintaining and spreading these disorders, these sites may also channel mutual assistance, advice, and psychological and emotional support, with ultimate benefits for health.We use data from an online survey of users of French- and English-language ‘ana-mia’ websites, providing information on the composition and structure of their personal networks both online and face-to-face, and their health-related support networks, for two types of health issues. We find that different health-related needs call for different types of support, which can be accessed from different parts of one’s personal network; specifically, online groups provide distinctive sources of help. To an extent, participation in web-based eating disorder communities compensates for perceived shortcomings in healthcare services, though members do not overwhelmingly reject standard health systems and norms. Web-based groups thus appear as an important element in the understanding of social support, and a potential resource for enhanced public health services provision.

Especially, how counting methods influence institutional level research evaluation has not been studied in existing literatures. In this study, we selected the top 300 universities in physics in the 2011 HEEACT Ranking as our study subjects. We compared the university rankings generated from four different counting methods (i.e. whole counting, straight counting using first author, straight counting using corresponding author, and fractional counting) to show how paper counts and citation counts and the subsequent university ranks were affected by counting method selection. The counting was based on the 1988–2008 physics papers records indexed in ISI WoS. We also observed how paper and citation counts were inflated by whole counting. The results show that counting methods affected the universities in the middle range more than those in the upper or lower ranges. Citation counts were also more affected than paper counts. The correlation between the rankings generated from whole counting and those from the other methods were low or negative in the middle ranges. Based on the findings, this study concluded that straight counting and fractional counting were better choices for paper count and citation count in the institutional level research evaluation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study examined web customers’ salient beliefs and the role of web-design elements in altering customers’ existing beliefs after their exposure to an e-commerce web site. Using salient beliefs and categories of web-design elements identified previously, we developed a conceptual model of belief revisions due to exposure to web-design elements and internal cues. The empirical analysis of the model indicated that web customers were influenced by the external cues from the design factors as well as the internal ones from their prior beliefs.

Synthesizing findings from several previous research studies of digital volunteerism, this paper offers a new approach for conceptualizing the activities of digital volunteers, shifting from a focus on organizing to a focus on information movement. Using the lens of distributed cognition, this research describes collective intelligence as transformations of information within a system where cognition is distributed socially across individuals as well as through their tools and resources. This paper demonstrates how digital volunteers, through activities such as relaying, amplifying, verifying, and structuring information, function as a collectively intelligent cognitive system in the wake of disaster events.	artificial intelligence;collective intelligence;distributed cognition;information processing;organizing (structure);verification and validation	Kate Starbird	2013		10.1145/2470654.2470769	simulation;socially distributed cognition;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;collective intelligence;management;world wide web;crowdsourcing	HCI	-78.92832456658978	-15.394737896481706	85045

These regulations mandate that if an airline website is inaccessible for persons with disabilities, the airline must charge the same price that is available on the website and may not charge a fee for purchasing tickets over the phone. To evaluate compliance, the websites of leading airlines were examined for accessibility in terms of the ability to check flight schedules and order tickets. Among the four airlines with barriers to accessibility on their websites, a series of phone calls were made by researchers to assess whether the DOT regulations would be followed. Two of the airlines, USAirways and United, practiced discriminatory pricing, even after being made aware of the regulations, in over one-third of the phone calls. This paper details the findings from the study and analyzes the data in terms of website accessibility, civil rights for travelers with disabilities, and policy implications.	accessibility;airport security;assistive technology;experience;interaction;requirement	Jonathan Lazar;Paul T.

Results from a crowd-sourcing experiment, showed a wide variety of factors affected credibility perception, including a tweet author’s gender, profile image, username style, location, and social network overlap with the reader. We found that culture determines readers’ credibility perception, but country has no effect. We discuss the implications of our findings for user interface design and social media systems.

We consider posts from a variety of newsgroups which indicate that individuals feel they have nowhere else to go to find information or support for concerns crucial to their everyday lives. A qualitative content analysis is performed to examine three main issues: what information needs people posting to these groups have, who they hide these needs from in the ‘real world’, and why they feel they can only express their needs online. Preliminary findings show that information on health and relationships is most commonly sought. Needs are most often hidden from parents and family, and the main reasons for seeking information online are a lack of understanding and the fact that people simply don’t know where else to go. Our work confirms that newsgroups provide a means of expression for those who feel they have no local support available to them.	code;distrust;experience;focus group;goto;information needs;internet;social media;usenet;while	Laura Hasler;Ian Ruthven	2011			poverty;the internet;simulation;information;computer science;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-85.12399497342915	-20.621972106277052	85709

One approach to motivate participation is via games. That is, a crowdsourcing game is built upon the desire of individuals to be entertained while generating useful outputs as byproducts of gameplay. A gap in current research is that actual usage patterns of crowdsourcing games have not been investigated adequately. We address this gap by comparing content creation patterns in a game for crowdsourcing mobile content against a non-game version. Our analysis of 3024 contributions in both apps reveal 10 categories, divided into: (1) those that conform more to the notion of mobile content utilized to learn about a specific place or for navigational purposes; and (2) those that were about the content creator himself/herself, or in relation to other users or other non-playing individuals, with the location as a backdrop, similar to status updates in social media platforms like Twitter. We argue that both categories are potentially useful in that they meet different needs, and together could serve to recruit and sustain participation in the longer term. Further, the distribution of categories varied across the apps, indicating that the features afforded by games shape behavior differently from non-game-based approaches to crowdsourcing.	crowdsourcing	Dion Hoe-Lian Goh;Ei Pa Pa Pe-Than;Chei Sian Lee	2016		10.1002/pra2.2016.14505301061	computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-84.81963346331571	-17.12684889111104	85824

SIdM refers to the deliberate and targeted disclosure of personal information to a subset of one's contacts on OSN. Yet, unlike the physical world, SIdM on OSN is compromised by unavailable or insufficient settings as well as by properties of mediated communication (e.g. persistence). In this paper, we employ a novel approach based on the participants' Facebook profiles content to study privacy settings in OSN. Our results indicate a mismatch between perceived, preferred, and actual settings that can be reduced to lack of awareness and control by the user.	identity management;interaction;persistence (computer science);personally identifiable information;privacy;stemming	Michael Netter;Moritz Riesner;Michael Weber;Günther Pernul	2013	2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2013.455	public relations;privacy software;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web	DB	-89.7923516927719	-15.871072743288412	86293
1f54b0778c510d111080a1198720290655574ca9	internet relationships: people who meet people		Current research suggests that the Internet has become a popular medium for forming interpersonal relationships. Not only are many people developing cyberfriendships, but some move beyond virtual communication and interact more directly through telephone contact and face-to-face encounters. This pilot study examined the personality characteristics of 30 participants (17 men and 13 women) who were regular Internet users and who had used the Internet to meet people mainly through chat rooms. The findings of this study suggest that people who use the Internet meet others tend to be truthful in general in their interactions although both men and women often did not reveal their true names. Eighty percent of the subjects formed casual or friendly relationships, whereas 6% formed intimate or romantic relationships. Approximately one-third of the subjects made some form of offline contact, with 40% talking on the telephone and 33.3% meeting face-to-face. Furthermore, examination of personality styles indicated that cyberfriends tend to be socially skilled, have strong verbal skills, and demonstrate empathy for others. Most subjects were careful about protecting their anonymity, and none of the subjects who met face-to-face did so without first talking on the phone. This suggests that individuals who make friends via the Internet tend to take appropriate precautions and find this medium an effective and safe way to interact with others and to expand one's social system.	cns disorder;chat room;empathy;interaction;internet relationship;name;online and offline;social system;speech;true names	Judy A.

There are two types of players in the Innovation Game, innovators and consumers. While the innovators think up ideas and propose them to the consumers, the consumers criticize the ideas and make decisions whether they buy the ideas or not. In the Innovation Games, the innovators do not only propose their ideas to the consumers, but also improve the ideas using consumer’s comments that represent negative impression to the ideas. Therefore, it is considered that ideas with social creativity are related to the negative comments from the consumers. However, the relation between them has not been cleared. In this paper, we analyze discourse texts of communication generating social creativity. The analysis method focuses on the negative comments obtained from the consumers. We analyzed discourse texts of the Innovation Game using the method, and it was verified that the more negative comments the innovators accept, the more ideas with social creativity are obtained.

We describe the findings from 12 co-design workshops with 28 people from the UK representing a range of older people with and without health conditions, users of ALT and carers for people using such devices. The workshops were conducted to explore issues related to finding reliable information about ALT with the goal of gathering requirements for the design of a peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform. Our analysis highlights how a current reliance on peers and informal networks relates to a desire to establish the authenticity and relatability of another person's experience to one's own circumstances. This connects to a perceived mistrust in information where provenance and authenticity is not clear. We use these to critique the wisdom of taking an e-marketplace and recommendation service approach to ALT provision and assessment, and offer alternatives based on our findings.	distrust;e-commerce;peer-to-peer;requirement	John Vines;Peter C.

Social shopping communities, representing a special form of social media, have offered fertile ground for members to communicate their opinions and exchange product information. The goal of our paper is to understand this new business model of social shopping communities and investigate why members voluntarily share information on social shopping communities. We integrate theories of collective action and social capital theory to construct a research model for investigating the motivations behind members’ posting behavior. By analyzing panel data collected from a social shopping community, we found that members posting behavior is determined by reputation, enjoyment of helping, network centrality, member expertise, as well as reciprocity. The results of this study provide important implications for both research and practice.		Ivy L. B. Liu;Christy M. K. Cheung;Matthew K. O. Lee	2012				HCI	-87.36040154007037	-13.64689138199647	87289
f3f27399f42b6f1f8e2860ac84890804f2fb9c33	knowledge seeking and knowledge sharing in a nonprofit organizational partner network: a social network analysis		This research empirically examines the online social network of a national, non-profit organization which we refer to as the national alliance to reduce violence (NARV), an organization designed to bridge the gap between non-profit organizations across the US which address the issue of interpersonal violence. As a network of practice, knowledge shared by the nonprofit organizations originates across a breadth of experts in the disciplines of advocacy, science, practice and policy. Two problems served as the motivation for this research. First, how does the online network structure support current knowledge contribution and knowledge retrieval within the network? Second, how could the online network structure enhance knowledge contribution and knowledge retrieval to meet the needs of the organization? We acquired network structure and knowledge sharing data through the collection of survey responses from NARV‟s membership list. The data were analyzed as a two-mode affiliation network using UCINET, a popular application for social network analysis. For the first research question, we found that the action groups of research and public awareness are positioned to be strong sources of knowledge contribution within the current network due to the number of nodes with whom they are connected. For the second research question, we identified training and mentoring as the action group from which other nodes desire knowledge.	regular expression;social network analysis	Connie S.

A close reading of the Facebook game FrontierVille aims to provide some starting points for the study of social games. The paper starts by outlining the rationale behind the economy based on virtual object sales and examines how also the non-paying players are affected by the system. Second, the paper considers the different forms and functions of sociability present within FrontierVille. Finally, the study explicates how FrontierVille both allows flexible playing patterns and actively builds particular rhythms of play. All in all, the paper argues that design, economics and playing of social games are tightly interconnected and should be studied in relation to each other.	design rationale;social network game	Heikki Tyni;Olli Sotamaa;Saara Toivonen	2011		10.1145/2181037.2181042	psychology;simulation;game mechanics;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-84.06441797884686	-15.753989447377789	87355

With the popularity of mobile Internet, private information of users is easily accessed. Appropriate access to users’ information can help enterprises understand consumers’ demand better and improve marketing effectiveness. However, grabbing users’ information excessively may increase the costs of enterprises and induce the privacy leakage, which causes users’ dissatisfaction. Recently, events of privacy leakage based on the mobile Internet are frequently exposed in China. It triggers much attention and results in great social impact. From the perspective of mobile Internet users, the concept of privacy leakage tolerance is put forward to describe users’ acceptance of privacy leakage. Based on the description and dimensions of privacy leakage tolerance, a three-dimension and second-order privacy leakage tolerance measurement scale is designed and will be verified. We believe that the scale has good reliability and validity for the measurement of privacy leakage tolerance on the mobile Internet and data show users’ attitude to privacy leakage exactly. The measurement of privacy leakage tolerance on the mobile Internet has important significance both in business practices and theory studies. It is conducive for mobile Internet enterprises to collect users’ information appropriately and to protect users’ privacy with target, which makes contribution to optimizing information allocation and to exerting the economic value of information. Moreover, it provides a new concept to describe users’ privacy attitude and it is helpful to analyze users’ privacy behaviors and to explain the privacy paradox1.	internet privacy;norm (social);personally identifiable information;spectral leakage	Rui Li;Wenli Li;Shidao Geng;Yulin An	2014			privacy software;internet privacy;computer security;computer network	Metrics	-88.01987274435267	-10.702799482959104	87384

Drawing upon interviews with community members and digital traces from multiple platforms, we explore how affected locals, government responders and journalists utilized a broad range of social media in their work-assembling different platforms to meet the information needs of their audiences. We borrow the analytical lens of stitching suggested by Vertesi, which allows us to see where these infrastructural alignments are seamless vs. seamful-highlighting some of the emergent and persistent challenges for those responding to disasters with and through social media. We demonstrate how this work is extremely dynamic, as the technical affordances of these platforms and the evolving practices of users shape how crisis communication occurs. Simultaneously, the pervasive and in some places institutionalized use of these platforms across a wide range of local actors suggests they are performing as critical infrastructure during crisis response. This raises questions of what it means to have so much local crisis information work occurring through platforms that mediate from a distance.	critical infrastructure protection;digital footprint;emergence;image stitching;information needs;pervasive informatics;seamless3d;situated;social media;tracing (software)	Dharma Dailey;Kate Starbird	2017		10.1145/2998181.2998290	social science;simulation;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;communication;management;social psychology;world wide web;computer security;social computing	HCI	-79.40835493498047	-13.108512005115575	87522

Specifically, we propose that the relationship between perceived congruence of communication and service quality is mediated by a self-perceived performance. The data was collected from 186 customer-contact subordinates in hotels, banks and restaurants in Kyrgyzstan. To test the direct and mediated effect, structural equation modeling techniques were applied. We found that self-perceived performance mediates the relationship between the perceived congruence of communication and service quality.	dns-based authentication of named entities;mediation (statistics);perceived performance;quality of service;structural equation modeling;zeller's congruence	Mehmet Ferhat Özbek;Davran Yuldashev	2010	JoSS	10.1007/s12927-010-0007-x	structural equation modeling;knowledge management	HCI	-91.44966513501754	-11.139200165027045	87605

The present study aimed to test whether the relationship between Internet gambling and gambling problems persisted when including variables related to gambling involvement as predictors, namely time spent gambling and diversity of gambling formats. Data from a large sample of French adolescents (n = 9910) were used. Associations between disordered gambling/money spent gambling with Internet gambling were performed using generalized linear models, not controlling and controlling for diversity of gambling formats and time spent gambling. The results showed that Internet gamblers had significantly more problems than land-based gamblers. The relationship decreased when diversity of gambling formats and time spent gambling were controlled separately, and became non-significant when they were both included in the model. To conclude, time spent gambling and diversity of gambling formats rather than Internet gambling should be considered a detrimental gambling behavior. They seemed to capture different aspects of gambling patterns. This study was a step forward in changing the conceptual model of problem gambling, with gambling involvement as a main variable.

Feedback is often presented as ratings and textual comments. We evaluate comments and existing orders as drivers of how consumers' perceived risk and trust change. Our experimental results indicate that comments affect these two things, but the number of existing orders only impacts perceived trust. In addition, a consumer's intention to join a group-buying auction is impacted by both the perceived risk and trust. We develop additional results that refine our understanding of the value of comments and why they cannot be replaced by ratings.	feedback;internet	Robert J.

We utilized more than 170,000 online chat sessions between customers and agents to identify characteristics of chat sessions that incurred dissatisfying experience. Quantitative data analysis suggests that sentiments or moods conveyed in online conversation are the most predictive factor of perceived satisfaction. Conversely, other session related meta data (such as that length, time of day, and response time) has a weaker correlation with user satisfaction. Knowing in advance what can predict satisfaction allows customer service staffs to identify potential weaknesses and improve the quality of service for better customer experience.	level of measurement;online chat;quality of service;response time (technology)	Kunwoo Park;Jaewoo Kim;Jaram Park;Meeyoung Cha;Jiin Nam;Seunghyun Yoon;Eunhee Rhim	2015		10.1145/2806416.2806621	customer to customer;voice of the customer;computer science;marketing;attitudinal analytics;customer delight;customer intelligence;advertising;customer satisfaction;customer retention;world wide web;service quality;sentiment analysis;conversion marketing;customer advocacy	Web+IR	-88.94746381624594	-13.648351874997177	88484

A few researchers have further suggested website preferences based on gender (i.e. whether one is a man or a woman) differ in countries that are typically considered higher in masculinity versus higher in femininity. As such, this supposes fewer differences exist between men and women in more feminin e societies, while more significant differences occur in more masculine societies. To test this assumpt ion, we survey a total of 955 participants located in six countries. More particularly, we examine design constructs of Information Content, Navigation Design, Visual Design modeled to Website Trust and Website Satisfaction. We are interested to determine if gender differences are strong in higher masculinity countries and weak in lower masculinity countries. We also investigate if gender moderates the various relation ships in our model. As predicted, in higher masculinity countries there are more differences between men and women, and gender is more likely to modera te the relationships in the model. This research has implications for the comp lexity of website design preferences, and extends earlier work on website design in a multiple countr y sample where masculinity –femininity differs.

A literature search and analysis was conducted to address this deficiency. First, overviews, reviews, and meta-analyses were analysed to extract an initial set of dimensions to characterise expository animations. Next, a representative set of descriptions of expository animations used in past research on learning from animation was retrieved from the research literature. The animations employed in the 44 investigations analysed covered 30 different topics in 14 different domains. The characterisation developed distinguishes attributes that are inherent characteristics of animations from attributes that are external supplements to animations. The potential advantages of the characterisation developed as a framework for future research on learning from animation are discussed. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our model demonstrates that such data can be used to reveal aspects of the identities players express by their social networking profile information. We tested our model on players of the multiplayer first-person shooter videogame Team Fortress 2. It was able to significantly explain the variances of the players’ number of friends (35.1%), number of uploaded screenshots (49.6%), and number of uploaded videos (39.2%) of their profiles on the gaming social network Steam. Our results revealed several findings, such as criteria indicating how players customized avatars differently according to notions of aesthetics and practicality, and how these notions contributed to predicting their number of friends on their social networking profiles. Responses evaluated from a conducted survey reaffirmed several of these findings.	avatar (computing);computation;data mining;polystation;privacy;screenshot;social network;stealth;steam;team fortress 2;upload;virtual world	Chong-U Lim;D.

This raises privacy concerns for consumers. While internet privacy is not a new issue, there has been little attention to the concerns of consumers from developing countries. Further, individuals may perceive targeted advertisements differently depending on their social backgrounds. In this research-in-progress, we examine the phenomenon of Internet Privacy Concerns (IPC) among Saudi SNS users. Inspired by family systems theory (FST), we will explore the impact of two societal factors – family cohesion and social ties – on IPC and self-disclosure in different SNS contexts (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram).	big data;google sites;instagram;internet privacy;systems theory	Tawfiq Alashoor;Mark Keil;Mazen Shawosh	2015			geography;environmental protection;environmental resource management;internet privacy	Security	-86.34485268947188	-14.48222505722333	89006

Electronic mail, for instance, filters out personal and social cues and provides new capabilities not found in traditional media, and it has been argued that these factors have consequences such as “flaming” and depersonalization. Alternative theoretical perspectives on the impacts of information technology suggest that our ability to explain these outcomes might be enhanced by attending to users' intentional choices about how to use technology and to unpredictable technology usage patterns that emerge when users interact with the technology and each other. These alternative perspectives are examined in the context of an exploratory case study of a complex organization in which electronic mail was heavily used. Users were found to select email deliberately when they wished to avoid unwanted social interactions. At the same time, they actively took steps to avoid negative outcomes, such as depersonalization of their relationships with subordinates. However, despite their well-intentioned efforts, some negative social effects did occur that cannot entirely be attributed to the technological characteristics of electronic communication. Instead, they appear to be ironic side effects of users' thoughtful efforts to use email effectively. These results suggest the value of according a prominent role in explanations of technology impacts to users' intended and unintended technology uses. The results also imply that negative social effects from using electronic communication technology may not prove easy to eradicate, despite technological developments such as multimedia integration, and despite efforts to train users in the best email “etiquette.”	email;flaming (internet);http 404;interaction	M.

The analysis indicates that there is a distinction between possible actions with an opponent having bad reputations. That is, cooperative action with opponents that have bad reputations is less favorable than cooperative action with someone with an average reputation, and defection against opponents that have bad reputations is more favorable than defection against someone with an average one. Evaluation of actor with opponents that have bad reputation are found to depend on two evaluation factors, intimacy and social desirableness, because evaluation words extracted from the respondents’ questionnaires could be classified with these two dimensions. This finding indicates that the norm of reputation making is more complex than the intuitive one-dimensional mechanism.	reputation;web application	Takahisa Suzuki;Tetsuro Kobayashi	2010	2010 10th IEEE/IPSJ International Symposium on Applications and the Internet	10.1109/SAINT.2010.45	two-dimensional space;the internet;reputation;informatics;law;world wide web;computer security	NLP	-85.51559107935574	-18.78069271897851	89654

Technical challenges successfully overcome by the project include non-uniformity of manuscript files and metadata formats, embargo management, and author authentication for repository deposit. Three areas of research investigating (i) author and reader attitudes and behaviours, (ii) article-level usage at repositories and publisher platforms, and (iii) the economics of large-scale archiving have been commissioned and are producing results. The baseline behavioural survey identified an increasing general awareness of open access, but a lower awareness of institutional and subject repositories. Perceptions were also found to vary depending on whether individuals were responding from an author or reader perspective. PEER itself has seen low uptake from authors when invited to self-deposit into the project.

We propose Maater, which counteracts these issues by leveraging crowdsourced corrections and fact checking to help other readers engaged with a particular article better understand it. The system incorporates user-generated in-line commentary and corrections, which are vetted by other readers through a ranking system. Highly ranked comments gain more social value and are prominently displayed. This provides corrections with greater prominence than they are given by news outlets.	crowdsourcing;digital journalism;internet;user-generated content;value (ethics)	Raymond Liaw;Ari Zilnik;Mark Baldwin;Stephanie Butler	2013		10.1145/2468356.2468828	computer science;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;crowdsourcing	Web+IR	-85.16389844710636	-17.696105461934238	90247

While the former counts citations, the latter recursively weights them with the prestige of the citing journals. We make a thorough comparison of the bibliometric concepts of popularity and prestige for journals in the sciences and in the social sciences. We find that the two notions diverge more for the hard sciences, including physics, engineering, material sciences, and computer sciences, than they do for the geosciences, for biology-medical disciplines, and for the social sciences. Moreover, we identify the science and social science journals with the highest diverging ranks in popularity and prestige compilations.	bibliometrics;computer science;recursion	Massimo Franceschet	2010	J.

The psycho-sociological background of an individual plays a crucial role in determining his/her vulnerability of being lured into joining the organisation and indulge in terrorist activities, since his/her behavior largely depends on the society s/he was brought up in. Here, we analyse five sociological aspects -- personality, values & ethics, optimism/pessimism, age and gender to understand the psycho-sociological vulnerability of individuals over Twitter. Experimental results suggest that psycho-sociological aspects indeed act as foundation to discover and differentiate between prominent and unobtrusive users in Twitter.	endeavour (supercomputer);hazard (computer architecture);isis;social media;unobtrusive javascript;vulnerability (computing)	Aishwarya N.

01bf22674726b3f242cb5730e14bafa8e69b5b32	online social capital: mood, topical and psycholinguistic analysis		Social media provides rich sources of personal information and community interaction which can be linked to aspect of mental health. In this paper we investigate manifest properties of textual messages, including latent topics, psycholinguistic features, and authors’ mood, of a large corpus of blog posts, to analyze the aspect of social capital in social media communities. Using data collected from Live Journal, we find that bloggers with lower social capital have fewer positive moods and more negative moods than those with higher social capital. It is also found that people with low social capital have more random mood swings over time than the people with high social capital. Significant differences are found between low and high social capital groups when characterized by a set of latent topics and psycholinguistic features derived from blogposts, suggesting discriminative features, proved to be useful for classification tasks. Good prediction is achieved when classifying among social capital groups using topic and linguistic features, with linguistic features are found to have greater predictive power than latent topics. The significance of our work lies in the importance of online social capital to potential construction of automatic healthcare monitoring systems. We further establish the link between mood and social capital in online communities, suggesting the foundation of new systems to monitor online mental well-being. Introduction The concept of social capital was introduced in sociology (Bourdieu 1986; Coleman 1988; Putnam 2000). Like other forms of capitals, social capital can be defined by the capacity of facilitating productive activity. In this view, physical capital and human capital can be determined through the value of tools/machines or skills/capabilities respectively (Coleman 1988); meanwhile, social capital is valued by the resources associated with interpersonal relations that facilitate actions (Coleman 1988). For example, (Coleman 1988) noted that a group with trustworthiness, a measure of social capital, has higher chance to accomplish than another without that. Similarly, (Bourdieu 1986) defined social capital as the actual or potential resources a network of relationship possesses. (Putnam 2000) further divided social capital into bonding and bridging based on whether emotional support is provided (bonding), e.g., between family members and close Copyright c © 2013, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. friends (strong ties), or not (bridging), e.g., among acquaintances (weak ties). Generally, social capital includes social inclusion, social participation and social support (VicHealth 2010). Social inclusion implies access for example, older people may have less physical access to social communities. Social participation describes how much a person engages with a community. And, social support implies how much support one can get from the community. The theory of social capital has been spread into several fields, including economics, education and health. For example, according to (Putnam 2001), joining a community might increase one’s social capital and subsequently reduce his chance of fatality in the next year by a half; (Coleman 1988) found that the value of social capital students gained from home and outside is positively correlated with the probability of dropping out of high school. In the age of the Internet, social media genres, such as blogs, social networking sites and forums, have become a popular venue for people to gather, emerging a new form of social capital – digital social capital. This concept has attracted considerable attention, such as investigations into the impact of the new media for the production of social capital (Beaudoin and Tao 2007; Shah, Kwak, and Holbert 2001; Wellman et al. 2001). Insights from such analysis have wide applications, from sociology where the web is viewed as a very large community sensor, to business where e-commerce is now the norm. This study examines a large corpus of blog posts to analyze the effect of online social capital a user potentially possess on mood, topics and psycholinguistic styles conveyed in the messages he creates. Continuing with the core components of social participation and support, we define two categories of LOW and HIGH social capital. We have 12 cohorts to study 2 categories of social capital (LOW and HIGH), and in each, 3 measures of social participation (number of communities joined, number of posts written and number of comments made) and 3 of social support (number of friends, number of comments received and number of followers). Using posts made by 60,000 users in Live Journal over 10 years, we explore across all measures of social participation and social support: (a) distribution of mood and mood swings over LOW and HIGH social capital; (b) distribution of latent topics of interest in LOW and HIGH social capital; and (c) distribution of psycholinguistic features exProceedings of the Seventh International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media	artificial intelligence;blog;bridging (networking);e-commerce;emoticon;internet;new media;online community;personally identifiable information;physical access;putnam model;social capital;social media;social support;text corpus;trust (emotion);venue (sound system);word lists by frequency	Thin Nguyen;Bo Dao;Dinh Q.

29163961a08d268e05847e6e6a193c35ee512018	exploring prestigious citations sourced from top universities across disciplines		There have been many studies on the factors influencing paper citation counts. A number of studies have focused on the citing papers, and corresponding methods were proposed to measure the prestige of citations based on the journal impact factors, the total citation counts and the PageRank algorithm values. However, there are drawbacks to these methods. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to identify prestigious citations from the affiliation of the citing paper. Specifically, if the authors of the citing paper are affiliated with a prestigious university, the citing paper could be counted as a prestigious citation. As a pilot, we used the top 200 universities on the QS World University Rankings 2015 to identify the prestigious universities so that the prestigious citations, named as QS citations, were identified accordingly. Experimental results validated that QS citations have more important impact on the cited papers than other citations. Papers with QS citations have better performance across most disciplines not only in total citation counts, but also in altmetrics such as the Altmetric Attension Score and Mendeley reader counts.	algorithm;altmetrics;experiment;futures studies;mendeley;pagerank	Feiheng Luo;Aixin Sun;Mojisola Erdt;Aravind Sesagiri Raamkumar;Yin Leng Theng	2017		10.1002/pra2.2017.14505401028	citation analysis;data science;geography;altmetrics	Web+IR	-77.47308327764779	-21.24039169426581	90754

Our empirical analysis used archival data from 1995 to 2005; it showed that ICT expansion in the Middle East has been effective both in bridging the digital divide and also in promoting economic freedom in a region that was vulnerable to political, social, and global conflict. However, differences between countries, such as the educational attainment of their citizens and institutional resistance to technology acceptance, both enhanced and restricted the relationship between ICT and economic freedom.

The Yule–Simon model and Lotka’s square law were applied to the publication data obtained from 2175 articles from 11 KM/IC journals. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the KM/IC discipline represents a very young, attractive academic field that welcomes contributions from a variety of academics and practitioners. In their paper acceptance decisions, KM/IC journal editors are not biased towards a small group of highly productive researchers, which is a positive sign that the field has been progressing in the right direction. The discipline is driven more by academics than by practitioners, and the distribution of articles is more concentrated among a few academic but not practitioner institutions. It was also observed that the Yule–Simon model and Lotka’s square law may produce different distributions with respect to institutions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A doctrinal paradox occurs when majority voting on a compound proposition (such as a conjunction or disjunction) yields a different result than majority voting on each of the elements of the proposition. For example, when most individuals accept proposition X ; most individuals accept proposition Y ; but only a minority of individuals accept the compound proposition ‘X and Y ’. Conducting two elemental votes would lead to accept X and Y , but conducting one compound vote would lead to reject X and Y . In such a situation, do people manifest a stable preference as to which voting procedure should be applied? This research reports the results of two behavioral experiments using a within-participant design, which show that procedural preferences can be upturned by framing either positively or negatively the set of judgments to be aggregated. This shift in procedural preference leads to large swings in the final collective judgment endorsed by participants.	elemental;experiment;framing (world wide web);paradox (database)	Jean-François Bonnefon	2010	Social Choice and Welfare	10.1007/s00355-009-0421-5	public relations;majority rule;economics;social psychology;framing effect;welfare economics	HCI	-89.29525214328515	-17.465802937175443	91485

The study attempts to bridge the two streams of research and to explain e-service customer post-adoption behaviors in a unified model from the perspectives of affective events theory. Findings support the proposed model positing that e-service customer retention behaviors were determined by perceived site quality and cognitive appraisal of incidents handling. Post-adoption behaviors investigated in the study include continuance intention, complaint intention, and recommendation intention.

The public accessibility of such networks with the ability to share opinions, thoughts, information, and experience offers great promise to enterprises and governments. In addition to individuals using such networks to connect to their friends and families, governments and enterprises have started exploiting these platforms for delivering their services to citizens and customers. However, the success of such attempts relies on the level of trust that members have with each other as well as with the service provider. Therefore, trust becomes an essential and important element of a successful social network. In this article, we present the first comprehensive review of social and computer science literature on trust in social networks. We first review the existing definitions of trust and define social trust in the context of social networks. We then discuss recent works addressing three aspects of social trust: trust information collection, trust evaluation, and trust dissemination. Finally, we compare and contrast the literature and identify areas for further research in social trust.	accessibility;computer science;social network	Wanita Sherchan;Surya Nepal;Cécile Paris	2013	ACM Comput.

American (N = 289) and Chinese college students (N = 227) first completed belief-based measures of attitudes and subjective norms of giving advice, and later completed measures of behavioral intentions of giving advice. Results revealed that there were similarities as well as noteworthy cultural differences with respect to ratings of the TRA components and strengths of associations between attitudes, subjective norms, and intentions. The TRA model showed relatively stronger prediction for giving advice intentions for Chinese than it did for Americans. A belief framework specified by the TRA demonstrated stronger power to capture finer cultural variations in giving advice as a form of support provision.	risk assessment;tomb raider: anniversary	Hairong Feng	2015	Communication Research	10.1177/0093650213486668	attitude;psychology;belief;advertising;social psychology	AI	-89.0362349493295	-17.51137734389823	92127

Accepts that computer mediated communication changes the nature of the interaction by removing bodily cues from the process, but argues that creating new identities is not simply a case of using new words. Argues that the choice of words is the result of socialized learning into a particular role, a process that cannot be taught explicitly. Analyses an existing case study and highlights the limitations of playing with an identity into which one has not been socialized.

Of all the issues surrounding online shopping, convenience, access to information, and trust were found to be the most important. These were implemented in an online conjoint shopping task. Respondents were found to use the central route of the ELM on marketing messages that involved issues of minimizing travel, information access, and assurances of system security. Users employed the peripheral ELM route when considering usability, price comparison, and personal information protection. A descriptive model of Web-based marketing components, their roles in the central and peripheral routes, and their relative importance to online consumer segments was developed.	comparison shopping website;computer security;description;elaboration likelihood model;elm;freedom of information laws by country;information access;information security;online shopping;peripheral neuropathy;personally identifiable information;usability;user experience;message	Clyde A.

With this comes a need for a sound governance structure, and this paper aims to investigate the prevalence and content of social media policies within the UK higher education environment. Governance documents from all publicly funded universities were gathered and analyzed for accessibility through readability statistics, and a thematic analysis of the content compared to the main themes from the current body of literature pertaining to social media policies. The results suggest that a large proportion of UK institutions lack an explicit social media governance document and those that do exist score reasonably high on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and SMOG readability measures. The content suggests that whilst higher education institutions are providing guidance for use of social media at work, little direction is provided for the use of social media for work. The paper then concludes by considering issues for policy implementation within the UK higher education environment.	social media	Rebecca Lees	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-91521-0_34	public relations;internet privacy;readability;thematic analysis;computer science;higher education;social media;policy analysis;corporate governance	HPC	-81.73267997547677	-15.153615581689085	93123

Significant progress has been made in addressing research questions such as how and when individuals are motivated to contribute knowledge in online settings. Yet, not only are important questions unanswered—such as why online communities succeed or fail—but also there still remains disagreement on the basic definition of online community. Furthermore, as the diversity of users and uses of online media continues to increase, IS researchers can now ask and answer different questions. For example, advances in social computing, mobile computing, and social media support new forms of online communities. In this panel we will propose and debate the direction of an online community research agenda for the next decade and beyond.	digital media;information system;mobile computing;online community;social computing;social media	Steven L.

This paper discusses the context, methodology, findings, and conclusions from an exploratory study that assessed users’ preferences of ISM services. The study uses a mixed methods approach to explain why ISM services are liked or disliked by users. This is an important area for research since users are the most important stakeholders of any ISM service. The outcomes of this exploratory study were sets of rankings of ISM services that were based entirely on users' preferences. This has not been studied in prior research up to this point. As Internet social networks continue to grow in their popularity and usefulness, this study provides a better understanding of the preferences of ISM users that is valuable to both academia and practitioners. The ISM services that are compared in this study include Facebook, MySpace, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, Groupon, Digg, Yelp, and Loopt.	google+;internet;sfiaplus;social media;social network	Vik Pant;G.

ee4015aa591d71612728b7bf3d1269402e978466	trust in b2c e-commerce interface	e commerce	Electronic commerce (e-commerce) is changing the way people make business transactions, especially in the business-to-consumer (B2C) area, and it is becoming a significant global economic force. Since Internet technologies and infrastructures to support e-commerce are now in place, attention is turning to psychological factors that affect e-commerce acceptance by online users and their perceptions of online transactions. One such factor is trust, seen to be key to the proliferation of e-commerce. Trust has existed as long as the history of humans and human social interactions, and it has been studied long before the emergence of the Internet or e-commerce. With respect to consumer behavior, studies have mainly focused on trust and trust relationships in the off-line world and have emerged from numerous disciplinary fields since the 1950s (Corritore, Kracher, & Wiedenbeck, 2001). These disciplines, including philosophy, sociology, psychology, management, marketing, ergonomics, human-computer interaction (HCI), and industrial psychology (Corritore, Kracher, & Wiedenbeck, 2003), have together contributed an extensive body of literature on trust in general, and therefore, they are important grounding points for the examination of trust in the online world. However, “trust is an extraordinarily rich concept, covering a variety of relationships, conjoining a variety of objects,” as Nissenbaum (2001, p. 104) has pointed out. Due to the complex and abstract nature of trust, each discipline has its own understanding of the concept and different ways to conceptualize it according to the features of a particular context. Even with the diverse trust research, researchers from every discipline do acknowledge the value of trust and generally observe and accept four characteristics of trust. First, there must exist two specific parties in any trusting relationship: a trusting party (trustor) and a party to be trusted (trustee). The two parties, comprised of persons, organizations, and/or products, constantly evaluate each other’s behaviors. Second, trust involves vulnerability. Trust is only needed, and actually flourishes, in an environment that is uncertain and risky. Third, trust decreases complexity in a complex world and leads people to take actions, mostly risk-taking behaviors. “Without trust people would be confronted with the incomprehensible complexity of considering every possible eventuality before deciding what to do” (Grabner-Krauter & Kaluscha, 2003, p. 787). And fourth, trust is a subjective matter. It is directly related to and affected by individual differences and situational factors. The previously mentioned characteristics of trust make it especially needed in e-commerce because people perceive economic transactions in a virtual environment as posing a higher degree of uncertainty than in traditional settings. Most e-commerce transactions are not only separated in time and space, but are also conducted via limited communication channels and impersonal interfaces, making trust a crucial facilitator for people to overcome fear, risks, and complexity. Therefore, online consumers need trust as a mental shortcut to reduce the complexity of conducting business transactions with online vendors (Luhmann, 1989). Such trust occurring in cyberspace is commonly termed “online trust,” and we limit the scope to the online trust that is pertinent to B2C e-commerce, namely, the trust that occurs for an individual Internet user toward a specific e-commerce Web site or the online vendor that the Web site represents. Derived from the general definition for trust (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998), online trust can be defined as follows: an Internet user’s psychological state of risk acceptance based upon the positive expectations of the intentions or behaviors of an online vendor. There are almost certainly many potential sources of influence that promote or hinder online trust. However, the current article focuses on the HCI or interface design perspective in inducing online trust, that is, to use what consumers can see on an e-commerce interface to affect their feelings of trust toward the online merchant that the e-commerce interface represents.	cyberspace;e-commerce;emergence;human factors and ergonomics;humans;human–computer interaction;industrial and organizational psychology;internet;keyboard shortcut;mental state;online and offline;relevance;trust (emotion);trust metric;virtual reality;vulnerability (computing);world wide web	Ye Diana Wang	2005			the internet;consumer behaviour;e-commerce;industrial and organizational psychology;vendor;feeling;public relations;customer relationship management;facilitator;sociology	HCI	-86.0776429798979	-17.665469868988698	93723
7d432baad4ecd38976d3cc30ee85aa05f2035564	integrating ego, homophily, and structural factors to measure user influence in online community		Research problem: In the current information age, people are increasingly accustomed to sharing their special interests online and are influenced by the relationships developed from that sharing. The purpose of this study was to better measure peer influence in these online communities. Research questions: 1. How can peer influence in online communities be measured in a way that comprehensively incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the structural position of a user in the network? 2. Is the method proposed in this study superior to other existing methods? Literature review: Previous literature on measuring online user influence can be classified into two streams: 1. Those that focus on the intrinsic characteristics of social media players to measure peer influence; 2. Those that address social network structure. Relevant computing algorithms include Topic-Based PageRank, Quality-Structure index, and so on. Although the first stream considers a focal peer's intrinsic characteristics, it overlooks the interpeer attraction in terms of similarity and discrepant knowledge among peers. The second stream mostly stresses the structures of social networks to measure network-wide peer influence but underestimates the effect of interpeer attraction that may leverage every diffusion step of peer influence through the network. To fill this research gap, this study proposes a new method of measuring network user influence that incorporates peers’ intrinsic factors, interpeer influence factors as homophily effect, and network structure. Homophily refers to the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are similar with respect to certain attributes. Methodology:  From the communication sender–receiver perspective, we developed a computable method that incorporates peer-based characteristics, the homophily effect, and the structural position of a user in the network to measure the social network user influence. Two empirical studies were subsequently conducted in a social network service-based online community and an online professional logistics community to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results and conclusions: The empirical results show that our proposed method provides higher prediction accuracy of user influence rank in an online community than the other existing methods. These findings lay a foundation for future theoretical exploration and provide a useful tool for targeting influential users in online communities such as blogs, bulletin board systems, and forums.	algorithm;blog;computable function;focal (programming language);logistics;online community;pagerank;peer-to-peer;social media;social network	Chenghong Zhang;Tian Lu;Shoucong Chen;Cheng Zhang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication	10.1109/TPC.2017.2703038	streams;homophily;empirical research;knowledge management;pagerank;online participation;computer science;social network;social media;online community	Web+IR	-87.28534253188067	-14.326433536820865	93790

Leading weblog sites are already attracting millions of visitors. Yet, success in the highly competitive world of weblogs is not easily achieved. This study seeks to explore weblog success from a technology perspective, i.e. from the impact of weblog-building technology (or blogging tool). Based on an examination of 126 highly successful weblogs tracked over a period of three months, we categorized weblogs in terms of popularity rank and growth, and evaluated the relationship between weblog success (in terms of popularity) and technology use. Our analysis indicates that weblog success is associated with the type of blogging tool used. We argue that technology characteristics affect the presentation and organization of weblog content, as well as the social interaction between bloggers, and in turn, affect weblog success or popularity improvement. Based on our observation, we propose a techno-social success model for weblogs. This model postulates that a weblog’s success is mainly associated with its ability to provide value for its users and readers at the content, the technology, and the social levels.	blog;categorization;embedded system;web application	Helen S.

The focal aim of this study is to analyze how twitter (dataset) can be used to improve the user experience with personality assessment. The article, in its primary context, exhibits the psychological profiling of users on the basis of the dataset. This profiling can be a very useful tool for career progression, job satisfaction and setting preferences in different interfaces. We propose a way in which the user’s personality can be predicted through information mapping available to the public on their personal Twitter using DISC (Dominance, Influence, Compliance, Steadiness) assessment. The outcomes of this study can be useful for information retrieval (search engine), content selection mechanism and positioning product & services.	color gradient;focal (programming language);information retrieval;personally identifiable information;profiling (computer programming);social media;user experience;web search engine	Nadeem Ahmad;Jawaid Siddique	2017		10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.067	data mining;information mapping;world wide web;user experience design;profiling (computer programming);viewpoints;social media;computer science;job satisfaction;personality;personality assessment inventory	Web+IR	-84.64478303617427	-14.543388209331072	94148

With bullying becoming more com mon amongst LGBT youth, it is important to obtain a greater understanding of this phenomenon. In our study, we report on the analysis of 151 YouTube videos which were identified as having LGBT and bullying related content. The analysis reveals how content creators openly disclose personal information about themselves and their experiences in a non-anonymous rhetoric with an unknown public. These disclosures could indicate a desire to seek friendshi p, support and provide empathy.	computer-mediated communication;personally identifiable information;user-generated content	Michael Green;Ania Bobrowicz;Chee Siang Ang	2015	Behaviour & IT	10.1080/0144929X.2015.1012649	psychology;gender studies;self-disclosure;social psychology	HCI	-84.49166483652333	-17.64795945783067	94269

We show that the fight against software piracy is most likely speeding up the adoption especially in the developing countries. The situation is somewhat different in those parts of the world, which have lower piracy rates. There, political lobbying seems to offer the major push for open source software. This brings us to study the actual open source software adoption in the Finland, which is both the home of Linux and also one of the most advances information societies with little piracy. The outcome is rather surprising - the Finnish government is currently ignoring open source. The results we have got from our a survey to all Finnish municipalities and from additional expanded interviews shows that there is currently high demand and growing interest for open source solutions within the Finnish municipalities but the government (by ignoring the issue) and the private sector (being mainly committed to proprietary solutions) are not able to fill the needs. We propose that the governments in the rich countries should in fact learn from developing countries and have a more proactive policy approach to open source software.	linux;open-source software;stop online piracy act;the fight: lights out	Mikko Välimäki;Ville Oksanen;Juha Laine	2005		10.1145/1089551.1089643	public relations;business;computer security;commerce	SE	-80.7599973961953	-10.384110091904116	94602
fd6e5536cfb56e21d49322f871edab7b79aeadbf	do people play mmorpgs for extrinsic or intrinsic rewards?		Abstract Several frameworks have been proposed to explain the motivations for playing Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG). However, no unified view as to whether people play MMORPGs for extrinsic or intrinsic rewards has been proposed in the existing literature. Thus, this study drew upon flow theory, Veblen’s Leisure Class theory, and Yee’s online gaming motivations framework to investigate the effects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivations on the gamer loyalty and gaming behaviors of Turkish MMORPG players. A path model was proposed to articulate the aforementioned relationships. The model showed that gamer loyalty could be predicted by status seeking (extrinsic motivation) and two facets of flow (merging of actions and awareness, and autotelic experience; intrinsic motivation). Furthermore, the game levels reached while playing MMORPGs were affected both by status seeking (extrinsic motivation) and high control of the game (intrinsic motivation). The results also demonstrated that participants with higher social motivation spent more of their daily time on MMORPGs, and players who reported higher levels of autotelic experience spent more money on MMORPGs.	massively multiplayer online role-playing game	Muhterem Dindar	2018	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2018.06.001	marketing;instrumental and intrinsic value;merge (version control);flow (psychology);computer science;loyalty;veblen good;autotelic	HCI	-88.48425706809184	-16.554667401673548	94784

The main focus of the paper is to explore the occurrence of Web 2.0 tools used in the open repositories. Design/methodology/approach – Repositories having English as one of the interface/content languages and indexed in Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR) were selected and analyzed under different parameters. Findings – A total of 1,499 open access repositories having English as one of the interface/content languages (75.82 percent of total OA repositories) are developed from 81 nations and only 61 countries have most of their repositories Web 2.0 enabled. About 57 percent (804) repositories make use of Web 2.0 tool/s, 43 percent (608) have yet to avail benefits of Web 2.0 tools while 5.8 percent remain inaccessible (87) during the study period. Though the USA leads in terms of OA repositories, the percentage of Web 2.0 enabled repositories is higher for the UK (75.27 percent) as compared to the USA (51.08 percent). Really Simple Syndication (RSS), a syndication tool, is found in the majority of repositories (736, 91.54 percent) followed respectively by Social Bookmarking and ATOM (syndication tool) in 228 and 160 repositories Research limitations/implications – Repositories have to develop a more productive Web 2.0 outlook in order to converge with an interactive learning model. A follow-up study can explore the use of Web 2.0 tools in open access repositories. The impact of Web 2.0 tools on the associated activities of the users as well as repository administrators can also be carried on. HowWeb 2.0 tools have helped to improve the services of the repositories and how they have influenced the information seeking behavior of users in the open access repositories can also be researched. Originality/value – The research is the first of its kind and can act as an opener to the issues related to use of Web 2.0 in open repositories.	atom (standard);converge;information seeking behavior;interactivity;microsoft outlook for mac;rss;software repository;web 2.0;web syndication	S.

4ae58528a14fe1e83c90246ffd38820bf167261f	choice defaults and social consensus effects on online information sharing: the moderating role of regulatory focus		Abstract Multidisciplinary research has demonstrated that privacy related decisions are context dependent. While numerous articles have explored the effects of privacy notices and disclosures, there is a dearth of research that seeks to understand the impact of choice defaults (i.e., options that the chooser will obtain if doing nothing) on information sharing. This article attempts to bridge this gap and explores how opt-in vs. opt-out choice defaults influence intentions to share personal information online and how regulatory focus moderates these effects. Because people are influenced by their peers’ beliefs and actions, the model also accounts for possible moderating effects of social norms. To test these relationships, we conducted three web-based experiments. Findings based on logistic regression analysis demonstrate that consumers with a prevention orientation, but not those with a promotion orientation, show a lower propensity to share in the opt-out condition (i.e., “do not disclose”) than in the no default and the opt-in (i.e., “disclose”) conditions. Moreover, this interaction effect is obtained in the presence of low to moderate consensus information, but it disappears in the presence of moderately high to very high consensus. These findings can better inform businesses that collect consumer information as well as policy makers.

Many authors have proposed important outcomes of group membership, and some have even investigated some preliminary dynamics of these online groups. Unfortunately, no validated measure of online group identity exists, causing these researchers to employ measures with poor psychometric properties or concerning construct validity. For these reasons, the current article undergoes a multiple study process to validate a measure of online group identity. In doing so, several aspects of online group identity are discovered, largely based on propositions previously posed for offline groups. Study 1 demonstrates that individuals from a general sample identify with online groups, and the measure has an identifiable factor structure. Using a naturally occurring online group, Study 2 shows the measure’s concurrent, convergent, and divergent validity, while simultaneously revealing many novel relationships of online group identity. Lastly, Study 3 investigates the effect of The United States President, Barack Obama, creating an account on the website studied in Study 2 and interacting with group members. The results of Study 3 reveal that online group identity did not change after this historic event, although members had notable emotional responses. In all, the current study illustrates the validity of an online group identity measure, and discovers many important relationships previously unknown in regards to online group identity. It is believed that the investigated measure of online group identity will become an important tool in future research, especially when further probing the relationships analyzed in the current study. Further implications and suggestions for future studies are discussed. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	concurrent computing;futures studies;interaction;online and offline	Matt C.

b06cb86410ff8928c42608b63dbc28d1a3ae03dc	pagerank-based prediction of award-winning researchers and the impact of citations		In this article some recent disputes about the usefulness of PageRank-based methods for the task of identifying influential researchers in citation networks are discussed. In particular, it focuses on the performance of these methods in relation to simple citation counts. With the aim of comparing these two classes of ranking methods, we analyze a large citation network of authors based on almost two million computer science papers and apply four PageRank-based and citations-based techniques to rank authors by importance throughout the period 1990-2014 on a yearly basis. We use ACM SIGMOD E. F. Codd Innovations Award and ACM A. M. Turing Award winners in our baseline lists of outstanding scientists and define four relevance weighting schemes with some predictive power for the ranking methods to increase the relevance of researchers winning in the future. We conclude that citations-based rankings perform better for Codd Award winners, but PageRank-based methods do so for Turing Award recipients when using absolute ranks and PageRank-based rankings outperform the citations-based techniques for both Codd and Turing Award laureates when relative ranks are considered. However, the two ranking groups show smaller differences if more weight is assigned to the relevance of future awardees.	acm turing award;baseline (configuration management);citation graph;citation network;computer science;pagerank;relevance;sigmod edgar f. codd innovations award	Dalibor Fiala;Gabriel Tutoky	2017	J.

In particular, this study touches upon how the assessment of both non-professional and professional categories of content on job applicants' social media differs by recruiters' gender and national culture, and whether these characteristics and how recruiters view non-professional content on social media are associated with the recruiters' perceived tendency to exclude applicants from the recruitment process. The theoretical foundations of this study were based on the selectivity model and the existing literature on national culture. The analysis of data collected from 256 Italian and Dutch recruiters using ANCOVA and logistic regression indicated that the assessment of job candidates' non-professional content differed by recruiters' culture but not by their gender, whereas the assessment of job candidates' professional content on social media differed by recruiters' gender but not by their culture. Factors related to the recruiters' perceived tendency to exclude candidates from the recruitment process were also identified. The findings of this study provide practical implications for recruiters and job seekers, and present new suggestions for future research. Female recruiters assess professional content on applicants' social media more positively.Dutch recruiters assess non-professional content on applicant's social media more negatively.Dutch recruiters tend more to exclude applicants during the social media-based screening.	social media	Mariam El Ouirdi;Ivana Pais;Jesse Segers;Asma El Ouirdi	2016	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2016.04.012	psychology;social media;computer science;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-83.17201813253875	-19.790992758307134	95425

The current paper develops a model to investigate the factors influencing individual e-service users’ Word of Mouth (WOM) behavior. Based on 543 useful questionnaires, the research model is empirically tested together with a number of hypotheses. The results show that satisfaction together with perceived usefulness and service quality positively impact users’ recommendations of e-service to others. The study finding implies that individuals would like to spread WOM more based on e-service attributes and service performance than on their own affect.

In-depth one-on-one interviews were held with a purposive sample of 20 gatekeepers identified through community-based organizations between April and May 1997. Findings indicated that the gatekeepers were slightly better educated and earned more than the average Harambee resident. The most prevalent information needs experience related to race relations, crime and family, and their sources of unmet needs were lack of awareness of or access to existing information or resources. Interpersonal sources were preferred over all other sources because of concerns about trustworthiness and credibility of information.

It picks out some of the key distinctions between internet use within domestic spaces and as a technology accessed in a public economy of consumption. The research findings are contextualized and tested against existing work on public internet access. The material derived from interviews with customers is used to explore the ways in which the internet is differently perceived, used and gendered in the public spaces of an internet cafe. The paper argues that public use of the internet is not just a transitional phenomenon which precedes home internet adoption. The research revealed that the internet cafe provided a distinct and dedicated use space which was intimately bound up in the domestic and work routines of its users.	spaces	Sarah Lee	1999	New Media & Society	10.1177/14614449922225618	public relations;the internet;internet research;consumption;marketing;public;sociology;advertising;internet privacy;law;world wide web;technology	ECom	-80.13567098310645	-13.440158417483095	95711

The gender gap in science has been the focus of many analyses which have, for the most part, documented lower research productivity and citation impact for papers authored by female researchers. Given the rise of scholarly use of social media to disseminate scientific production and the healthy proportion of women on these sites, further investigation of potential gender disparities in social media metrics are warranted. Comparing event counts from Twitter, blogs, and news with citations, this study examines whether publications with male and female authors differ regarding their visibility on the social web and whether gender disparities can be observed in terms of social media metrics. Findings demonstrate increased gender parity using social media metrics than when considering scientific impact as measured by citations. It is acknowledged that this could be the results of the different impact communities, as the scientific community constituting the citing audience is more maledominated than the social media environment. The implications for the use of social media metrics as measures of scientific quality are discussed.	altmetrics;blog;social media	Adèle Paul-Hus;Cassidy R.

Of particular interest is the growth of health related websites and the healthcare sector’s adoption of social media. In this paper, we develop a typology of health 2.0 collaboration platforms and websites. According to the proposed typology, two major types of actors within health 2.0 websites are health professionals (P) and health consumers (C). Each type of user can serve as either support provider or support recipient. Thus, we define the main types of health 2.0 platforms and websites as professional-to-professional (P2P), professional-to-consumer (P2C), consumer-to-consumer (C2C), and consumer-to-professional (C2P). We describe each type and utilize the typology to investigate 16 popular health 2.0 websites and the collaboration platforms they provide. Our typology can be used as a basis for the future research on health social media.	americas conference on information systems;biological anthropology;blog;crowdsourcing;customer to customer;experience;health 2.0;p (complexity);peer-to-peer;social media;virtual community	Nima Kordzadeh;John Warren	2012			public relations;typology;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-83.400583375378	-14.171177943614284	95818

Studies on Internet governance rely on contradictory notions of governance. The common understanding of governance as some form of deliberate steering or regulation clashes with equally common definitions of Internet governance as distributed modes of ordering. Drawing on controversies in the broader field of governance and regulation studies, we propose to resolve this conceptual conundrum by grounding governance in mundane activities of coordination. We define governance as reflexive coordination – focusing on those ‘critical moments’, when routine activities become problematic and need to be revised, thus, when regular coordination itself requires coordination. Regulation, in turn, can be understood as targeted public or private interventions aiming to influence the behaviour of others. With this distinction between governance and regulation, we offer a conceptual framework...

However, information overload and conflicting comments in online reviews can get consumers confused. Therefore, it is important for both researchers and practitioners to understand the characteristics of helpful reviews. But studies examining the determinants of perceived review helpfulness produce mixed findings. We review extant research about the determinant factors of perceived helpfulness. Conflicting findings exist for six review related factors, namely review extremity, review readability, review total votes, linear review rating, quadratic review rating, and review sentiment. We conduct a metaanalysis to reconcile the contradictory findings on the influence of review related factors over perceived review helpfulness. The meta-analysis results confirm that review extremity, readability, total votes, and positive sentiment have a negative influence on helpfulness, but review rating is positively related to helpfulness. We also examine those studies whose findings are contradictive with the meta-analysis results. Measure discrepancy and reviewed product type are the two main reasons why mixed findings exist in extant research.	discrepancy function;information overload;online shopping;product type	Hong Hong;Di Xu;Dapeng Xu;Guanghui Wang;Weiguo Fan	2017			meta-analysis;readability;helpfulness;data mining;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-89.72570278301852	-13.273897281239638	96102

Such selective exposure to a liberal podcast program was positively associated with negative emotion and negatively related to positive emotion towards a conservative party presidential candidate. In contrast, the use of the liberal podcast was positively associated with positive emotion and negatively associated with negative emotion towards a liberal party presidential candidate. Both negative and positive emotions towards political candidates were significantly related with individuals’ political participation. Most importantly, the results showed that the emotions mediated the relationship between partisan podcast use and political participation. Implications of the findings are discussed.	podcast	Youngju Kim;Yonghwan Kim;Yuan Wang	2016	IJMC	10.1504/IJMC.2016.075021	emotion	HCI	-87.65283954362474	-20.406629062636984	96292

Particularly, Twitter users have shown difficulties in distinguishing these socialbots from the human users in their social graphs. Frequently, socialbots are effective in acquiring human users as followers and exercising influence within them. While the success of socialbots is certainly a remarkable achievement for AI practitioners, their proliferation in the Twitter sphere opens many possibilities for cybercrime. The proliferation of socialbots in Twitter motivates us to assess the characteristics or strategies that make socialbots most likely to succeed. In this direction, we created 120 socialbot accounts in Twitter, which have a profile, follow other users, and generate tweets either by reposting others’ tweets or by generating their own synthetic tweets. Then, we employ a $$2^k$$ 2 k factorial design experiment to quantify the infiltration performance of different socialbot strategies, and examine the effectiveness of individual profile and activity-related attributes of the socialbots. Our analysis is the first of a kind, and reveals what strategies make socialbots successful in the Twitter sphere.	artificial intelligence;cybercrime;social network;synthetic data;the zeta project	Carlos Alessandro Sena de Freitas;Fabrício Benevenuto;Adriano Veloso;Saptarshi Ghosh	2016	Social Network Analysis and Mining	10.1007/s13278-016-0331-3	simulation;engineering;multimedia;advertising	Web+IR	-84.16883914317485	-18.3631310283275	96441

This study focuses on interactive engagement with online news videos. We propose a theoretical framework for conceptualizing user engagement on a continuum from exposure to interactivity. Furthermore, we make a distinction between user–content (e.g. commenting) and user–user (e.g. replying to another user’s comment) modes of interaction. We then explore publicly available measures of these concepts and test a series of hypotheses to explore commenting and conversational behaviors in response to YouTube news videos. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications for advancing our understanding of user engagement with online news.

While extensive efforts have been devoted to quantifying and predicting research impact, the question of how collaborative behavior influences scientific impact remains unaddressed. In this work, we study the interplay between scientists' collaboration signatures and their scientific impact. As the basis of our study, we employ an ArnetMiner dataset with more than 1.7 million authors and 2 million papers spanning over 60 years. We formally define a scientist's collaboration signature as the distribution of collaboration strengths with each collaborator in his or her academic ego network, which is quantified by four measures: sociability, dependence, diversity, and self-collaboration. We then demonstrate that the collaboration signature allows us to effectively distinguish between researchers with dissimilar levels of scientific impact. We also discover that, even from the early stages of one's researcher career, a scientist's collaboration signature can help to reveal his or her future scientific impact. Finally, we find that as a representative group of outstanding computer scientists, Turing Award winners collectively produce distinctive collaboration signatures throughout the entirety of their careers. Our conclusions on the relationship between collaboration signatures and scientific impact give rise to important implications for researchers who wish to expand their scientific impact and more effectively stand on the shoulders of """"collaborators."""""""	acm turing award;antivirus software;computer scientist;file spanning;open collaboration	Yuxiao Dong;Reid A.

However, users share information with a heterogeneous audience with varied expectations. As a result, various social spheres may influence the information individuals share or their decision to share at all. The current research describes dimensions of information in terms of horizontal and vertical information sharing. Previous research has demonstrated the salience of social spheres with conflicting norms for SNS users. We build on previous research by exploring the effects of social spheres on the depth of information shared by SNS users. Students from a university in the USA and South Korea were interviewed to understand their perceptions of information sharing and the influence social spheres have on the depth of information they provide. We found that conflicting social spheres influence the depth of information provided when a user posts to their SNS and that impression management plays a key role.		Aaron M.

Celebrity endorsement has been a popular practice in social media, however, what contributes to its effectiveness has not been fully understood. To address this issue, this study examines the effects of endorsement in social media towards brand attitude and merchandise attractiveness based on the source credibility model. We propose source credibility elements: attractiveness, expertise, and trustworthiness, to be positively related to consumer attitude. We test these hypotheses by conducting online survey with 183 participants in Indonesia. This study demonstrated that brand attitude was influenced by endorser’s attractiveness and trustworthiness, meanwhile merchandise attractiveness was influenced by endorser’s expertise and trustworthiness.	instagram;social commerce;social media;trust (emotion)	Dinna Amelina;Yu-Qian Zhu	2016			public relations;marketing;advertising	HCI	-88.26884054053576	-13.020321208811088	96831

We describe our research methods and present the final results of our investigation. Our specific contribution is to clearly delineate the unique social media ecosystem as found in mainland China and how it is used in academic settings. Social media is helpful for supporting auxiliary academic activities such as knowledge dissemination and maintaining existing work and social relationships but is not a suitable way for people to obtain information that are necessary to foster research collaboration due to trust and privacy concerns. The expectation that social media might support academic relationship building has generally failed. Participants also reported being overwhelmed by the lack of work and life balance due to the fact that social media platforms have been adopted by their academic institutions as the official communication channel for work. We suggest ways to leverage social media to promote academic activities while avoiding the pitfalls identified in this paper.	channel (communications);failure;knowledge management;media ecology;social media;user experience	Hong Qiao;Patrick C.

The system has two selection mechanisms, based on semantic algorithms and user ratings. The first utilizes an algorithm to ‘measure’ the quality of knowledge contributions and ranks them accordingly, while the second averages the ratings that knowledge items receive from KMS users. Building on appraisal theory, we found that knowledge seekers and contributors reacted differently to the two mechanisms. The rating-based rankings positively influenced knowledge seekers’ tendency to access, comment on, and spread the knowledge shared in the KMS, while the algorithm-based ranking positively influenced knowledge contributors’ to continue sharing knowledge via the system. Moreover, shorter (or longer) time delay between the time that the knowledge was shared and the time when knowledge contributors received their first comments seemed to positively (or negatively) influence the contributors’ tendency to continue sharing knowledge via the KMS. Our study adds to the existing KMS literature by investigating knowledge seekers’ and contributors’ reactions to the two different knowledge recommendation mechanisms, and recommends that managers understand the importance of implementing algorithm-based rankings in their KMS as well as the simpler and more commonly adopted rating-based ranking.	knowledge management	Juliana Sutanto;Qiqi Jiang	2013	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2012.11.004	psychology;appraisal theory;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;data mining;personal knowledge management;knowledge value chain;management;social psychology;world wide web	DB	-89.87765676988059	-13.435173773361466	97507

Using an online survey, the current study examines the influence of perceived ad relevance and privacy concern on social media ads. The results confirmed that perceived ad relevance influences advertising effectiveness such as increased attention to ads and decreased ad avoidance. However, perceived relevance also increases privacy concern which ultimately raises ad avoidance in social media.

Indeed, the Internet is expected to do no less than virtually transform society. Yet even as the Internet races ambitiously toward critical mass, some social scientists are beginning to examine carefully the policy implications of current demographic patterns of Internet access and usage. Key demographic variables like income and education drive the policy questions surrounding the Internet because they are the most likely have a differential impact on the consequences of interactive electronic media for different segments in our society. Given these concerns, we set out to conduct a systematic investigation of the differences between whites and African Americans in the United States with respect to computer access, the primary current prerequisite for Internet access, and Web use. We wished to examine whether observed race differences in access and use can be accounted for by differences in income and education, how access influences use, and when race matters in the calculus of equal access. The particular emphasis of this research is on how such differences may be changing over time. We believe our results may be used as a window through which policymakers might view the job of ensuring access to the Internet for the next generation.	e-commerce;internet access;next-generation network;race condition	Donna L.

Video games have challenged this concept, as the distance between game players and characters is greatly reduced, if not completely removed, in virtual environments. Games encourage the internalization and psychological merging of a player's and a character's mind, a multidimensional concept known as character attachment (CA). Data from our study suggest that dimensions of CA are useful in understanding both pro- and anti-social gaming motivations. Pro-social gamers feel a greater sense of control over their characters, while anti-social gamers are more likely to suspend their disbelief of the game environment and not take responsibility for their virtual actions. Pro-social gaming was more prevalent in older gamers, and younger male game characters were motivated by anti-social reasons.	attachments;dimensions;interaction;large;massively multiplayer online role-playing game;motivation;null character;personality character;switch statement;video games;video recording;virtual reality;virtual world;interest	Nicholas David Bowman;Daniel Schultheiss;Christina Schumann	2012	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	10.1089/cyber.2011.0311	psychology;multimedia;communication;social psychology	HCI	-86.4816095264751	-18.948868650027848	98027

However, previous literature suggests that the convenience provided by the Internet in establishing social connection may not facilitate shy individuals to engage in online positive behaviors (e.g., prosocial behavior) as frequently as others. In contrast to larger effort devoted to studying negative outcomes in cyberspace, insufficient interest has been focused on online prosocial behavior. This study aims to investigate the association between shyness and online prosocial behavior and related mechanisms. According to the Cognitive and Affective Processing Systems of personality, cognitive (social self-efficacy) and affective (empathy) factors were introduced as mediators. Self-reported measures were administrated to 805 Chinese undergraduate students in 2017. Results showed that shyness was negatively correlated with online prosocial behavior, and this association was completely mediated by social self-efficacy, perspective taking, and empathic concern. Specifically, shyness exerted a negative influence on the abovementioned mediators, thereby decreasing the tendency to act prosocially online. Moreover, the mediating effect of social self-efficacy was larger than that of perspective taking and empathic concern. Identifying these mediators further enables us to work out effective measures to encourage shy individuals to engage in more prosocial behavior online that will promotes their psychological and social well-being.

Furthermore, online retailers are also different from traditional retailers because the former do not often have frontline employees, physical outlets, or displaying layouts. Therefore, when building a strong online retailer brand, it is not enough to only consider the traditional dimensions of customer-based brand equity, namely brand awareness, perceived quality, brand associations, and brand loyalty. Some dimensions, i.e. trust associations and emotional connection need to be distinguished or included in the context of online business. Besides, the willingness to pay a price premium is always being viewed as a good indicator to measure brand equity, but for online retailers, it is conditional on some premises. By structural equation modeling, it was verified that for online retailers, the importance of brand awareness and trust associations decreased but perceived quality remained its strong influence. Brand loyalty was the better indicator for measuring brand equity, and emotional connection became so critical that if without it, customers would lack willingness to pay a price premium.	electronic business;online shopping;structural equation modeling;trust metric	Dauw-Song Zhu;Min-Jone Kuo	2010	2010 IEEE/ACIS 9th International Conference on Computer and Information Science	10.1109/ICIS.2010.128	brand extension;brand equity;marketing;brand management;advertising;business;brand awareness;commerce	AI	-90.1861524333824	-10.995014181444278	98472

The modern workplace is becoming increasingly reliant on distributed work arrangements, in which employees work part- or full-time from home, coffee shops, satellite offices, and elsewhere rather than at a centralized location. There are questions about the role of personality in shaping work behavior during distributed work, particularly with respect to cyberslacking and work engagement as indicators of distributed work effectiveness. Cyberslacking can be viewed as an extension of typical counterproductive workplace behavior, and it involves distraction and putting off work to """"surf the Internet."""" Engagement can be viewed as the intensity of physical, cognitive, and emotional involvement with work activities. We found that non-Big Five personality traits, Honesty and Procrastination, were important predictors of these outcomes. Moreover, we developed three sets of intermediary behaviors linking personality to distributed work effectiveness: regular upward communication, self-management tactics, and conscious socialization efforts. Finally, personality profiles were identified with latent profile analyses in order to determine which """"types"""" of people are more successful than others in distributed work."""		Thomas A.

This research adds to the knowledge of tourism information presentation through studying different types of available online textual tourism information, examining their characteristics, and exploring their influence on tourists’ desires to visit a destination. Two studies were conducted in total, in which Study 1 employed a mixed-method approach to extract the values of online data. Study 2 employed a scenario-based experiment with a follow-up questionnaire and interview to obtain the perceived values of the different types of textual information. This research categorises the online textual tourism information into four types: blogs, reviews, messages, and articles. Blogs tend to present tourism information using first person narratives, displaying a strong sense of affection and positive emotions with a touch of sincerity and excitement. Reviews, as the easiest to understand and most useful type of textual tourism information, have a significant influence on tourists’ desires to visit a particular destination.

In this paper we examine the role of feedback system in building trust towards unknown E-vendors when buyers are making purchase for the first time. We adopted Signaling theory from marketing literature to breakdown the cognitive process of buyers when they face a mixture of true and fake advertisements and guarantees from the E-vendor, and how they perceive the signals to be honest and true. We posit that Social Presence signals from reviewers in the feedback system possess the bonding ability that makes the cost/difficulty in sending fake signals prohibitively high in given feedback system. This perceived credibility in feedback system then positively influence the perceived credibility of trust-building signals, as the cost for sending fake signal without being exposed by the feedback system is extremely high. Finally, the perceived level of trust in the E-vendor positively influence the perceived credibility of risk-reducing signals, because the potential loss of sending out fake signals will jeopardise established consumer trust, which is highly sought after and valuable. By identifying the reinforcing effect between these constructs rather than parallel constructs, we hypothesize that interpersonal signals serve as a """"primer"""" that can trigger this chain reaction, and feedback system has a much broader implication in the formation of online trust than previously recognized.

A relatively new technology, social bookmarking, is increasingly being used in many organizations (McAfee 2006), and may enhance employee innovativeness by providing a new, socially mediated channel for discovering information. Users of such systems create publicly viewable lists of bookmarks (each being a hyperlink to an information resource) and often assign searchable keywords (""""tags"""") to these bookmarks. We explore two different perspectives on how accessing others' bookmarks could enhance how innovative an individual is at work. First, we develop two hypotheses around the idea that quantity may be a proxy for diversity, following a well established literature that holds that the more information obtained and the larger the number of sources consulted, the higher the likelihood an individual will come across novel ideas. Next, we offer two hypotheses adapted from social network research that argue that the shape of the network of connections that is created when individuals access each others' bookmarks can reflect information novelty, and that individuals whose networks bridge more structural holes and have greater effective reach are likely to be more innovative. An analysis of bookmarking system use in a global professional services firm provides strong support for the social diversity of information sources as a predictor of employee innovativeness, but no support that the number of bookmarks accessed matters. By extending the social networks literature to theorize the functionalities offered by social bookmarking systems, this research establishes structural holes theory as a valuable lens through which social technologies may be understood."""

The focus of this paper is on the ethics for online research. Our aim is to reignite the discussion about the way the availability and consequent (mis)use of ‘social’ data, e.g. social network site profiles or newsgroup postings by researchers is about to necessitate a new definition of and fight for the right for a private sphere that each individual may claim in the public of the virtual worlds.

Contributions are public information and each participant evaluates her partner's contribution. At the beginning of each period, participants receive information regarding the evaluation of the previous period. Evaluations are subjective judgments, hence our reputation system allows for some degree of noise. There are two information treatments: Each participant receives information either about her partner's evaluation, or about her own and her partner's evaluation. The results show that although participants condition their contributions on their partners' evaluations, this information alone is insufficient to raise contributions. Only if participants also know their own evaluations, we find an increase in contributions.	experiment;reputation system	Matthias Greiff;Fabian Paetzel	2016	Games and Economic Behavior	10.1016/j.geb.2016.02.009	public relations;reciprocity;welfare economics	ECom	-90.40789571206847	-17.957376356401237	99241

Politicians, media and citizens are visible online and share their opinions immediately on these platforms. During the last days before an election a lot of activity is observed on these media, giving a picture of the issues and key people. In this paper, we study the case of the French primaries election through the Twitter microscope over a period of 10 days preceding the election. We apply social network analysis to uncover the key topics and influencers for the left and right-wings.

Despite time zone differences of about eight hours, collaborators still found time to synchronously meet. The interviews identified the diverse strategies teams used to find time windows to interact, which often included times outside of the normal workday and connecting from home to participate. Recent trends in increased work connectivity from home and blurred boundaries between work and home enabled more scheduling flexibility. While email use was understandably prevalent, there was also general interest in video, although obstacles remain for widespread usage. We propose several design implications for supporting this growing population of workers that need to span global time zone differences.	email;microsoft windows;scheduling (computing)	John C.

37c8039821e45da8c03242deb0fd610a1805fb6c	the effect of conflicting consumer reviews on the accuracy of a purchase decisions		Online consumer review plays an important role in customers’ purchase decisions. However, conflicting online reviews can confuse potential customers. As a result, he/she will take a risk of either selecting a product that is not able to satisfy their needs or not select an appropriate product. This error in purchasing can impose significant tangible and intangible costs on the supply chain. In this paper, a conceptual framework will be proposed to model the effect of three types of conflict among online consumer reviews: including Conflicting opinions among product attributes, Conflicting star ratings and the Disagreement intensity among reviewers (CCD model) on the perceived informativeness and accuracy of a purchase decision. Result of this study may help sellers to analyze and categorize online reviews and publish reviews that would improve the accuracy of a purchase decision, thereby decreasing the overall cost of a wrong purchase.

Research found that Facebook is deeply integrated in users’ daily lives through specific routines and rituals. Users claimed to understand privacy issues, yet reported uploading large amounts of personal information. Risks to privacy invasion were ascribed more to others than to the self. However, users reporting privacy invasion were more likely to change privacy settings than those merely hearing about others’ privacy invasions. Results suggest that this lax attitude may be based on a combination of high gratification, usage patterns, and a psychological mechanism similar to third-person effect. Safer use of social network services would thus require changes in user attitude.	bernhard rosenkränzer;data mining;digital journalism;journal of computer-mediated communication;online community;persistence (computer science);personally identifiable information;phishing;privacy;social network;unintended consequences;upload	Bernhard Debatin;Jennette P.

They are important as they may detract from the perceived objectivity of the results if the authors are in the pay of commercial companies. However, the frequency of these statements in the web of science (WoS) is only a few percent of the total number of biomedical papers. A survey of journal editors revealed that many COI statements are excluded from the WoS because they are printed separately from the acknowledgement section of the paper. One consequence of the appearance of COI statements on papers is that the WoS mistakenly includes companies who have given money to some of the researchers for unrelated work among the sponsors listed among the funding organizations, and this will distort the analysis of the funding of the research being reported in some of the papers and appears nearly to double companies’ apparent tally of papers.	distortion;money;objectivity/db;printing;web of science	Grant Lewison;Richard Sullivan	2014	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1507-0	public relations;social science;data mining;management;operations research;law;world wide web	Crypto	-78.69216527396227	-21.273087217253895	99622

Developing local models, special attention is paid to whether variables explain the vote equally well across the country. Variables describing the post-industrial and economic ‘successfulness’ of Local Authorities most strongly discriminate variation in the vote. To a lesser extent this is the case for variables linked to ‘metropolitan’ and ‘big city’ contexts, which assist the Remain vote, those that distinguish more traditional and ‘nativist’ val- ues, assisting Leave, and those loosely describing material outcomes, again reinforcing Leave. Whilst variables describing economic competitiveness co-vary with voting pref- erence equally well across the country, the importance of secondary variables – those dis- tinguishing metropolitan settings, values and outcomes – does vary by region. For certain variables and in certain areas, the direction of effect on voting preference reverses. For ex- ample, whilst levels of European Union migration mostly assist the Remain vote, in parts of the country the opposite effect is observed.		Roger Beecham;Aidan Slingsby;Chris Brunsdon	2018	J.

5859d62b55e76d906c84401254172ff96545fc49	does the global south have altmetrics? analyzing a brazilian lis journal		Introduction As a new emerging field, Altmetrics has become a trendsetter, and received a good deal of attention by researchers involved in the evaluation of scientific research. Moreover, it has led to a notable growth in the related academic literature. The international landscape has displayed an exponential growth in the field of scholarly publishing with several studies exploring altmetrics (both their potential benefits and limitations) in the last 3 years. However, in the Global South this subject is still not widespread, with a few empirical works. Alperín (2014) explored altmetrics measurements from articles in South American journals retrieved from sources such as SciELO, Redalyc and Latindex. This author also carried out an analysis of 21,560 articles published by the Brazilian journals in SciELO. This explored its altmetrics data with the Altmetric.com tool, and showed that these new measurements in the region are still in their early stages. Alperín (2014) also believed that the spread of science on the Internet and social networks in Brazil seems to have been limited in scope. This is because there are few or no sources of alternative performance metrics such as Blogs, Wikipedia, videos and social media like Google Plus, LinkedIn, Reddit, Pinterest, and others. The only media that appears to have significant data is Twitter, with 6.03% of mentions, followed by Facebook, with only 2.81%. Nascimento & Oddone (2014) also used Altmetric.com to conduct an analysis of altmetrics indicators in 2 Brazilian journals in Library and Information Science (LIS). This showed that out of a total of 55 articles, 35 (63%) recorded mentions of Twitter, 22 (40%) of Mendeley, 19 (34%) of Facebook and 1 (1%) of Pinterest. Similarly, Araújo (2014) analyzed the altmetrics data of Brazilian LIS journals either through Altmetrics.com, with the cut-outs of 121 articles published in the last 3 editions of 4 core national journals in this area. From this total sample, only 6 articles of 3 different journals returned altmetrics data. Apart from the limited amount of altmetrics data in the source, it is clear that all of the data were from Twitter, with no mentions on Facebook, or on blog posts. Araújo (2014) argues that these meagre results in the use of Altmetrics.com may have been caused by (1) a limitation of the tool due to the issues already considered such as DOI and, others; and (2) the coverage provided by other social media services. It has been suggested that this drawback in the use of social media (such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn) can be overcome through the use of an API (Application Programming Interface) that once parametrized, can provide more precise altmetrics indicators from articles (Araújo, 2014). Following this suggestion, we performed an altmetrics analysis of a Brazilian LIS journal (DataGramaZero) through the use of APIs of the two largest social media in Brazil in terms of active users: Facebook and Twitter. DataGramaZero (DGZ) is a pioneer publishing venture in the area of the Brazilian LIS and has had an entirely digital format since its inception, as well as being among the core journals in LIS in the nation. However, the absence of a DOI precludes this journal from obtaining results from the use of tools for altmetrics data collection e.g. Altmetrics.com. In addition, as well as not being indexed in international databases, it is not included in the citation results of Web of Science (WoS). This study seeks to conduct an empirical analysis to check the altmetrics measurements in the DGZ articles as an example of the lack of altmetrics in the Global South.	altmetrics;application programming interface;blog;database;google+;internet;latindex;library and information science;mendeley;redalyc;scielo;social media;social network;time complexity;web of science;wikipedia	Ronaldo F.

In an observation study of eleven, thirty-minute baby storytimes conducted at two branches of a large public library system, the naturally occurring behavior of the children captured through observation field notes and audio-recording and transcription of the program successfully revealed numerous incidents of emergent literacy activities and social interaction. This article discusses the practicalities of implementing participant observation in storytime programs for very young children. Special requirements related to informed consent, the need to protect baby and toddler participants, and the challenge of gaining and maintaining access are addressed. Included is an appendix of recommended observation, child development, and research methods texts.

Based on findings in general education, we have studied the influence of emotional and social factors on students’ learning outcomes in introductory computer science courses. Emotional health and social well-being have been measured in terms of five variables: perfectionism, self-esteem, coping tactics, affective states and optimism. Surprisingly, we found no correlation between emotional health and social well-being on the one hand and success in computer science as indicated by course grades on the other. However, in most of the courses, the students who pass have a statistically significant higher self-esteem than those who do not. Our hypothesis was that there would be a positive correlation between emotional and social factors and success in computer science as indicated by the course grade, since others have found the variables perfectionism, selfesteem and affective states to be predictors of success. We identify potential explanations for this seeming contradiction.	coefficient;computer science;nl (complexity);tree accumulation;aptitude	Jens Bennedsen;Michael E.

However, conventional WOM communication is only effective within limited social contact boundaries. The advances of information technology and the emergence of online social network sites have changed the way information is transmitted and have transcended the traditional limitations of WOM. This paper describes online interpersonal influence or electronic word of mouth (eWOM) because it plays a significant role in consumer purchase decisions.	emergence;microsoft word for mac;social network	Mohammad Reza Jalilvand;Sharif Shekarchizadeh Esfahani;Neda Samiei	2011		10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.008	word of mouth;information technology	HCI	-86.8060642882923	-13.554423598809466	100467

Examples of cybersafety issues include cyberbullying, cyberthreats, recruiting minors via Internet services for nefarious purposes, using deceptive means to dupe vulnerable populations, exhibiting misbehaving behaviors such as using profanity or flashing in online video chats, and many others. These issues have a direct negative impact on the social, psychological and in some cases physical well-being of the end users. An important characteristic of these issues is that they fall in a grey legal area, where perpetrators may claim freedom of speech or rights to free expression despite causing harm. The main goal of this inaugural workshop on cybersafety is to bring together the researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, government and research labs working in the area of cybersafety to discuss the unique challenges in addressing various cybersafety issues and to share experiences, solutions, tools, and techniques. The focus is on the detection, prevention and mitigation of various cybersafety issues, as well as education and promoting safe practices.  Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following: Cyberbullying in social media, Cyberthreats, coercion, and undue social pressure, Misbehaving users in online video chat services, Trolls in chat rooms, discussion boards and other social media, Deception to shape opinion, such as spinning, Deceptive techniques targeted at vulnerable populations such as the elderly and K-12 minors, Bad actors in social media, Online exposure of inappropriate material to minors, Education and promoting safe practices, and Remedies for preventing or thwarting cybersafety issues.	bios;chat room;computation;cyberbullying;internet;online predator;population;social media;video clip;world wide web	Shivakant Mishra;Qin Lv;Richard Han;Jeremy Blackburn	2016		10.1145/2983323.2988541	artificial intelligence;data mining;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-84.19924552732756	-18.916492227702747	100527

In Asia, however, the diagnosis, assessment and intervention of ASD is significantly lagging behind its western counterpart: there is no systematic prevalence study in China yet as to how many of its population has been affected by ASD. In this paper, we present our study, the first of its kind, to offer some preliminary, yet early valuable insights into the practices, knowledge and public awareness of ASD through lexical-affinity based emotion analysis on textual contents extracted from a notably well-known Chinese support site on ASD and one enormously popular social media site-Weibo. Mixed results were obtained. The ‘sum’ of our feeling is potentially positive and encouraging; yet the data obtained from Weibo are in line with previous works that public awareness of ASD is very low in China and the Asia Pacific region. Thanks to the increasing Chinese government supports and more research and development in this area, it is our ‘collective’ hope that more HCI community can engage in such efforts in China.

While the study of online political communication provides several different perspectives, few studies have attempted to uncover tendencies of so-called permanent campaigning in online environments. The term signifies campaign-like activities at the hands of politicians also during non-election periods and has spawned a number of conceptual discussions. This article presents an exploratory effort, studying traces of permanent campaigning in two similar countries—Norway and Sweden. As the former of these countries underwent a parliamentary election during the studied period, the study provides insights into “the election effect”—heightened levels of online activity among the Norwegian parties and politicians that can perhaps best be understood in relation to an ongoing election.

Learning about information design begins with understanding how it is defined. This paper provides an analysis of the definition of information design. Using a method based on content analysis, existing definitions proposed by renowned authors and information design practitioners were synthesized into a single complete definition. The process involved identification of definitions used by key organizations and acknowledged leaders in the information design community according to the context and position of each author. The overall analysis of each definition involved a systematic critique process. This consisted of a detailed content analysis of the main words used in each definition and an analysis of the corresponding sentence construction used for each definition. Using synonymous word groups, and based on the analysis (and structure) of the source materials, a new definition of information design was proposed. It is suggested that this approach may be applied to any area or concept not having a clear definition.	academy;emergence;information design;microsoft word for mac	Maria Jose Herrera	2013	IEEE International Professonal Communication 2013 Conference	10.1109/IPCC.2013.6623932	computer science;knowledge management;data mining;lexical definition;linguistics;data analysis;management;world wide web;information retrieval;statistics	EDA	-79.74365789993458	-17.326182228576222	100631

Accepting donations online helps nonprofits, which typically face budgetary constraints, to accomplish their tasks more effectively and efficiently and to put their resources to use where they are needed most. In this paper we first present a framework that illustrates several antecedents of online donations. We use the results of two surveys to test the scales we have developed and present the respective factor loadings. After discussing the descriptive results, we compare two user groups (members of nonprofits and students) regarding their attitudes toward online donations. The results suggest that most of the scales we present exhibit sufficient validity and that significant differences between the two groups exist. While the former is useful for researchers planning to conduct an empirical survey to assess the importance of online donations, the latter results demonstrate the applicability of our instrument to segment user groups according to their preferences. This can help nonprofits to address their (prospective) members with better target communication efforts.	factor analysis;prospective search	Horst Treiblmaier;Irene Pollach	2006			public relations;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;trustworthy computing;management;social psychology;computer security	HCI	-89.00499384043094	-11.840697353007107	100879

In turn, it is asserted that the gaming industry should focus on appealing to these players via targeted content. Being targeted as a gamer, however, does not a gamer make. Identity as a gamer intersects with other identities like gender, race, and sexuality. Negative connotations about gaming lead people to not identify as gamers, and even to not play video games. This article concludes, based on interview data, that those invested in diversity in video games must focus their attention on the construction of the medium, and not the construction of the audience as such. This shift in academic attention is necessary to develop arguments for representation in games that do not rely on marking groups as specific kinds of gaming markets via identifiers like gender, race, and sexuality.	identifier;item unique identification	Adrienne Shaw	2012	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444811410394	psychology;multimedia;sociology;advertising;human sexuality;social psychology;race	HCI	-83.82260962837822	-16.97510565248534	100954

To date there has been very little published academic research concerning online gaming and even less on the different types of online games that exist. Given the lack of data, a scoping study was undertaken to examine the extent, range and nature of different MMORPGs. Data were collected relating to the twenty most popular MMORPGs. The primary aim was to present a summarised overview of all material reviewed. The secondary aim was to provide a thematic construction in order to present a narrative account of existing MMORPG literature. Overall, the scoping study found that whilst some games had received moderate, or even substantial attention, others have had no research conducted upon them at all. This presents a problem since the growth in both the player base and the industry suggests that a single psychological profile of ‘the gamer’ cannot be relied upon, and as such further research is required. It is hoped that this study suggests ways forward and helps set research agendas for future research	massively multiplayer online role-playing game;scope (computer science);while	Alex Meredith;Zaheer Hussain;Mark D.

864c89a1389606fe56b2d6642c8be8dca1f56a6c	fostering active participation of young people in democratic life: a case study using the #ask dashboard		In many democratic countries, including the European Union Member States, it is increasingly important that policy makers are aware of young people’s opinion. In this respect, the European Union prioritizes the discovery of new forms of participation in democratic processes and access to political decision-making through online and offline tools. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate and evaluate the idea of promoting young people’s participation in political decision-making by brokering discussions on Twitter. Towards this end, we present a case study that utilizes and makes a preliminary evaluation of the #ask Dashboard, a software solution for brokering and analyzing discussions on Twitter between policy makers and young people. In terms of the case study, we discovered Twitter handles of 74 policy makers and 229 young people interested in ten topics. We used the #ask Dashboard to broker more than 275 discussions about these topics. So far, we have achieved 367 replies, 15 retweets and 105 likes mostly from young people. Students who participated in brokered discussions for a month performed the evaluation of the case study. Although students believe that the case study gave them the opportunity to be active on political issues, they were sceptical on whether Twitter discussion brokering successfully reaches young people and policy makers.	dashboard	Areti Karamanou;Eleni Panopoulou;Vibor Cipan;Darko Cengija;David Jelic;Efthimios Tambouris;Konstantinos A.

The nature of the resulting collaborations shows that the government's aim is to become more open, participatory and accessible. This will change how those charged with carrying out the policies of the government, public servants carry out its business activities. While there are legal, procedural, social, technical, privacy, IP, policy, and cultural issues our aim here is to highlight some ethical concerns. Though early, it is envisaged that this new conjunction will give rise to additional ethical dimensions (especially role confusion ad conflict) due to the new forms of interactions and collaborations.

Using a Social Network Analysis framework and following on the heels of motivational studies, we examine the Facebook Fan Pages of three environmental communities: eBird, Aspen Center for Environmental Studies and the Anacostia Watershed Society. We find that whether posts originate with the page owner (Page Posts), with users (User Posts), or whether they are posted by Fan Pages of other sites (Mention Posts), posts on a site fall into 4 main categories based on their message and intent: informational, invitational, motivational and investigational. While thematic content analysis corroborates that posts by owners motivate the most user engagement across the board, the degree to which Page Posts cumulatively fall into the motivational category on a site critically impacts user engagement.

This study uses these stories in order to model tourist spatiotemporal movement at the destination within the context of their tourist-activated networks. The stories provide information about the behavior of tourists on the move with respect to their problems, critical moments, information needs, knowledge gain, and the perceived value of overall travel experiences. The results offer several implications are drawn for designing mobile technology that enhance tourist experiences. This study contributes to the practical and theoretical development of tourism and information systems in two ways. First, this study shows that online communities such as travel journals can be used as reliable sources of tourist behavior. Second, the results of this study support further development of a theoretical framework for designing mobile technology that supports the traveler experience.	information needs;information system;online community	Iis P.

Different social categories, such as gender, age, education, profession and social status, are strongly related with the linguistic diversity of people’s everyday spoken and written interaction. In this paper, sociolinguistic studies addressed to gender differentiation are overviewed in order to identify how various linguistic characteristics differ between women and men. Thereafter, it is examined if and how these qualitative features can become quantitative metrics for the task of gender identification from texts on web blogs. The evaluation results showed that the “syntactic complexity”, the “tag questions”, the “period length”, the “adjectives” and the “vocabulary richness” characteristics seem to be significantly distinctive with respect to the author’s gender.	blog;social engineering (security);vocabulary	Vasiliki Simaki;Christina Aravantinou;Iosif Mporas;Marianna Kondyli;Vasileios Megalooikonomou	2017	Journal of Quantitative Linguistics	10.1080/09296174.2016.1226430	mathematics;linguistics	NLP	-84.2478010638358	-19.779503481463234	101725
c6d99fb87d14fd2fdd824acfd8456b2e02b6c1d2	framing meaningful experiences toward a service science-based tourism experience design		From a service science approach, this paper describes the use of sentiment analysis technology to analyze visitor’s reviews in order to design experiences in the tourism business sector. Despite what the mere accidental observation could show, tourism is one of the significant experiences for human beings and that makes it optimal to test new concepts in service science, such as experience design and sentiment analysis.

In this work we explore the influence of network structures of these pages on the efficiency of WikiProjects. Project efficiency is measured as the amount of work done by project members in a quarter. The study uses the comments on WikiProject talk pages to construct communication networks. The structural properties of these networks are studied using ideas from social network theory. We develop three hypotheses about how network structures influence project effectiveness and examine the hypotheses using a longitudinal dataset of 362 WikiProjects. The evaluation suggests that an intermediate level of cohesion with a core of influential users dominating network flow improves effectiveness for a WikiProject, and that greater average membership tenure relates to project efficiency in a positive way. We discuss the implications of this analysis for the future management of WikiProjects.

Children are information seekers with needs and development characteristics that vary from those of adults. Cognitive developmental ability, memory and recall levels; emotional, social, and physical developments are factors that influence use of various information retrieval systems. Reliable, multiple inquiry methods are needed to elicit children's information-seeking behavior. What research methodology would best be suited for the study of children's information seeking? Federal regulations require that researchers submit an application to an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to request permission for using children as subjects in research projects. The IRB guidelines may discourage many researchers from conducting such research due to complexity and time involved to comply with the regulations. The presenters will report on the results of recent studies that employed various types of inquiry methods to examine children's information-seeking behavior, and will discuss the IRB regulations relating to use of children as human subjects in research projects.

We analyze the ads shown to users during controlled browsing as well as examine the inferred demographics and interests shown in Ad Preference Managers provided by advertisers.  In an initial study of ad networks and a focused study of the Google ad network, we found many expected contextual, behavioral and location-based ads along with combinations of these types of ads. We also observed profile-based ads. Most behavioral ads were shown as categories in the Ad Preference Manager (APM) of the ad network, but we found unexpected cases where the interests were not visible in the APM. We also found unexpected behavior for the Google ad network in that non-contextual ads were shown related to induced sensitive topics regarding sexual orientation, health and financial matters.  In a smaller study of Facebook, we did not find clear evidence that a user's browsing behavior on non-Facebook sites influences the ads shown to the user on Facebook, but we did observe such influence when the Facebook Like button is used to express interest in content. We did observe Facebook ads appearing to target users for sensitive interests with some ads even asserting such sensitive information, which appears to be a violation of Facebook's stated policy."""	advanced power management;facebook like button;information sensitivity;location-based service	Craig E.

A controlled experimental study has been carried out to determine the differences in performance of students in a computer assisted mstruction (CAI) group with that of a control group. It investigates the relationship between performance and various student-specific characteristics such as aptitude, attitude, sex, domain experience, domain expertise, and system experience. The relationships b between attitude towards CAI, fulfillment of expectations, and satisfaction with the system and course have also been explored. The results indicate that CAI has favorable effects on students' performance and that personal attributes have relatively less important roles to play.	computer;decision support system;experiment;user experience;aptitude	William R.

Using multi-wave panel data from a representative sample of adults in the US, the study found that reported levels of open dialogue decreased slightly with mobile-mediated political discussion in small and like-minded strong-tie networks. Interestingly, a more pronounced positive effect was found for mobile-mediated discussion in larger networks of like-minded close ties. In this case, open dialogue was facilitated by mobile-mediated discussion, revealing potential for mobile communication among close personal ties to expand spheres of public discourse and deliberation. Theoretical implications and directions for future research are offered in the discussion.	mobile phone	Scott W.

In our prior work we observed that a negative side effect for merchants selling Groupons is that, on average, their Yelp ratings decline significantly. However, this previous work was primarily observational, rather than explanatory. In this work, we rigorously consider and evaluate various hypotheses about underlying consumer and merchant behavior in order to understand this phenomenon, which we dub the Groupon effect. We use statistical analysis and mathematical modeling, leveraging a dataset we collected spanning tens of thousands of daily deals and over 7 million Yelp reviews. We investigate hypotheses such as whether Groupon subscribers are more critical than their peers, whether Groupon users are experimenting with services and merchants outside their usual sphere, or whether some fraction of Groupon merchants provide significantly worse service to customers using Groupons. We suggest an additional novel hypothesis: reviews from Groupon users are lower on average because such reviews correspond to real, unbiased customers, while the body of reviews on Yelp contain some fraction of reviews from biased or even potentially fake sources. Although our focus is quite specific, our work provides broader insights into both consumer and merchant behavior within the daily deals marketplace.	baseline (configuration management);compiler;email marketing;experiment;file spanning;jamie wilkinson;mathematical model	John W.

To address privacy needs, Twitter provides various security settings. However, users with protected profiles are limited to their friendship circles and thus might have less visibility from outside of their networks. Previous research on privacy reveals information leakage and security threats in social networks despite of privacy protection enabled. In this context, could protecting microblogging content be counterproductive for individual users? Would microbloggers use Twitter more effectively when opening their content for everyone rather than protecting their profiles? Are user profile protection features necessary? We wanted to address this controversy by studying how microbloggers exploit privacy and geo-location setting controls. We followed a set of user profiles during half of year and compared their usage of Twitter features including status updates, favorites, being listed, adding friends and follower contacts. Our findings revealed that protecting user accounts is not always detrimental to exploiting the main microblogging features. Additionally, we found that users across geographic regions have different privacy preferences. Our results enable us to get insights into privacy issues in microblogs, underlining the need of respecting user privacy in microblogs. We suggest to further research user privacy controls usage in order to understand user goals and motivations for sharing and disclosing their microblogging data online with the focus on user cultural origins.	adobe flash player;bookmark (world wide web);copy protection;geolocation;information leakage;privacy;real life;social network;spectral leakage;test set;user (computing);user profile;user-generated content;web application	Elena Daehnhardt;Nick K.

Accordingly, various methods have been considered to enhance customer trust. Human branding has received increased attention and played a vital role in business in recent years because it has great impacts on our daily life and consumption. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of applying human brands in an online shopping environment with an emphasis on product type and human brand attachment. The study combines the eye-tracking technique with a self-reported questionnaire to gain a deeper understanding of the effect of human branding in the online shopping process. The results showed that both the product type and level of human brand attachment have significant influences on a customer's visual attention as well as perceived trust towards the product.	eye tracking;online shopping	Seong Wook Chae;Young Wook Seo;Kun Chang Lee	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-28493-9_2	computer science;brand management;corporate branding;trustworthy computing;brand awareness;product type	AI	-89.11534218789375	-11.590554130228234	102894

The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset (about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system, experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society. The results show that papers with the tag""""good for teaching""""do achieve higher altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of the papers is controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented (""""new finding""""). The findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of research should lead to societal impact. If altmetric data is to be used for the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization. In bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers' subject area and publication year. This study has taken a second analytic step involving a possible normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely reflected in Thomson Reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of topics."""	altmetrics;altran praxis;bibliometrics;book;chan's algorithm;desmond;max planck digital library;scientific literature;social sciences citation index;web of science	Lutz Bornmann	2014	J.

However, with the rapidly grown popularity of social media and mobile computing, the service expectations and functional requirements for digital online presence and interaction have also changed. We studied the characteristics of the 2013 UEFA top four football teams' online appearance, that is, the mix of official team Web sites and their social media and mobile applications. By building on past studies that had explored professional team Web sites by using the TEDS framework for information artifact evaluation, this investigation replicated the same 'human agent-centric' approach, but also included in the study the teams' social media and mobile channels. The results suggest that the official websites of the 2013 top-four UEFA teams have slightly improved over time. However, the official team Web sites have lost importance relative to social media and mobile channels.	functional requirement;ieee 1451;mobile app;mobile computing;social media;web design	Marlen Jurisch;Helmut Krcmar;Hand J.

It provides companies with competitive tools for online promotion, and it also assists consumers to make better-informed purchasing decisions based on the sharing of experiences from other consumers. Trust is important in social commerce environment as it serves as a foundation for consumers to evaluate product information from companies as well as from other consumers. However, extant literature still lacks clear understanding of the nature of trust in social commerce. This study sets out to understand trust development in social commerce websites. Specifically, based on trust transference theory, we develop a research model to examine how consumer trust in social commerce impacts their trust in the company and their electronic word of mouth intention. In addition, we also examine how customers’ prior transaction experience with a company could impact their social commerce trust development and serve as a mediator in the trust transfer process. The research model is empirically examined using a survey method consisting of 375 users of a social commerce website. This study contributes to the conceptual and empirical understanding of trust in social commerce. The academic and practical implications of this study are also discussed.	e-commerce;experience;purchasing;social commerce	Wing S.

This thirdyear economics module included a blend of online communication (through email, online chats and online discussions) and face-to-face meetings, both in smaller bargaining groups and in whole class plenary meetings. Our method of analysis includes the use of Exchange Structure Analysis of text chats and face-to-face learning conversations, triangulated by observation, survey and interview data. The focus on community of practice enables us to offer a nuanced interpretation of differences in crude participation data derived from the online chats. Superficially, the data may suggest marginalisation of participants, but Wenger’s (1988) notion of peripheral participation with a trajectory towards full participation reframes the disparities in terms of an active community of practice. Some members are fully engaged with the practices of trade bargaining from the early stages of the simulation, while others move towards full participation over the duration of the simulation. Our results suggest that the laboratory-based online text chats did provide opportunities for student participation in the simulation, and that male and female students exhibited different patterns of participation in the chats. Introduction Online interventions are no longer solely the domain of distance education (Burbules and Callister, 2000). They are increasingly being integrated into campus-based curricula, and they need to be understood and have their effectiveness evaluated in that context. Opportunities afforded by online collaboration have been explored across several genres and domains including facilitation (Berge, 1995; Mason, 1991), online learning and teaching (Salmon, 2000), online community (Rheingold, 1994; Turkle, 1995), computer-supported collaborative learning (Dillenbourg, 1999; McConnell, 2000), online collaborative work (Sproull and Kiesler, 1995), communities of practice (Wenger 1998), and virtual teams (Lipnack and Stamps (2000). Some of this work is not highly theorised and our research draws on combinations, appropriate to specific contexts, of practiceand research-based literature. Much of the literature on online collaboration in education has focused on asynchronous discussion, but synchronous discussion in the form of text chat offers opportunities for self-documenting online meetings that occur in real time, enhancing community building and accelerating information flows within a team. Handel and Herbsleb (2002, 8) report on globally distributed work teams whose members used instant messaging to ‘co-ordinate projects and meetings, and to negotiate availability’. Salmon (2000) and Figallo and Rhine (2002), however, emphasise the limitations of chats for sustained reflective conversation in the absence of effective facilitation. Our article reports on how we analysed text chat by University of Cape Town (UCT) students in a simulated World Trade Organisation bargaining round that uses a blend of learning media and methods, including online text chats, bulletin boards and face-toface meetings. In the UCT context, characterised by many inequalities and with students drawn from very diverse backgrounds, we thought it was particularly important to study issues including if and how text chats can enhance participation and distribute argumentation roles. We explored peripheral participation in communities of practice on the understanding that such participation has an ‘inbound trajectory’ leading to full participation (as defined by Wenger, 1998, 100–101). We attempted in this study to answer four questions: 1. Did the text chats enhance student participation? 2. Were the text chats on-topic? 3. What roles did students play in the chats? 4. Did male and female students show different patterns of participation? The International Trade Bargaining (ITB) simulation is a third-year economics module, which we describe in more detail in the next section. In seeking a richer understanding of processes in the simulation, we drew on research by Wenger (1998) and Lave and Wenger (2002) on learning in communities of practice. Participants in the ITB simulation created a hyperactive, networked community of practice in trade bargaining. The students had to learn about the purposes and practices of trade bargaining if they were to achieve even minimal success in the simulation. The lecturers and tutors as initial core members of the simulation offered leadership from the beginning of the simulation. With limited exceptions, they modelled full participation in the practices of trade bargaining by consistently operating in their roles as World Trade Organization (WTO) officials. Students initially engaged in ‘peripheral participation’ as they grappled with the complex procedures of trade bargaining. Wenger (1998) distinguishes peripheral participation from marginal participation because the former leads towards full participation. Their peripheral participation in online chats within the ITB simulation 198 British Journal of Educational Technology Vol 35 No 2 2004 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2004. gave students access to a community of practice with low barriers to initial participation. A significant minority established themselves as core members of their bargaining groups and alliances and, in some cases, of the ITB as a whole. Method of analysing text chat data We chose Exchange Structure Analysis (ESA) as our method of analysing the chats because it involves relatively simple coding and provides insights into conversational roles and power relationships when used together with observation, survey and interview data. ESA investigates the dynamics of turn taking. A ‘turn’ is defined as a contribution by a particular participant and is delimited by that person starting and stopping speaking. The ESA categories defined by Kneser et al (2001) are based on Sinclair and Coulthard’s (1975) transactional analysis. Kneser et al define an exchange as a combination of Initiate and Respond moves, which together make up a classroom dialogue (see Table 1). ESA includes a set of moves (see Table 2), used to define argument roles, such as challenge, disagree and justify, clarify, feedback, inform, inquire and reason, as defined by Pilkington (1999). For example, a reason move can be any argument that includes a goal, purpose, problem, solution, cause, consequence, condition, support or contradiction, and a clarify move is a question requesting clarification of a previous statement (Pilkington, 1999). Figure 1 below is an example from a coding sheet showing ESA categories and moves: Further, individuals’ preferences for specific moves result in ESA roles: for example, a participant with a strong preference for the challenge move takes the role of critic, while one with a strong preference for the reason move takes the role of explainer. From peripheral to full participation in a blended trade bargaining simulation 199 © British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, 2004. Table 1: Initiate and Respond categories in ESA (after Kneser et al, 2001) Initiate (I): a contribution that anticipates a response and is not predicted from a previous turn. Respond (R): a contribution that is not initial, does not anticipate a turn and usually completes an exchange. Reinitiating (RI): a contribution that is a continuation of a current exchange and which anticipates a response, but which was not predicted from an earlier turn and which was not initial. Reinitiation can be negative feedback. Response-complement (RC): a contribution that can be acknowledgement, feedback or evaluation. Response-complement signals intention to close the exchange, although it can be followed by a new exchange. Stand alone (SA): contributions in which one participant continues to initiate, and where turns by the same speaker follow each other.

f223190099d1925b6f421d01f605adb16834d5cb	the ranking of scientists		To the Editor — The ranking of scientists is largely based on J. E. Hirsch’s index1 to measure “an individual’s scientific research output”. If a researcher’s papers are ranked in descending order by the number of times cited, cr, where r = 1, 2, ... N, then the Hirsch index, h, is the maximum r such that cr ≥ r. This measure boasts one clear advantage over the total number of citations, C, as a measure of scientific productivity: it doesn’t require knowledge of a scientist’s complete citation record. Unfortunately, although it reasonably ignores the tail of the citation record, its major drawback is that it neglects a researcher’s most cited works2,3 — giving it a reputation as an imprecise, but nonetheless useful metric of scientific productivity4. The problem arises when one tries to evaluate a scientist’s achievements based exclusively on this number. Indeed, in almost any physics department, you can find at least one prolific researcher with an h index greater than those of the most successful scientists of both bygone and recent years. By studying a representative sample of researchers from physics and complex systems extracted from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science (Core Collection) database (http://apps.webofknowledge.com) we found that h systematically favours long lists of modestly cited publications. Our sample contains 208 scientists with various citation records, at different stages of their academic careers. We include many highly cited researchers, enabling us to measure correlations in a wide range of citation data. Typically, citation datasets are highly heterogeneous (in particular, it is difficult to separate science administrators from active researchers), so a larger sample would not improve the statistics. Each dot in Fig. 1 shows how the ratio of h to its maximum possible value √C for one scientist relates to √C. The colour of a dot indicates the mean number of citations 〈c〉 = C/N per paper for the researcher, where N is their total number of papers. One can see that the bright dots tend to occur at the bottom of the plot, indicating that for a given C, on average, h decreases with increasing 〈c〉. We observe this trend everywhere except in the region of low C, in which h strongly fluctuates. We indicate the scientists’ names for some points in the figure, and it is easy to see that the region of small values of h/√C — corresponding to the worst possible h — is completely occupied by outstanding researchers5. To quantify this negative gradient we apply the method of least squares to this dataset, which provides the approximation 0.584 + 0.00023√C − 0.020√〈c〉 for h/√C. We find that the standard deviation is relatively small, 0.057, compared with the standard deviation, 0.091, from the average value 〈h/√C 〉 = 0.452 for our sample, so we can rely on this fit. The negative sign of the third term in the expression above confirms that for two researchers receiving the same total number of citations, the one with a higher number of publications has, on average, a higher h index. Consequently the Hirsch index is not merely imperfect, but it unfairly favours poorly performing scientists and punishes stronger researchers with a large mean number of citations per paper. The widespread acceptance of h as a measure of scientific productivity can be largely attributed to human nature. To compute your h index, you need only compare two numbers: the number of citations a paper receives and its rank. There is something particularly attractive in the point where these two numbers meet each other. Ironically, the fact that it is possible to manipulate and increase your h index by self-citing only adds to its charm. The more you publish, the easier it is to increase h in this way. So, if h does not provide a fair ranking, is it possible to rank scientists based on a simple metric? Numerous efforts to introduce a more reasonable measure by trying to include more detail sacrifice the charming simplicity of the Hirsch index2,6,7. Instead, we propose a new measure that focuses on a researcher’s most cited paper as an indicator of his or her major achievement — and good luck — but also accounts for h. We introduce the o index, which is based on two numbers that any researcher can remember: the h index and the number of citations to his or her most cited paper, m. The o index is the geometric mean of m and Ranking scientists	achievement;approximation;chromium;complex systems;enigma machine;extraction;genetic heterogeneity;gradient;index (publishing);large;least squares;name;order by;paper;silo (dataset);sorting;standard deviation;web of science;citation	Chunhua Weng;Andrew Goldstein;Chi Yuan;Zhiping Zhou	2018	Journal of biomedical informatics	10.1016/j.jbi.2018.02.006	data mining;information retrieval;computer science;ranking	ML	-78.22871404598563	-21.847120751494256	103407

The objectives of the study are to identify the customer loyalty, repurchase intention and positive word of mouth via online auctions in Taiwan. It hopes to study the relationship between e-service quality and e-recovery service quality dimensions toward bidder’s disconfirmation. The data was collected from 400 online auction bidders in Taipei, Taiwan. The result shows that there’s a direct link between satisfaction and customer’s loyalty, repurchase intention, and positive word of mouth. The findings might prove and help the online auction websites to gain a better knowledge of what measures they should take to increase the users’ loyalty towards the websites.

0f756a1ba560e620e63ca33b9765e054d3804b93	investigating regional prejudice in china through the lens of weibo		Regional prejudice is prevalent in Chinese cities where native residents and migrants from other parts of China lack mutual trust. Weibo users actively discuss and argue about the issue of migration, which provides a good source of data to examine the communication network regarding regional prejudice. We are interested in the posts and reposts related to the topic on migrants. In a Weibo repost, one can add new content in addition to the original post. Then both original and new content as a whole can be read by others. In particular, we focus on the reposts in response to native residents’ complaints about migrants. Based on the sentiment (negative or non-negative) and the direction (native resident(rightarrow )migrant or migrant(rightarrow )native resident), we classify the reposts into four categories. We find evidence of homophily in regional prejudice in the Weibo communication network: 72.7 % of the time, native residents’ complaints trigger more complaints from other native residents. What interests us most are the socioeconomic factors that can reverse the sentiment or direction of the original posts. A multinomial regression model of the reposting patterns reveals that in a city with better housing security and a larger migrant population, migrant Weibo users are much more likely to argue with native residents who hold a negative view about migrants. One important implication from our findings is that a secure socioeconomic environment facilitates the communication between migrants and native residents and helps break the self-reinforcing loop of regional prejudice.

Up to now, empirical research on IM use is still lacking. We conducted a qualitative study collecting interview data from a work group using IM for work purposes. We found that people have formed various patterns of IM adoption. Drawing on the theory of structure and agency, we explained that the adoption patterns are formed by both the group-level structures (peer pressure, social impact, managerial rules) and the individual-level agency factors (users’ free choice based on their technology use history, age, and use habits).	instant messaging	Jijie Wang;Michael J.

In the current study, the authors examined how cellular telephones have made it possible for members of romantically involved couples to keep track of each other. The authors surveyed 69 undergraduates on their use of cellular telephones as well as their relationships and their level of sexual jealously. Results find that nearly a quarter of romantically involved cellular telephone users report tracking their significant other, and evidence shows that tracking behavior correlates with jealousy. Furthermore, participants frequently reported using countermeasures such as turning off their cellular telephones in order to avoid being tracked by others. In conclusion, newer communication technologies afford users to act upon protectiveness and jealousy more readily than before these technologies were available to the general public. does lead to countless subtler changes that we experience in our day to day lives. Many of these changes are societal, psychological or behavioral. From an ethical point of view, these many changes present people with situations and choices with which they previously did not have any experience and for which there may not yet be societal norms (Moor, 2005). The recognition that technological innovations can have both positive and negative consequences is central to the wide ranging, interdisciplinary, and expanding field of technoethics. The pervasiveness of technology in human life makes it imperative that technoethical scholars hail from a vast range of fields (de Vries, 2009) as they collectively approach the DOI: 10.4018/jte.2011010104 44 International Journal of Technoethics, 2(1), 43-49, January-March 2011 Copyright © 2011, IGI Global. Copying or distributing in print or electronic forms without written permission of IGI Global is prohibited. ethical implications of technology, including areas as far reaching as environmental impact, political implications, and societal transformation (Luppicini, 2009). Technology in its end use directly impacts the thoughts and behaviors of individuals. Hence, psychology is a field that is well positioned to examine the impacts of technology on human functioning. Although the field of psychology has been neither organized nor systematic in its approach to technology (Kipnis, 1991), psychological research has a rich history in informing us of technology’s negative consequences (Stern & Handel, 2001). As far back as the 1940s, psychologists warned readers of the potential misuse of radio for wartime propaganda (Allport, 1947). In the early 1960s, psychologists studied the links between children’s television viewing and subsequent aggression (Eron, 1963). In the current age, psychologists have investigated the potentially numerous concerns regarding the Internet (e.g., Gackenbach, 1998; Kielser, 1997) including the potentially habit forming nature of the Internet (Stern, 1999; Young, 1998). Privacy, and the right to privacy are frequently cited (Luppicini, 2009) aspects of human social life that have been altered by technological change. In this paper, we examine some privacy related effects that have accompanied the mass introduction of cellular telephones. Because this technology impacts individuals as well as interactions between individuals, this research can be considered social psychological. Much of the psychological research on the effects of cellular telephones focuses on the effects of using cell phones while driving (Redelmeier & Tibshrani, 1997; Strayer & Johnston, 2001). This is quite understandable considering the well-established danger to self and others caused by driving while speaking on the telephone. There are, however, other psychological phenomena associated with the mass introduction of cellular telephones during the last two decades that deserve attention. Technological innovation can change or eliminate social norms. Crabb (1996), for instance, found that users of easily affordable camcorders were quick to invade the privacy of others, demonstrating a degradation of the civil inattentiveness norm (i.e., it is impolite to stare). Technological change can also lead to shifts in patterns of influence (Kipnis, 1991). The introduction of the Internet, for instance, has given medical patients easier access to information about pharmaceuticals and their potential side effects, in turn empowering them vis a vis their physicians. Closer to the topic at hand, Ling and Yttri (2006) have described how cellular telephones alter power relationships between teenagers and their parents. In his examination of technological design, Norman (1988) endorsed the useful notion of understanding the elements of our environment in terms of “affordances” or in other words “properties that determine...how a thing could possibly be used” (p. 8). Cellular telephones make it possible, for instance, to keep in touch with others who would not have access to a stable telephone. In turn, since the telephones are small and durable, they are also very portable. Finally, they are relatively cheap to purchase and use, so young people can typically afford to have one, and parents can afford to generously buy them for their children. These qualities afford the users the ability to carry cellular telephones on their person through much of the day. They also afford the users to be accessed remotely, as well as constantly. In fact, it may be normative to keep the phones turned on, yet acceptable, as with residential telephones, to break this norm and to screen calls (Crabb, 1999). At another level, we can also examine cellular telephones in terms of gratifications, or in other words, the instrumental needs that cellular telephones satisfy. While clearly satisfying our need to stay in touch with others, Leung and Wei (2000) also found that mobile phones satisfied people’s needs to stay in fashion, to maintain affectionate relationships, to relax, to do business, and to feel safe and secure. 5 more pages are available in the full version of this document, which may be purchased using the """"Add to Cart"""" button on the product's webpage: www.igi-global.com/article/cellular-telephones-socialinteractions/51640?camid=4v1 This title is available in InfoSci-Journals, InfoSci-Technology Adoption, Ethics, and Human Computer Interaction eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Educational Leadership, Administration, and Technologies eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Surveillance, Security, and Defense eJournal Collection, InfoSci-Select.

In particular, we examine if Cialdini’s six influence strategies have an effect on the three dimensions of need for uniqueness and if need for uniqueness further influences continuance intention of e-commerce shoppers. To achieve this, we carried out a study of 183 e-commerce shoppers. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), we developed a hypothetical path model using the data from the study. Our results show that the three dimensions of need for uniqueness explain about 22% of the variance in continuance intention of e-commerce shoppers. In addition, scarcity had the highest influence on the three dimensions of need for uniqueness. We further carried out a multi group analysis based on gender. Our results suggest that scarcity influences the decision of females to buy products that are not only unique, but also socially acceptable, while commitment influences males to buy unique and socially acceptable products.	e-commerce payment system	Ifeoma Adaji;Kiemute Oyibo;Julita Vassileva	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-78978-1_23	social psychology;computer science;e-commerce;scarcity;uniqueness;persuasion;group analysis;structural equation modeling;partial least squares regression;path analysis (statistics)	AI	-89.59854502685864	-12.390020036336278	103933

This research builds a model that hypothesizes that the user experiences from social interactions among users, operationalized as personalization, transparency, access to social resources, critical mass of social acquaintances, and risk, as well as with the technical features of the social media platform, operationalized as the completeness, flexibility, integration, and evolvability, influence user engagement and subsequent usage behavior. Using survey responses from 408 social media users, findings suggest that both social and technical factors impact user engagement and ultimately usage with additional direct impacts on usage by perceptions of the critical mass of social acquaintances and risk.

Thus far, the discussion on knowledge transfer has tended to be identifying the drivers and inhibitors for effective transfer such as the ability to transfer and receive of the individuals involved, and the context in which the sharing takes place. One question that has received relative little attention and that is central to effective knowledge transfer is when to use what type of transfer mechanism. We propose that all else being equal the choice of mechanisms is determined by the tacitness and embeddedness of the knowledge to be transferred. Knowledge with high degree of tacitness should be transferred by rich media, while knowledge with high embeddedness should be transferred by media with high transfer capacity.

We assemble a dataset of search and purchase behavior from eBay to quantify the returns, and thus implied costs, to consumer search on the internet. The extensive nature of the eBay data allows us to examine a rich and detailed set of questions related to search in a way that previous structural models cannot. In contrast to the literature, we find that consumers search a lot: on average 36 times per purchase over 3 (distinct) days, with most sessions ending in no purchase. We find that search costs are relatively low, in the region of 25 cents per search page. We pursue the analysis further by, i) examining how users refine their search, ii) how search behavior spans multiple search sessions, and iii) how the amount of search relates to finding lower prices.	internet	Thomas Blake;Chris Nosko;Steven Tadelis	2016		10.1145/2940716.2940754	economics;computer science;marketing;microeconomics;advertising;commerce	Web+IR	-85.48806347135799	-12.732195781290402	104412

We conducted a study of emerging social Q&A site Quora. First, we describe user activity on Quora by analyzing data across 60 question topics and 3917 users. Then we provide a rich understanding of issues of authority, reputation, and quality from in-depth interviews with ten Quora users. Our results show that primary sources of information on Quora are judged authoritative. Also, users judge the reputation of other users based on their past contributions.

It is necessary to understand user’s attitudes and behaviors toward an information system so as to evaluate the consequence of system implementation. Different from previous research, this study investigates user acceptance toward a newly introduced system from a behavioural economics perspective. Specifically, the study targets the effects of system usage outcomes on user satisfaction in a mandatory context where an old system is replaced by a new one. Based on the Prospect Theory, we argue that users evaluate the new system according to their perceptions from a value function, comparing their current system usage status with a reference point in terms of gain and loss. By describing a three-stage system switching process, this study unpacks how the usage outcomes of both the old and the new system and their contrasts affect perceived value toward the new system, which positively predicts user satisfaction. The system usage performances related to both the old and the new system are incorporated in the research model. Their joint effects, the main and the interacting effects, on user satisfaction with the new system are explicitly explored and explained. Findings of the study enable firms to better understand a system switching process and to design more effective managerial interventions for improving new system acceptance.	bellman equation;computer user satisfaction;information systems;information system;interaction;performance	Yue Feng;Kar Yan Tam	2013			simulation;computer user satisfaction;knowledge management;marketing	HCI	-88.92701536466527	-10.738962801439238	104587

This observations has been coined the productivity paradox. This paper meta-analytical methods to examine publication bias and size of ICT elasticity. The empirical part is based on a collection of more than 800 estimates of IT payoff effects from almost 70 studies written in the last 20 years. The meta-analysis reveals strong presence of publication bias within ICT productivity literature and using mixed effect multilevel model estimates the ICT elasticity to be only 0.3%, which is more than ten times smaller than what was reported by previous meta-analysis 10 years ago.

In order to better understand this phenomenon, a qualitative and a quantitative study are presented here that analyze the influence of immersive experiences on the online perceived value of the visit and on the potential responses of the visitor towards the site, the brand and the product. The author's study shows that virtual reality web sites generate episodes of immersion, which have an impact on the hedonic and utilitarian value of the visit experience. The author also shows that perceived value plays the role of mediator between the immersion and visitors' behavior and the author highlights the moderating effect of involvement and expertise on the relationship between immersion and perceived value. Finally, from theoretical and managerial points of view, our results offer perspectives on the perceived benefits of online' immersive experiences.	immersion (virtual reality)	Ahmed Anis Charfi	2014	IJOM	10.4018/IJOM.2014100102	psychology;multimedia;advertising;social psychology	HCI	-88.33297890309036	-13.570339001417507	105030

d12f06d4f451b4dd77d62b81b0fcc5409a9d88b5	the role of different tie strength in disseminating different topics on a microblog		The study of information flow typically does not distinguish the choices of tie strength on which the information flows. All receivers of the information are assumed to have the same potential to pass on the information. Modifying the SEIZ (susceptible, exposed, infected, skeptic) model, we discover that people choose to retweet strong or weak ties based on the topic. We made two modifications in the model. In the first modification (Model I), we assume that the contact rates of agents in different compartment and the probability of an agent transitioning from one compartment to another are different for strong ties and weak ties. In the second modification (Model II), we assume that only the probability of transitioning is different for strong ties and weak ties. We discover that people do not discriminate strong ties and weak ties when retweeting controversial topic, perhaps because this topic can both be personal and breaking news. On the other hand, people discriminate strong ties and weak ties when retweeting non-controversial topic. They prefer to retweet strong ties when the topic is donation, and kids, and weak ties when the topic is news on hurricane and music. Meanwhile, SEIZ model and its modifications are found to be inadequate to model tweets on event promotion.	multi-compartment model;reblogging	Felicia Natali;Kathleen M.

14cdf051fca1ccc0af03a4f40856fa8d645ec7be	rumor and truth spreading patterns on social network sites during social crisis: big data analytics approach		Social network sites give their users the ability to create contents and share it with others. During social crisis, the spread of false and true information could have profound impacts on users. Lack of prior studies to compare differences between diffusion patterns of rumors and truths during social crisis is the motivation of this study. In this study, we examine the role of information credibility, anxiety, personal involvement, and social ties on rumor and truth spread during social crisis. Building on the rumor theory, we propose a research model to examine differences between spread of rumors and truths. Using the Tweeter data collected during the Baltimore riots in 2015, we test the research model. Theoretical contributions and practical implications will be outlined based on the findings of the study. We anticipate findings will provide new avenues of research by determining characteristics of truths and rumors in online contexts.	social network	Mehrdad Koohikamali;Dan J.

One of the arguments put forward by Leydesdorff and Vaughan turns out to depend crucially on incorrect multidimensional scaling maps that are due to an error in the PROXSCAL program in SPSS.

For both forms of inequality, people most easily meet contacts in occupations dominated by their own categories (e.g., women are more likely to meet nurses as they are overrepresented in nursing; likewise, dominant ethnic groups are more likely to meet managers and CEOs, being overrepresented in high-status roles). Yet we also find distinctive patterns: childcare is a major factor influencing women’s contact with teachers, cashiers, and cleaners. Education is a major ocial capital inequality ingapore factor affecting ethnic groups’ unequal access to contacts such as professors and bankers, cleaners and taxi drivers. Examining the intersection of gender and ethnicity, we find Malay men have less access to contacts in high-status occupations compared with Malay women, Non-Malay men, and Non-Malay women. Moreover, a university education accrues social capital at a slower rate for Malay men than for the other combinations of gender and ethnicity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

af00228c672deef7ac0e9ef91fb2b43c15bde7db	understanding interactions between municipal police departments and the public on twitter		Law enforcement agencies have started using social media for building community policing, i.e., establishing collaborations between the people in a community and local police departments. Both researchers and practitioners need to understand how the two parties interact on social media on a daily basis, such that effective strategies or tools can be developed for the agencies to better leverage the platforms to fulfill their missions. In this paper, we collected 9,837 tweets from 16 municipal police department official Twitter accounts within 6 months in 2015 and annotated them into different strategies and topics. We further examined the association between tweet features (e.g., hashtags, mentions, content) and user interactions (favorites and retweets) by using regression models. The models reveal surprising findings, e.g., that the number of mentions has a negative correlation with favorites. Our findings provide insights into how to improve interactions between the two parties.	interaction	Yun Huang;Qunfang Wu	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-78105-1_5	community policing;leverage (finance);law enforcement;public relations;social media;business	NLP	-81.6891789555639	-17.606235300673802	105485

Unlike the bi-directional relationships on traditional SNS sites (such as Facebook), connections on most microblogging platforms (such as Twitter) is one-directional, by which users choose others to “follow” and each user has her own group of “followers”. Such asymmetric relationships are particularly ubiquitous between celebrities and their fans. This study investigated the impacts of microblogging users’ various celebrity-following activities from a social capital perspective. The results of a large-scale survey provided supportive evidence to our theoretical research model, i.e., microblogging users’ one-directional celebrity-following activities could increase their perceived social capital and such influences are mediated by their parasocial interactions with the celebrities.	interaction;social capital	Yue Ding;Lingyun Qiu;Dong Li	2012			public relations;social science;social capital;computer science;microblogging;socioeconomics;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-86.97580220241403	-14.449775978215882	105534

Here, we combine these two approaches to shed light on the opinion evolution dynamics in Egypt during the summer of 2013 along two axes (Islamist/Secularist, pro/anti-military intervention). We intend to find traces of opinion changes in Egypt's population, paralleling those in the international community - which oscillated from sympathetic to condemnatory as civil clashes grew. We find little evidence of people """"switching"""" sides but observe clear changes in volume with both pro- and anti-military camps becoming more active at different stages.  Our work contributes new insights into the dynamics of large protest movements, specially in the aftermath of the main events - rather unattended previously. It questions the standard narrative concerning a simplistic mapping between Secularist/pro-military and Islamist/anti-military.

This study reports a panel data analysis on 181 countries observed from 2010 to 2013, to assess country-level predictors of Facebook adoption. The findings show that the spread of such a global SNS decelerates as perceptions of democratic governance deteriorate above and beyond socioeconomic and infrastructural development. Nevertheless, once dictatorship fails to maintain socio-political stability, the diffusion of Facebook accelerates to a greater extent than in democracy. This trend could transcend institutional constraints, as well as socioeconomic developments, because of widespread proliferation of mobile phone use in addition to increasing wireless or shared connectivity in urban areas.	mobile phone	Shin Haeng Lee	2015	First Monday		public relations;urbanization;social media;economics;computer science;socioeconomics;advertising;world wide web	ML	-85.43167796139272	-14.07257861321353	105775

But product reviews vary in the degree to which people perceive them to be credible. Research questions: (1) To what extent does a product review's environment-a retailer or brand site-affect review users' ratings of that review's credibility? (2) To what extent does review valence (positive versus negative) affect review users' ratings of review credibility? (3) What is the strength of the relationship among credibility and its two main components, trustworthiness and expertise? Literature review: Recent research has made clear the spread and the influence of user-generated comments and, thus, the need for sophistication in handling it. Review credibility has two main components: trustworthiness (which equates to honesty or sincerity) and expertise (which equates to accuracy). Prior research also shows the effects of valence (positivity or negativity) in reviews, noting that negative reviews have more influence than positive reviews on readers' perceptions of review credibility and purchasing decisions. Methodology: We tested the effect of a consumer review's environment (brand or retailer site) and the effect of review valence (positive or negative) on the perceived credibility of that review, as well the degree of correlation among credibility, trustworthiness, and expertise. Through an online survey, we exposed respondents to the same review text with different star ratings (4-star and 2-star) in two types of sites: brand and retailer. We asked participants to evaluate the review's credibility, trustworthiness, and expertise. In half of the exposures, participants evaluated a review in the site of a high-credibility company (Apple or Amazon), and in the other half of exposures, participants evaluated a review in the site of a midlevel-credibility company (Dell or Walmart). Results and conclusions: Credibility strongly correlated with both trustworthiness and expertise. Participants rated 4-star reviews as more credible than 2-star reviews on high-credibility sites, but star ratings had no impact on midlevel credibility sites. We found no difference between ratings of reviews displayed on brand and retailer sites for midlevel-credibility companies but a small difference between reviews displayed on brand and retailer sites for high-credibility companies. Professional communicators should attend to reviews posted both to retailer and brand sites. Conclusions: Professional communicators charged with managing user-generated content need not spend resources on channeling it into retailer and other independent review site environments as opposed to brand site environments. Our findings indicate that professional communicators looking to identify credible reviews should attend to review valence, or the positivity or negativity of a review. When managing user-generated product reviews, they should try to make credible content more noticeable to review users.	negativity (quantum mechanics);purchasing;review site;trust (emotion);user-generated content	Jo Mackiewicz;Dave Yeats;Thomas Thornton	2016	IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication	10.1109/TPC.2016.2527249	public relations;media;computer science;marketing;advertising;user-generated content;management;world wide web	HCI	-88.89527363691425	-13.375826211927496	106140

Teleworking, the practice of setting up home offices for employees with appropriate resources for computing and communication, is one example of this new flexibility. Teleworking brings new challenges as well as benefits, and a variety of studies have examined the impact of teleworking in terms of costs and benefits. A major attraction for teleworkers is the control it allows them over the way they structure their work and lives. However, the intrusion of work into the home blurs the boundaries between work and home life and may result in conflict between work and family. This work-family conflict is a direct result of the mutual incompatibility between the demands of work and family roles (Akdere, 2006). The aim of this research is to study the work-family balance of Malaysian teleworkers by exploring the nature of interactions between work and family activities, in order to get a better understanding of the experience of teleworkers in balancing their work and family life. This study will use the work-family border theory (Clark, 2000) to describe the phenomenon, and to explain how individuals manage and negotiate the work and family spheres and the borders between them in order to attain balance.	blurred vision;disabled persons;experience;post-traumatic stress disorder;telecommuting	Nafishah Othman Shafiz	2009	Computer and Information Science		knowledge management;work;balance	HCI	-79.24232273103522	-11.094619853605215	106370

However, users may have varying degrees of preferences to different functions and tasks that can be accomplished using a single technology. In order to investigate this phenomenon, this study adopts a previous study by Gefen and Straub (2000) as a reference point and uses Internet technology to investigate two tasks: information search and online purchasing. The current study provides a more comprehensive picture of applying task behaviours by decomposing each variable in the technology acceptance model (TAM) according to the two online tasks. The proposed model was tested with survey data from 435 respondents. Results demonstrate that TAM holds its explanatory utility very well when applied to task behaviours. Convergent and discriminant validities indicate that each task possesses its own characteristics and variables. A structural equation modelling test was performed and the results show that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness have significant relationships with intention only within its task but not outside. As a result, our results outperform those reported in the baseline study of Gefen and Straub. It is therefore advisable for organizations in deploying technology to delineate user behaviour by tasks and explore the impact of the technology on individual tasks.	baseline (configuration management);discriminant;ibm tivoli access manager;information system;internet;multi-function printer;purchasing;structural equation modeling;usability	Achita Muthitacharoen;Prashant C.

The sale of mobile phones has exceeded those of personal computers. India is the second largest telecommunication network in the world in terms of number of wireless connections after China. Telecom companies are ready to tap a large unexplored market in India with lucrative offerings. Smart phones sale are at its peak. 3G technology is also ready to play a lead role in mobile revolution. Due to the low average life of the mobile phones, lack of awareness among users and in absence of government policies, mobile waste is accumulating in vast amount in India. Without a proper system of recycling, the unsafe disposal is causing a variety of environmental and health problems. This paper discusses the various issues related to the worldwide growth of mobile phones, the insecure methods of disposal and the regulations and policies in India. We intend to put forward some challenges and advices.

a67e1fe5ac29cf1d87a9d17d855eef8f7ff3cfb2	using social media to assess neighborhood social disorganization: a case study in the united kingdom		Urban communities can benefit from behavior regulation of their members in the interest of collective values. The absence of such control is related to the concept of social disorganization and is hypothesized to be associated with crime and anti-social behavior in neighborhoods. Social disorganization is, however, hard to quantify due to the lack of data and the inherent complexity that emerges from social interactions. Notably, geolocated social media provides a real-time assessment of places via the examination of the digital footprints left by users. In this paper, we introduce a measure for social disorganization by analyzing geotagged posts on Twitter. We propose to characterize the social disorganization of a place by evaluating the entropy of individuals’ opinions about certain subjects. As a case study, we used tweets related to football in the UK, given its ubiquity in that country, which makes its supporters as proxies for the social characteristics of those places. We found that our proposed measure can reasonably explain the variation of the occurrence of crime across regions in UK and that our measure better explains the variation of crime among places with higher social disorganization.	digital footprint;geotagging;interaction;proxy server;real-time transcription;social media	Diogo Ferreira Pacheco;Marcos A.

Moreover, the paper also presents the analysis performed to determine the number of visits received by the articles promoted to the featured status. We have analyzed the visits not only in the month when articles awarded the promotion or were included in the main page, but also in the previous and following ones. The main aim for this is to assess the attention attracted by the featured content and the different dynamics exhibited by each community of users in respect to the promotion process. The main results of this paper are twofold: it shows how to extract relevant information related to the use of Wikipedia, which is an emerging research topic, and it analyzes whether the featured articles mechanism achieve to attract more attention.	home page;information source;paging;wiki;wikipedia	Antonio J.

Such games offer players a style of gameplay—often without an ending and with a free-to-play model—that is quite different from other types of games. In addition, new audiences and demographics are being exposed to this type of games and are playing them. How do players decided what is fair and unfair in such games? How do they cheat? This study begins the process of answering those questions by examining how the definition of cheating and its practices have evolved with the rise in popularity of Facebook games. The answers indicate that players often dismiss the seriousness of social network games, and thus cheating was either not needed or not a part of gameplay expectations.	social network	Irene Serrano Vazquez;Mia Consalvo	2015	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444813516835	video game design;games;the internet;simulation;turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games;marketing;emergent gameplay;game mechanics;media studies;multimedia;sociology;game studies;advertising;law;social network	ECom	-83.94984675064602	-17.347831134347906	107125

In today's world, marketers use many data sources to analyze the behavior and responses of their consumers. This mainly involves data from Point of Sales, consumer surveys or home visits. However, with the advancement of web technologies, there is one more place where data is available: User generated content (UGC) from Web 2.0 applications. The purpose of this conceptual paper is to formulate hypotheses for the interrelationship between user generated content on the Internet and brand marketing and promotional effectiveness of a firm or campaign.	internet;user-generated content;web 2.0	Stefan Koch;Özgür Elçiseven	2012				Web+IR	-87.13081173170814	-12.454429614827276	107185

Multidimensional scaling showed that the choices of the participants were formed as three main regions: telephone services, luxuries of life and necessities of life. Axes interpretation gave similar results, with the addition of a biology/technology dimension. The participants also ranked these products in terms of their personal necessity and entertainment. The rankings corresponded largely to a pattern found for a larger US sample. One particular exception was education, which in Sweden was seen more favourably in terms of necessity and entertainment. Cluster analysis showed that education and type of employment could to some extent explain the choices relating to necessity and of entertainment.	cluster analysis;image scaling;information appliance;multidimensional scaling	Bo N.

Scholars typically explain this pattern of results with one of two arguments. Some contend that perceptual factors—namely, the difficulties that buyers have in making sense of category spanners—contribute to the observed pattern of devaluation. Others argue that the penalty for category-spanning stems from the fact that those who do not focus their efforts narrowly tend to offer products that are of lower quality. Because these two mechanisms often co-occur, it has been difficult to provide definitive evidence of the perceptually driven component of the multiple-category penalty. We employ a natural experiment on a peer-to-peer crowd-funding website to address this gap. Difference-in-difference analyses on matched samples show that category spanning is perceived negatively and can result in devaluation, even in the absence of underlying quality differences. This result supports the argument that perceptual issues contribute to the penalty for category spanning.		Ming D. Leung;Amanda J.

Social networking sites such as Facebook provide individuals with opportunities to express and gather information relevant to their self-concept. Previous theoretical work yielded contrasting assumptions about a potential link between individuals’ Internet use and their self-concept clarity, that is, individuals’ perception of a clear and internally consistent self-concept content. Focusing on social networking sites, our aim was to provide cross-sectional as well as longitudinal evidence regarding the relationship between individuals’ feelings of connectedness to Facebook (Facebook intensity) and self-concept clarity. Two cross-sectional studies (N1 = 244; N2 = 166) and one longitudinal study (N3 = 101) are presented. Independent samples of adolescents, adults, and students from Austria participated. The statistical procedures included hierarchical regression analyses (Studies 1 and 2) and a cross-lagged panel analysis (Study 3).

Because of this, a considerable amount of time can be spent every day managing one’s inbox. Previous work has shown that people adopt different strategies for managing their inbox. However, there has been little work examining how the choice of email management strategy impacts the total time that one gives to email activities each day. In the current study seven academics spent one week trying out different email management strategies: either a once-a-day strategy or a frequent strategy. Data on the amount of time spent managing email and subjective feelings towards each strategy were gathered. Results suggest that a once a day email management strategy may be effective in reducing the total time spent dealing with email.	email;expectation propagation;inbox by gmail	Adam Bradley;Duncan P.

In this digital era, the Internet has been recognized as an important medium for improving health literacy. However, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie its impact on health literacy. With a general basis in the Cognitive Mediation Model, this study empirically tested a model that included motivation for health-related Internet use, health-related Internet use, perceived health information overload, and health literacy. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the US-based Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 2013 dataset. The results support for all the paths in our posited model. The effects of motivation for health-related Internet use on health literacy were completely mediated by health-related Internet use and perceived health information overload. The findings extend the Cognitive Mediation Model to the context of health literacy and provide significant implications for the design and dissemination of online health information. Recommendations are made for future research, including further validation of the five-item scale of health literacy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we regarded the use of instant messaging in team collaboration as a social behavior and examined the changing roles of social influence processes in the formation of usage we-intention (i.e. social intention). Building on the belief-desire-intention model and the social influence theory, an integrated model was developed and empirically tested using survey data collected from 482 students. The results demonstrated that desire partially mediates the effects of group norm and social identity on we-intention to use. In addition, the effect of group norm is more significant for users with lower usage experience, whereas the effect of social identity is more significant for users with higher usage experience. We believe this study provides several important implications for both research and practice.	belief–desire–intention model;instant messaging;norm (social);web 2.0	Xiao-Liang Shen;Christy M. K.

96839555818596b2600692e0e9f069f9ce39b346	a survey of using multiple affiliations by scholars in scientific articles		In recent years, some scholars use multiple affiliations in their papers due to financial supports from different institutes and universities that are beyond common collaborations. The organizations are interested in employing highly cited professors to climb their rank in the world. Regarding this important issue, a survey prepared and shared among 300 scholars to ask their opinion about addressing several universities or institutes as affiliation in scientific papers. The researchers with at least an M.Sc. degree were from 54 different countries while 77 % of them have published at least 1 ISI paper. Finally, 6 % of the scholars from 11 countries including Italy, Iran, Malaysia, Oman, UAE, Pakistan, Portugal, Brazil, India, Algeria, and Australia returned the filled forms. All of the selected scientists had, at least, three ISI papers. The results of the survey were analyzed using SPSS software. The survey demonstrated that the proposed topic is a controversial issue. As all of the respondents believed that financial support is one of the most important parts of the research as scientists need it to develop their ideas and continue their research. Furthermore, they had an optimistic attitude about everything that helps the researchers to develop their ideas. However, just 16.67 % of the respondents believe that adding the other institute affiliations due to financial support is ethical. In contrast, others pointed out that if there is only funding from other institutes, the ‘‘Acknowledgment’’ section would be well adequate to appreciate the financial resource.	acknowledgment index;information sciences institute;spss;scientific literature	Mohammad Reza Safaei;Marjan Goodarzi;Omid Mahian;Mahidzal B.

In particular, the computer-mediated interaction affects customers’ perceived accessibility into self-services. Thus, we posed the following research question: “How does an individual’s ability to use a computer influence the need for direct person-to-person interaction in services?” The study is based on a postal survey conducted in south-eastern Finland. Data were collected using a random sample of N = 3,000 people ranging from 60 to 90 years of age. A total of 1,121 valid responses were received. The data were slightly biased towards respondents who are coping well. We employed structural equation modelling with a multi-group moderation approach in the analysis. The findings indicate that satisfaction is related to routines in the service process. Customers’ ability to perform the requisite role in the service process influences their preference for human interaction. Interestingly, the value of human interaction is driven by customers’ expected abilities, whereas physical restrictions have a minor influence. We contribute to the literature explaining co-creation in computer-mediated services by applying human behaviour models to assess the customers’ value expectations.	accessibility;behavioral modeling;experience;postal;structural equation modeling	Mika Immonen;Sanna Sintonen;Jouni Koivuniemi	2018	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.10.005	coping (psychology);social psychology;moderation;structural equation modeling;consumer behaviour;psychology;research question;service system;communication channel	HCI	-89.58770975228059	-10.241628740858392	108155

268431763e5a4a52d05d699a3daebe89d5cef908	who is better adapted in learning online within the personal learning environment? relating gender differences in cognitive attention networks to digital distraction		Abstract In response to increasing concerns about digital distraction, we bridged peopleu0027s cognitive attention to digital distraction within the personal learning environment (PLE). Gender differences were investigated in college studentsu0027 media-related perceived attention problems (PAP) and their attention self-regulatory strategies (SRS). Also examined were the gender moderating effects on the correlations of attention problems and regulatory strategies with six dimensions of social media usage and four cognitive- and adjustment-related criteria: online search strategies, media-multitasking self-efficacy (MMSE), positive/negative self-esteems, and academic achievement. Participants were 771 undergraduate and graduate students from 10 universities in Taiwan. Gender measurement invariance was established in the research instrument. Males exhibited higher PAP than females. Females demonstrated more versatile strategy use to regulate their attention with increased social media use, while males applied more behavioral strategies over social media use as disorientation increased during online searches. Higher MMSE was associated with higher executive and orienting problems for females, and higher alerting problems for males. Higher orienting problems was associated with more negative self-esteem for males. Females with higher PAP reported poorer academic achievement. Implications for practical intervention of PAPs are discussed for each gender group to promote college studentsu0027 psychological well-being with regard to social media use and learning performance.

We examined eight communities across Canada, each with differing levels of traditional local media access (television, radio, and print). We wanted to discover, particularly in communities underserved by traditional local media, whether Twitter would help to fill an information gap during election time by helping to spread locally relevant political information. Preliminary analysis has revealed that most information shared on Twitter accounts in our eight communities was national rather than local in scope. Influencers, as identified by the number of @-mentions, tended to be national, rather than local, and general activity on Twitter did not reflect overall population of an area, or any specific locally important issue. Thus we conclude that despite its potential, Twitter is currently not a useful counterbalance for a declining local traditional news environment in smaller communities across Canada.	community;counterbalance device component;information retrieval;small;television	Jaigris Hodson;April Lindgren	2017		10.1145/3097286.3097325	politics;influencer marketing;advertising;public relations;population;general activity;political science	Web+IR	-80.83158659085547	-15.979872144109615	108393

This study, based on social comparison theory, examined a psychological pathway from individual characteristics to selfie-editing behavior through social comparison. It was hypothesized that selfie-taking, public self-consciousness, social media use, and satisfaction with facial appearance would indirectly influence selfie-editing through social comparison of appearance (with friends or social media influencers/celebrities). A two-wave longitudinal online survey was conducted in South Korea among female smartphone users aged 20 to 39 (N 1⁄4 1064 at Wave 1 and 782 at Wave 2). The results revealed that frequent selfie-taking, higher levels of public self-consciousness, and more use of social media at Wave 1 were associated with social comparison with friends at Wave 1, which increased selfie-editing behavior at Wave 2.

Web analytics industry also has been growing rapidly. Web analytics is to analyze web log files to discover accessing patterns of web pages. In our work described in this paper, we identify factors which can affect the continuous usage intention of a firm using services in Web Analytics service and empirically validate the relationships between the identified factors. For this purpose, we analyze 174 Korea firms. The analysis results show that the satisfaction is significantly associated with service quality and switching cost and the service usage period is not significantly associated with continuous service usage intention. We measure service quality using SERVQUAL. It turn out that two dimensions of SERVQUAL, reliability and empathy are significantly associated with satisfaction, but another dimension of SERVQUAL, responsibility, is not. Finally, satisfaction is significantly associated with continuous service usage intention.	blog;data logger;quality of service;servqual;www;web analytics;web page;web service;world wide web	Jaesung Park;Kyung Ho Jung;Yunhee Lee;Geon Cho;Jae Jon Kim;Joon Koh	2009	2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2009.939	analytics;web analytics;web standards;marketing;ws-policy;multimedia;business;web intelligence;world wide web	Web+IR	-90.62088926035534	-11.575375442470857	108725

Here, we propose to study individual performance and success in Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games. Our purpose is to identify those behaviors and playing styles that are characteristic of players with high skill level and that distinguish them from other players. To this aim, we study Defense of the ancient 2 (Dota 2), a popular MOBA game. Our findings highlight three main aspects to be successful in the game: (i) players need to have a warm-up period to enhance their performance in the game; (ii) having a long in-game experience does not necessarily translate in achieving better skills; but rather, (iii) players that reach high skill levels differentiate from others because of their aggressive playing strategy, which implies to kill opponents more often than cooperating with teammates, and trying to give an early end to the match.	dota 2;social network;social system;virtual world	Anna Sapienza;Hao Peng;Emilio Ferrara	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)	10.1109/ICDMW.2017.124	battle;machine learning;artificial intelligence;management science;computer science;social system;social network	DB	-89.43902853644052	-22.517430506910102	108866

5863ce57f2907e39aa1f6dfd3efd581491b1f503	1st troll battalion: influencing military and strategic operations through cyber-personas		The Twenty-First Century has seen the dawn of the Internet as a pervasive medium by which nearly all information flows. However, the permissive environment in which the Internet was founded fostered a community plagued by Internet trolls, individuals who deliberately post inflammatory, off-topic, or offensive material on online message boards to elicit angst, or other emotions, from their targets. Then American adversaries weaponized information using trolling, and stories of its increased use and technology to influence behavior dominated headlines over the past year. Foreign influence in cyberspace directed towards the 2016 Presidential Election demonstrates how trolling has changed the political environment in the United States. Americans are vulnerable to the influence of these foreign actors, and most troubling, some will not realize foreign intelligence services target their online activities. Adversaries leverage access through Internet trolling to shift public opinion in a new and original way by distributing politically charged narratives and suppressing the free exchange of ideas through a variety of means. By combining cyber operations, information warfare, and military intelligence with automated infrastructure in one military unit, the Troll Battalion, leaders can influence military operations by shaping adversaries' social and political environments while protecting Americans from the effects of foreign trolls. The practical application of influencing strategic and tactical outcomes via cyber-personas requires further analysis for use on the battlefield, and the protection and defense of American leaders, institutions, and persons must also be analyzed to protect Americans from information warfare.	baseline (configuration management);cyberspace;internet troll;knowledge spillover;list of code lyoko episodes;noise shaping;off topic;pervasive informatics;the fight: lights out	Stephen W.

The results suggest that while both perceived ease of use and usefulness were influential factors in system utilisation at the user level, it was perceived usefulness that was the more influential factor The study also provides evidence that the processes by which an inter-organizational information system is accepted in one organisation have an impact on the acceptance of the same system in the other organisations. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the framework of uses and gratifications with social cognitive theory, we conducted a survey (N = 164) of Facebook game players and identified four motivations and unpacked play into seven different types. We then looked at the relationships between motivations, types of play, and individual characteristics such as gender, age, and cultural differences. We found that motivations previously identified as being “social” split into two categories: building common ground with existing acquaintances, and design-driven reciprocal behavior. Building common ground was associated with stronger use of space customization, spending real money, communicating about game achievements, and exchanging gifts. However, we found that more people were using the games as a coping mechanism and to pass time rather than using it for social purposes. Individual differences are also discussed.

In particular, weblogs are a popular option for personal expression via the Internet. Perhaps this means of communication is well suited to bypassing deficits in social interaction and communication that characterize ASD. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionaries [10], we compared blogs of individuals with ASD to the writing of neurotypical (NT) bloggers. We found that rates of word usage were nearly identical in the two groups with one exception - there was more variation in the use of social words in ASD compared to NT blogs. This similarity in language between ASD and NT authors suggests that communication deficits routinely found in people with ASD may be due to the social context in which their communication skills are tested, and that the affordances of asynchronous computer-mediated communication may offer alternative means of testing and expression.	blog;computer-mediated communication;dictionary;internet	A.

de1d7c9a20bb0ac1fcf5df0e72262ef0e2e5eeb7	a conjoint study of the relationship between website attributes and consumer purchase intentions	conjoint analysis;customer satisfaction;e commerce;digital certificate	Many scholars have developed different conceptual models to capture effects of factors on consumers’ preferences for on-line shopping websites (e.g., Ranganathan and Gananpathy, 2002; Schaupp and Belanger, 2005; Shih, 2004; Straub and Watson, 2001) because the on-line shopping website has become one of the major interfaces between companies and their consumers. A review of extant literatures suggests that a survey method has been widely used. However, a survey method used for exploring consumers’ preferences for on-line shopping websites may bear potential problems of validity and transferability due to respondents’ potential lack of both the knowledge and experience associated with on-line technologies. To address the above problem, a refined methodology is imperative in the investigation into on-line shopping experiences. In this paper, we extended and modified the Schaupp and Belanger model (2005) to develop and propose a model of on-line shopping intentions that includes three categories of factors: technology, shopping, and product. Next, we developed four on-line websites that incorporate and operationalize the relevant factors to serve as test platforms. All respondents of this study were asked to visit these web-sites that represent differing shopping scenarios before they completed our on-line survey. By simulating different shopping scenarios on our four test platforms, prior experiences of respondents are not required in this study. Findings of this study are as follows. First, on-line contract signing mechanism was ranked as the most desired option in building trust in on-line shopping websites by all respondents. Second, respondents of this study were found able to be categorized into three groups according to the website factors they valued most. The three were logistic/security, security/trust, and convenience/trust. The specific attributes of on-line shopping websites valued most within each of the three groups are discussed in this paper. This study presents findings that support the use of many existing on-line technologies that have been found little used in on-line shopping websites such as digital certificate and on-line contracting. The inclusion of these technologies in on-line shopping websites may increase the cost of building and maintaining them and may create worries about user inconvenience. However, it is important that these technologies increase the attractiveness of the on-line shopping website and web surfers purchase intentions.	categorization;imperative programming;online and offline;online shopping;public key certificate;simulation;ws-trust	Yinh-Hueih Chen;Ching-Yi Tsao;Chia-Chen Lin;I-Chieh Hsu	2008			public key certificate;survey methodology;e-commerce;marketing;conjoint analysis;conceptual model;operationalization;conjoint analysis;customer satisfaction;advertising;computer science	HCI	-89.33548463327408	-11.445443711701776	109601

Emerging evidence indicates that social comparison may mediate the relationship between Facebook use and young people's body dissatisfaction. Yet, little work has been done on how these relationships evolve over time in adolescence and no study has examined the reciprocal relationships between passive Facebook use, social comparison, and adolescents' body dissatisfaction. To examine these reciprocal relationships, two-wave panel data (NTime1 = 1840) gathered among adolescents (ages 12–19) were analyzed. Cross-lagged structural equation models indicated that passive Facebook use at Time 1 predicted increases in boys' comparison on Facebook at Time 2. Comparison on Facebook at Time 2, in turn, was associated with more body dissatisfaction at Time 2. In addition, body dissatisfaction at Time 1 predicted increases in comparison on Facebook at Time 2. Comparison on Facebook at Time 2, in turn, was related to more passive Facebook use at Time 2, but less passive Facebook use over time. No gender differences were found for these opposite pathways. The discussion focuses on the explanation and understanding of these findings.

Crowdsourcing contest is a typical case of crowdsourcing and has been adopted by many organisations for business solution and decision making. From a participant's perspective, it is interesting to explore what motivates people to participate in crowdsourcing contest. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the category of motivation based on self-determination theory and synthesises various motivation factors in crowdsourcing contest. Meanwhile, perceived motivational affordances and task granularity are also examined as the moderate constructs.

a413e0b747039f163d57189bd4c1bf0dc36a62d8	understanding the role of interpersonal identification in online review evaluation: an information processing perspective		While the proliferation of online reviews has increased consumers’ access to resources for informing the purchase decision, it has also substantially increased the cognitive effort required for finding personally relevant information through this channel. In the face of this challenge, an increasingly valuable capability of online review platforms relates to delivering the right reviews to the right consumer at the right time. Many platforms have sought to develop this capability by leveraging generic review characteristics like recency and valence, or crowdlevel performance metrics like helpfulness score. While useful, these approaches may be overlooking important individual-to-individual (dyadic) social mechanisms that underpin review evaluation and selection. In an effort to inform the development of more robust information management capabilities of online review platforms, we introduce and test a model that highlights the influence of dyadic social information processing in online review evaluation. Results from model testing support most of the hypotheses and reveal important social selection mechanisms consumers employ in this context, which could be leveraged to add additional value through online		Joshua M.

6192c551d6c1360384393d84aea54a62d52f7959	the antecedents of buyers' perceived justice in online markets		The success of a business largely depends upon customers' intentions to continue to purchase, but this can be a challenge for vendors in online markets. This study proposes a model which identifies an initial set of justice antecedents and evaluates their relation to perceived justice, trust, and repurchase intention in online markets. The theoretical model is tested by using structural equation modeling on a data set of 424 buyers in Yahoo! Kimo online auction market. The results demonstrate that three dimensions of justice (distributive, procedural, and interactional) are positively and significantly related to trust, which in turn affects buyers' intention to repurchase. Moreover, among the three dimensions of justice judgments, distributive justice and interactional justice are relatively more important than procedural justice in predicting buyers' trust in sellers. In terms of the antecedents of justice, this study provides evidence that product quality and delivery performance are significantly related to distributive justice, while information quality and contact channel are important antecedents of procedural justice. This study also finds that responsiveness is important in enhancing buyers' judgments of interactional justice.

Studying a group of four virtual communities, the findings show that community members invoke a variety of institutional carriers in order to try to legitimate actual centralized governance structures, which contradict their stated intentions of building decentralized decision making. The research illustrates in the micro-level how an institutionalized social structure is seen as meaningful by social actors in spite of being the opposite of what community members would rhetorically defend. The study explores how institutional carriers become sanction and legitimating mechanisms, which influence the reproduction of institutionalized behavior in virtual interactions, concluding on the relevance of understanding the institutional context to make sense of behavior patterns, which emerge from interactions in online environments in general and virtual communities in particular.	centralisation;centralized computing;ibm power systems;interaction;multi-level governance;online and offline;online community;pervasive informatics;powell's method;relevance;scientific literature;social structure;value (ethics);virtual community;virtual reality	Magda David Hercheui	2011				HCI	-80.75551034825631	-13.469476441312453	110223

Personal home pages are not, however, the only way in which scientists present themselves through technology construction and use—nor even the primary way. In this paper, we examine the technologies that oceanographers use to manage professional identity within their sociotechnical networks.	sociotechnical system;software developer;web page;world wide web	Roberta Lamb;Elizabeth J.

By doing so, it sought to promote geographic community engagement. Initially, this paper presents an overview of the scheme since its inception and review the current geographic community groups participating in the scheme. To date the scheme has had limited success in attracting a critical mass of communities that value the promoted benefits of social networks in this format, with only 154 community websites across Australia. While it has not achieved the expected level of uptake, the scheme has shown some potential in developing community engagement online. One example of these websites harnessing offline experiences and using shared bonds to establish and enhance social networks occurred during the Victorian bushfires in January/February 2009. Geography-specific community websites allowed individuals to connect during this tragic event — sharing experiences and coordinating re-building efforts. Six months on from the bushfires, many of the community websites based in affected areas showed high levels, when ‘owned’ by the community, of activity and interaction between community members, demonstrating effective and meaningful social networks in action.	experience;online and offline;social network;virtual community	Mark Bruce Freeman;Alison Freeman	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society	10.1109/ISTAS.2010.5514611	public relations;community organization;geography;socioeconomics;community building;advertising	HCI	-81.1644219769787	-13.647030797835379	110650

Much literature about such communities describes them as environments based on user-generated content, while the role of their management is frequently overlooked. This study shifts the focus from community members to managers, and demonstrates the centrality of managers in terms of content production, initiation of and contribution to discussions, requesting and providing information and assistance. The discussion justifies a novel and more nuanced view of communities of practice not as arenas of user-generated content, but rather as environments based on interplay and interactions between members and managers.	social media	Azi Lev-On	2017	First Monday		computer science;public relations;social media;knowledge management;public service	NLP	-85.67295589407944	-15.905781447169787	110751

Even with the business advisory service that is widely preached by government and non-government providers, micro entrepreneurs are still challenged. Concerns of business advisory outreach are largely raised. Using a quantitative approach the study sought to identify the advisory services needed, those accessed online and the reasons for using on not using the existing online platforms to access business advisory. The study was narrowed down to micro-entrepreneurs operating in the textile industry. The study provides insight about the state of internet-based business advisory in the micro-entrepreneurial society of Uganda. It was generally noted that micro-entrepreneurs prefer physical access to online access of business advisory although they acknowledge the benefits associated with online platforms. Limited knowledge and skills on how to use these platforms coped with the busy daily schedule limits the time available to search for advice online.

825e3b5d2164f282b6c4915b13df4390285eddd8	interfield equality: journals versus researchers	interfield comparison;research subsidy;publication evaluation	The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (Tubitak) gives subsidies to researchers for their publications. Tubitak groups journals into subject categories, and gives equal subsidies to publications from journals with comparable standing. This formulation aims at interfield equality among journals. Unfortunately, interfield equality among journals does not necessarily lead to interfield equality among researchers because there are interfield productivity differences. We show that chemists in prestigious Turkish universities on average receive 4.30 times more subsidies than economists. We also apply the subsidy formula to the publications of the researchers from world’s most prestigious universities. In this case, the inequality between chemists and economists is less pronounced.

We collected and mined around 70.000 entries from DBLP for 122 conferences and journals, for the period 1971–2012, in order to process several bibliometric indicators. We provide evidence that the number of authors of articles in software engineering is increasing on average around +0.40 authors/decade. The results also indicate that until 1980, the majority of the articles have a sole author, while nowadays articles with 3 or 4 authors represent almost half of the total.	bibliometrics;dbl-browser;mined;scientific literature;software engineering	João M.

In this brief communication, the same academics were re-ranked, using other popular citation databases. It was found that for academics who publish more in computer science forums, their h was significantly different due to highly cited papers missed by Web of Science; consequently their rank changed substantially. The study was widened to a broader set of UK LIS and IR academics where results showed similar statistically significant differences. A variant of h, h mx , was introduced that allowed a ranking of the academics using all citation databases together.	citation index;computer science;database;google scholar;http 404;mike lesser;roland gs;scopus;web of science	Mark Sanderson	2008	JASIST	10.1002/asi.20771	social science;information science;ranking;scientometrics;computer science;data mining;citation analysis;world wide web;information retrieval	DB	-77.57521652801312	-20.990556018281538	111580
d9fbee7574d1abc3ab71f76cd5d56b3ec6b1e23b	elites tweet? characterizing the twitter verified user network		Social network and publishing platforms, such as Twitter, support the concept of verification. Verified accounts are deemed worthy of platform-wide public interest and are separately authenticated by the platform itself. There have been repeated assertions by these platforms about verification not being tantamount to endorsement. However, a significant body of prior work suggests that possessing a verified status symbolizes enhanced credibility in the eyes of the platform audience. As a result, such a status is highly coveted among public figures and influencers. Hence, we attempt to characterize the network of verified users on Twitter and compare the results to similar analysis performed for the entire Twitter network. We extracted the entire network of verified users on Twitter (as of July 2018) and obtained 231,246 user profiles and 79,213,811 connections. Subsequently in the network analysis, we found that the sub-graph of verified users mirrors the full Twitter users graph in some aspects such as possessing a short diameter. However, our findings contrast with earlier findings on multiple aspects, such as the possession of a power law out-degree distribution, slight dissortativity and a significantly higher reciprocity rate, as elucidated in the paper. Moreover, we attempt to gauge the presence of salient components within this sub-graph and detect the absence of homophily with respect to popularity, which again is in stark contrast to the full Twitter graph. Finally, we demonstrate stationarity in the time series of verified user activity levels. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first quantitative attempt at characterizing verified users on Twitter.		Indraneil Paul;Abhinav Khattar;Ponnurangam Kumaraguru;Manish Gupta;S.

f7fb62128157e6895a92891a2c52f8c15e1a5ff8	the influence of geospatial factors on democracy: its representation on web interface design	political aspects;geospatial information;design	Democracy is represented on web interface design (Li, 2010). Wittfogel’s (1957) Eastern autocracy states that 2 environmental dimensions, rainfall and sea border, influence the origin of democracy. This study examined Wittfogel’s Eastern autocracy theory through statistical analysis of average annual precipitation, land boundaries, latitudes, and annual temperature of 196 countries and territories with their freedom levels defined by Freedom House, to find out the correlations between these geospatial factors and democracy. In addition, this study extended its investigation to web interface design by examining democracy represented on college/ university websites in correlations with these geospatial factors. A total of 130 college/university websites selected from 65 countries were coded and examined systematically in linear and multiple regression analyses. This study concluded that democracy correlates positively with annual precipitation and latitude, but negatively with land boundaries and annual temperature. Furthermore, this study indicated that these 4 geospatial variables associate with democracy represented on web interface design, although the associations are not statistically significant. This study also suggested that it is more accurate to predict democracy if the 4 geospatial factors are considered together as dependent variables. By examining Wittfogel’s theory of hydraulic civilization on web interface design, this study not only extended its sociological perspective to the information science arena, but also provided a better understanding of the functionality of the Internet in information dissemination and its cultural and sociological aspects.	freedom of information laws by country;information science;user interface	Rowena Li	2014	JASIST	10.1002/asi.22964	design;social science;geospatial analysis;data mining;management science;world wide web	HCI	-79.79442775090249	-16.002221967880114	112181

However, most studies of online dating systems have focused exclusively on users' abilities to find long-term relationships. This has restricted our understanding of how to design systems for users that have multiple relationship goals. To address this gap in understanding we explored how people use online dating systems in regards to casual encounters. We did this through an interview study with users of a popular online dating system in the USA and a study of online dating coaches who give behavioral advice specific to the pursuit of casual encounters. Findings highlight how users subtly disguise and probe for openness to casual encounters, while coaches try to overcome ambiguities in user intentions through a series of targeted dating methods.	openness	Douglas Zytko;Sukeshini A.

Due to their relatively limited e-health literacy, D/hh people might use less complex health texts than the general public in their online communication. To test the hypothesis, we utilized text mining and readability measurements to compare the language use of online health discussions of two groups. We collected health data from AllDeaf and Yahoo!Answers, representing online communities for deaf people and the public, respectively. Flesch Kincaid Grade and professional health vocabulary coverage were utilized to compare their health writing complexity. The results showed that the public did not use significantly more complex health texts and health vocabularies than D/hh people. Further explorations are needed to analyze other readability metrics and clarify the influence of platforms on health writing complexity.	complexity;computer-mediated communication;demographic and health surveys;exploratory testing;h. h. scott, inc.;online community;performance;social media;text mining;vocabulary	Biyang Yu;Zhe He	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)	10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217846	machine learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;literacy;readability;multimedia;vocabulary;text mining	HCI	-83.41387964093678	-20.81251407381872	112228

However, there is no specific shopping platform for university students. From perspective of consumer’s attitude, frequency, demand, and other aspects on online shopping platform, constructing an online shopping platform in university is feasible. Because the online shopping platform is especially designed for university students, the management mode, operation mode and profit pattern are all different from other website. And the main problems in operating the pattern show in aspects of Internet real-name, product quality and complaint treatment.	internet;online shopping	Xiong Kai	2010	2010 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government	10.1109/ICEE.2010.1149	logistics;feasibility study;the internet;economics;marketing;multimedia;pattern;advertising;management;information system;profitability index	DB	-91.00300686299997	-11.247007484324795	112253

This paper provides such an empirical analysis at the level of individual researchers, departments, institutions and countries. Two datasets are used: 147,547 papers published between 2000 and 2008 and assigned to 14,379 Canadian university professors affiliated to 508 departments, and all papers indexed in the Web of Science for the same period (N=8,221,926) assigned to all countries and institutions. Although there is a strong relationship between the two measures at each of these levels, a pairwise comparison of AoR and RoA shows that the differences between all the distributions are statistically significant and, thus, that the two methods are not equivalent and do not give the same results. Moreover, the difference between both measures is strongly influenced by the number of papers published as well as by their impact scores: the difference between AoR and RoA is greater for departments, institutions and countries with low RoA scores. Finally, our results show that RoA relative impact indicators do not add up to unity (as they should by definition) at the level of the reference dataset, whereas the AoR does have that property.	compiler;web of science;world wide web	Vincent Larivière;Yves Gingras	2011	J.

This study compares the historical formation of regulatory systems for broadcasting and telecommunications between Korea and the United States. In particular, we analyze various metaphors about telecommunications and broadcasting and which metaphors and discourses have been adopted in the social context. We further examine how such metaphors and discourses contributed to different regulatory philosophies and regulatory systems in Korea and the United States with a focus on comparative historical analysis. Analysis shows that regulatory philosophy and the framework of telecommunications and broadcasting were constructed in different historical contexts in both countries. The perception that communication technologies are public resources was pervasive in the U.S., but in Korea, the function of broadcasting was recognized as a means of government control or dissemination of propaganda implemented under Japanese colonial authorities and the rule of the U.S. military government. How these different social/historical contexts led to different regulatory philosophies and systems in the U.S. and Korea is discussed.

We focus on activism related to the UK broadcast media’s negative portrayal of welfare benefit claimants; portrayals characterised as “poverty porn” by critics. Using critical discourse analysis, we explore two activist campaigns countering the TV programme Benefits Street. Through content analysis of social media, associated traditional media texts, and interviews with activists, our analysis highlights the way activists leverage the specific technological affordances of different social media and other online platforms in order to manage and configure counter-discourse activities. We reveal how activists use different platforms to carefully control and contest discursive spaces, and the ways in which they utilise both online and offline activities in combination with new and broadcast media to build an audience for their work. We discuss the challenges associated with measuring the success of counter-discourse, and how activists rely on combinations of social media analytics and anecdotal feedback in order to ascertain that their campaigns are successful. We also discuss the often hidden power-relationships in such campaigns, especially where there is ambiguity regarding the grassroots legitimacy of activism, and where effort is placed into controlling and owning the propagation of counter-discourse. We conclude by highlighting a number of areas for further work around the blurred distinctions between corporate advocacy, digilantism and grassroots activism.

The research hypotheses draw primarily from the diffusion of innovation literature. Our analysis of 802 candidates in 2006 and 816 candidates in 2008 indicates that Facebook adoption diffused rapidly between 2006 and 2008, with party (Democrats), competition, money and the level of education in the district explaining both adoption and implementation. Challengers and candidates for open seats were more likely to be early adopters, but incumbents used Facebook more extensively. Both higher adoption rates by peers or competitors in the candidate’s own state and a propensity to adopt earlier campaign technologies are strong positive motivators for early adoption, but irrelevant to usage.	relevance;social network	Christine B.

813947f57288ec58da6d344debef4211cfb530df	a cross-cultural comparison of kuwaiti and british citizens' views of e-government interface quality	importance performance view;government administrative body;e government interface quality;persuasive quality;national culture;content analysis;foreign countries;statistical analysis;web sites;cross cultural studies;computer interfaces;cultural differences	Abstract It is difficult to conceive how Web users from different cultures can be encouraged to reap the benefits of an e-government initiative when its portal is suffering from culture-indifferent interface quality. Thus far, the e-government literature not only has paid scanty attention to web evaluation issues but also has been slow to embarking on cross-cultural research. As an attempt to address this concern, this investigation introduces an augmented approach to analyze cross-cultural website quality. The proposed approach consists of three parts: 1) a qualitative study of the website using content analysis, 2) an empirical evaluation using traditional statistical methods of perceptions of website users, and 3) a “persuasive quality gap” analysis that examines the gap between the composite scores of perceived importance and performance of quality attributes across the studied two cultures. These analyses were used to identify cross-cultural differences between Kuwaiti and British usersu0027 perceptions of e-government quality attributes. While the findings showed no significant differences between Kuwaiti and British users in terms of important quality features, the results revealed significant variations between the two groups in terms of perceived performance of quality attributes. Moreover, although the findings showed marginal support for the existence of differences between the two samples in terms of persuasive quality features, a post-hoc analysis of the persuasive quality gap revealed a need to consider not only important and/or high performing characteristics but also persuasive features to fully understand cross-cultural e-government quality variations. The author discusses the implications of these results for e-government design practices and future research.	e-government	Adel M.

Development of information technology has led to the development of the scientometric analyzes, which already have great significance for many decisions in the academic medical community, and represents a cross section of work of an author. Scientometric indices in the medical community become a tool in selecting the management of institutions, as well as membership in many academies. This paper should be a basis, as well as guidance in the development of a better and more accurate algorithm for more accurate analysis of the work of authors, and should also point the importance of accurate citations during writing scientific papers. The lack of selectivity of Google Scholar, and the possible individual manipulation of content, implies the need for further development of these platforms, so that the scientometric analysis can become a valid tool in the academic community.

In this study, by combining predictors of product performance with customer value framework, we consider both text and non-text information in examining the effect of in-store information on application downloads. We apply latent semantic analysis technique to find out the meaningful, valuable information embedded in customer review and product description for five types of applications. We also find that for different types of applications, customers weight information at various levels when they make downloading decisions. This study makes contributions by revealing the role of in-store information in mobile application downloads and providing application developers with useful guidance to improve in-store information management.	download;embedded system;information management;latent semantic analysis;mobile app;value (ethics)	Ying Wang;Miguel I.

9c0d4ee4958e3e065bbe2a56f83ce3cd14c5dd16	predictors of drop-out in an internet study of men who have sex with men		Researchers have suggested the rising use of Internet to look for sexual partners is an important contributor to the resurgence in the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM). Web-based samples of this population reflect good geographical diversity for research, but a high drop-out rate creates a significant potential for bias, misrepresentation of population, and misinterpretation of data. This study aims to describe the demographics of an Internet sample of MSM and the differences between the completers and drop-outs. We analyzed data obtained from a cross-sectional study using an online self-administered questionnaire for males, 18 years or older, who were current U.S. residents, and who had sex with men. Of 850 eligible participants, 404 (47.5%) were labeled as drop-outs. The completers and drop-outs differed significantly in age, education, country of birth, health insurance, time spent on Internet, location of computer access, types of sites visited, profile information, last homosexual experience, methods used to determine safety of partners, and type of sexual activities on real meets. Almost half of the participants dropped out before completion. Although the two groups did not differ in many of the items, high drop-out rates are a threat to the validity of such data. Drop-out constitutes a significant bias in Internet sexuality research and must be considered while interpreting the results of such studies.		Amit Jain;Michael W.

Although prior studies have investigated several factors which influence movie revenue, there’s a lack of research examining the effect of search volume of movie soundtrack on the movie revenue. Therefore, we proposed the following research questions: (1) Is search volume of a movie soundtrack a predictor of the movie revenue in the opening week and the following weeks? (2) Does the effect of search volume of movie soundtrack on movie revenue differ between existing songs and new songs in different time periods? We investigated the effect of movie soundtrack search volume on the movie revenue in different time periods. Moreover, we also examined the moderating effect of existing songs vs. new songs on the relationship between search volume and movie revenue. Initial data collected from Google Trends and IMDb was used for the preliminary test of the research model. The initial results showed that online search volume of movie soundtrack has an effect on the movie revenue, and this effect in the pre-launch period is strengthened if existing songs are used in the movie soundtrack.	kerrison predictor;online search;pretail	Haifeng Xu;Nadee Goonawardene	2014			simulation;marketing;advertising;revenue	ML	-86.01389684240472	-13.365039410891866	113958
6ec31585a5696f3f0648faf8b03bae74ca447e1a	response to the letter to the editor by gangan prathap on the article: designing a composite index for research performance evaluation at the national or regional level: ranking central universities in india		Prathap (2016) comments on our paper on Composite Indices QQCI(1) and QQCI(2) in a Letter to the Editor, Scientometrics. In our paper we have shown that the Composite Index QQCI(1) (constructed from Papers, Citations, International Papers and Highly cited Papers) varies as a cubic polynomial with respect to the h-index of the Universities (R = 0.9996) (Please refer Fig. 2 of Basu et al. 2016). We have noted in our paper that a similar relationship was observed in a paper by Nishy et al. (2012), of which Prathap is a co-author. We have further stated in our paper that it was not immediately clear as to what was the significance of the cubic relationship in the two papers. Prathap claims that the Composite Index QQCI(1) in our paper is simply a proxy of the Exergy X in his paper (Nishy et al. 2012), based on the fact that both terms have a cubic relationship to the h-index. We strongly contest this claim. It is clear that Exergy = TC/ TP depends only on Total Citations (TC) and Total Papers (TP), while QQCI(1) is a composite index including Internationally Collaborative Papers (ICP) and top 1 % cited papers (HiCP) in addition to TC and TP, as reiterated by Prathap himself in the letter. Our response to Prathap would be to say that since both X and QQCI(1) are performance indicators, and it may not be surprising that they have a similar relationship to h. QQCI(1) may in fact be considered a generalization of X.	composite index (database);performance evaluation	Aparna Basu;Sumit Kumar Banshal;Khushboo Singhal;Vivek Kumar Singh	2016	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-016-1996-0	mathematics education;media studies	DB	-77.49994563557449	-21.264409320119572	114001

One such factor is parental mediation of children's electronic technology use. Little attention has been given to how different parental mediation strategies (i.e., instructive, restrictive, co-viewing) relate to adolescents' cyberharassment (i.e., cyberbullying, cybertrolling) perpetration and victimization, and how gender might impact these associations. To this end, the present study examined the moderating effect of gender on the longitudinal association between parental mediation strategies and adolescents' cyberharassment involvement. This focus was examined using a sample of 568 (53% female) adolescents from the 8th grade in the United States. The association between restrictive mediation and cybervictimization was more positive for girls when compared to boys, while the relationship between instructive mediation and cybervictimization was more negative for girls than for boys. The findings underscore the importance of considering parents in adolescents' cyberharassment involvement.	cyberbullying	Michelle F.

Building from the theory of planned behavior, a theoretical model predicting self-protection of online privacy was tested in the present study. This model accounted for nearly a quarter of the variability in actual adoption during a ten-day period immediately after participants completed the initial questionnaire. Overall, the present research provided a strong support for the theoretical utility of psychological factors and processes in online privacy related research.	computer simulation;heart rate variability;internet privacy;pharmaceutical services, online	Mike Z.

Indeed, as the one of leading nations for high-speed broadband access, South Korean Internet users virtually dominate the entire gamut of Internet activities-everything from web searches to games to Instant Messenger (IM) chatting-and are one of the leading consumers of on-line shopping for services and goods (“e-commerce”). Even popular social movements have gone “on-line” in South Korea with civil organizations effectively mobilizing their resources through Internet networking.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#However, a widespread disparity in Internet use has recently come to light in South Korea. In particular, Internet use has been clearly divided by generations, which threatens to create a “new” generation gap and the possibility of further generational conflict in a society already marked by deep generational cleavages. In this paper, we touch upon the adoption of the Internet on the basis of research data that examines the digital divide on a national scale. We examine socio-demographic factors, attitudes toward the Internet, social supports (family support, in particular), and the influence that Internet access has had on the South Korean populace, paying particular attention to diffusion theory which has been considered the most feasible explanation for South Korea's rapid Internet adoption. This research indicates that Internet adoption in South Korea is influenced more by family support than by other characteristics. On the basis of this analysis, this study suggests that comparative studies need to be conducted on a macro level as well as within the socio-cultural context of the particular country.

This mandate offers a unique opportunity to assess the impact of a national eParticipation policy at such scale focusing on a particular engagement tool. A web content analysis methodology was used to collect data from the 353 English local government websites. Different variables measuring the implementation of this initiative were explored, including evidence of other eParticipation activities such as online consultations. The data were then crossexamined with institutional background factors such as political affiliation of the leading party. The study results question whether the legislation actually achieved its purpose since they indicate apparent efforts of minimum institutional compliance and low actual use of ePetitions. Among others, population density and previous experience with eParticipation were positively correlated with the implementation effort and actual use of those systems.	online petition;web content	Panagiotis Panagiotopoulos;Christopher J Moody;Tony Elliman	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23333-3_18	public relations;environmental resource management;marketing;political science	Web+IR	-81.67171444345222	-14.94580542896058	114705

Scholars have recently proposed the potential of designing multidimensional rating systems to better convey information on multiple dimensions of products. This study investigates whether and how multidimensional rating systems affect consumer satisfaction (measured by product ratings), based on both observational data and two randomized experiments. Our identification strategy of the observational study hinges on a natural experiment on TripAdvisor when the website started to allow consumers to rate multiple dimensions of the restaurants, as opposed to only providing an overall rating, in January 2009. We further obtain rating data on the same set of restaurants from Yelp, which controls for the unobserved restaurant quality over time and allows us to identify the causal effect using a difference-in-differences approach.

The expansion of the Internet has significantly increased the amount of textual communication received and stored by individuals and organizations. Inundated with massive amounts of textual information transmitted through Computer-mediated Communication, CMC, people remain largely unsuccessful and inefficient in detecting those messages that may be deceptive. Creating an automated tool that could help people flag the possible deceptive messages in CMC is desirable, but first it is necessary to understand cues used to deceive in textual instances. This study focuses on the identification of deceptive cues deceivers use in a textual CMC environment. 30 dyads (n =14 truthful, n = 16 deceptive) were able to complete the Desert Survival Problem. Findings have demonstrated significant differences between the content within truthful and deceptive messages. Several cues were also found to be significantly more present when deceivers write messages.	computer-mediated communication;depth perception;exploratory testing;internet;sensor;text-based (computing)	Lina Zhou;Douglas P.

For any company it is critical to understand both their own and their competitors’ strengths and weaknesses in all locations where they offer a service. With this motivation we created a Customers Acquisition and REtention system based on SOcial MEdia (CARESOME). Our system extracts and separates all social media interactions in a given location by market player and communication purpose and quantifies the impact of each single interaction over a given time period. To model the impact of the social media interactions, CARESOME relies on a set of metrics based on both intrinsic and extrinsic components—including Entity Engagement Index, Differential Perception Factor, Tie-Strength and Number of Exposed users—. In addition to the definition of our impact quantification metrics, we provide a thorough discussion about the design decisions taken to build our system. To illustrate the behavior of our system, we show-case a real world scenario from the airline industry based on two major airports in Great Britain.	social media	Juan Bernabé-Moreno;Álvaro Tejeda-Lorente;Carlos Porcel;Hamido Fujita;Enrique Herrera-Viedma	2015	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2014.12.033	competitor analysis;computer science;strengths and weaknesses;marketing;voice of the customer;social crm;social media	Metrics	-86.96975531691933	-12.430710189049137	115657

In fact, social networking has a large potential for easing collaboration, also across organizational boundaries. However, effective e-collaboration through social networks requires the development of open and interoperable systems, allowing people belonging to different organizations to create ties, reflecting real connections existing in daily activities. Attention has to be paid to identity management, for allowing users to develop their reputation consistently, and to privacy and confidentiality, for creating a more trustful environment and protecting freedom of expression. In this article we propose a novel peer-to-peer system, named Blogracy, leveraging the large BitTorrent network. Its main distinguishing features are: (i) protection of users' identity and privacy, (ii) absence of central control over published content; (iii) interoperability with other systems; and (iv) low costs and scalability of the infrastructure.

Griefing is used to describe when a player within a multiplayer online environment intentionally disrupts another player's game experience for his/her own personal enjoyment or material gain. Unrestrained, griefing could lead to a downward spiral of the number of people playing Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG)s, and possibly the death of smaller MMORPGs. Big game publishers may not wish to risk supporting the genre. There have been studies conducted in the past that attempt to define griefing and the different forms it takes in MMORPGs. These were outlined from the perception of the general player, and so did not examine differences in perception of griefing by different types of players.  The authors conducted an online survey with the intention to discover the perception of various in-game actions previously identified in research as griefing, among griefers and griefing victims. In general players who identified themselves as griefers were more likely to regard these actions as a part of the game people had to learn to accept and not griefing. However some patterns of commonality were also observed between griefers and subjects of griefing, with some actions previously identified as griefing in the literature less commonly regarded as griefing by both player types in this survey.	massively multiplayer online role-playing game;virtual world	Leigh Achterbosch;Charlynn Miller;Peter Vamplew	2013		10.1145/2513002.2513007	psychology;simulation;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-86.24516348552888	-18.59983837238894	115804

However, little is known about the predictors of its persuasiveness and the moderating effect of culture. In this paper, we investigate the predictors of """"the persuasiveness of Competition"""" (i.e. Competition) using three social influence con-structs: Reward, Social Comparison and Social Learning. Using a sample of 287 participants, comprising 213 individualists and 74 collectivists, we explored the interrelationships among the four social influence constructs and how the two cultures differ and/or are similar. Our global model, which accounts for 46% of the variation in Competition, reveals that Reward has the strongest influence on Competition, followed by Social Comparison. However, the model shows that Social Learning has no significant influence on Competition. Finally, our multigroup analysis reveals that, for our population sample, culture does not moderate the interrelationships among the four constructs. Our findings suggest that designers of gamified applications can employ Reward, Social Comparison and Competition as co-persuasive strategies to motivate behavior change for both cultures, as the susceptibilities of users to Reward and Social Comparison are predictors of their susceptibility to Competition."""	gamification;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;persuasive technology;responsiveness	Kiemute Oyibo;Rita Orji;Julita Vassileva	2017		10.1145/3099023.3099113	instrumental and intrinsic value;social psychology;social comparison theory;social learning;collectivism;path analysis (statistics);social influence;psychology;behavior change;population	HCI	-88.1642998317616	-15.9386557821404	115832

Many such e-communities are rapidly evolving on the Internet, some initiated, organized, and controlled by community members themselves, some organized and controlled by marketers, and some by third parties acting as intermediaries between members and other interest groups such as marketers and advertisers. In this paper, we explore the role of e-communities as intermediaries in exchange relationships among community members and between community members and other interest groups such as marketers and advertisers from an economic perspective. In particular, we focus on the types of interactions that take place among community members and between community members and other interest groups and examine the economic and social issues involved in maintaining a healthy community. Deriving parallels from extant research in financial intermediation and social exchange theory, we explore conditions and incentive mechanisms under which such communities could develop and add value on the Internet. We also draw upon limited empirical examples from the World Wide Web to provide support to our propositions.		P. K. Kannan;Ai-Mei Chang;Andrew B.

af4356c45a1f2a4a1edc5319d302b72ac0fcb97c	using social media data to measure and influence community well-being		Information about our local environment is everywhere on the Internet and other information and communication technologies (ICT), especially in certain forms of social media. Our engagement and interaction with this information in our daily social lives, as individuals and groups, has grown tremendously in the past decade and continues to do so. This is an early research proposal that aims at looking beyond detection of events in the “real-world” via social media and wants to ask how we can gauge from the social media data how well individuals and groups of community-based individuals are doing. My goal is to do this by finding useful measures of social indicators, in particular community well-being and its possible relationship with the collective stress and/or tranquility of communities, in social media. Moreover, I would like to see if we can influence individuals and groups through their social networks in order to change or modify their behavior on the basis of this data. This research, then, seeks to engage in the fields of social media use, the evaluation of community well-being, and the mechanisms of influence in social networks. This project is important in helping us better understand how social media plays a role in communities and how we might increase the utility of this ubiquitous and very popular online technology.	interaction;internet;social media;social network	Ziad Matni	2015	TCDL Bulletin		political science;public relations;well-being;social media	HCI	-82.76763672948024	-17.964216957926773	116258

Here, a formal model provides rational explanations for this self-serving bias in a Bayesian framework. For the high-ability authors in a very active scientific field, the model predictions are: (1) Bayesian-rational authors are relatively overconfident about their likelihood of manuscript acceptance, whereas authors who play the role of referees have less confidence in manuscripts of other authors; (2) if the final disposition of his or her manuscript is acceptance, the Bayesian-rational author almost surely attributes this decision more to his or her own ability; (3) when the final disposition is rejection, the Bayesian-rational author almost surely attributes this decision more to negative bias in peer review; (4) some rational authors do not learn as much from the critical reviewers’ comments in case of rejection as they should from the journal editor’s perspective. In order to validate the model predictions, we present results from a survey of 156 authors.

Based on a sample of 394 social media users, the descriptive statistical analysis showed two different kinds of gaps. """"Higher awareness but lower behavior gap"""" represented gaps from higher-scoring constructs (including awareness of adverse consequences caused by rumors, ascribed responsibility of adverse consequences, sense of obligation and behavioral intention to combat rumors) to lower-scoring actual behavior, whereas """"lower attitude but higher behavior gap"""" represented the gap from lower-scoring attitudes toward rumor combating to higher-scoring actual behavior. The results of the structural analysis demonstrated that the proposed model had a satisfactory level of prediction power for pro-social rumor combating behavior. The findings also supported all the hypothesized relationships among the model constructs except the direct influences of subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on behavioral intention and verified the mediating roles of the model constructs. In particular, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and awareness of adverse consequences were the three most important predictors of actual rumor combating behavior. We merged planned behavior theory and norm activation model in rumor combating.There was a higher awareness but lower behavior gap hindering rumor combating.There was a lower attitude but higher behavior gap promoting rumor combating.Our model had a strong prediction power for the pro-social rumor combating behavior."""	social media	Liming Zhao;Jianli Yin;Yao Song	2016	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.054	psychology;social media;computer science;communication;social psychology;world wide web;theory of planned behavior	HCI	-88.84823056035862	-17.44345186144229	116564

Yet, their effects on long-term engagement have not been fully examined. In study designs where repeated administration of incentives is required to ensure the regularity of behaviors, the effectiveness of subsequent incentives may decrease as a result of the law of diminishing marginal utility. In this paper, we introduce random-loss incentive -- a new financial incentive based on loss aversion and unpredictability principles -- to address the problem of individuals» growing insensitivity to repeated interventions over time. We evaluate the new incentive design by conducting a randomized controlled trial to measure the influences of random losses on participants» dietary self-tracking and self-reporting compliance using a mobile web application called Eat & Tell. The results show that random losses are significantly more effective than fixed losses in encouraging long-term engagement.

An online questionnaire revealed a paradox: patients like PEx and are drawn to sites containing PEx, but are then less likely to trust the information and advice they find there. Subsequent analysis suggests that this paradox may be related to the prevalence of advertising as a funding-model for online patient communities. To better understand these issues we explored one health domain (smoking cessation) in greater depth, inviting participants to search for relevant material and then discuss the different kinds of patient experience they found online. We report on the selection and rejection factors involved in choosing sites containing PEx and explore the notion of credible design in this space.	peer-to-peer;rejection sampling	Elizabeth Sillence;Claire Hardy;Pamela Briggs	2013		10.1145/2464464.2464488	public relations;medicine;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-84.60524026528186	-21.143733926611073	116918

This paper reports on a study on the use and preference of web browsers by 100 respondents aged 50 years old and over from Thailand and UK, who arguably differ in their culture and online developmental curve. The questionnaire explored their online activities, browser manipulations, problems with standard browsers and features required. The study reveals differences in the types of activities these two groups of users performed online and in their preferences. The results of this study points to the need to design a culturally inclusive web browser in addition to an age-friendly web browser when dealing with older web browsers from different countries.

According to Fuchs’ theory of scientific change, this leads over time to intellectual and social fragmentation, as new scholarship accumulates in the absence of shared unifying theories. We consider here a set of specialisms in the discipline of history and measure the connectivity properties of their bibliographic coupling networks over time, in order to assess whether fragmentation is indeed occurring. We construct networks using both reference overlap and textual similarity. It is shown that the connectivity of reference overlap networks is gradually and steadily declining over time, whilst that of textual similarity networks is stable. Author bibliographic coupling networks also show signs of a decline in connectivity, in the absence of an increasing propensity for collaborations. We speculate that, despite the gradual weakening of ties among historians as mapped by references, new scholarship might be continually integrated through shared vocabularies and narratives. This would support our belief that citations are but one kind of bibliometric data to consider—perhaps even of secondary importance—when studying the humanities, while text should play a more prominent role.	bibliographic coupling;bibliometrics;fork (software development);fragmentation (computing);theory;vocabulary;while	Giovanni Colavizza	2018	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-018-2934-0	scholarship;historiography;data mining;social science;bibliographic coupling;narrative;fragmentation (computing);computer science	ML	-77.48092807635103	-17.747031494289732	117541

People perceived PDAs (e.g., Likes, Favorites, and Upvotes) as socially supportive both quantitatively and qualitatively, even without implicit meaning associated with them. People who are highly sensitive about what others think of them and have high self-esteem are more likely to perceive higher social support from PDAs.	bookmark (world wide web);interaction;like button;personal digital assistant;radiography, dental, digital;self esteem;self-conscious;self-consciousness;social media;social support	Donghee Yvette Wohn;Caleb T.

BACKGROUND Wikipedia successfully aggregates millions of volunteers' efforts to create the largest encyclopedia in human history. Without formal employment contracts and monetary incentives, one significant question for Wikipedia is how it organizes individual members with differing goals, experience, and commitment to achieve a collective outcome. Rather than focusing on the role of the small set of people occupying a core leadership position, we propose a shared leadership model to explain the leadership in Wikipedia. Members mutually influence one another by exercising leadership behaviors, including rewarding, regulating, directing, and socializing one another.   METHOD We conducted a two-phase study to investigate how distinct types of leadership behaviors (transactional, aversive, directive, and person-focused), the legitimacy of the people who deliver the leadership, and the experience of the people who receive the leadership influence the effectiveness of shared leadership in Wikipedia.   RESULTS Our results highlight the importance of shared leadership in Wikipedia and identify trade-offs in the effectiveness of different types of leadership behaviors. Aversive and directive leadership increased contribution to the focal task, whereas transactional and person-focused leadership increased general motivation. We also found important differences in how newcomers and experienced members responded to leadership behaviors from peers.   APPLICATION These findings extend shared leadership theories, contribute new insight into the important underlying mechanisms in Wikipedia, and have implications for practitioners who wish to design more effective and successful online communities.	behavior;contract agreement;directive (programming);encyclopedias;focal (programming language);money;online community;rewards;socialization;theory;two-phase locking;wikipedia	Haiyi Zhu;Robert E.

The study, which uses online group buying as a research context, is premised on the marketing perspective of online consumer behavior and the information systems perspective of human-computer interactions with online interfaces. Data were obtained through a mall-intercept systematic sampling distribution of questionnaires, and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that online flow elements (arousal, challenge, time distortion, control, interactivity, and skill) are positively related to online shopping experiences (hedonic and utilitarian), which in turn are positively related to online group buying (or purchase) intention.

Because it is health information, we need to integrate how patients seek out online information. This study included patients' information-seeking behaviour along with digital divide scholars' constructs i.e. literacy and computer skills. Using 1617 observations from the 2010 Pew Internet and American Life Project, this study found that individuals with a significant number of health problems, who are likely to be in a lower income bracket, are proactive online health information seekers; however, they are less likely to search general information. This finding adds value to existing research revealing that usefulness, which has been overlooked in online health information seeking, is important and should be a part of the research model.

Two hundred and twenty Chinese and 245 British students responses to a self-report survey questionnaire are discussed. Significant differences were found in Internet experience, attitudes, usage, and self-confidence between Chinese and British students. British students were more likely to use computers for study purposes than Chinese students, but Chinese students were more self-confident about their advanced computer skills. Significant gender differences were also found in both national groups. Men in both countries were more likely than women to use email or chat rooms. Men played more computer games than women; Chinese men being the most active games players. Men in both countries were more self-confident about their computer skills than women, and were more likely to express the opinion that using computers was a male activity and skill than were women. Gender differences were higher in the British group than the Chinese group. The present study illustrates the continued significance of gender in students attitudes towards, and use of computers, within different cultural contexts. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The diffusion perspective in institutional theory has portrayed how agents import 'ready-to-wear' cultural accounts. In contrast, translation theory depicts how agents interpret and adapt cultural accounts as they fashion them into legitimating accounts for a local setting. An alternative would theorize accounts that are neither strictly borrowed nor idiosyncratically tailored. We advanced a third perspective, drawing on frame analysis as it is used in social movement theory. Framing theory attends to both the importance of cultural building blocks and the embedded ways in which agents relate to and shape systems of meaning and mobilize collective action to change social arrangements. We find that legitimating accounts are intertwined with the construction of social identities, which serve to legitimate, on the one hand, an account maker's participation in the discourse and set of claims, and on the other hand, the involvement of proponents and crucial audiences. We suggest that the mobilizing potential of legitimating accounts rests in part on their messages becoming 'autocommunicational,' so that listeners identify themselves with the message.	make	W. E.

This paper employs the scenario-based factorial survey method to investigate how the perceived characteristics of innovation and the perceived risk of online shopping influence the consumers’ intention to use BOPS while also considering the moderating effects of situational factors (location convenience) and product type (involvement). Our findings indicated that the consumer perceptions of relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, and risks involved in online shopping are important antecedents to intention to use BOPS, and that these relationships were significantly moderated by locational convenience and product involvement. The implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are discussed in detail.	product type	Eunhye Kim;Myeong-Cheol Park;Jongtae Lee	2017	Telematics and Informatics	10.1016/j.tele.2017.08.006	public relations;risk perception;survey methodology;marketing;product type;situational ethics;computer science	HCI	-88.70239588633898	-10.535686777000723	118700

This survey research investigated undergraduates’ computer anxiety, computer self-efficacy, and reported use of and attitudes toward the Internet. This study also examined differences in computer anxiety, computer selfefficacy, attitudes toward the Internet and reported use of the Internet for undergraduates with different demographic variables. The findings suggest that the undergraduates had moderate computer anxiousness, medium attitudes toward the Internet, and high computer self-efficacy and used the Internet extensively for educational purposes such as doing research, downloading electronic resources and e-mail communications. This study challenges the long perceived male bias in the computer environment and supports recent studies that have identified greater gender equivalence in interest, use, and skills levels. However, there were differences in undergraduates’ Internet usage levels based on the discipline of study. Furthermore, higher levels of Internet usage did not necessarily translate into better computer self-efficacy among the undergraduates. A more important factor in determining computer self-efficacy could be the discipline of study and undergraduates studying computer related disciplines appeared to have higher self-efficacy towards computers and the Internet. Undergraduates who used the Internet more often may not necessarily feel more comfortable using them. Possibly, other factors such as the types of application used, the purpose for using, and individual satisfaction could also influence computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety. However, although Internet usage levels may not have any impact on computer self-efficacy, higher usage of the Internet does seem to decrease the levels of computer anxiety among the undergraduates. Undergraduates with lower computer anxiousness demonstrated more positive attitudes toward the Internet in this study.	computer;download;email;internet;turing completeness	Hong Kian Sam;Abang Ekhsan Abang Othman;Zaimuarifuddin Shukri Nordin	2005	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;self-efficacy;survey research;the internet;multimedia;social psychology;law;statistics;pedagogy;anxiety	HCI	-86.58395044423415	-22.980298749692743	118736

The purpose of this paper is to challenge the liberal notion of privacy and explore foundations of an alternative privacy conception. Design/methodology/approach – A typology of privacy definitions is elaborated based on Giddens’ theory of structuration. The concept of privacy fetishism that is based on critical political economy is introduced. Limits of the liberal concept of privacy are discussed. This discussion is connected to the theories of Marx, Arendt and Habermas. Some foundations of an alternative privacy concept are outlined. Findings – The notion of privacy fetishism is introduced for criticizing naturalistic accounts of privacy. Marx and Engels have advanced four elements of the critique of the liberal privacy concept that were partly taken up by Arendt and Habermas: privacy as atomism that advances; possessive individualism that harms the public good; legitimizes and reproduces the capitalist class structure; and capitalist patriarchy. Research limitations/implications – Given the criticisms advanced in this paper, the need for an alternative, socialist privacy concept is ascertained and it is argued that privacy rights should be differentiated according to the position individuals occupy in the power structure, so that surveillance makes transparent wealth and income gaps and company’s profits and privacy protects workers and consumers from capitalist domination. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the establishment of a concept of privacy that is grounded in critical political economy. Owing to the liberal bias of the privacy concept, the theorization of privacy has thus far been largely ignored in critical political economy. The paper contributes to illuminating this blind spot.	biological anthropology;dominating set;privacy;social media;theory	Christian Fuchs	2011	J.

Amazon’s 2007 introduction of the Kindle e-book reader launched a new way of reading. The popularity of e-book readers has exploded over past several years. However, the Chinese e-book reader market is still relatively underdeveloped and underexploited when compared with North America or other regions. At the time, it remained unclear whether consumers could be persuaded to abandon conventional printed books for the new device in the Chinese market. Design/methodology/approach – This research has gathered 352 valid questionnaire samples on an Internet survey from the general population. Path analysis was used to investigate the causal relationships which were hypothesized by the structural equation modelling methodology to identify key factors in intention to switch to the e-book reader.

This manuscript is conceptually based in the areas of e-consumer behaviour and e-services marketing. Specifically, it examines the phenomenon of waiting in terms of the role it plays in the functionality of service delivery over the internet and the effect waiting has on how consumers behave online. A number of previous studies have identified a link between the ‘quickness’ of web sites and the site's overall functionality. The existing knowledge on consumer waiting behaviour in the general context of traditional or ‘off-line’ services and in the specific context of online services is reviewed. A qualitative empirical study of consumer behaviour in online waiting situations is undertaken. The factors that determine how e-consumers behave when faced with online waiting situations are identified and explored.	e-services	Gerard Ryan;Mireia Valverde	2006	Inf. Syst.

The empirical study uses a double methodology. First, a qualitative study using the Q-method is conducted. Qualitative analysis reveals that negative attitudes are commonly shared, and that ad-clutter is perceived critically. Therefore, in a second step, a quantitative study is adopted to assess the impact of attitudes towards SMS advertising and perceived ad-clutter on reading behaviour. The main test is conducted over a representative sample of 302 mobile owners. From a behavioural standpoint, the results show ambivalent behaviour in most cases. In particular, the role of perceived ad-clutter is ascertained. Implications for practice and directions for future research are discussed.	clutter;online advertising;q methodology	Claire Gauzente	2010	IJTHI	10.4018/jthi.2010040102	psychology;multimedia;advertising;social psychology	HCI	-89.3120905434534	-15.095383092685225	119317

Since in many of the most recent cases of digital activism the main actors have been young activists, the paper attempts to present how some of these new cohorts make use of technology mediated tools for social interaction, crowd engagement and participation, through a networked and apparently leaderless social and political activism. By analyzing the interaction between the existing tools and the generational characteristics of the social actors in particular situations we show the role that digital systems and new social media play in certain situations.     Con el fin de comprender el activismo digital, en este articulo se exploran tres categorias que se entrelazan: las herramientas que facilitan los procesos de participacion, las personas como agentes sociales que intervienen y los contextos de participacion social y politica. Dado que en los casos mas recientes de activismo digital los principales actores pertenecen a cohortes juveniles, el articulo intenta presentar algunas ideas de como esos activistas hacen uso de las herramientas tecnologicas para la participacion social, la ccoperacion y la inteligencia de las multitudes, mediante un activismo en red aparentemente sin liderazgos notorios. Se hace el analisis de la interaccion entre las herramientas tecnologicas y las caracteristicas generacionales en tres casos particulares para ilustrar el papel que los sistemas digitales y los nuevo smedios sociales juegan en ciertas situaciones.	emergent	Fernando López de la Mora	2014	J.

Refraining from acting under few and easily linkable partial identities is a prerequisite for trustworthy privacy. Traditionally user-controlled identity management systems primarily support individuals interacting with organisations, but mainly ignore special needs which arise if individuals interact with each other. To support online communities those systems have to change.	identity management system;interaction;internet;online community	Katrin Borcea-Pfitzmann;Marit Hansen;Katja Liesebach;Andreas Pfitzmann;Sandra Steinbrecher	2007	Datenschutz und Datensicherheit - DuD	10.1007/s11623-007-0221-y	computer science;knowledge management;computer security;identity management	HCI	-89.92531562621346	-16.00673070088683	119490

We collect a unique data set of over 10 million e-mail advertisements sent by a website to over 600,000 customers who could buy the advertised products from the online merchant. We estimate a two-stage hierarchical model using Bayesian analysis to account for observable and unobservable consumer heterogeneity. Our analysis suggests several interesting results regarding consumers’ responses to firms’ use of information. When firms use product-based personalization (where the use of information is not explicitly mentioned), consumers respond positively. On the other hand, consumers respond negatively when firms are explicit in their use of personally identifiable information (i.e., a personalized greeting). We also find that negative responses to personalized greetings are moderated by consumers’ familiarity with firms. The main contribution of this study is that it not only indicates the economic benefits of personalization in e-mails but also highlights consumers’ concerns over the use of information in personalization.	bayesian network;email;hierarchical database model;observable;personalization;personally identifiable information	Sunil Wattal;Rahul Telang;Tridas Mukhopadhyay;Peter Boatwright	2012	Information Systems Research	10.1287/isre.1110.0384	computer science;marketing;personalization;advertising;privacy;computer security;commerce	HCI	-89.51814714463147	-12.414384479422665	119581

However, due to a lack of a comprehensive and integrated framework for managing customer's experience, it remains challenging for e-marketers to effectively employ these tools. This paper proposes a formal approach to managing customer experience in electronic markets. We propose to expand the conventional 4Ps marketing mix model by incorporating four additional e-Ps including Push-pull-participative communication, Personalization, Promptness, and Privacy. We have further discussed how our framework can help e-marketers identify their customer experience strategies and e-commerce tools to implement e-CEM. Finally, we offered some tangible e-metrics to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of implementing the framework.	digital marketing;e-commerce;electronic markets;email;internet;location awareness;location-based service;mobile device;personalization;privacy	Sophea Chea;Tung X.

We explore the ambivalence of commercials that at once resonate with fears of messaging slang as a verbal contagion and luxuriate in the playful inversion of standard language hierarchies. The commercials were invoked by monologic mainstream media as evidence of language decay, but their circulation on YouTube invited dialogic metalinguistic discussions, in which young people and texting proponents could share the floor with adults and language prescriptivists. We examine some of the themes that emerge in the commentary YouTubers have posted about these ads, and discuss the style of that commentary as itself significant.	backup-file format	Graham M.

Research indicates that medical professionals do not author an extensive amount of health information available on the Internet. This creates a possibility for false information, thereby potentially leading ill people away from proper care. One way to begin addressing this problem is to assess perceptions of credibility about information found online. A between-groups, 2 (message type) × 3 (source type) factorial design was tested by manipulating source expertise (high, medium, low) and content knowledge (known and unknown). While findings did not indicate a significant interaction between source and content type, they did indicate an overall tendency to rate all information as relatively credible. In addition, results indicate that both knowledge of content and source expertise affect perceptions of online health information.		Matthew S. Eastin	2001	J.

This article investigates the extent to which academics exploit journalism using content and citation analyses of online BBC News stories cited by Scopus articles. A total of 27,234 Scopus-indexed publications have cited at least one BBC News story, with a steady annual increase. Citations from the arts and humanities (2.8% of publications in 2015) and social sciences (1.5%) were more likely than citations from medicine (0.1%) and science (<0.1%). Surprisingly, half of the sampled Scopus-cited science and technology (53%) and medicine and health (47%) stories were based on academic research, rather than otherwise unpublished information, suggesting that researchers have chosen a lower-quality secondary source for their citations. Nevertheless, the BBC News stories that were most frequently cited by Scopus, Google Books, and Wikipedia introduced new information from many different topics, including politics, business, economics, statistics, and reports about events. Thus, news stories are mediating real-world knowledge into the academic domain, a potential cause for concern.	citation analysis;commonsense knowledge (artificial intelligence);digital journalism;scopus;secondary source;wikipedia	Kayvan Kousha;Mike Thelwall	2017	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23862	citation analysis;public relations;the arts;computer science;information retrieval;scholarly communication;science, technology and society;scopus;citation;secondary source;journalism;multimedia	AI	-79.73819744062273	-19.132494108686547	119804

This paper explores some mechanisms through which online social networking may impact on governance towards greater openness & transparency.  In particular we examine the case of one initiative, the WeGov Project, which has as its mandate the bringing together of e-governance and e-society. We begin this paper by providing a contextual background to the initiative, its objectives and remit. We then proceed to critically examine the processes underlying the design of the WeGov tool-kit, as well as the end-user engagement methodologies, which feed back into the design of this platform.  We ask how direct & in-direct injection from policy makers on social networking sites (SNS) can facilitate participative governance in its most transparent and inclusive sense.	e-governance;e-society;openness;social network	Somya Joshi;Timo Wandhöfer;Mark Thamm;Brigitte Mathiak;Catherine Van Eeckhaute	2011		10.1145/2072069.2072117	public relations;knowledge management;marketing;political science	HCI	-80.95891575243047	-13.024392275570435	119838

These gathering places leave footprints in the form of colossal amounts of data regarding consumers’ thoughts, beliefs, experiences, and even interactions. In this paper, we propose an approach for firms to explore online user-generated content and “listen” to what customers write about their and their competitors’ products. Our objective is to convert the user-generated content to market structures and competitive landscape insights. The difficulty in obtaining such market-structure insights from online user-generated content is that consumers’ postings are often not easy to syndicate. To address these issues, we employ a text-mining approach and combine it with semantic network analysis tools. We demonstrate this approach using two cases—sedan cars and diabetes drugs—generating market-structure perceptual maps and meaningful insights without interviewing a single consumer. We compare a market structure based on user-generated content data with a market structure derived from more traditional sales and survey-based data to establish validity and highlight meaningful differences.	blog;chat room;experience;interaction;map;semantic network;social network analysis;syndicate;text mining;user-generated content	Oded Netzer;Ronen Feldman;Jacob Goldenberg;Moshe Fresko	2012	Marketing Science	10.1287/mksc.1120.0713	text mining;economics;marketing research;marketing;market structure;advertising;user-generated content	HCI	-86.49288772026621	-13.722573419297285	119913

In this talk, we will look at the health promotion landscape in Singapore, with growing challenges such as obesity and diabetes - set against the backdrop of a workforce that is sometimes too busy to take care of their health, and an ageing population that requires more support. We will examine how the Health Promotion Board of Singapore has taken steps to address the gap between """"knowing"""" and """"doing"""" by shifting its focus from health education to behavior change.  Various examples of this approach will be touched on, such as the introduction of innovative health programs, campaigns, partnerships and use of persuasive technology to make it increasingly easier for Singaporeans form and sustain healthier habits.

Because homophily—the principle that like seeks like—has been suggested as a mechanism by which people interact, it may also provide a mechanism that generates such frequencies and distributions. However, our multi-agent simulation tool, Construct, suggests that a slight supplement to a knowledge homophily model—the inclusion of several highly salient personal facts that are infrequently shared—can more successfully lead to the tiering behavior often observed in human networks than a simplistic homophily model. Our findings imply that homophily on both general and personal facts is necessary in order to achieve realistic frequencies of interaction and distributions of interaction partners. Implications of the model are discussed, and recommendations are provided for simulation designers seeking to use homophily models to explain human interaction patterns.	agent-based model;simulation;social network;social support	Brian R.

Our research suggests that there are four major challenges associated with successfully integrating an online user community into an organization’s innovation processes: understanding the ideas posted, identifying the best ideas, balancing the needs of transparency with the community against disclosure to competitors, and sustaining the community. In this article, we analyze specific aspects of these four challenges that became evident during the first 18 months of Dell IdeaStorm, Dell Computer Corporation’s online user innovation community. We describe the recommendations that we initially posted on Dell’s site for improving IdeaStorm and the responses we received. The article concludes with seven recommendations for how to overcome these challenges, which we believe can be used by other firms to leverage user innovation communities using an open model with social media tools.	dell ideastorm;online community;social media;virtual community;web 2.0;net	Paul Michael Di Gangi;Molly McLure Wasko;Robert E.

However, little is known about who the patient's supporters are, what support they provide, and why. To address this, we interviewed fifteen people involved in medical crowdfunding, including both beneficiaries and supporters. We found that support networks were larger than beneficiaries expected, with strangers offering support. Supporters offered not only monetary but also volunteering contributions including campaign creation, promotion, and external support. However, the emphasis medical crowdfunding interfaces place on monetary contributions led to social issues. Beneficiaries' close friends felt pressured to donate money they could not afford to give. And beneficiaries promoting the campaign worried they would be judged for requesting money. To mitigate these concerns, we suggest making the variety of volunteering contributions more visible and discuss the design challenges of including such signals in existing systems.	crowdfunding;distributed social network;money;social support	Jennifer G.

In the global information society, the importance of the Internet cannot be overemphasized. Unfortunately, in 2016, recent statistics of international telecommunications union showed that nearly 15% of people in Africa are Internet users (ITU, 2016). This relative low Internet penetration rate signals a problem. Tremendous efforts have been made to provide Internet to people. Policy makers often make the implicit assumption that the advantaged and disadvantaged people will respond to the same technology in similar ways (Hoffman et al., 2001). The purpose of this study is to propose a model explaining the Internet use continuance and then distinguish internet users’ continuance behaviors on the basis of their socio-economic status. Ultimately, we will determine what prevents the socio-economically disadvantaged from sustainably exploring digital opportunities. Data were collected through a survey. as Hsieh et al. (2008), we recommend a group alignment strategy to substitute the typical generic policy that does not distinguish ICT users and treat them as the same and offers a single invariant solution to all populations. The theoretical and practical implications are also described.	internet;population;word lists by frequency	Bangaly Kaba	2018	Int J.

Such privacy-sensitive data may reside in the other side of the planet. This trend highlights concerns on privacy in the cloud – how privacy of users is perceived and protected? In response to the growing privacy concerns, many technologies have been proposed, and governments in the world are preparing legal frameworks to protect privacy. However, there are still gaps between practices and proposed solutions, conflicts of interests, and disagreement on requirements and notions. For example, the more personal attributes service providers obtain, the further personalized services they can provide. Vice versa, the higher risks of privacy erosion. Thus, privacy provision must strike the best balance between conveniences, risks, and public interests. Also, recent public discussions about the usage of private information have raised the question whether privacy protection can become a business model. The notion of privacy is relatively new and should be evolving in accordance with the social and technological advancement. Also, the notion of privacy varies by culture, region and other aspects. Through this panel, panelists with a variety of backgrounds will lay a foundation for common understandings of privacy issues, and discuss agenda to foster further research and development in the areas of privacy in the cloud.	cloud computing;online advertising;personalization;personally identifiable information;privacy;requirement;social media	Kenji Takahashi	2011	2011 IEEE 35th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference	10.1109/COMPSAC.2011.120	cloud computing security;privacy software;privacy policy;media;cloud computing;information privacy;privacy by design;computer science;operating system;services computing;internet privacy;privacy;law;computer security	DB	-80.60855978609104	-11.186868465344295	120854

We find that the distributions of references made and citations received share a number of basic features across sciences. Reference distributions are rather skewed to the right, while citation distributions are even more highly skewed: the mean is about 20 percentage points to the right of the median, and articles with a remarkable or outstanding number of citations represent about 9% of the total. Moreover, the existence of a power law representing the upper tail of citation distributions cannot be rejected in 17 fields whose articles represent 74.5% of the total. Contrary to the evidence in other contexts, the value of the scale parameter is between three and four in 15 of the 17 cases. Finally, power laws are typically small but capture a considerable proportion of the total citations received.	journal citation reports;reference architecture;scientific literature	Pedro Albarrán;Javier Ruiz-Castillo	2011	JASIST	10.1002/asi.21448	skewness;power law;computer science;data science;data mining;citation analysis;world wide web;information retrieval;statistics	Web+IR	-77.58556954291497	-21.97101211260169	121419

Previous research has offered guidance to improve these warnings. We performed a laboratory study to investigate how the choice of background color in the warning and the text describing the recommended course of action impact a user’s decision to comply with the warning. We did not reveal to participants that the subject of the study was the warning, and then we observed as they responded to a simulated phishing attack. We found that both the text and background color had a significant effect on the amount of time participants spent viewing a warning, however, we observed no significant differences with regard to their decisions to ultimately obey that warning. Despite this null result, our exit survey data suggest that misunderstandings about the threat model led participants to believe that the warnings did not apply to them. Acting out of bounded rationality, participants made conscientious decisions to ignore the warnings. We conclude that when warnings do not correctly align users’ risk perceptions, users may unwittingly take avoidable risks.	align (company);approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);color;mass effect trilogy;phishing;rationality;relevance;simulation;threat model;web colors	Serge Egelman;Stuart E.

One explanation for this dearth of research is simply that the number of possible dimensions of individual characteristics that could be explored is extremely large. The work of mental model researchers provides an excellent starting point for more closely examining the unique knowledge, understandings and perspectives that individuals bring to lhe group process. In this paper, we suggest an approach that addresses two significant barriers which confront GS S researchers interested in exploring this area: the extremely time consuming methodologies required to elicit and represent mental models and the lack of a means to form groups based on the similarity and dissimilarity of Lhe mental models of the group members. We detail a solution that provides researchers with some insight into the mental models individuals may have of a problem situation or task domain. This solution is practical for dealing with the large number of subjects that small group experiments require. Importing a methodology from the field of Production and Operations Management, we detail a technique for forming groups based on the similarity and dissimilarity of the individual group member's understanding and perspectives.	experiment;mental model;roland gs	Anne P.

7e664e71833ffb696bfd1ebd19c8b8ae6e79e341	cross cultural study of multimedia effects on first impression bias	first impression bias;multimedia;culture	The body of knowledge about the relationship between multimedia and first impression bias, which has been mainly accumulated in North America, may not be generalizable in other countries because theories ground on one culture may not necessarily apply in other cultures. To better understand how multimedia can be applied successfully in various cultures for reducing first impression bias, researchers need to compare multimedia effects systematically across different cultures. This paper discusses the importance and necessity of considering the culture dimensions, such as collectivistic cultures versus individualistic cultures, in studying multimedia’s impact on firs impression bias. It arrives at several propositions for future empirical investigations. These propositions delineate the relationships between first impression, media type (text based versus multimedia based), and culture.	bias–variance tradeoff;text-based (computing);theory	Xiang Fang;T.

We highlight changes in the multimedia generation and consumption process that has occurred the past decade, and discuss several new angles this has brought to multimedia analysis research. We first examine the content production, dissemination and consumption patterns in the recent social media studies literature. We then propose an updated conceptual summary of media lifecycle from a previous research column by Chang. We present an update list of impact criteria and challenge areas for multimedia content analysis. Among the three criteria, two are existing but with new problems and solutions, one is new as a results of the community-driven content lifecycle. We present three case studies that addresses the impact criteria, and conclude with an outlook for emerging problems.	microsoft outlook for mac;online community;social media	Lexing Xie;Hari Sundaram	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo	10.1109/ICME.2012.138	media;visualization;social media;content analysis;computer science;exhibition;multimedia;internet privacy;world wide web;social network	DB	-78.45332128557897	-17.39643051578623	121635

Specifically, it examines the impact of Web site appeal and usability on the initial trust beliefs of new customers with respect to an on-line company. Web site appeal is found to be a significant predictor of initial trust, which in turn has a significant effect on intention to use the Web site in the future, but the results do not support a relationship between Web site usability and initial trust. Web skills are found to have a positive relationship to perceptions of a Web site’s usability, but initial trust in a company has no significant relationship to individual trust propensity. Finally, there is some indication, although not conclusive, that the relationship between Web site usability and initial trust may be significant only for travelrelated Web sites, an area where the customer’s search task can be very complex.	kerrison predictor;online and offline;usability;world wide web	William Hampton-Sosa;Marios Koufaris	2005	Int.

Researchers doing so have explored how those who put in large amounts of time playing such games are also productive of the culture surrounding the game. Yet in relation to casual games and their players, we have seen a curious omission. Are elements of game culture such as game capital and the creation and avid use of paratexts specific to traditional gamers? And if not, do casual players differ in specific or important ways from those norms? This paper uses a case study approach to investigate those questions, as well as to draw attention to a neglected group---devoted fans of casual games.

15dd58d45b1fc484ba3c32c9b25e6c196b521786	a two-dimensional index to quantify both scientific research impact and scope		Modern management of research is increasingly based on quantitative bibliometric indices. Nowadays, the h-index is a major measure of research output that has supplanted all other citation-based indices. In this context, indicators that complement the h-index by evaluating different facets of research achievement are compelling. As an additional bibliometric source that can be easily extracted from available databases, we propose to use the number of distinct journals Nj in which an individual’s papers were published. We show that Nj is independent of citation counts, and argue that it is a relevant indicator of research scope, since it quantifies readership extent and scientific multidisciplinarity. Combining the h-index and Nj , we define a two-dimensional index (H,M) that measures both the output (through H) and the outreach (through M) of individual’s research. In order to probe the relevance of this two dimensional index, we have analysed the scientific production of a panel of physicists belonging to the same Department but with different research themes. The analysis of bibliometric data confirms that the two indices are uncorrelated and shows that while H reliably ranks the impact of researchers, M accurately sorts multidisciplinary or readership aspects. We conclude that the two indices together offer a more complete picture of research performance and can be applied to either individuals, research groups or institutions.	bibliometrics;database;relevance	Mokhtar Adda-Bedia;F.

Specifically, the effects of message characteristics (i.e., incentives and prior permission) and individual differences of message recipients (i.e., content involvement, prior experience with the mobile medium, and medium-fit perceptions) on the attitudinal and behavioral outcomes of such campaigns are investigated. Perceived intrusiveness of the message and attitude toward the campaign are conceptualized as key attitudinal reactions triggered by a mobile advertising message, which in turn influence the behavioral responses generated by the campaign. Findings suggest that, in comparison to permission and incentive, individual differences are stronger determinants of responses to mobile advertising campaigns. Additionally, intriguing insights with respect to the effectiveness of different types of incentives are provided. 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We found that various forms of customizability technology (especially, system-driven customizability) increase selective exposure in the context of online political news consumption. Moreover, customizability technology has a stronger effect on minimizing exposure to counter-attitudinal information than it has on increasing exposure to proattitudinal information. The effect of customizability on selective exposure was particularly strong for ideologically moderate individuals. This study extends the understanding of the selective exposure process in today's communication environment and clarifies the implications of the Internet for deliberative democracy theory. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Few researchers have recently found counter evidence of selective exposure in social media: users are exposed to politically diverse articles. No work has looked at what happens after exposure, particularly how individuals react to such exposure, though. Users might well be exposed to diverse articles but share only the partisan ones. To test this, we study partisan sharing on Facebook: the tendency for users to predominantly share like-minded news articles and avoid conflicting ones. We verified four main hypotheses. That is, whether partisan sharing: 1) exists at all; 2) changes across individuals (e.g., depending on their interest in politics); 3) changes over time (e.g., around elections); and 4) changes depending on perceived importance of topics. We indeed find strong evidence for partisan sharing. To test whether it has any consequence in the real world, we built a web application for BBC viewers of a popular political program, resulting in a controlled experiment involving more than 70 individuals. Based on what they share and on survey data, we find that partisan sharing has negative consequences: distorted perception of reality. However, we do also find positive aspects of partisan sharing: it is associated with people who are more knowledgeable about politics and engage more with it as they are more likely to vote in the general elections.	social media;web application	Jisun An;Daniele Quercia;Jon A Crowcroft	2014		10.1145/2660460.2660469	politics;social science;social media;computer science;social psychology;world wide web;news aggregator	HCI	-84.55326241300578	-16.8748749997193	121920

With the great support from Hong Kong and Singapore government, e-government system has achieved temporary success by offering some everyday services through virtual Internet. During last year’s Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, e-governments in Hong Kong and Singapore ensured the proper running of government services despite of massive physical restrictions caused by SARS outbreak. E-government started to show its value through continuous development in the past decade. The idea of “virtual government” implementation had been proved in some extent. In the meantime, SARS outbreak introduced new challenges to e-government in dealing with abrupt events. The paper will present the new trends and dynamics in e-government development enlightened by feedbacks from fighting with SARS outbreak. The paper will also provide assessment for those functional specifications raised under the SARS outbreak.	definition;e-government;electronic business;feedback;functional specification;human–computer interaction;industrial engineering;internet;ubiquitous computing	Zichao Li	2004				Security	-78.39809858643137	-10.259130002901204	121988

Nevertheless, researchers continue to draw potentially misleading conclusions from flawed data. We consider two particular types of systematic error in measurement of network size: individuals over/underreporting others (expansiveness bias), and individuals being over/underreported by others (attractiveness bias). We examine evidence of individual variation in these biases in one apparently typical sociometric dataset. We specifically suggest that variation in expansiveness bias may commonly distort findings concerning characteristics of individual networks (e.g. size, range, density), and properties of whole networks (e.g. inequality, transitivity, clustering, and blockmodels). We suggest methodological improvements and urge further research. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.	cluster analysis;distortion;selection bias;sensor;social inequality;social network analysis;vertex-transitive graph	Scott L.

Bots work towards gaining human followers, participating in campaigns, and engaging in unethical activities such as spamming and false click generation. In this paper, we perform temporal pattern mining on bot activities in Twitter. We discover motifs (repeating behavior), discords (anomalous behavior), joins, bursts and dynamic clusters in activities of Twitter bots, and explain the significance of these temporal patterns in gaining competitive advantage over humans. Our analysis identifies a small set of indicators that separates bots from humans with high precision.

Therefore, this paper focuses on bridging this gap with a survey of social media use, potential and challenges, combined with a social media - focused innovation literature review of state-of-the-art. The study also studies the essential differences between business-to-consumer and business-to-business in the above respects. The paper starts by defining of social media and web 2.0, and then characterizes social media in business, social media in business-to-business sector and social media in business-to-business innovation. Finally we present and analyze the results of our empirical survey of 122 Finnish companies. This paper suggests that there is a significant gap between perceived potential of social media and social media use in innovation activity in business-to-business companies, recognizes potentially effective ways to reduce the gap, and clarifies the found differences between B2B's and B2C's.	bridging (networking);service innovation;social media;web 2.0	Hannu Kärkkäinen;Jari Juhani Jussila;Jaani Väisänen	2010		10.1145/1930488.1930536	public relations;media relations;marketing;media management;business;commerce	HCI	-86.97708841865338	-12.084886255533576	122454
adeb715cc04052ef9963ceb029183a4f8a1efa07	measuring and moderating opinion polarization in social networks	polarization;social networks;opinion formation;moderation	The polarization of society over controversial social issues has been the subject of study in social sciences for decades (Isenberg in J Personal Soc Psychol 50(6):1141–1151, 1986, Sunstein in J Polit Philos 10(2):175–195, 2002). The widespread usage of online social networks and social media, and the tendency of people to connect and interact with like-minded individuals has only intensified the phenomenon of polarization (Bakshy et al. in Science 348(6239):1130–1132, 2015). In this paper, we consider the problem of measuring and reducing polarization of opinions in a social network. Using a standard opinion formation model (Friedkin and Johnsen in J Math Soc 15(3–4):193–206, 1990), we define the polarization index, which, given a network and the opinions of the individuals in the network, it quantifies the polarization observed in the network. Our measure captures the tendency of opinions to concentrate in network communities, creating echo-chambers. Given this numeric measure of polarization, we then consider the problem of reducing polarization in the network by convincing individuals (e.g., through education, exposure to diverse viewpoints, or incentives) to adopt a more neutral stand towards controversial issues. We formally define the ModerateInternal and ModerateExpressed problems, and we prove that both our problems are NP-hard. By exploiting the linear-algebraic characteristics of the opinion formation model we design polynomial-time algorithms for both problems. Our experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate the validity of our metric, and the efficiency and the effectiveness of our algorithms in practice.	algorithm;echo suppression and cancellation;experiment;np-hardness;polarization (waves);polynomial;social media;social network;time complexity	Antonis Matakos;Evimaria Terzi;Panayiotis Tsaparas	2017	Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery	10.1007/s10618-017-0527-9	computer science;data mining;viewpoints;management science;social issues;social network;incentive;social media;phenomenon	ML	-87.87332185343631	-14.914212784631449	122606

Both this and the previous article use data from the same E-collaboration study as a basis for the discussion of important WarpPLS features. The focus of this article is on specific features related to saving and analyzing grouped descriptive statistics, viewing and changing analysis algorithm and resampling settings, and viewing and saving the various minor and major results of the analysis. Even though its focus is on an E-collaboration study, this article contributes to the broad literature on multivariate analysis methods, in addition to the more specific research literature on E-collaboration. The vast majority of relationships between variables, in investigations of both natural and behavioral phenomena, are nonlinear; usually taking the form of U and S curves. Structural equation modeling software tools, whether variancEor covariancE-based, typically do not estimate coefficients of association based on nonlinear analysis algorithms. WarpPLS is an exception in this respect. Without taking nonlinearity into consideration, the results can be misleading; especially in complex and multi-factorial situations such as those stemming from E-collaboration in virtual teams.

While about 83% of the sub-Saharan population is covered by a mobile network and nearly 70% has a mobile subscription, only 33% can access electricity [1]-[3]. This problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where network access and penetration lag slightly but electrification is far lower [4]. We term this condition the mobile-electrification gap (MEG.) Faced by the MEG, rural sub-Saharans options for phone charging are few and undesirable. As mobile growth has outstripped electrification on the continent, sub-Saharans have turned to limited off-grid solutions or to resold electricity from """"phone shops"""" to fill the void; some have even taken to shipping their phones to get them charged [5]."""	access network;bridging (networking);magnetoencephalography;the void (virtual reality)	Ezra Max;Justin Berman	2018	IEEE Technology and Society Magazine	10.1109/MTS.2018.2857599	engineering;rural area;computer security;phone;electrification;telecommunications;bridging (networking);population;electricity;cellular network;access network	Mobile	-81.29487869174923	-10.057222094586336	122752

However, it has been pointed out that the existing metrics are largely inadequate to reflect scholars’ overall peer-mediated performance, especially in the social sciences and humanities (SSH) where publication channels are more diverse. In this paper alternative metrics exploring a variety of formal and informal communication channels were proposed, with the aim of better reflecting SSH scholarship. Data for a group of SSH scholars in Taiwan on these metrics were collected. Principal component analysis revealed four underlying dimensions represented by the 18 metrics. Multiple-regression analyses were then performed to examine how well each of these dimensions predicted the academic standing of the scholars, measured by the number of public grants awarded and prestigious research awards received. Differences in the significance of the predictors were found between the social sciences and humanities. The results suggest the need to consider disciplinary differences when evaluating scholarly performance.	database;principal component analysis;scopus;web of science	Kuang-hua Chen;Muh-Chyun Tang;Chun-mei Wang;Jieh Hsiang	2014	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1420-6	public relations;social science;bibliometrics;computer science;data science;data mining;world wide web	Web+IR	-78.09735901289187	-20.717060382831985	122781

We study one such context-the elimination of cash payment on London buses in July 2014. We conducted ethnographic fieldwork, interviews with drivers and collected online and social media comments before, during and shortly after the introduction of cashless fares. We explore how drivers and passengers were fearful of the change due in part to a lack of information and communication, the anticipation of negative effects on vulnerable passengers and a compromise in freedom, flexibility and surveillance. We highlight the ways cashless payments can alter the social function of money, create new forms of work for drivers and passengers, and if not carefully introduced can cause emotional stress and fears of state surveillance and control.	cash;device driver;field research;money;social media	Gary W.

However, its presence in computer-mediated communication in corporate settings is not well understood. This paper provides a preliminary study of people's expression of sentiment in email conversations in an organizational context. The study reveals that sentiment levels evolve over time during the process of newcomers' socialization, that sentiment varies according to tie-strength with the recipient, and that sentiment patterns can be indicative of one's position in the corporate social network as well as job performance. These findings shed light on the complex and dynamic nature of sentiment patterns, and would inspire further explorations and applications of sentiment analysis in organizations.	computer-mediated communication;email;sentiment analysis;social network;socialization	Jiang Yang;Lada A.

Path analysis was used to examine the relationships between the two types of passion: obsessive and harmonious passion, behavioral regulations, and flow. A total of 1074 male secondary school students from Singapore took part in the study. The results of the path analysis showed that external, introjected, and identified regulations positively predicted obsessive passion, while harmonious passion was predicted by identified and intrinsic regulations. Flow in digital gaming was predicted directly by harmonious passion, as well as indirectly through intrinsic regulation. This study supports the proposed dualistic model of passion in explaining young people’s motivation in internet gaming. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

db3e713c882d8d6e8e6b240af5356c2aa24190ac	shifting toward collaboration (abstract)	working environment;computer usage;end users;organizations;software training	A paradigm shitl toward a more collaborative milieux is emerging. Groupware provides computer support for this shitl, lhowever, structural support is also needed. Structural support can be provided through revised education, evaluation, and reward systems that teach, recognize, and reinforce collaboration. PARADIGM SHIIT Many organizations have discovered that the rigid steep hierarchies of bureaucratic control that served them so well in the past, now hinder their abdity to react to changing economic and market conditions. Three particularly interesting adaptive trends have emerged. Fkst, the elimination of levels of hierarchy has transformed spire-shaped mountainous structures into gently rolling hills that are more easily traversed by win-win solutions to difficult problems. second, the empowerment of employees has unshackled them from a stifling hierarchical chain-of-command. Empowerment emancipates employees to engage in collaborative crossfunctional self-managed teamwork. Third, the formation of alliances with suppliers, customem, and competitors has signaled an openness toward collaborative teamwork across corporate entities. Each of these three trends indicates a shift toward a more collaborative milieux. TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT New collaboration-prone information technologies have also emerged to meet the needs of these trends. Referred to as groupware [Ellis et. al 1991] these information technologies support cooperation, coordination, and collaboration within and between groups under various conditions of task, time, and space. Groupware tools foster the development of electronic level playing fields of interpersonal networks that bridge functional divisions without the overhead of hierarchical mountain clirnbmg expeditions. These electronic social fields meet many of the criteria said to be conducive to innovation and productivhy in bureaucracies [Perin 1991]. CULTURE CLASH The collaborative social norms of autonomous self-managed invisible electronic social fields, run counter to the competitive social norms of bureaucracies. This culture clash inhibhs the adoption of groupware tools by managem who see social fields as being antistructural [Perin 1991]. Indeed, competitive cultures tend to be slower to adopt groupware than collaborative cultures [Cheek 1993]. SOCIAL NORMS Social norms that perpetuate hierarchy through competition arc distinctly different from those that foster collaboration. For example, interpersonal interactions in hierarchical social structures tend to employ one-up-one-down strategies that benefit the individual at the expense of the group. Hierarchical transactions tend to be parent-child; behavior tends to be either aggressive (one-up) or passive (one-down) or passive/aggressive (pretending to be one-down while engaging in guerih warfare sabotage against the competition) and conflict resolution tends to produce win-lose outcomes. In contrast, interpersonal interactions in egalitarian social structures tend to employ strategies that benefit the group to the mutual benefit of all. Egalitarian transactions tend to be adult-adul~ behavior tends to be assertive (i.e. neither aggressive nor passive} and conflict resolution tends tcl produce win-win outcomes. NEEDED STRUCTURAL SUPPORT Changing from the competitive milieux of a mountainous hierarchy to the collaborative milieux of an egalitarian (all-equals) level playing field requires much relearning of interaction patterns and social norms. In highly competitive cultures, such as the United States [Kohn 1986], many individuals have little, if any, life experience of a collaborative culture. ‘Ihe education system (public, private, and corporate) can provide structural support for collaboration by including collaborative learning experiences in their curriculums. The performance evaluation system can provide structural support by replacing “boss” evaluation with peer evaluation. The reward system can provide structural support by rewarding groups rather than individuals. These and other structural revisions are needed to support the transition to a more collaborative milieux. SUMMARY Collaborative cooperation is a productive alternative to the inherent destructiveness of competition [Kohn 1986]. The shift toward collaboration that groupware supports must be matched by shifts within individuals, within organizations, within the univemc. Our mutual survival depends on it. RESEARCH IN PROGRESS The author’s current research addresses structural support revisions needed for the shit? toward collaboration. REFERENCES Cheek, M.

The single-item approach to measure daily contacts differentiates the individuals effectively, corresponds closely with complex network measures, and reveals well how individuals vary in both expressive and instrumental returns, as supported by 14 large-scale probability surveys from three Chinese societies over a decade. This paper also draws upon three sets of sophisticated contact diaries, which yielded rich data about the circumstance of each contact, the alter’s characteristics and the ego–alter relationship. Along with the diary approach, which offers sophisticated data about contacts, ties and networks, the single-item survey approach is another extreme yet straightforward measure of daily contacts. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Especially when companies cross borders to conduct business, the lines for what is ethical begin to blur when costs and profits are concerned. Thus, many issues emerge when looking at environmental and social responsibility, such as environmental friendliness, local manufacturing, and child labor. These ethical issues have brought about standards of conduct for businesses as consumers tend to react poorly when an ethical line has been crossed. This study attempts to look at how one such issue, child labor, impacts the purchasing behaviors of consumers for the cell phone industry. Coltan is a raw mineral that is used in many technologies, including the batteries of cell phones and computers. This mineral is currently being mined using child labor in Africa, specifically the country of Congo. Unfortunately, this issue has not been publicized and cell phone companies are not currently being held accountable for where the coltan for their cell phones is coming from. Thus, the purpose of this study is to expose this ethical dilemma and measure the potential effect on consumers within the cell phone industry.	cell (microprocessor);computer;mined;mobile phone;purchasing	Emily K.

While general citation patterns have been widely studied in the literature we develop the notion of citation projection graphs by investigating the citations among the publications that a given paper cites. We investigate how patterns of citations vary between various scientific disciplines and how such patterns reflect the scientific impact of the paper. We find that idiosyncratic citation patterns are characteristic for low impact papers; while narrow, discipline-focused citation patterns are common for medium impact papers. Our results show that crossing-community, or bridging citation patters are high risk and high reward since such patterns are characteristic for both low and high impact papers. Last, we observe that recently citation networks are trending toward more bridging and interdisciplinary forms.	bridging (networking);citation graph;journal citation reports	Xiaolin Shi;Jure Leskovec;Daniel A.

We study the perception and the conceptualization of this term in the traditional media using eight years of data collected from news outlets based in 20 countries. Our results not only corroborate previous indications of a high increase in the usage of the expression “fake news”, but also show contextual changes around this expression after the United States presidential election of 2016. Among other results, we found changes in the related vocabulary, in the mentioned entities, in the surrounding topics and in the contextual polarity around the term “fake news”, suggesting that this expression underwent a change in perception and conceptualization after 2016. These outcomes expand the understandings on the usage of the term “fake news”, helping to comprehend and more accurately characterize this relevant social phenomenon linked to misinformation and manipulation.	conceptualization (information science);entity;vocabulary	Evandro Cunha;Gabriel Magno;Josemar Alves Caetano;Douglas Teixeira;Virgílio A.

Our research presented here focuses on how microworkers construct meaningfulness, based on the accounts of workers on the crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. We draw upon a relational job design perspective to explore why microworkers experience meaningfulness in their work. We found four sources of meaningfulness: rewards, self-improvement, moral, and social. These four sources vary in the degree to which they were internal or external in focus, and in their level of rationalization (concrete or abstract). This may explain why such types of employment are appealing despite a lack of organizational-support structures and points to the need to better understand cue provision in virtual, platform-enabled work settings.	digital humanities;microwork	Dominique Kost;Christian Fieseler;Sut I Wong	2018	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2018.01.002	rationalization (psychology);the internet;knowledge management;peer review;psychology;social psychology;job design;microwork;crowdsourcing	HCI	-85.12544551779305	-15.839610744695985	124016

The aim of this study was to investigate if selected factors have differential predicting power on the use of Facebook and Google service in Taiwan. This study employed seven constructs: purposive value, hedonic value, social identity, social support, interpersonal relationship, personality traits, and intimacy as the factors predicting Facebook and Google usage. An electronic survey technique was used to collect data from Internet. The results showed that hedonic value and social identity constructs can significantly predict Facebook usage and purposive value has significant predicting power on Google usage. The construct intimacy is the most significant factor for both Google and Facebook usages. Our findings make suggestions for social network sites (SNSs) providers that to differentiate their SNSs quality from others’, both functional aspects and emotional factors need to be taken into consideration.	internet;social network;social support	Huey-Wen Chou;Kai-Chun Chang;Yu-Hsun Lin	2012	IJSTM	10.1504/IJSTM.2013.055634	advertising;internet privacy;cyberpsychology	HCI	-89.27087818713659	-11.280333162807983	124188

The key findings from national surveys of Internet use during 2000 and 2001, together with census data, provide an indication of Internet access amongst Maori. The results show there is a substantial “digital divide” between Maori and other New Zealanders, in terms of access to the Internet and employment in information technology industries. This “divide” is likely to be due to the lower household incomes and educational outcomes of Maori adults. While Maori currently do not have the same level of access to information technology as non‐Maori, the growth in their participation has nonetheless been rapid.

Preference affirmation is an important consideration as marketers seek to promote their products and leverage the visibility of consumer preferences. This research-in-progress indicates that others’ willingness to affirm their friends’ preferences is related to social expectations and product characteristics. Using Pinterest data from April 2012, my analysis uncovers negative correlations between preference affirmation and social norm breaches. Furthermore, in some cases, users with higher degrees are correlated with lower preference affirmation by others. Thus, the relationships between preference affirmation, social expectations, and users’ ego network in an “open” social network may be more nuanced and deserves additional scrutiny.

Deception in face-to-face communication has been extensively studied in social science disciplines to identify cues to deception and to understand human deception detection. As the globalization and popularity of virtual teams grows, people increasingly rely on computer mediation for interpersonal communication, information acquisition, and information dissemination. Online communication enabled by electronic media (e.g., emails and instant messaging) relieves people from contextual restrictions on their behavior and enables selective self-presentation due to the physical separation and optional anonymity of communication partners. As a result, online communication may offer fertile grounds for deception and alter the social and legal distribution of deceptive practice. According to an annual report of the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3, http://www. ic3.gov/), in 2007, IC3 processed about 220,000 complaints that could lead to Internet crime investigations by law enforcement and regulatory agencies. The total dollar loss from all cases of fraud was $239.00 million, up from $198,000 million in 2006. Email was one of the primary mechanisms (73.6%) by which fraudulent contact took place. Despite ample research on deception and on online communication individually, there is relatively little work aiming to understand their interaction until recently. Through a series of studies on deception in online communication, we have obtained a collection of linguistic cues to deception and developed models for automatic deception detection. These cues and models can be used to assist people in detecting online deception and to increase the public awareness of deception in online communication.	communications of the acm;computer-mediated communication;email;instant messaging;internet crime complaint center;sensor;virtual reality	Lina Zhou;Dongsong Zhang	2008	Commun.

In recent years, a rash increase in securitizing gamification-related inventions has taken place. By analyzing the content of 134 unique patents from USPTO and EPO with an in-depth raw data text analysis, the technical background is explored holistically. To discover meaningful patterns and thus to derive implications from the patent data they are visually summarized. Especially predominant are the topics of device, data, user and game. Based on the nature of the data, being evidence-based and future directed, our technical framework integrates these patterns and sets it into relation. An additional analysis provides further insights into fundamental game elements. As patents serve as a decisive indicator of future product introductions, the information gathered in this paper represents essential strategic information to guide practitioners and researchers in the area of gamification.	assisted gps;gamification;holism	Patrick Julian Hoeflinger	2017			knowledge management;computer science	ML	-78.87557827917463	-16.311167949035937	124333

However, when learning about a controversial claim, human biases and viewpoints may affect which evidence documents are considered """"trustworthy"""" or credible. It is important to overcome this bias and know both viewpoints to get a balanced perspective. In this paper, we study various factors that affect learning about the truthfulness of controversial claims. We designed a user study to understand the impact of these factors. Specifically, we studied the impact of presenting evidence with contrasting viewpoints and source expertise rating on how users accessed the evidence documents. This would help us optimize how to teach users about controversial topics in the most effective way, and to design better claim verification systems. We find that users do not seek contrasting viewpoints by themselves, but explicitly presenting contrasting evidence helps them get a well-rounded understanding of the topic. Furthermore, explicit knowledge of the source credibility and the context not only affects what users read, but also how credible they perceive the document to be."""	document;trustworthy computing;usability testing	V.

We test two competing models that build on direct causation theory and affect heuristic theory, respectively. In a direct effect model, affect steers self-disclosure, independent of cognitive cost–benefit appraisals. The indirect effect model instead suggests that affect influences self-disclosure by adjusting perceptions of benefits and costs. The empirical comparison of the models relies on survey data from more than 500 university students. Overall, affect influences self-disclosure indirectly by adjusting the benefits people perceive. In particular, affect toward self-disclosure and toward SN websites relate positively to self-disclosure motivators; their perceived values appear amplified in the presence of positive affect. We also offer a plausible, alternative explanation of the observed positive relationship between privacy risk and self-disclosure according to an indirect effect model, in which self-...	social network	Jongtae Yu;Paul Jen-Hwa Hu;Tsang-Hsiang Cheng	2015	J. of Management Information Systems	10.1080/07421222.2015.1063305	public relations;marketing;social psychology;affect	DB	-89.16991474240204	-13.529346997212599	124556
5583df9760f3b6b497aa9d82d64a8ffeeef9e272	weaponizing the haters: the last jedi and the strategic politicization of pop culture through social media manipulation		Political discourse on social media is seen by many as polarized, vitriolic and permeated by falsehoods and misinformation. Political operators have exploited all of these aspects of the discourse for strategic purposes, most famously during the Russian social media influence campaign during the 2016 presidential election in the United States and current, similar efforts targeting the U.S. elections in 2018 and 2020. The results of the social media study presented in this paper presents evidence that political influence through manipulation of social media discussions is no longer exclusive to political debate but can now also be found in pop culture. Specifically, this study examines a collection of tweets relating to a much-publicized fan dispute over the Star Wars franchise film Episode VII: The Last Jedi . This study finds evidence of deliberate, organized political influence measures disguised as fan arguments. The likely objective of these measures is increasing media coverage of the fandom conflict, thereby adding to and further propagating a narrative of widespread discord and dysfunction in American society. Persuading voters of this narrative remains a strategic goal for the U.S. alt-right movement, as well as the Russian Federation. The results of this study show that among those who address The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson directly on Twitter to express their dissatisfaction, more than half are bots, trolls/sock puppets or political activists using the debate to propagate political messages supporting extreme right-wing causes and the discrimination of gender, race or sexuality. A number of these users appear to be Russian trolls. The paper concludes that while it is only a minority of Twitter accounts that tweet negatively about The Last Jedi , organized attempts at politicizing the pop culture discourse on social media for strategic purposes are significant enough that users should be made aware of these measures, so they can act accordingly.

67d6d4e8dafb1ac902c5ccf0fe696a3e1ab8cb14	the social aspect of voting for useful reviews		Word-of-mouth is being replaced by online reviews on products and services. To identify the most useful reviews, many web sites enable readers to vote on which reviews they find useful. In this work we use three hypotheses to predict which reviews will be voted useful. The first is that useful reviews induce feelings. The second is that useful reviews are both informative and expressive, thus contain less adjectives while being longer. The third hypothesis is that the reviewer’s history can be used as a predictor. We devise impact metrics similar to the scientific metrics for assessing the impact of a scholar, namely h-index, i5-index. We analyze the performance of our hypotheses over three datasets collected from Yelp and Amazon. Our surprising and robust results show that the only good predictor to the usefulness of a review is the reviewer’s impact metrics score. We further devise a regression model that predicts the usefulness rating of each review. To further understand these results we characterize reviewers with high impact metrics scores and show that they write reviews frequently, and that their impact scores increase with time, on average. We suggest the term local celebs for these reviewers, and analyze the conditions for becoming local celebs on sites.	information;kerrison predictor;local variable	Asher Levi;Osnat Mokryn	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-05579-4_36	computer science;data science;data mining;world wide web;statistics	Web+IR	-79.67857832988368	-20.645987868774775	124640
1b6ee86f18d57ef9b3d8a6c5fccca3c3926465f3	the many paradoxes of broadband	telecommunications industry;information technology;fiber to the home;broadband;ftth;it	There is much dismay and even despair over the slow pace at which broadband is advancing in the United States. This slow pace is often claimed to be fatally retarding the recovery of the entire IT industry. As a result there are increasing calls for government action, through regulation or even through outright subsidies. A careful examination shows that broadband is full of puzzles and paradoxes, which suggests caution before taking any drastic action. As one simple example, the basic meaning of broadband is almost universally misunderstood, since by the official definition, we all have broadband courtesy of the postal system. Also, broadband penetration, while generally regarded as disappointingly slow, is actually extremely fast by most standards, faster than cell phone diffusion at a comparable stage. Furthermore, many of the policies proposed for advancing broadband are likely to have perverse effects. There are many opportunities for narrowband services that are not being exploited, some of which might speed up broadband adoption. There are interesting dynamics to the financial and technological scenes that suggest broadband access may arrive sooner than generally expected. It may also arrive through unexpected channels. On the other hand, fiber-to-the-home, widely regarded as the Holy Grail of residential broadband, might never become widespread. In any case, there is likely to be considerable turmoil in the telecom industry over the next few years. Robust growth in demand is likely to be combined with a restructuring of the industry.	consensus (computer science);exploit (computer security);fairness measure;fiber to the x;file sharing;internet access;last mile;mobile phone;money;paging;postal;speculative execution;unintended consequences	Andrew M.

Rich information revealed on the Internet leads to the change of consumers’ purchase decision-making processes. Findings from the consumer focus group interviews support that consumers do have tendency to perform search online before committing to any purchases. Also, it suggests a two-phased information search and evaluation model. In the proposed model, online shoppers tend to place more focus on different marketing mix elements in each phase. Most online shoppers evaluate the product in the first phase and compare prices in the second. While the decision of sales channel selection is postponed, both traditional and electronic alternatives are jointly evaluated in retail markets. Managerial implications from this study contribute insight about modern day consumers and retailing markets.	e-commerce;focus group;internet;online shopping;purchasing	Chun-An Chen	2009	JSW		e-commerce;marketing mix;decision-making;index term;computer science;focus group;retail;consumer behaviour	ECom	-89.6388892100728	-11.912163496071617	124932

More specifically, there is a paucity of research on the topic of building successful Web 2.0 communities like YouTube—the top ranked Web 2.0 video sharing website. In this paper, a framework for Web 2.0 community success is proposed based on a theoretical review and an empirical study of YouTube using a dual approach consisting of content analysis and grounded theory interviews. The findings identify specific internal and external factors that are important for the success of YouTube as a Web 2.0 community. A framework of Web 2.0 community success is also proposed, which is useful in the planning and administration of Web 2.0 Communities. the topic of community (Hagel & Armstrong, 1997; Karp et al., 1977; Muniz & O’Guinn, 2001; Rothaermela & Sugiyama, 2001; Szmigin et al., 2005), research in the more recent concept of Web 2.0 communities is still in its formative stages. More specifically, there is a paucity of research on the topic of building successful online communities, considering their unprecedented growth in popularity. This paper is expected to provide a catalyst for further research in this area. This objective of this study is to address this by proposing a conceptual framework for online community success based on an amalgamation of theory and an empirical study of YouTube using a dual approach consisting of DOI: 10.4018/jeco.2011040101 2 Journal of Electronic Commerce in Organizations, 9(2), 1-14, April-June 2011 Copyright © 2011, IGI Global.

This paper will cover relevant concepts in a literature review, explain the rationale for its research methodology and then present its findings in a discussion that includes a conceptual model. YouTube was selected as the pre-eminent Web 2.0 online community for this study due to its ubiquity, success, and ranking by Web 2.0 magazine (“Top 100 Web 2.0 Websites”, 2007) as the number one Web 2.0 video sharing website. Additionally, YouTube was named Time magazine’s ‘2006 invention of the year’ (“Best Inventions”, 2006). Considering the apparent absence of frameworks that can be used to plan Web 2.0 communities, the conceptual framework presented is expected to provide a basis for structuring Web 2.0 communities for success, given their growing importance to E-commerce organizations and the broader online community. In this context of this study, ‘success’ is defined by the size of the community, determined by market share. YouTube’s competitor Dailymotion.com, which is substantially less successful (0.22% market share vs. YouTube’s 42.94%) (Hitwise, 2006), will be included in the discussion as to provide a comparative dimension.	online community;web 2.0	Joshua Chang;Clifford Lewis	2011	JECO	10.4018/jeco.2011040101	social web;community;the internet;web analytics;content analysis;web standards;social semantic web;multimedia;internet privacy;web intelligence;empirical research;grounded theory;web 2.0;world wide web	Web+IR	-86.52909118856368	-11.9042483713531	124938

Extant research on online review generation has primarily focused on the valence of online review, the volume of online review however remains largely unexamined. This study examines the peer effect on content production. Using a unique data set, we track and measure peer effect at message level. We find that peer effect does exist and it is attributed to the characteristics of the receiver, the object and the message, the relationship between the sender and the receiver. Intriguingly, our findings show that not all friends have the same effect on content production. A user is more likely affected by friends who share salient and relevant content and whom the user admires. Our findings hold implications for online review platform designer and marketers in terms of utilizing peer effect to facilitate content generation and spreading Word of Mouth.	google moderator;information systems;software quality	Zhihong Ke;De Liu	2015			computer science;multimedia;advertising;world wide web	HCI	-85.90381786018696	-16.722541324265205	124989

They are expected to write good reviews at product review sites; provide high quality answers in question answering systems; and share interesting content in social networks. In the context of marketing and advertising, knowing how users react to emails and messages from authority senders is important, given the prevalence of email in our everyday life. Using a real-life academic event, we designed and conducted an online controlled experiment to determine how email senders of different types of authority (department head, event organizer and a general email account) affect the range of response behavior of recipients, which includes opening the email, browsing the event website, and registering for the event. In addition, we proposed a systematic approach to analyze the user response behavior to email campaigns from the time the user receives the email till he/she browses the website in a seamless manner.	display resolution;electronic organizer;email;question answering;real life;seamless3d;social network;social system	Kwan Hui Lim;Ee-Peng Lim;Binyan Jiang;Palakorn Achananuparp	2016		10.1145/2914586.2914619	authority;computer science;email address harvesting;internet privacy;opt-in email;world wide web	HCI	-87.45087835648182	-13.80560300725247	125354

The hypotheses are empirically tested by analyzing data collected from 290 solvers on a Chinese crowdsourcing contest platform. A negative moderation effect between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic incentives is found, showing that intrinsic motivation's effect on task effort weakens when the level of extrinsic incentives is high. More interesting, we find that this moderation effect is fully mediated by engagement, which in turn directly increases task effort. In addition, extrinsic incentives are found to positively moderate the relationship between engagement and task effort. These findings shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying solver motivation and engagement in crowdsourcing contests, and provide implications for theory and practice of crowdsourcing management.	crowdsourcing	Huigang Liang;Meng-Meng Wang;Jianjun Wang;Yajiong Xue	2018	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.11.040	knowledge management;psychology;moderation;social psychology;instrumental and intrinsic value;incentive;moderated mediation;crowdsourcing	NLP	-91.13652703913831	-14.682164499496535	125533

Two pilot studies and three laboratory experiments were conducted to test and develop the concepts, measurements, and the integrated model. The results support the proposed integrated model. Behavioral intention and entertainment motive collectively predicted behavioral usage. Satisfaction was positively associated with the level of usage. The good structure fit with the merge model and data showed that the model explained more than 30% variance of behavioral usage. Although both theories are solid acceptance theories, U&G provides specific information and a more complete understanding of usage, whereas TAM constructs are easily used with Web-based applications. This study gives researchers and practitioners an interdisciplinary perspective for investigating the phenomenon of technology acceptance. In addition, it merges the strengths from the fields of information systems and communications.

This is the case for (in total) 75 examined researchers from the fields of mathematics (Fields medalists), physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine (Nobel laureates). We study several indicators for these researchers, including the h-index, total number of publications, average number of citations per publication, the number (and fraction) of uncited publications, and their interrelations. The most remarkable result is a positive correlation between the h-index and the number of uncited articles. We also present a Lotkaian model, which partially explains the empirically found regularities.

While online news venues have been available for quite some time, the major tragedies and news events of the past few years have highlighted their ability to provide immediate, constantly-updated information (Emmer et al., 2002). In this paper we describe the current state of play in the online news industry in ten European countries, as at May 2003. The findings are based on the first two phases of a three-phase, European-Commission-funded market survey. In the paper we consider in greater detail the Internet business models of these companies. After initially introducing some of the literature in this field and discussing the justification for our chosen research approach, we describe our research design. We then report the findings from the first two phases of the project – the “Expert talks” and our web-based survey of the online news industry. Finally we identify the key driving factors for online news today: the new competitive environment, the appropriate payment systems, the focus on core competences, end devices and the consumers.	dot-com company;internet;online music store;web application	Cornelia C.

The purpose of this study is to formulate and evaluate critical success factors in the open market from the perspective of buyers. Based on an extended technology acceptance model, this study assumes that the success of open markets are influenced by several factors, including perceived website quality, perceived usefulness, third party recognition, satisfaction, and trust. An empirical survey is conducted and questionnaires are collected from the respondents who had experience in using the open markets. The hypotheses are verified by using the structural equation modeling. Testing results are summarized and managerial implications are discussed.	e-commerce;internet;online shopping;structural equation modeling;theory	Sung Ho Ha;Luo Tao Liu	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16283-1_31	public relations;marketing;business;commerce	Web+IR	-89.39004006392408	-10.789464397218612	126633

Measurements such as citation counts and h-index are used for evaluating individual research performance as well as the ranking of research institutions and universities. This exploratory study aims to understand the implications of the increasing use of metrics on scholarly communication and practices. A pilot study was conducted in universities in Ireland. Preliminary findings show that researchers use Google Scholar and ResearchGate for self-monitoring and that they perceive bibliometric measures as indicators of achievements. The pilot study also shows that there are mixed feelings toward bibliometrics: while the participants emphasise that research interest is the most important criterion in choosing research topics and publication channels and that citation counts, h-index, and RG scores are coincidental of their research activities, they also perceive the quantitative measures as objective evaluation of research performance without knowing how the h-index or RG scores are calculated.	scholarly communication	Lai Ma;Michael R Ladisch	2016		10.1002/pra2.2016.14505301132	library science;knowledge management;political science;management science	HCI	-78.9627990930451	-21.960269215829115	126650

Study participants' decisions and actions related to the preservation of their digital information were examined. Significant positive and negatives experiences using digital information were found to influence participants' behaviors. Motivated by frustration and anger over digital devices malfunctioning, participants intentionally store personal digital content in multiple locations as a means of digital preservation. Positive experiences with digital information motivated participants to unintentionally store and preserve personal content on the web as a result of social interactions through email and social networking sites. The findings provide support for the study of positive affective issues in information behavior research and in particular its relationship to information valued for the long term and social networks and web-based storage practices.

Drawing on the theory of social construction of technology, the study employs an in-depth case study approach to investigate how the community network was designed and how the Kutztown community participated in the network development. The findings show that there was little societal input into the design process; the design process was influenced by political economy factors, which now threaten the viability of the network. The study highlights the significant role of intermediation in developing community networks and concludes that community participation should not be limited to particular development stages.	interaction	Dong Hee Shin;Murali Venkatesh	2008	Proceedings of the 41st Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2008)	10.1109/HICSS.2008.67	social relation;community organization;design process;economics;marketing;socioeconomics;community building;management;economic growth;economic system;social network	HCI	-81.03001852062822	-12.494135674732254	127059

The antecedents of group-oriented conversation are difficult to pinpoint, however, because of the complex interdependence between individual and group behavior. In this study we utilize a unique set of exogenous, group-level treatments – the outcomes of National Football League games – to observe how group members – fans of these teams – participate in group-oriented conversation on Twitter. We show first that positive group outcomes (team victories) encourage group members to talk publicly about their group. Our results also indicate that group members participate more actively in the group-oriented discussion when the the outcome is a surprise.

Drawing upon social cognitive theory (SCT) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this paper explores how and to what extent persuasive social influence features (namely, social learning (SL), social comparison (SC), and normative influence (NI)) alter customer behavior toward engagement in feedback sharing. A theory-driven research model was composed and then analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Based on a pilot experimental study involving 69 Twitter users, the authors indicate that behavioral intention (BI) to engage in feedback sharing is partially explained by the perceived persuasiveness (PP) of a system, which is partly explained by means of NI, which in turn is partly explained by means of SC. On top of that, SL plays an important role in explaining and influencing all of the abovementioned constructs.	experiment;normative social influence;partial least squares regression;sl (complexity);sociotechnical system;structural equation modeling	Agnis Stibe;Harri Oinas-Kukkonen;Tuomas Lehto	2013	2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2013.222	normative social influence;social learning;cognition;social comparison theory;feature extraction;social influence;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;marketing;persuasive technology;feedback;customer satisfaction;management;world wide web	HCI	-88.49713185862893	-13.58074182794999	127611

However, little is known about what affects the speed of social mobilization. Here we use a framed field experiment to identify and measure properties of individuals and their relationships that predict mobilization speed. We ran a global social mobilization contest and recorded personal traits of the participants and those they recruited. We studied the effects of ascribed traits (gender, age) and acquired traits (geography, and information source) on the speed of mobilization. We found that homophily, a preference for interacting with other individuals with similar traits, had a mixed role in social mobilization. Homophily was present for acquired traits, in which mobilization speed was faster when the recuiter and recruit had the same trait compared to different traits. In contrast, we did not find support for homophily for the ascribed traits. Instead, those traits had other, non-homophily effects: Females mobilized other females faster than males mobilized other males. Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and older recruits mobilized slower. Recruits also mobilized faster when they first heard about the contest directly from the contest organization, and decreased in speed when hearing from less personal source types (e.g. family vs. media). These findings show that social mobilization includes dynamics that are unlike other, more passive forms of social activity propagation. These findings suggest relevant factors for engineering social mobilization tasks for increased speed.	geography;information source;interaction;social network;software propagation;trait	Jeff Alstott;Stuart E.

The new model is then tested against data obtained from college students as well as from a technological lifestyle forum. After the revisions these analyses suggested were applied, the model explained nearly 23% of the variance in the number of movies downloaded. The most important factors in this model were, among others: the drives to see many different and new movies, the social environment and its perceived attitude toward the behaviour, and the degree to which downloading has embedded itself in the daily routine. Because the Dutch government and lobbyists are superficially unclear about the current legislature, the unique opportunity existed to study the impact of knowing about legislature on the behaviour. Other results indicate an unexpected openness to an alternative film-distribution method where both the producers and the consumers get an honest deal, presenting options to release the current political and social tension without prosecuting an increasing portion of the population.	download;embedded system;openness	Ruud S.

4834fe26f1ab5787f97ed54ea7c7b61e899492be	the emotional antecedents of solidarity in social media crowds		This study examines the organizational dynamics of social media crowds, in particular, the influence of a crowd’s emotional expression on its solidarity. To identify the relationship between emotions expressed and solidarity, marked by sustained participation in the crowd, the study uses tweets from a unique population of crowds—those tweeting about ongoing National Football League games. Observing this population permits the use of game results as quasi-random treatments on crowds, helping to reduce confounding factors. Results indicate that participation in these crowds is self-sustaining in the medium term (1 week) and can be stimulated or suppressed by emotional expression in a short term (1 hour), depending on the discrete emotion expressed. In particular, anger encourages participation while sadness discourages it. Positive emotions and anxiety have a more nuanced relationship with participation.	social media	Drew Margolin;Wang Liao	2018	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444818758702	social psychology;sociology;crowds;population;anger;social media;sadness;football;emotional expression;solidarity	HCI	-88.22007772837944	-18.731706637981734	128323
90319e795968b1c3b58d157b613c3cf65b30f8f8	can government regulate an evil online game?: an empirical analysis of regulation policy effects using vector autoregression		The objective of this study is to examine the effects of regulation policy on online gambling, an increasingly popular type of entertainment in the online game industry. Prior information systems (IS) studies on online game focus primarily on user behavior. However, there is a growing need to investigate the effects of regulation policy on dynamic changes of games or service providers instead of ad hoc heuristic approaches on individual behavior. Going beyond the approaches of previous studies, this study empirically tests the regulation policy effect with three theoretical perspectives: social influence, prior experience and perceived switching cost. A vector autoregression (VAR) methodology is used to forecast game usage and to model several patterns of the co-movement of online games. Evidence is also provided of strong Granger-causal interdependencies within games and service providers. This study provides one of the first empirical evidences that examine the effects of regulation policies on online game. In research methodology aspect, this study also introduces an exposition of VAR methodology in IS research. Therefore, it provides advanced knowledge on gambling behavior and helps develop suitable regulation policy to protect users of online gambling as well as to satisfy policy makers.	autoregressive model;causality;difference in differences;heuristic;hoc (programming language);information retrieval facility;information system;interdependence;multihoming;multiple homing;occam's razor;online shopping;vector autoregression	Moonkyoung Jang;Seongmin Jeon;Jongil Kim;Byungjoon Yoo	2015			entertainment;marketing;service provider;interdependence;information system;vector autoregression;heuristic;government;social influence;economics	HCI	-87.50493502478247	-10.943524722337004	128542
ddb6df87bc09081d175be3f642eab8b3cb6c9450	ordering versus grabbing: the influence of temporal proximity on unregulated online buying behavior	electronic commerce	A study is proposed to test the effects of temporal proximity between the encounter of a stimulus and the receipt of the product on impulsive online buying behavior. In traditional retail settings, temporal proximity between exposure to a stimulus and receipt of the product is an important factor influencing impulsive buying behavior. In most online shopping situations however, there is a time lag between the purchasing process and the receipt of the product; studies have nevertheless shown the widespread existence of impulsive buying behavior in online settings. A model is proposed that demonstrates how future consequences can influence online buying behavior and how the temporal proximity between the exposure to a stimulus and the possibility to conduct a purchase “on the spot” can override the consideration of future consequences and trigger impulsive online buying behavior. In order to test the model, a laboratory experiment has been designed. The expected findings will further the understanding of factors influencing impulsive online buying behavior, and will thus provide prescriptive insights for the design of business-to-consumer e-commerce systems.	e-commerce;online shopping;purchasing	Christoph Schneider	2006			consideration of future consequences;marketing;purchasing process;computer science;lag;receipt	ML	-89.40717798441256	-12.768131606111728	128699

Four classes emerged, listed from largest to smallest class: (a) communal coping mothers, (b) shared communal copers, (c) independent communal coping children, and (d) communal coping children. Mothers’ parent–child closeness predicted class membership, but adolescent children’s reported closeness was not a significant predictor. Nevertheless, adolescent children’s respect for family significantly predicted class membership, whereas mothers’ respect for family was not a significant predictor. Mothers who were members of the communal coping children class reported less frequent depressive symptoms, whereas children who were independent communal coping children reported more frequent depressive symptoms.	biological anthropology;centrality;dyadic transformation;emoticon;kerrison predictor;latent class model	Jennifer A.

Critics of GIS, and the associated technologies, for the collection of administrative and service data frequently strcss the threats to privacy that such systems pose. H o w e r , with only a few cxccptions, such as the Scandinavian countries, register, transaction, or survey-based means of counting the population have nor replaced the traditional census as the most important single source of social information. Gnsuscs are complicated to administer and to analyse. They are costly and they have to meet the needs of many users. Ar a professional level M U O ~ census authorities collabontc and share their technical expertise, yet census users seldom have the opportunity to make international comparisons. Such studies can show the relative strengths and weaknesses of alternative approaches and provide an opportunity for crossfertilization berween countries. T h e decennial censuses in the UK and the US appear, at first sight, to be very similar. Both aim to be complete surveys of the whole population; both cover a range of housing, social, and economic questions in addition to basic demographic details; both have problems with undercounting, particularly in metropolitan areas; and both publish their results on a variety of print and computer-readable media. Yet it is the differences between thcse two censuses, and the ways in which they are exploited, that are most instructive.

Although adult gamers are also known to be vulnerable to addictive playing behaviours, this aspect of highly engaged gaming among adults has rarely been investigated. To address this issue, biographical interviews were conducted with 35 adult gamers to explore their interaction with the game, integration of gaming into everyday life, and social interaction in real and virtual life. Participants were also asked about their reasons for becoming involved in highly engaged gaming, and for ending that involvement. The findings indicate that highly engaged adult gamers are a heterogeneous group. Three general types of gamer emerged from the interviews. One of these types showed no signs of problematic behaviour; however, the other two types tended to neglect aspects of everyday life and the real-life social environment in their playing behaviours.	artificial life;real life	Emese Domahidi;Thorsten Quandt	2015	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444814521791	psychology;typology;addiction;marketing;multimedia;advertising;social psychology	HCI	-85.89971878978595	-19.26127307953954	129575
0fefca8f0bc0f81f61740ad62737bcea5904ccf2	exploring user perceptions of discrimination in online targeted advertising.		Targeted online advertising now accounts for the largest share of the advertising market, beating out both TV and print ads. While targeted advertising can improve users’ online shopping experiences, it can also have negative effects. A plethora of recent work has found evidence that in some cases, ads may be discriminatory, leading certain groups of users to see better offers (e.g., job ads) based on personal characteristics such as gender. To develop policies around advertising and guide advertisers in mak­ ing ethical decisions, one thing we must better understand is what concerns users and why. In an effort to answer this question, we conducted a pilot study and a multi-step main survey (n=2,086 in total) presenting users with dif­ ferent discriminatory advertising scenarios. We find that overall, 44% of respondents were moderately or very con­ cerned by the scenarios we presented. Respondents found the scenarios significantly more problematic when dis­ crimination took place as a result of explicit demographic targeting rather than in response to online behavior. How­ ever, our respondents’ opinions did not vary based on whether a human or an algorithm was responsible for the discrimination. These findings suggest that future pol­ icy documents should explicitly address discrimination in targeted advertising, no matter its origin, as a significant user concern, and that corporate responses that blame the algorithmic nature of the ad ecosystem may not be helpful for addressing public concerns.	algorithm;amazon mechanical turk;distributed interactive simulation;ecosystem;experience;icy;limbo;named entity;online advertising;online shopping	Angelisa C.

62a9208cda3b5076f6cdd8d6196756aca19de2c9	reciprocity: understanding online social relations	information systems;reciprocity	Reciprocity is a key concept for understanding social behaviour. It involves complex interactions of giving and returning. This paper examines the concept of reciprocity to think about, and design for, online social interactions. We argue that reciprocal exchange is symbolic insofar as it produces and enacts many forms of social life by drawing individuals into a relation of recognition. Indeed, reciprocal interactions underlie much online activity, and a fuller understanding of the concept explains important aspects of how social life is conducted with others online. We contrast our understanding of reciprocity with those of more dominant theories of interaction built on the assumption that actions, including those that seek reciprocity, are self–interested or otherwise altruistic. This assumption ignores how social actions that solicit a return–action seek to neither profit nor benefit, but rather express a desire to draw in others into social life and relationships. After analysing three kinds of online activity (web forums, social networking sites, and online games) using our view of this concept, we conclude with implications for designers who seek to support the development of our digitally–mediated social life.

Based on a literature review of social capital and citizen participation, the study develops a model of active e-participation. In this model, this study argues that three dimensions of social capital and citizen participation management are positively associated with active e-participation. To test several hypotheses, the study uses the 2009 E-Participation Survey data collected from 1,076 participants of the Cheon Man Sang Sang Oasis, an e-participation program administered by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in South Korea. Using ordered logistic regression analysis, the study finds that active e-participation is positively affected by citizens' trust in government, their volunteer experiences, weak offline social ties, and perceived quality responsiveness during the e-participation process.	cross-sectional data;e-government;experience;external validity;futures studies;hands-on computing;logistic regression;online and offline;ordered logit;problem solving;responsiveness;social capital;social network;web application	Jooho Lee;Soonhee Kim	2014	2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2014.259	public policy;public relations;e-government;social capital;computer science;marketing;socioeconomics;management;regression analysis	HCI	-87.50982810281474	-10.93577058850559	129974

Using a custom-built visual analytic system, we presented users with news content from social media accounts from a variety of news outlets, including outlets engaged in distributing misinformation. We conducted controlled experiments to study decision-making regarding the veracity of these news outlets and tested the role of confirmation bias (the tendency to ignore contradicting information) and uncertainty of information on human decision-making processes. Our findings reveal that the presence of conflicting information, presented to users in the form of cues, impacts the ability to judge the veracity of news in systematic ways. We also find that even instructing participants to explicitly disconfirm given hypotheses does not significantly impact their decision-making regarding misinformation when compared to a control condition. Our findings have the potential to inform the design of visual analytics systems so that they may be used to mitigate the effects of cognitive biases and stymie the spread of misinformation on social media.	computer multitasking;experiment;futures studies;social media;veracity;visual analytics	Alireza Karduni;Ryan Wesslen;Sashank Santhanam;Isaac Cho;Svitlana Volkova;Dustin Arendt;Samira Shaikh;Wenwen Dou	2018			visual analytics;computer science;data mining;misinformation	HCI	-90.55221317172607	-15.184256240212552	130183

The status of a discipline is crucial for such fairness. One might assume, therefore, that IS scholars are treated fairly during tenure and promotion processes when compared to scholars from other business school academic fields. In fact, this may not be the case. The playing field used by business academic disciplines may not be level. This study addresses three questions related to this issue. The first asks whether there is a level playing field for publication among the various business disciplines, and second, assuming an unlevel playing field, what are the relative productivity differences between dissemination of scientific results among these disciplines? The third question is how could the playing field be leveled, assuming it is not at the present time. To answer these questions, existing data sources were tapped, one of these containing well over 18,000 data points. Further, original data was gathered from U.S. business schools, and all the data was analyzed in relation to AACSB data on the relative sizes of business school disciplines. Given our finding that the playing field is not level, the differences between the IS discipline and four other disciplines – Accounting, Finance, Management, and Marketing – are examined, and the consequences of the disadvantage to the IS discipline are discussed. The article concludes with recommendations of actions to level the field, and these are presented as a challenge to leaders in the Information Systems discipline.	data point;fairness measure;information system	Kenneth A.

However, despite the amount of writings produced on mobile phones, Western bias is surprisingly unbridledly prevailing alongside the feted dissemination of mobile phones. Expansive literature tends to present the rapid adoption of mobile phones among rural individuals, with little to no indication of how local values and voices are respected or promoted. We undertook semi-structured interviews with 16 rural chiefs to inquire into ways in which mobile phones enabled socio-economic development in the rural Congo. Rather than using quantitative, large-scale, or top-down data, we sought to give voice to chiefs themselves about the role of mobile phones. We found that Western bias dominates the literature and deployment of mobile phones more than usually acknowledged. We suggested some paths forward, while bringing the African communal Utu or Ubuntu culture to the center stage.	mobile phone	Sylvain K.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the type of SNSs depressed adolescents use and the incidence of depressive disclosure on SNSs among them. The study was designed to be cross-sectional. The sample consisted of 53 adolescents diagnosed with depressive disorder, as confirmed by K-SADS-PL, and 55 non-depressed adolescents. The Children’s Depression Inventory, Social Anxiety Scale and Social Network Use Questionnaire were administered. The primary finding was that the amount of time spent on the Internet and on SNSs was significantly higher among depressed adolescents than non-depressed adolescents. Additionally, depressed adolescents reported significantly higher disclosure of anhedonia, worthlessness, guilt, loss of concentration, irritability and thoughts of suicide on SNSs. The intensity of the depression sharing was significantly higher in the depressed group. Depressed young people use social networks to express their symptoms. Adolescents’ disclosure on social networks may be able to guide relatives, friends and mental health professionals.	social network	Hatice Gözde Akkin Gürbüz;Türkay Demir;Burcu Gökalp Özcan;Muhammed Tayyib Kadak;Burç Çagri Poyraz	2017	Behaviour & IT	10.1080/0144929X.2016.1262898	social psychology;mental health;worthlessness;anhedonia;social anxiety;irritability;social network;psychiatry;psychopathology;clinical psychology;psychology	ECom	-86.63923502045685	-21.154166331285023	130450

This paper presents a research project aiming at eliciting the potential of public libraries in building social capital, and promoting generalized trust in today's multicultural society. Method. Two approaches to research, the societal approach and the institutional approach are identified. The concept of low intensive versus high intensive meeting places is presented. A survey among inhabitants in four different metropolitan communities varying according to demographic characteristics in general, and the percentage of the population with a non-Western background in particular was undertaken. Initial results from a survey on how the public library is taken into use as a meeting place are presented and analysed. Analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the research question. Results. The survey results indicate that the library is a complex meeting place with a range of meetings along a continuum from high intensive to low intensive meetings. Conclusions. The library's potential role as a promoter of social capital by functioning as a low intensive meeting place seems to offer a promising research agenda.	amiga reflections;apache continuum;google scholar;google search;identification friend or foe;information science;library (computing);microsoft windows;public library;relevance;social capital;the new palgrave dictionary of economics;the new york times	Ragnar Andreas Audunson;Andreas Vårheim;Erling Dokk-Holm;Svanhild Aabø	2007	Inf.

Not all videos will reach the same popularity and have the same impact. Popularity differences arise not only because of differences in video content, but also because of other """"content-agnostic"""" factors. The latter factors are of considerable interest but it has been difficult to accurately study them. For example, videos uploaded by users with large social networks may tend to be more popular because they tend to have more interesting content, not because social network size has a substantial direct impact on popularity.  In this paper, we develop and apply a methodology that is able to accurately assess, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the impacts of various content-agnostic factors on video popularity. When controlling for video content, we observe a strong linear """"rich-get-richer"""" behavior, with the total number of previous views as the most important factor except for very young videos. The second most important factor is found to be video age. We analyze a number of phenomena that may contribute to rich-get-richer, including the first-mover advantage, and search bias towards popular videos. For young videos we find that factors other than the total number of previous views, such as uploader characteristics and number of keywords, become relatively more important. Our findings also confirm that inaccurate conclusions can be reached when not controlling for content."""	digital video;social network;upload	Youmna Borghol;Sebastien Ardon;Niklas Carlsson;Derek L.

With it, youu0027re a partner in critical conversations at the highest levels, establishing credibility, shaping decisions and demonstrating value when resources are dwindling. Without it, you risk becoming an anonymous utility, just one of many bills to be paid. At West Virginia University, communication isnu0027t outsourced to the campus PR shop or delegated to a technical expert as one of 15 duties. Itu0027s the primary responsibility of a member of the Information Technology Services senior leadership team, a proactive, practical, professional brand ambassador who helps improve visibility and rapport. In three years, ITS has developed: formal communication strategies for both planned and unplanned outages, including a DDoS attack; an outage listserv for IT staff and campus VIPs; an emergency texting messaging service with 200+ subscribers; a working partnership with University Relations; comprehensive strategic communication plans for campus on enterprise IT projects; regular IT updates to the campus; an extensive glossary of acronyms to ensure a common language; strong social media engagement; and compelling infographic messaging.

Moreover, no study differentiates between digital natives and digital immigrants, although theoretically there should be differences in their IS adoption. Digital natives are those from the generation that has grown up with digital technology, their characteristics and behavior are distinguished from those of previous generations, i.e., digital immigrants. To address these research gaps, we conducted a mental simulation experiment with a between-subjects design where the participants used a dual-purpose IS with various game mechanisms inside a car. Our findings indicate that digital natives feel more pleasure, dominance, and arousal than digital immigrants after being confronted with the hedonic part of a dual-purpose IS. The game mechanisms implemented do not influence the emotional state of the user differently. Moreover, pleasure significantly predicts the adoption of the hedonic part of the dual-purpose IS.	digital electronics;digital native;gamification;information system;simulation	Carolin Ebermann;Everlin Piccinini;Benjamin Brauer;Sebastian Busse;Lutz Kolbe	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.169	games;simulation;media;emotion;computer science;marketing;multimedia;advertising;law;world wide web	HCI	-89.35998550582138	-20.742217509945377	130721
4cfbb9a3f5f0ec45708f97b5ff6cf3013375741e	measuring decentralization of chinese keyword censorship via mobile games		China has the world’s largest mobile gaming market. Like other technology and Internet companies operating in the country, the gaming industry must follow strict content control policies including submitting lists of blacklisted keywords to regulators. In this paper we provide a first look at how content regulations over the gaming industry are implemented in practice by analyzing over 180,000 unique blacklisted keywords collected across over 200 games from app stores in China. Internet censorship in China is often presented as a uniformly enforced, top-down system. However, we find content control responsibilities are pushed down to companies resulting in varied implementations. We find that, among the hypotheses we tested, the only consistent predictor of keyword list similarity is whether games have the same publisher and developer, which suggests there is no central state or provincial authority controlling the generation of keyword lists and companies have a degree of flexibility in implementing controls. These results suggest a decentralized and fractured regime of control.	internet;kerrison predictor;mobile game;top-down and bottom-up design	Jeffrey Knockel;Lotus Ruan;Masashi Crete-Nishihata	2017			computer science;computer security;internet privacy;decentralization;censorship	Metrics	-83.67016507453297	-11.863655725704843	130950

It suggests that the data transparency paradigm need to be critically examined as the effects of data visibility and mobility differ according to the nature of information disclosed and conflicts surrounding it. Both information and technology that supports it visibility are embedded in power relations. Three themes are eloborated in the paper namely, the continued difficulty with retreiving information on land and territory;  the complexities involved in capturing and representing accurately the dynamics of territory use and ownership claims and the emerging governmentality relating to spatial governance that renders power opaque.

Because of this popularity they are increasingly facing the consequences of central bottlenecks, which could be overcome by taking a different approach: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology. P2P systems can only be successful with as much cooperation among as many users as possible. We explain how this cooperation is hard to enforce, and how inducing it might be more successful. This paper lists relevant psychological backgrounds that can be used to induce this cooperation, along with possible applications for our system called Peer-to-Peer Television (P2P-TV).	internet;peer-to-peer;television;theory	Jenneke Fokker;Huib de Ridder;Piet Westendorp;Johan A.

Partners in a relationship may create digital possessions frequently. However, after a relationship ends, individuals typically seek to disconnect from their ex-partner. This becomes difficult due to the partners' interwoven digital presence and digital possessions. In this paper, we report on a qualitative study exploring individuals' experiences of relationship break up in a digital context, and discuss their attitudes towards digital possessions from those relationships. Five main themes emerged: digital possessions that sustain relationships, comparing before and after, tainted digital possessions, digital possessions and invasions of privacy, involved and emotional reminiscing. Design opportunities were identified in managing attitudes towards digital possessions, disconnecting and reconnecting, and encouraging awareness of digital possessions.	digital media;experience;pervasive informatics	Daniel Herron;Wendy Moncur;Elise van den Hoven	2016		10.1145/2971485.2971539	media;human–computer interaction;computer science;memory	HCI	-85.18337595627803	-18.39500395429959	131210

This paper is based on developing an AI agent that plays a game with a similar emotive content like a human. The purpose of the study was to see if the incorporation of this emotive content would influence the outcomes within the game Love Letter. In order to do this an AI agent with an emotive layer was developed to play the game over a million times. A lower win/loss ratio demonstrates that, to some extent, this methodology was vindicated and a 100 per cent win for the AI agent did not happen. Machine learning techniques were modelled purposely so as to match extreme models of behavioural change. The results demonstrated a win/loss ratio of 0.67 for the AI agent and, in many ways, reflected the frustration that a normal player would exhibit during game play. As was hypothesised, the final agent investment value was, on average, lower after match play than its initial value.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;classification tree method;dataflow;eel;machine learning;mcgurk effect;play store;text-based (computing);virtual world;win–stay, lose–switch	James Stallwood;Ashok Ranchhod	2017	Computers	10.3390/computers6020018	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;communication	AI	-89.62682657590157	-22.61820341769502	131278
796286245114d368256c8a72c650a064dac269b9	the social embeddedness of academic online groups in offline networks as a norm generating structure: an empirical test of the coleman model on norm emergence	norm;coleman;online discussion;online community;social network;internet;survey data;academic communication	This paper analyzes two questions. First, under which conditions does a norm emerge in academic online groups that prescribes members to help others during group discussions? Second, what effects does such a norm, and other social conditions, have on the contributing behavior of researchers during online discussions? It is argued that the Coleman model (1990) on the emergence of norms points to an important condition that facilitates the realization of such a norm. According to the Coleman model (1990) a dense network among members of a group tends to strengthen a group norm. The paper makes a distinction between different kinds of academic online groups. The criterion of the distinction is the extent to which within the membership a highly integrated research community exists. An online group with a highly integrated research community is called to have a high degree of social embeddedness of its online communication in offline networks. It is hypothesized that a high degree of embeddedness has a number of effects. A higher degree of embeddedness leads to a stronger help-prescribing norm. The stronger the norm the more researchers send online answers to questions of their co-members during public online discussions. Furthermore, a high degree of embeddedness increases the answering behavior of researchers directly because it provides opportunities to gain reputation within the academic community through contributing to the discussion. The study makes use of data that consist of a combination of survey data and observed data of the communication behavior of researchers in about 50 international academic emailing lists. The results provide evidence for the expected effect of embeddedness on the strength of the norm and for the effect of embeddedness on the answering behavior of researchers. The strength of the help-prescribing norm indirectly influences the answering behavior.

Based on a valence framework and trust transfer theory, we developed a trust-based customer decision-making model of the non-independent, third-party mobile payment services context. We empirically investigated whether a customer’s established trust in Internet payment services is likely to influence his or her initial trust in mobile payment services. We also examined how these trust beliefs might interact with both positive and negative valence factors and affect a customer’s adoption of mobile payment services. Our SEM analysis indicated that trust indeed had a substantial impact on the cross-environment relationship and, further, that trust in combination with the positive and negative valence determinants directly and indirectly influenced behavioral intention. In addition, the magnitudes of these effects on workers and students were significantly different from each other. 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. * Corresponding author.

This study covers two areas of analysis: project-level research and founders-level (creators-level) research. In the first area, the article presents an analysis of documentary film projects based on descriptive statistics and the clustering of the film projects. In the second area, the paper sheds light on the Polish filmmakers' attitude to crowdfunding, and this analysis was based on a survey. This exploratory study led to the following conclusions: 1. The descriptive statistics indicate that the `average documentary film' on the Polish market reaches a higher level of funding compared to non-documentary projects, and higher numbers of supporters. 2. The film projects on the Polish crowdfunding platforms can be segmented into six clusters. 3. The survey conducted among Polish filmmakers indicates that the experts strongly differed in their views about crowdfunding in general, and specifically, in the crowdfunding for documentary films. Such diversity of opinions and attitudes may be linked to the novelty of crowdfunding and therefore, the experts' difficulty of assessing the present and future role of crowdfunding for filmmaking. 4. This study shows that over 85% of experts agree with the sponsor's involvement with film production. Such a high level of expert agreement is important as nowadays `being a prosumer' is one of the major trends of consumer behavior.	cluster analysis;crowdfunding;high-level programming language	Pawel Kossecki;Urszula Swierczynska-Kaczor	2016	2016 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)	10.15439/2016F236	film;management	HCI	-82.5704584758892	-20.569994248400732	131599

Motivated by the growing interest in e-commerce, we focus our research questions on identifying the key dimensions of e-commerce service quality and its relationships to customer satisfaction and loyalty. In exploring answers to our research questions a hypothesized model is proposed and empirically tested using a research survey with 370 online shoppers. Salient results include: (1) key dimensions of e-commerce service quality are website usability, information quality, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and personalization; (2) customer satisfaction is influenced mostly with the perception of reliability, while customer loyalty is affected by the perception of assurance; (3) customer retention is predicted by the customer satisfaction index. Results of the study contribute to the nascent body of research in e-service quality and offer unique insights for managers of online firms on how to manage the quality of their e-commerce e-service.	dimensions;e-commerce;e-commerce payment system;e-services;information quality;online shopping;personalization;personnel loyalty;quality of service;responsiveness;web site;web usability	Samar I.

Specifically, this paper aims to achieve the following two objectives: first, to examine and compare the online habits of both broadband and dial-up users; and second, to examine and compare the impacts of both broadband and dial-up on a consumer’s use of time upon daily life activities. The study was conducted using a postal survey. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to 1600 households and a total of 358 completed questionnaires were obtained from the respondents. The study provides evidence that significant changes in the total time spent on-line and Internet usage frequency can occur when people use broadband technology. The paper also suggests that consumers of broadband and dial-up are different in terms of time allocation pattern on daily life activities.	cross-sectional data;dial-up internet access;online and offline;postal	Yogesh Kumar Dwivedi;Jyoti Choudrie;Vishanth Weerakkody	2006			marketing;advertising;computer science;broadband	HCI	-89.33016275802882	-10.964665245256697	131731

Viral marketing—the tactic of creating a process where interested people can market to each other—is therefore emerging as an important means to spread-the-word and stimulate the trial, adoption, and use of products and services. Consider the case of Hotmail, one of the earliest firms to tap the potential of viral marketing. Based predominantly on publicity from word-of-mouse [4], the Web-based email service provider garnered one million registered subscribers in its first six months, hit two million subscribers two months later, and passed the eleven million mark in eighteen months [7]. Wired magazine put this growth in perspective in its December 1998 issue: “The Hotmail user base grew faster than [that of ] any media company in history—faster than CNN, faster than AOL, even faster than Seinfeld’s audience. By mid-2000, Hotmail had over 66 million users with 270,000 new accounts being established each day.” While the potential of viral marketing to efficiently reach out to a broad set of potential users is attracting considerable attention, the value of this approach is also being questioned [5]. There needs to be a greater understanding of the contexts in which this strategy works and the characteristics of products and services for which it is most effective. This is particularly important because the inappropriate use of viral marketing can be counterproductive by creating unfavorable attitudes towards products. Work examining this phenomenon currently provides either descriptive accounts of particular initiatives [8] or advice based on anecdotal evidence [2]. What is missing is an analysis of viral marketing that highlights systematic patterns in the nature of knowledge-sharing and persuasion by influencers and responses by recipients in online social networks. To this end, we propose an organizing framework for viral marketing that draws on prior theory and highlights different behavioral mechanisms underlying knowledge-sharing, influence, and compliance in online social networks.

The formation of the online social network was explored by testing two distinct network attachment logics: strategic selection and homophily. Both logics received some support. Taken together, the results are suggestive of a “performance-based clustering” phenomenon within the OSS online community in which most collaborations involve accomplished developers, and novice developers tend to partner with less accomplished and less experienced peers.	open-source software;social network analysis	Cuihua Shen;Peter Monge	2011	First Monday		public relations;social network analysis;social science;motivation;computer science;distributed computing;sociology;world wide web;online participation	Web+IR	-86.70280408743866	-16.66785715742241	132034

Place attachment refers to the relationship between people and places, which has numerous benefits for individual well-being. Popular location-based AR games often include elements that are known to predict place attachment: exploration, social relations or the experience of enjoyment in a place. We argue that positive emotions triggered by playing can influence players’ place attachment via the process of gamification. We tested this hypothesis in a correlational study conducted among Pokémon Go players. Our analyses showed that satisfaction from playing and the social relations made during play positively predict place attachment, but the amount of time spent on playing does not. A series of mediation analyses showed that relations among game satisfaction, social relations, and place attachment were mediated by the appraisal of the place as exciting. This study demonstrated a mechanism of emotional transfer between positive experiences from playing and place attachment, which may prove useful in other domains, such as education, land conservation, or marketing.	attachments;augmented reality;gamification;mediation (statistics)	Tomasz Oleksy;Anna Wnuk	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.06.008	psychology;social psychology;social relation;place attachment;mediation (marxist theory and media studies);augmented reality	HCI	-87.85935870049967	-18.533265413262242	132312

Citizens have access to a variety of service delivery channels when they initiate contact with their government, ranging from e-government to more traditional channels such as the phone and in-person visits to a government office. This paper examines the extent of use of both contact channels for citizens and the impact of the digital divide on channel use. A public opinion survey of Egyptian citizens was analyzed, and the results showed that there was a digital divide in the use of e-government by citizens. The digital divide also extended to other contact channels such as the phone and when citizens used multiple contact channels for public service delivery. The results of this study imply that for the development of e-government, especially in the context of a developing country such as Egypt, policy-makers need to understand that e-government is one of many channels that citizens can use when they initiate contact with their government. The results of this study should encourage policy-makers to recognize the importance of public service delivery in a multichannel environment. #R##N#Shirin Madon is the accepting Associate Editor for this article.	e-government	Christopher G.

The success of computer-supported social networks depends on the extent to which members will stay and continue participating. Many computer-supported social networks however suffer from the problem of retaining members. Drawing from theories of user satisfaction and information adoption, we develop a model to examine how computer-supported social networks encourage members to continue participating and using the information in the network. The theoretical model is validated through an online survey of 240 users of a Bulletin Board System established by a local university in China. The results reveal that individuals will continue to use the information in a computer-supported social network when they are satisfied with their prior usage, and when they perceive that the information in the network is useful. The results also suggest that individuals' perceived information usefulness and satisfaction are determined by information quality and source credibility in the context of computer-supported social networks.

e7e9782e76cb4ab766c72e9d88bfd92e70bb6061	does a prosocial decision in video games lead to increased prosocial real-life behavior? the impact of reward and reasoning		Abstract Recently, researchers have become increasingly interested in the potential of video games to promote real-life prosocial behavior. It has been argued that in-game prosocial acts may transfer to playersu0027 real-life behavior. But so far little is known about how video games affect playersu0027 in-game as well as future real-life prosocial decisions. To address this research gap, we carried out two experiments. Both studies investigated whether voluntarily choosing to help a game character in the same first-person shooter game affected an ensuing real-life prosocial decision (i.e., donation to a charity). The results of the first study (N = 270) indicate that voluntarily deciding to help in-game subsequently led to increased donating behavior. In study 2 (N = 185) we further analyzed the potential moderating effects of game rewards and playersu0027 reasoning for in-game helping. The results of both studies indicate that voluntarily deciding to help in a video game subsequently led to increased donating behavior. Further, results of Study 2 revealed that the absence of a reward for helping in-game affected players’ reasoning for helping and positively influenced prosocial self-concept and donation.	real life	Glena Helen Iten;Julia Ayumi Bopp;Clemens Steiner;Klaus Opwis;Elisa D.

0089261e1efcd380842f0ac5ab160c0d5f0980c5	why e-return services fail: a psychological contract violation approach		This study elucidates why and how e-return services (e-RS) fail, representing a preliminary attempt to explain the critical role of psychological contract violation (PCV) and explore its antecedents and outcomes in e-RS research. Based on marketing, psychology, and information systems-related studies, a theoretical framework is developed to correlate perceived fairness (PF), causal attribution (CA), and magnitude of negative outcome (MNO) with customers' PCV. Additionally, based on trust (TR), exactly how PCV further influences customers' stickiness intention (SI) is examined as well. Analysis results indicate that PF, CA, and MNO influence customers during both the evaluation stage and the customer receipt of e-RS, subsequently deriving PCV. These factors contribute to the subsequent success of e-RS, especially, customers' TR and SI. Furthermore, recommendations are made on how firms should evaluate PCV and its influencing factors to prevent e-RS failure.	action tremor;belief–desire–intention software model;causal filter;computational trust;fairness measure;heart failure;information systems;information system;psychological techniques;reed–solomon error correction;transistor;attribution;causal path analysis	Pei-Ling Hsieh	2012	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	10.1089/cyber.2012.0026	social psychology	AI	-89.62199877842922	-12.82545014004903	132618

To better understand this socio-technological phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods study of live streaming practices in China. We present the results of an online survey of 527 live streaming users, focusing on their broadcasting or viewing practices and the experiences they find most engaging. We also interviewed 14 active users to explore their motivations and experiences. Our data revealed the different categories of content that was broadcasted and how varying aspects of this content engaged viewers. We also gained insight into the role reward systems and fan group-chat play in engaging users, while also finding evidence that both viewers and streamers desire deeper channels and mechanisms for interaction in addition to the commenting, gifting, and fan groups that are available today.	experience;sociotechnology;streaming media;traction teampage	Zhicong Lu;Haijun Xia;Seongkook Heo;Daniel J.

Furthermore, we generate deeper insights about the moderating role of mobile shopping usage, product involvement and brand equity in this context. We answer our research questions by empirically analyzing a unique data set from a European fashion e-commerce company. This study links a wide range of transaction data (2.5 billion page clicks, 46 thousand different products, 700 brands, 40 product categories, 72 million sold and 33 million returned items) with a large set of OCRs (0.9 million). Our results show that positive OCRs can lead to lower return rates, higher sales after returns, and better conversion rates. Considering higher search costs on mobile devices, we reveal a weaker impact of OCRs in the mobile than in the desktop sales channel. Furthermore, in line with involvement theory, we see a significant impact of product involvement in this context such as the influence of positive OCRs is stronger for highinvolvement products than vice versa. Moreover, we find support for statements from brand signaling literature, that OCRs matter more for weak than for strong brands.	customer relationship management;desktop computer;e-commerce;mobile device;page view;transaction data	Tobias Lohse;Jan Kemper;Malte Brettel	2017			public relations;public records;computer science;marketing;advertising;law	Web+IR	-85.69783765677361	-12.36873373134749	132820

Existing research focuses on leveraging content analysis for positivity or negativity analysis of the sentiments of opinions expressed. This is while, analysis of link structure features of social networks underlying the conversation involving politicians has been less looked. The intuition behind such study comes from the fact that density of conversations about parties along with their respective members, whether explicit or implicit, should reflect on their popularity. On the other hand, dynamism of interactions, can capture the inherent shift in popularity of accounts of politicians. Within this manuscript we present evidence of how a well-known link prediction algorithm, can reveal an authoritative structural link formation within which the popularity of the political accounts along with their neighbourhoods, shows strong correlation with the standing of electoral outcomes. As an evidence, the public time-lines of two electoral events from 2014 elections of Sweden on Twitter have been studied. By distinguishing between member and official party accounts, we report that even using a focus-crawled public dataset, structural link popularities bear strong statistical similarities with vote outcomes. In addition we report strong ranked dependence between standings of selected politicians and general election outcome, as well as for official party accounts and European election outcome.	algorithm;interaction;negativity (quantum mechanics);social network	Nima Dokoohaki;Filippia Zikou;Daniel Gillblad;Mihhail Matskin	2015	2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1145/2808797.2808915	social network analysis;social science;artificial intelligence;data mining;sociology;social psychology;law;world wide web	NLP	-81.7566623927535	-17.709604532492595	132868

We present an investigation into the nature of Twitter-facilitated second-screening posts relating to Thelma's Gypsy Girls, one of a series of controversial documentary programmes portraying the Irish Traveller community that have recently been aired by the UK public-service television broadcaster Channel 4. Sentiment analysis highlighted the general negativity of these posts whilst a detailed thematic inquiry revealed the often abusive and aggressive messages aimed directly at the community and individuals portrayed in the broadcast material. We discuss why users might be susceptible to exhibiting these behaviours, and the implications for the broadcast industry, and social TV designers and developers.	cyberstalking;negativity (quantum mechanics);sentiment analysis;terrestrial television;while	Mark Doughty;Shaun W.

While many new interfaces have been created and studied in the small scale, we are not aware of any larger quantitative work to study current practices now that many secondary content experiences are publicly available. We conducted a survey with a broad sample of the American population to explore current secondary content use. We report on our findings, including that 80% of these experiences occur before or after viewing the primary content, and not as simultaneous experiences, and that social posting about television content remains quite low, even for one's favorite show. We conclude with implications for the design new secondary content systems based on our findings.	niche blogging;population;second screen;social media;television;user experience	Frank Bentley	2017		10.1145/3077548.3077554	internet privacy;second screen;advertising;mobile device;population;psychology	HCI	-85.01176628149177	-18.625177510875478	132968

Nearly all of the research on sex differences in mass media utilization has been based on samples from the United States and a few other Western countries. Aim. The present study examines sex differences in mass media utilization in four Asian countries (Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, and Singapore). Methods. College students self-reported the frequency with which they accessed the following five mass media outlets: television dramas, televised news and documentaries, music, newspapers and magazines, and the Internet. Results. Two significant sex differences were found when participants from the four countries were considered as a whole: Women watched television dramas more than did men; and in Japan, female students listened to music more than did their male counterparts.

The primary approaches to achieving this identification are surveys of academics, article-level citation, and senior scholar consensus. An example of the last approach is the basket of eight journals identified by senior scholars of the Association for Information Systems (AIS). A different and efficient approach is afforded by the publication of data from Journal Citation Reports (JCR). This provides aggregate citation data across individual journals. While the findings provide general empirical support for the choice of the AIS basket of eight journals, they also indicate that five additional journals qualify as core information systems journals. Each of these journals has numerous citations of journals within this set and low citations of individual journals outside this set. Furthermore, a network centrality analysis of this set of journals reveals a high correlation between in-degree centrality and the perceived importance of journals.

Although privacy is an essential and widely respected value in many cultures, the way in which it is understood and enacted depends on context. It is especially vital to understand user behaviors regarding privacy in the digital sphere, where individuals increasingly publish personal information. Our mixed-methods analysis of 18K Twitter posts that mention """"privacy"""" focuses on the face-to-face and digital contexts in which privacy is mentioned, and how those contexts lead to varied ideologies regarding privacy. We find that in the Arab Gulf, the need for privacy is often supported by Quranic text, advice on how to protect privacy is frequently discussed, and the use of paternalistic language by men when discussing women's privacy is common. Above all, privacy is framed as a communal attribute, including not only the individual, but the behavior of those around them; it even extends beyond one's lifespan. We contribute an analysis and description of these previously unexplored interpretations of privacy, which play a role in how users navigate social media."""	personally identifiable information;privacy;social media	Norah Abokhodair;Sofiane Abbar;Sarah Vieweg;Yelena Mejova	2016		10.1145/2908131.2908146	islam;privacy policy;information privacy;computer science;sociology;internet privacy;privacy;multimethodology;world wide web	HCI	-80.51715115075365	-14.81570937300201	133375

In this study we test whether the economic urban divide is reflected in the digital sphere of cities. Because, especially in dynamically growing cities, ready-to-use comprehensive data sets on the urban poor, as well as on the digital divide, are not existent, we use proxies: we spatially delimit the urban poor using settlement characteristics derived from remote sensing data. The digital divide is targeted by geolocated Twitter data. Based on a sample of eight cities across the globe, we spatially test whether areas of the urban poor are more likely to be digital cold spots. Over the course of time, we analyze whether temporal signatures in poor urban areas differ from formal environments. We find that the economic divide influences digital participation in public life. Less residents of morphological slums are found to be digitally oriented (“are digitally left behind”) as compared to residents of formal settlements. However, among the few twitter users in morphological slums, we find their temporal behavior similar to the twitter users in formal settlements. In general, we conclude this discussion, this study exemplifies that the combination of both heterogeneous data sets allows for extending the capabilities of individual disciplines for research towards urban poverty.	antivirus software;conceptualization (information science);google book search settlement agreement;hotspot (wi-fi);image resolution;interpretation (logic);proxy server;social network	Hannes Taubenböck;Jeroen Staab;Xiao xiang Zhu;Christian Geiß;Stefan W.

However, little is known about the relative importance of awards and the relationships between awards. This study aims to establish a comprehensive global map of important international academic awards, which visually presents the relative reputations of awards and the close or distant relationships between awards. By surveying the reputations of the preselected 207 awards, 90 important international academic awards with above-average reputations were identified. Then, based on the number of “awardees in common” or named “co-awardees” between every pair of these 90 awards, a network of co-awardees was built. Finally, using mapping software of VOSviewer, these 90 important international academic awards were mapped by taking the reputation scores as the weights of awards and the network of co-awardees as the basis of the relationships between awards.	reputation	Juntao Zheng;Niancai Liu	2015	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-015-1613-7	public relations;management	Arch	-78.87482722239616	-18.924537166742347	133458

The TREC 2010 Legal Track developed what is presently the only public test collection for evaluating privilege classification. This paper examines the reliability and reusability of that collection. For reliability, the key question is the extent to which privilege judgments correctly reflect the opinion of the senior litigator whose judgment is authoritative. For reusability, the key question is the degree to which systems whose results contributed to creation of the test collection can be fairly compared with other systems that use those privilege judgments in the future. These correspond to measurement error and sampling error, respectively. The results indicate that measurement error is the larger problem.	knowledge discovery metamodel;privilege escalation;sampling (signal processing)	Jyothi K. Vinjumur;Douglas W. Oard;Jiaul H.

We also address whether the adoption of social media portends a move by local governments from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0. The findings of this research show that the principal drivers of local government adoption of e-information and services are highly consistent with those of previous research: size of government, type and form of government, region of the country, education, years of e-government experience, and the existence of a separate IT department are all related to adoption. The drivers of adoption of e-transactions are consistent, but somewhat less so, with prior research. And, the drivers of adoption of social media are closer to those of e-information and services than of e-transactions. Based on evidence from the survey (local governments use social media mainly for one-way communication) and prior studies of IT and government and e-government, we conclude that social media today do not appear to be moving local governments in the direction of Web 2.0, but perhaps in the direction of Web 1.5.	social media;web 2.0	Christopher G.

Yet, the underlining mechanisms of this impact rarely has been examined. Drawing on the regulatory engagement theory, this study suggests that online brand engagement can facilitate sWOM communication through two mechanisms: the value intensifying effect and the activity experience effect. A model with three hypotheses are formulated to specify the relationships among online brand engagement, perceived value of WOM communication, and sWOM communication.

Among numerous categories of mobile Apps, social Apps were one of those with the greatest growth in 2013. Despite abundant research on users’ behavior intention of mobile App usage, few studies have focused on investigating key determinants of users’ continuance intention regarding social Apps. To fill this gap, we integrated customer value perspectives to explore the influential factors in the continuance intention of social App use. Moreover, users’ satisfaction and habit from both the marketing and psychology literature were also incorporated into the research model. A total of 378 valid questionnaires were collected by survey method, and structural equation modeling was employed in the subsequent data analysis. The results indicate that the continuance usage of social Apps is driven by users’ satisfaction, tight connection with others, and hedonic motivation to use the Apps. In addition, full mediation effects of satisfaction and habit were found between perceived usefulness and intention to continue use. These findings extend our understanding of users’ continuance intention in the context of social Apps. Discussion and implications are provided. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, we address the overall research question of whether pseudonymous cryptocurrencies are primarily used by criminals. Based on Rational Choice Theory and darknet market design, we build a dynamic research model. Utilizing panel data of 296,875 unique product and service listings that were available on 19 darknet markets from June 2014 to July 2015 as well as Bitcoin blockchain transactions, we provide evidence for the co-evolution of Bitcoin and darknet markets. We find that transactions within the Bitcoin blockchain and the usage of transaction obfuscation services can be related to previous sales on darknet markets. The temporal lag can be attributed to escrow mechanisms. We contribute to the research stream of cryptocurrency usage behavior and discussions of regulators, governments and financial services firms.

Among others, large survey results on a cross-disciplinary level on author opinions to open access journals have been published (Nicholas u0026 Rowlands 2005; Nicholas, Huntington u0026 Rowlands 2005; Swan u0026 Brown 2004). Also author perceptions towards author charges business model has been studied in domain of a medical journal (Schroter, Tite u0026 Smith 2005). In studies regarding institutional repositories attention has mainly been for several years on implementation, technical features and interoperability of systems using OAI-PMH standard. It is a natural development that now at a time when institutional repositories have been in function for some time we have seen studies focusing on evaluation of repository content by genre and type of included documents as well as growth rate for submissions (Thomas u0026 McDonald 2007; Dowell 2007; ). rnrnHowever, even though concept of open access is known among academic researchers their research and publishing practices have still not undergone a radical change. The important question on non-use of institutional repositories has lately been raised by Davis u0026 Conolly (2007). There is a need for deeper understanding of to what extent open access practices have spread among academics and what are main incentives and barriers to acceptance and use of new systems for open access dissemination of research results for example institutional repositories. rnrnAim of studyrnrnThe aim of this study is to address need of further studies on researchersu0027 expectancies towards open access and in particular acceptance and user behavior regarding institutional archives. Our approach is domain specific, focusing on researchers in business schools in Finland and is based on a framework of theories on intellectual and social organization of sciences and communication practices in digital era (Whitley 1984; Fry 2006; Fry u0026 Talja 2007). We also rely on previous studies on open access publishing in domain of biomedicine (Author 2007;). In study we apply a theoretical model of user acceptance and user behavior (UTAUT) developed by (Venkatesh et al.2003 ) as an explanatory model in analysis of results. Thus our research approach is new and cross-disciplinary in way we combine earlier research results from fields of organizational theory, information science and information systems science. This is in our view a fruitful approach broadening theoretical base of study and bringing in a deeper understanding of research problems. rnResearch questions and structure of paperrnIn study we will address following questions: rnWhat are prevailing attitudes toward open access among business school researchers in Finland?rnrnWhat type of incentives and barriers for use and non-use of open access publishing channels can be identified.rnrnDoes factors such as social influence of faculty and organization have an impact on acceptance and use of open access and institutional repositories?rnrnDoes personal factors such as perceived usefulness for research career and perceived ease of use have an impact on acceptance and use of open access and institutional repositories?rn rnThe structure of final paper will start by an introductory section on theories describing domain specific features in scientific communication and scientific publishing in fields of research typically carried out in business schools. In following section we will build up framework of theories and models on end-user attitudes and diffusion of new technology. In section on study settings we will describe methodology for survey carried out in business schools in Finland, followed by an analysis of results, discussion and concluding remarks.rnrnStudy object, methods rnrnFor study on scientific disciplines represented in business schools we will rely on Whitleyu0027s (1984; 2000) theory on social organization of scientific fields as our staring point. Whitleyu0027s theory characterizes differences between scientific fields into two main dimensions?trn-Degree of mutual dependencernAssociated with degree of dependence between scientists, colleagues, or particular groups to make a proper research contributionrn-Degree of task uncertaintyrnAssociated with differences in patterns of work, organisation and control in relation to changing contextual factorsrnrnAuthor (2007) characterize, in their study on incentives to publish in open access journals, factors depending on social environment and factors depending on personal factors of researcher. In studies modeling user acceptance and behavior Venkatesh et al. (2003) develop a theoretical framework that is well suited to use as an explanatory framework for intended statistical analysis of results from a survey directed to business school researchers in Finland. In formulation of Unified Theory of acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) Venkatesh et al. (2003) identified four constructs as direct determinants of user acceptance and usage behavior. The four constructs are: expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions. The above four constructs in Venkatesh et al (2003) are defined shortly as follows:rnPerformance expectancy - the degree to which an individual believes that using a system will help to attain gains in a job performance rnEffort expectancy - the degree of ease associated with use of a systemrnSocial influence - the degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use new system.rnFacilitating conditions - the degree to which an individual believes that an organizational and technical infrastructure exists to support use of systemrnrnUntil now above constructs have been used mainly in research on acceptance and intention to use of IT-systems. In present study we will adapt above constructs to study of acceptance and use and eventually also non-use of open access publishing systems as for example institutional archives.rn rnThe questions in survey form for empirical study to business schools in Finland are developed to reflect definitions of constructs especially regarding discipline specific social and personal factors that influence acceptance and user behavior. The survey will be conducted in January-February 2008. rnrnResultsrnrnIn conference paper we intend to present framework, modeling constructs of researchersu0027 attitudes to open access publishing and institutional archives. Our framework is based on above presented theoretical model for user acceptance and use of information technology (UTAUT) and we apply it in context of business schools. Thus also discipline specific factors of research carried out in this context will be taken into account in analysis. We will present a set of survey questions developed for purpose of analysis of attitudes towards open access and as we hope also adaptable to surveying open access attitudes in other disciplines. Initial results and analysis from survey will be presented answering proposed research questions. rnrnrnReferencesrnrnDavis, P. M. and Connolly, M. J. L. (2007).

These new features are based on a new logic of the Web, referred to as Web 2.0. When applied to the public sphere, this idea has been labeled as Government 2.0. This is a new trend that challenges governments to assess their role in society and especially their relationship with citizens. This article provides a brief introduction to Web 2.0 and its gradual adoption in public services and governance. Attention is directed to the concrete ways of utilizing Web 2.0 applications, on the one hand, and the identification of tensions and challenges associated with this new trend, on the other.

Companies worldwide are using the web to provide personalized offerings and unique experiences to their customers. While there is a lot of hype about delivering personalized services over the web, little is known about the effectiveness of web personalization and the link between the IT artifact (the personalization agent) and the effects it exerts on a user's information processing and decision making. To address the impact of personalized content, this article theoretically develops and empirically tests a model of web personalization. The model is grounded on social cognition and consumer research theories adapted to the peculiar features of web personalization. The influence of a personalization agent is mediated by two variables: content relevance and self reference. Hypotheses generated from the model are empirically tested in a laboratory experiment and a field study. The findings indicate that content relevance, self reference, and goal specificity affect the attention, cognitive processes, and decisions of web users in various ways. Also, users are found to be receptive to personalized content and find it useful as a decision aid. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.	information processing;personalization	Kar Yan Tam;Shuk Ying Ho	2006	MIS Quarterly		social cognition;customer;web modeling;information processing;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;mathematical model;personalization;multimedia;web intelligence;data analysis;self-reference;world wide web	ML	-90.11768012142497	-13.428941515487914	134276

This study provides additional information about the path from the service quality and trust to continuous usage. Also, this study investigates the different tendencies to continuance behavior by habit as a moderating effect within the conceptual model. According to the structural invariance test across moderating effect, it showed that: First, most of main effect paths showed significant positive signs only habit as moderator on trust in service provider is negative support. Second, the habit was supported as a moderator except for the trust in shopping-site to online shopping continuance interaction path. Unexpectedly, the positive moderating effect of habit tendency towards the path of trust in shopping-site to online shopping continuance in not significant.

Issues involving seniors are likely to rise to the forefront of national consciousness. A primary concern for this population is the loss of companionship, which can contribute to isolation, depression, and decreased socialization [9]. A concept for a data management service - mPath - is proposed to combat isolation among seniors. mPath works with administrators of assisted-living facilities to oversee an ad-hoc volunteer network. Interacting with residents, these volunteers assess social relationships and emotional reactions, quantifying for the computer their qualitative observations. The system examines accumulated data over time to reveal anomalies, highlight trends and anticipate future responses. Administrators may choose to act upon that information. The overall effect is to increase the social well being of seniors in an unobtrusive manner."""	consciousness;data mining;hoc (programming language);microsoft forefront;socialization;unobtrusive javascript	Shweta Aneja;Kevin Makice;Apurva Pangam;Matt Weldon	2005		10.1145/1056808.1057098	interpersonal relationship;simulation;motivation;human–computer interaction;data management;knowledge management;transparency;management;world wide web	HCI	-87.97469067850204	-19.30338917295522	134440

News and information is one such reason. The current study examines how system-generated cues available in social media impact perceptions of a source’s credibility. Participants were asked to view one of six mock Twitter.com pages that varied both the number of followers and the ratio between followers and follows on the page and report their perceived source credibility. Data indicate that curvilinear effects for number of followers exist, such that having too many or too few connections results in lower judgments of expertise and trustworthiness. Having a narrow gap between the number of followers and follows also led to increased judgments of competence. Implications of these findings are discussed, along with limitations of the current study and directions for future research. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

840a73c4f9b5ab8e5a85b875aa8172736649bc02	predicting it adaptation versus non-adaptation: a study of competing factors		User adaptation of customizable systems has been recommended as a way of increasing the system’s utility to users and thereby improve information technology (IT) usage. However, a significant proportion of users do NOT adapt these systems, despite being aware of the increase in IT usefulness and ease of use from adaptation. Such non-adaptive behavior runs counter to predictions from prior theories of IT usage such as the technology acceptance model. As a first step toward understanding IT adaptation, we examine salient user motivations driving adaptation versus non-adaptation behaviors. Drawing from prior research, we define seven ex ante predictors of IT adaptation and examine the predictive ability of these factors in successfully discriminating between IT adapters and non-adapters. Empirical data on MyYahoo web portal adaptation by student subjects supported three of seven hypothesized predictions. Contributions of this study include drawing attention to the important yet ignored area of IT adaptation and elucidating some of the preliminary determinants of adaptation behaviors.	12-hour clock;adaptive behavior;non-functional requirement;usability	Michael Harris;Anol Bhattacherjee	2004			management science;computer science;knowledge management;usability;information technology;technology acceptance model	HCI	-90.36462779724516	-10.20104654183054	134647

However, it has been recognized that citation distributions vary among fields of science and that one needs to normalize for this. Furthermore, the mean—or any central-tendency statistics—is not a good representation of the citation distribution because these distributions are skewed. Important steps have been taken to solve these two problems during the last few years. First, one can normalize at the article level using the citing audience as the reference set. Second, one can use non-parametric statistics for testing the significance of differences among ratings. A proportion of most-highly cited papers (the top-10% or top-quartile) on the basis of fractional counting of the citations may provide an alternative to the current IF. This indicator is intuitively simple, allows for statistical testing, and accords with the state of the art.	journal citation reports;normalize;paper;regular expression;sex factors;statistics, nonparametric	Loet Leydesdorff	2012		10.1007/s11192-012-0660-6	nonparametric statistics;social science;computer science;data science;data mining;impact;world wide web	ML	-77.98147804445023	-21.364626394026015	134689

We examine information infrastructures in mid-sized urban slums of Mumbai and Bangalore in three ways--1) highlighting technologies supporting social networks, 2) examining underlying notions of trust and privacy in building information networks, and 3) discussing protocols and practices around shared access. We then discuss our thoughts on designing for low-income, low-literacy, and resource-challenged communities, presenting new ways to think about the design of ubiquitous technologies for international development. We argue for collaborative exchange between the established strengths of the Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) and Ubicomp communities to generate new ways of shaping technologies towards poverty alleviation in previously neglected socio-economic contexts--Ubicomp4D.	noise shaping;population;social network;ubiquitous computing	Nithya Sambasivan;Nimmi Rangaswamy;Edward Cutrell;Bonnie A.

We focus on three indicators in particular, namely the Eigenfactor indicator, the audience factor, and the influence weight indicator. Our main finding is that the last two indicators can be regarded as a kind of special cases of the first indicator. We also find that the three indicators can be nicely characterized in terms of two properties. We refer to these properties as the property of insensitivity to field differences and the property of insensitivity to insignificant journals. The empirical results that we present illustrate our theoretical findings. We also show empirically that the differences between various indicators of journal performance are quite substantial.	bibliometrics;enigma machine	Ludo Waltman;Nees Jan van Eck	2010	JASIST	10.1002/asi.21354	digital library;bibliometrics;computer science;weighting;operations research;world wide web	ML	-78.12942016975717	-20.85616819524707	134974

In our analysis, we conduct a model analysis of consumer behavior using data composed of more than 30,000 questionnaire surveys and quantitatively find the elasticity coefficient of the boost to consumption by performing a two-step GMM (generalized method of moments), which uses instrumental variables. The results of the analysis show e-WOM significantly increased expenditures in six fields: computers, electrical appliances, etc.; music; hobbies; clothing, accessories, etc.; beauty products, etc.; and goods for everyday life, etc. Furthermore, there was no field that had a significantly negative value. These results showed that, in the majority of the target fields, e-WOM had not only the effect of winning customers from the competition, but also the effect of boosting consumption on a macro-level. In addition, even from people’s subjective evaluations, there were many in all the generational groups who said that e-WOM boosted expenditures.

This essay will focus on four key political concepts central to all TOS agreements studied. These concepts include contract language governing speech codes, intellectual property rights, privacy, and the relationship of the gaming world to the real world. If indeed these agreements offer governing constraints for people functioning in virtual spaces, then not only should their anti–democratic construction be considered, but as people spend more time in virtual worlds, these structures will become increasingly important to many aspects of our virtual identities.	terms of service;virtual world	Debora J.

Mined were transcripts of web sites, broadcasts, newspapers, and other content captured for 46 Muslim nations. Results show that Somalia made the largest move upward across the three periods, increasing 21 times in network centrality. Iran is consistently in the top 2 positions. The network increased in link strength and in degree but became less structured in the early uprising period, and continued the decline in structure in the post-Bin Laden period, results consistent with crisis effects. Words paired with 'jihad' that increased and decreased in the early uprising and post-Bin Laden periods revealed messages that reflected major changes in substantive content in the three periods. The results appear to have face validity, and demonstrate how mining open-sources for inter-nation networks and for semantic networks about a topic of interest, in this case: 'jihad, """" can provide quantitative evidence with statistical tests that have intelligence and security implications."""	centrality;degree (graph theory);mined;open-source software;semantic network;takedown: red sabre	James A.

Using a mixed-method explanatory sequential design approach, we first asked users to generate lists of actions they take on the Internet and then asked them why they engage in these 35 activities. Using the information gleaned from the interviews, we developed surveys that asked 261 users (ages 19 e68) to rate the perceived risk (defined as situations that contain uncertainty regarding outcomes and/or possess the potential for negative consequences) associated with each action, benefits received from each action, frequency with which they engage in the action, and amount of information they are willing to share to engage in the action. We also assessed a number of individual difference characteristics. Our study results (1) provide an Internet Action list usable in future studies; (2) provide an initial understanding that users (to a degree) engage in Internet actions for the benefits they perceive they gain; (3) show that users share little personal information, if any, to get those benefits; and (4) users have little ability to accurately evaluate the true risk (i.e., due to Internet threats) associated with those actions.

The results revealed that trait procrastination was associated with an increased use of leisure-related online content and impaired control over Internet use. As a result, Internet users high in trait procrastination showed a higher risk of experiencing negative consequence of Internet use in other life domains. These negative repercussions of insufficiently self-regulated Internet use partially accounted for the correlation between trait procrastination and impaired well-being (i.e. stress, anxiety, and depression). These findings underline the role of online media as an instrument for dysfunctional task delay among Internet users.

Informal discussions of mental illness take place every day in social media. In the case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), in particular, widespread use of the hashtag """"#OCD"""" indicates that social media users often trivialize the disease. The present study used a 3i?2i?2 between-subjects fully factorial online experiment (N=574, recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform) to test the impact of trivialized framing of this disease on perceptions of social media users who employ such language, as well as on perceptions of people with OCD as a group. Additionally, this study tested the effects of the gender of the Twitter avatar and self-identification in the avatar biography as an individual with OCD on these perceptions. Three-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) assessed the impact of the manipulations (i.e., content frame, gender of the avatar, self-identification with OCD).

In this paper, we argue that social change games should meet social gaming. Thus, we study the characteristics of Facebook style games and of the platform itself. We first discuss the positive traits of social gaming like the pro–social game mechanics, asynchronous multiplayer gameplay and the influence of the social infrastructure. Then, we consider how some of these factors can negatively impact social change games and show how these weaknesses can be addressed with careful forethought. Ultimately, we propose a novel strategy for the design of social change games and highlight how we can move forward to develop them.	game mechanics;planning;social infrastructure;social network game;the sims	Jennifer R.

Widely recognized for its potential to generate undue harm, the South Korean government has initiated a movement determined to block the participation of obscene content sharing between youths under the age of 18. While there may be different avenues to examine this phenomenon from, an approach notably absent from this list is the use of big data and data mining information produced via the dispersion of the Internet and social media. Using social big data, the study found that teenagers sexting in hopes of obtaining a higher volume of attention among friends; file sharing is more frequented than image distribution through sexting; and transactions without “adult pornography” and with “smishing” were the most influential in addressing the risks of sexting in South Korea. While big data and data mining do not make any inferences themselves, the benefits of analyzing social big data lies in its ability to incorporate a much larger volume of data and confirm the thoughts of a diverse range of participants.	big data	Juyoung Song;Tae Min Song;Jin Ree Lee	2018	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.035	public relations;psychology;social psychology;big data;the internet;pornography;image sharing;file sharing;phenomenon;social media;government	ML	-82.59131455556377	-18.299618093504293	135933

Previously, we proposed culturally familiar recognition-based graphical passwords using pictures that relate to users' backgrounds. This scheme showed a high level of memorability, especially for users who created their graphical password from culturally familiar pictures [1]. This paper aims to study this scheme further by examining its security against educated guessing attacks. This study was also the first attempt to investigate the risk of using personal information shared by users on social networks to guess their graphical passwords.  Friends and family members of the owners of graphical passwords were asked to make three attempts at attacking their graphical passwords. Each graphical password consisted of both culturally familiar and unfamiliar pictures. The attackers were advised to use two sources of information to help them in guessing: the victims' accounts on social networks and direct experience with the victims.  The results of this within-subject study showed that the attackers correctly guessed the culturally familiar pictures more often than unfamiliar ones. Also, culturally familiar pictures were easier to guess than unfamiliar pictures when the attackers used information from social networks.	authentication;computer graphics;computer security;graphical user interface;high-level programming language;image;password;personally identifiable information;social network;usability	Hani Moaiteq Aljahdali;Ron Poet	2014		10.1145/2659651.2659727	password policy;computer science;password psychology;authentication;internet privacy;computer security;social network	HCI	-90.28720398288309	-16.58226392136766	136004

Design/methodology/approach – The scientific literature was systematically reviewed to identify relevant empirical studies. These studies were analysed and synthesized in the form of a proposed conceptual framework, which was thereafter applied to further analyse this literature, hence gaining new insights into the field. Findings – The proposed framework reveals that all relevant studies can be decomposed into a small number of steps, and different approaches can be followed in each step. The application of the framework resulted in interesting findings. For example, most studies support SM predictive power, however, more than one-third of these studies infer predictive power without employing predictive analytics.

In an attempt to examine the relationship among users' behaviors, their counterparts' relationship types, and the users' perceived acquaintanceships after using Facebook, this study first investigated users' frequently used tools when interacting with different types of friends. Users tended to use less time- and effort-consuming and less privacy-concerned tools with newly acquired friends. This study further examined users' behaviors in terms of their closeness and intimacy and their perceived acquaintanceships toward four different types of friends. The study found that users gained more perceived acquaintanceships from less close friends with whom users have more frequent interaction but less intimate behaviors. As for closer friends, users tended to use more intimate activities to interact with them. However, these activities did not necessarily occur more frequently than the activities they employed with their less close friends. It was found that perceived acquaintanceships with closer friends were significantly lower than those with less close friends. This implies that Facebook is a mechanism for new friends, rather than close friends, to become more acquainted.

The presence of phantom or fake profiles dilutes the integrity of this correspondence. This paper looks at the presence of phantom profiles in the context of social gaming, i.e., profiles created with the purpose of gaining a strategic advantage in social games. Through a measurement-based study of a Facebook gaming application that is known to attract phantom profiles, we show statistical differences among a subset of features associated with genuine and phantom profiles. We then use supervised learning to classify phantom profiles. Our work represents a first-step towards solving the more general problem of detecting fake/phantom identities in OSNs.	computational human phantom;imaging phantom;interaction design;phantom reference;sensor;social network game;supervised learning	Atif Nazir;Saqib Raza;Chen-Nee Chuah;Burkhard Schipper	2010			psychology;simulation;multimedia;social psychology	ML	-84.43856381740117	-17.734620915817455	136255

Under the intensive market competition, customer’s revisit behavior is essential for OGB websites to survive. Drawing upon the shopping value perspective, this paper identifies the unique features of OGB and investigates the impacts of these features on customer shopping value and revisit behaviors. A theoretical model was developed and tested by 258 valid responses collected through an online survey. The results show that both the hedonic value and utilitarian value are salient in OGB context and the identified OGB features significantly influence the shopping value. Further, the effects of shopping value vary among different visit channels.	theory	Tong Che;Xiabing Zheng;Jerry Zeyu Peng;Kai H. Lim	2015				HCI	-87.69383664818447	-12.35732501270678	136395

To better understand the reasons behind this disparity, and offer support for (corrective) decision making, we and others have been engaged in large-scale empirical studies of activity in these online platforms, in which gender is one of the variables of interest. However, since gender is not explicitly recorded, it is typically inferred by automatic """"gender guessers"""", based on cues derived from an individual's online presence, such as their name and profile picture. As opposed to self-reporting, used in earlier studies, gender guessers scale better, but their accuracy depends on the quantity and quality of data available in one's online profile.

One of the key questions in creating online presence is whether to allocate resources on developing the offline print brand and expect brand equity transfer to the online environment or to allocate resources on developing the online brand for new audience. In this paper the authors propose an application of double jeopardy approach for assessing this issue. Finnish secondary data is used to test two competing research hypotheses. The analysis reveals that the magazine publishers who have been able to build market share in online environment seem to have more loyal customer-base in their websites. Market share of printed magazine does not predict loyalty towards magazine websites.

In this paper, we discuss methods to improve the design of context-aware notifications. Using the data from our prior experiment, we identify main factors that influence citizens’ responses to notifications and evaluate the predictability of quick responses using a simplified method. We then propose a model for designing civic crowdsourcing tasks based on historical information. We believe that creating well-designed notifications can decrease receivers’ workloads and simultaneously expands the positive impacts of civic crowdsourcing on the quality of life in the city.	crowdsourcing;the quality of life	Tomoyo Sasao;Shin'ichi Konomi	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39862-4_43	public relations;political science;socioeconomics;internet privacy;crowdsourcing	HCI	-90.95603088851448	-16.19257754683121	136833

In four studies, we show that expertise affects younger consumers, such that younger novices evaluate products more favorably when the descriptions feature benefit information, whereas younger experts evaluate products more favorably when the descriptions feature attribute information. However, both older novices and experts evaluate products described with benefit information more favorably than those described with attribute information. We further show that differences in the perceived diagnosticity of different types of information mediate the effects of expertise and age on product evaluations. We theorize that age differences in perceived diagnosticity occur because older and younger consumers spontaneously construe information in different ways. Therefore, age differences in the effect of expertise on evaluations should disappear when construal levels are controlled. Consistent with our hypotheses, we demonstrate that when primed to construe information at concrete levels, older consumers behave just like younger consumers—older experts formed more favorable evaluations toward products described with attribute information, but older novices formed more favorable evaluations toward products described with benefit information. When younger consumers are primed to construe information at abstract levels, they prefer products described with benefit information regardless of expertise, just like older consumers. We discuss the implications of our results for both researchers and practitioners. This paper was accepted by Pradeep Chintagunta, marketing .		Jing Wang;Catherine A.

We investigated the appropriation of tablet devices and a neighborhood portal as well as emerging privacy and security issues through ethnographic and action research in a long-term participatory design (PD) project with elderly participants. We discuss two major themes: a) the tensions related to perceived digital threats and the social pressures of online disclosure to the social environment; and b) the relation of these issues to the ICT appropriation process and the referring challenges we encountered. We argue that there is a need to understand the interleaving of physical and virtual habitats, the various ways resulting in discomfort and the senior citizens' actions -- which at first glance appear contradictory. We consider the implications of the issues observed for examining privacy and security concerns more broadly as well as discussing implications for the design of the portal and the shaping of social measures for appropriation support.	amiga reflections;emoticon;forward error correction;habitat;interaction;moore neighborhood;noise shaping;personal information management;personally identifiable information;privacy;social system;sociotechnical system;sparse matrix;tablet computer;theory	Dominik Hornung;Claudia Müller;Irina A.

Selection of three hundred and fifty-six fans of a famous sports club was through random sampling using the club’s website. AMOS used structural equation modeling for data analysis. Results provided strong support on the effect of electronic service quality (E-S-QUAL) on fan satisfaction and fan loyalty toward the website of their favorable football teams. Business enterprises have well researched e-service quality and loyalty. However, limited research exists in the sports context. This paper provides valuable insight into the measurement of e-service quality and fan loyalty in the sport and offers a foundation for future marketing research.

However, by using only this number, we lose significant information about the distribution of citations per article in an author’s publication list. In this article, we study an author’s citation curve and we define two new areas related to this curve. We call these “penalty areas”, since the greater they are, the more an author’s performance is penalized. We exploit these areas to establish new indices, namely Perfectionism Index and eXtreme Perfectionism Index (XPI), aiming at categorizing researchers in two distinct categories: “influentials” and “mass producers”; the former category produces articles which are (almost all) with high impact, and the latter category produces a lot of articles with moderate or no impact at all. Using data from Microsoft Academic Service, we evaluate the merits mainly of PI as a useful tool for scientometric studies. We establish its effectiveness into separating the scientists into influentials and mass producers; we demonstrate its robustness against self-citations, and its uncorrelation to traditional indices. Finally, we apply PI to rank prominent scientists in the areas of databases, networks and multimedia, exhibiting the strength of the index in fulfilling its design goal.	categorization;database;index (publishing);microsoft academic search;scientometrics	Antonis Sidiropoulos;Dimitrios Katsaros;Yannis Manolopoulos	2014	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-014-1515-0	ranking;bibliometrics;computer science;data science;data mining;operations research;citation analysis;world wide web	Web+IR	-77.85881273071321	-21.179917945239566	137641

This study examined the prevalence and correlates of sexting (i.e., sending sexual messages via mobile phones) within a sample of married/cohabiting couples (180 wives and 175 husbands). Married adults do sext each other, but it is much less common than within young adult relationships, and consists mainly of sexy or intimate talk (29% reported engaging in sexy talk with partners) rather than sexually explicit photos or videos (12% reported sending nude or nearly-nude photos). Sending sexy talk messages was positively related to relationship satisfaction only among those with high levels of avoidance, and sending sexually explicit pictures was related to satisfaction for men, and for women with high levels of attachment anxiety. Additionally, sending sexually explicit pictures was related to greater ambivalence among both men and women. These findings support and extend previous research with young adults.		Brandon T.

This absence of a clear theoretical framework for such judgements and conclusions that are reached is a real weakness of the book. For any thorough-going analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different assessment methods, models, and processes surely has to take full account of different agents, subjects, and purposes. There are empirical weaknesses too, for instance in the long chapter on the assessments that underpin the allocation of funds under the New Zealand Performance Based Research Fund, where we are given an analysis of the results of a post facto survey Goldfi nch conducted of assessment panel members. The response rate was less than 20% and skewed by discipline; but most of the tables presenting the results take no account at all of disciplinary differences in responses to questions such as the criteria adopted in assessing research outputs. And while there is much of interest in the chapter on Japan, again it is hard to draw any fi rm conclusions from it. In sum, the insights and lessons to be discerned by readers of this book are far from clear. The book provides even-handed descriptions and judgements of the three assessment exercises and the criticisms that have been made of them; but as an analytical account of assessment regimes it falls very short.	color gradient	Sanford G.

e7c542d57e3c5ab664086e55f176e53334cecaeb	model-based evaluation of scientific impact indicators		Using bibliometric data artificially generated through a model of citation dynamics calibrated on empirical data, we compare several indicators for the scientific impact of individual researchers. The use of such a controlled setup has the advantage of avoiding the biases present in real databases, and it allows us to assess which aspects of the model dynamics and which traits of individual researchers a particular indicator actually reflects. We find that the simple average citation count of the authored papers performs well in capturing the intrinsic scientific ability of researchers, regardless of the length of their career. On the other hand, when productivity complements ability in the evaluation process, the notorious h and g indices reveal their potential, yet their normalized variants do not always yield a fair comparison between researchers at different career stages. Notably, the use of logarithmic units for citation counts allows us to build simple indicators with performance equal to that of h and g. Our analysis may provide useful hints for a proper use of bibliometric indicators. Additionally, our framework can be extended by including other aspects of the scientific production process and citation dynamics, with the potential to become a standard tool for the assessment of impact metrics.	bibliometrics;complement system proteins;database;paper;preparation;trait;citation	Matús Medo;Giulio Cimini	2016	Physical review.

The increased use of the freemium business model and the introduction of new tools have made analytics pervasive in the video game industry. The research on game analytics is scant and descriptive. Thus, reasons for employing game analytics are not well understood. In this study, we analyze data collected with a set of in-depth interviews from small and medium-sized freemium game developers. The results show that game analytics is used to (1) assist design, (2) to reduce the risks associated with launching new games, and (3) to communicate with investors and publishers. The study advances the research on the business value of game analytics.

We propose and test a theoretical model to explain how different technologies and message characteristics influence the emotional responses of recipients and how recipients evaluate the emotional content of the messages. Two collaboration technologies - email and voicemail - were examined because they differ in richness and naturalness. As some individuals are more capable in interpreting and understanding emotion, we also examined the role of emotional intelligence. The results show that a message sent via email was likely to trigger a different immediate psycho physiological emotional response and be evaluated differently by the recipient than the same message sent using voicemail, depending on the content of the message, its tone, and the emotional intelligence of the recipient.	distortion;email;theory	Taylor M.

In response, they are often correlated with quality ratings or with other quantitative indicators in order to partly assess their validity. When correlations are calculated for sets of publications from multiple disciplines or years, however, the magnitude of the correlation coefficient may be reduced, masking the strength of the underlying correlation. In response, this article uses simulations to systematically investigate the extent to which mixing years or disciplines reduces correlations. The results show that mixing two sets of articles with different correlation strengths can reduce the correlation for the combined set to substantially below the average of the two. Moreover, even mixing two sets of articles with the same correlation strength but different mean citation counts can substantially reduce the correlation for the combined set. The extent of the reduction in correlation also depends upon whether the articles assessed have been pre-selected for being high quality and whether the relationship between the quality ratings and citation counts is linear or exponential. The results underline the importance of using homogeneous data sets but also help to interpret correlation coefficients when this is impossible.	coefficient;correlation dimension;display resolution;microsoft windows;simulation;time complexity	Mike Thelwall;Ruth Fairclough	2015	J.

2c505cac9f191ab80079e8a8c980077a13902473	a new scale for rating scientific publications		Introduction Citation-based bibliometric indicators are increasingly being used for evaluating research. This reflects the need of decision-makers to increase the efficiency of allocating resources to research institutions and scientists, while also keeping manageable and cost-effective the evaluation process that grounds the allocation of resources. There often is much room of improvement in how bibliometric indicators are being used in practice. But even state-of-the art bibliometric indicators suffer of a fundamental problem when used for evaluating research: the citations they are based upon are influenced by many factors beyond the quality of cited publications (Bornmann & Daniel, 2008) and these indicators need to be tested and validated against what it is that they purport to measure and predict, which is expert evaluation by peers (Harnad, 2008). A solution to this problem is aggregating online ratings provided post-publication by the scientists who read the rated papers anyhow, for the purpose of their own research. Online-aggregated ratings are now a major factor in the decisions taken by consumers when choosing hotels, restaurants, movies and many other types of services or products. It is paradoxical that in science, a field for which peer review is a cornerstone, rating publications on dedicated online platforms is not yet a common behavior. For example, if each scientist would provide one rating weekly, it can be estimated that 52% of publications would get 10 ratings or more (Florian, 2012). This would be a significant enhancement for the evaluative information needed by decision makers that allocate resources to scientists and by other users of scientific publications. For collecting this kind of ratings, a rating scale should be defined. Here I present the choices made during the development of the scale used at Epistemio, an online platform for aggregating ratings and reviews of scientific publications (www.epistemio.com).	bibliometrics;rating scale;scientific literature	Razvan V.

As a result, the ability of citizens and communities to engage in robust debate in the public sphere is diminished. In response, this paper highlights the capacity of urban interfaces, such as pervasive displays, to counteract this trend by exposing citizens to the socio-cultural diversity of the city. Engagement with different ideas, networks and communities is crucial to both innovation and the functioning of democracy. We discuss examples of urban interfaces designed to play a key role in fostering this engagement. Based on an analysis of works empirically-grounded in field observations and design research, we call for a theoretical framework that positions pervasive displays and other urban interfaces as civic media. We argue that when designed for more than wayfinding, advertisement or television broadcasts, urban screens as civic media can rectify some of the pitfalls of social media by allowing the polarised user to break out of their filter bubble and embrace the cultural diversity and richness of the city.	algorithm;pervasive informatics;social media;user interface	Marcus Foth;Martin Tomitsch;Laura Forlano;Matthias Hank Haeusler;Christine Satchell	2016		10.1145/2914920.2915010	public relations;engineering;multimedia;advertising	HCI	-81.39370181220832	-13.87215809331218	139203

In this paper, we characterize temporal trends in user communication through mapping of theoretically-linked semantic content. We used qualitative coding and automated text analysis to assign theoretical techniques to peer interactions in an online community for smoking cessation, subsequently facilitating temporal visualization of the observed techniques. Results indicate manifestation of several behavior change techniques such as feedback and monitoring' and 'rewards'. Automated methods yielded reasonable results (F-measure=0.77). Temporal trends among relapsers revealed reduction in communication after a relapse event. This social withdrawal may be attributed to failure guilt after the relapse. Results indicate significant change in thematic categories such as 'social support', 'natural consequences', and 'comparison of outcomes' pre and post relapse. Implications for development of behavioral support technologies that promote long-term abstinence are discussed.	categories;imagery;interaction;liver failure, acute;online community;psychological techniques;rewards;social support;women's health services	Vishnupriya Sridharan;Trevor Cohen;Nathan K.

In particular, we explored how positive messages in online discussion forums may affect consumers’ decisions to shop online. We used a laboratory experiment in which the treatment group was required to read positive messages about online shopping experience in an online discussion forum. Positive social influence was found to reinforce the relationship between beliefs about and attitude toward online shopping, as well as the relationship between attitude and intention to shop. We believe our alternative theory provides new insight into the complex processes through which social influence is brought to bear on consumers’ online shopping decisions.

The influence of ICT based form of communication on the relations between the authorities and the citizens are heavily influenced by the role of the citizens designed by the authorities. If the citizens are treated as customers the authorities are pursuing a consultative model focusing on creating an effective administration. The flow of information is unilinear; however, if the role of the citizens is a citizen’s role the administrative system pursue a participatory model. The information society produces frames of actions for the society, yet it is the role planned for the citizens that create the opportunities for E-Democracy. Based on these interaction models we assume effects on turnout in elections and on citizens’ role and activity in traditional channels. This paper is a theoretical contribution.

However, there is no consensus whether network position can promote organizational innovation. This study meta-analytically integrated results from piles of network position researches in organizational innovation in 20years. Based on 81 independent samples N=16975, it found a positive significance between network position and organizational innovation with r=0.448. Then, it explored this relationship from the perspective of time factor, cultural differences, organizational scales, measuring dimension, and the existence of mediators. It turned out that there were significant differences in the relationship under time factor, organizational size, measuring dimension, and the existence of mediators. However, there was no significant difference in the relationship under difference culture. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It argues that self-other disparities in perceived message effects lead to specific rectifying behaviors due to, presumably, a recognition of the problematic situation defined by perceived effects. Such behaviors would be aimed at restricting messages with negative influence, correcting messages with ambiguous influence, and amplifying messages with positive influence. The hypothesis was tested with models specified through “the diamond method.” These models allow for estimating effects of perceptual disparity while controlling for overall perceived message effects. Results from Web-based survey data showed that the third-person perception (i.e., greater effect on others than on self) was a robust and significant predictor across all three messages. But the directions of such effects differed across messages with desirable or undesirable presumed influence. Theoretical and methodological implications for future research on the beh...

The National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assesses American's health-related information behaviors and its links to health behavior change, attitudes, and knowledge in order to improve the American health information environment (Nelson, 2004). Analyses of the 2007 HINTS data reported that approximately 19% of Americans said that they have a lot of trust in online health information, approximately 48% of Americans have some trust in online health information, and approximately 17.47% of American have a little trust in online health information. However, only 14.47% of Americans were likely to purchase medicine or vitamins online. It was hypothesized that those who trust in online health information a lot are likely to purchase medicine or vitamins online. As a result, online users, who trust in online health information a lot, are more likely to purchase medicine or vitamins online (p<0.05). This study explains trust in online health information influences decisions regarding the purchase of medicine or vitamins online that might result in changes in health-related behaviors.	purchasing	Jung A.

This paper complements the market intelligence research by an investigation into the applicability of cultural classification schemes as exemplified by Hofstede with a view to information extant and prospective Internet involvement. Finally, practical recommendations are made in order to reduce the risk of activities likely to cause irritation of and non‐response from this burgeoning new market.	internet	Kevin Johnston;Parminder Johal	1999	Internet Research	10.1108/10662249910274566	simulation;marketing;sociology;advertising;law;world wide web;computer security;culture	HPC	-81.02293669641234	-10.210393846266065	139977
0728b8d63b0aa78c6d10db47413228aa4a3db2a5	digitalized news on non-communicable diseases coverage - what are the unhealthy features of media content induced for chinese?		As non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become widespread and are now the leading cause of death among populations worldwide, they are also increasingly the focus of media attention. The objective of this study is to focus on NCDs from media coverage with an understanding that media say something about the society producing it and future effects. The data integrates various newspaper coverage on NCDs from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. Online news data and machine-aided content analysis were employed to examine disease topics, causes, and ultimately to allocate responsibility. The methodology used emerging big social data analytics for analysis. A total of 32,685 newspaper articles covering NCDs were identified from 2010–2017. The topics of metabolic diseases were covered more frequently in mainland China, while cardiovascular diseases were predominately covered in the neighbouring areas. The study highlights the difference between news frames of NCDs and NCDs cause was induced predominantly by a focus on the risk factor of alcohol consumption. The discussion attempts to explain causative agents of diseases covered while provides an example of big social data analytics in journalism for larger social forces. In conclusion, this study addresses challenges researchers face when analyzing big data.

Higher centrality in the co-authorship network is hypothesized to be positively related to performance, in terms of academic publication, with gender having a positive moderating effect for female researchers. Using social network analysis, this study examines the bibliometric data (2002–2009) from ISI Web of Science for the co-authorship network of 2,027 Pakistani authors publishing in the field of Chemistry. A non-temporal analysis using node-level regression reports positive impact of degree and closeness and negative impact of betweeness centrality on research performance. Temporal analysis using node-level regression (time 1: 2002–2005; time 2: 2006–2009) confirms the direction of causality and demonstrates the positive association of degree and closeness centrality on research performance. Findings indicate a moderating role of gender on the relationship of both degree and closeness centrality with research performance for Pakistani female authors.	aggregate data;betweenness centrality;bibliometrics;causality;closeness centrality;self-replicating machine;social network analysis;web of science	Kamal Badar;Julie M.

We developed the """"store appeal value"""", which is unique index of showing the attractiveness of a store and developed a walk rally application based on incentives based on the store appeal value. We investigated whether shoutengai can be revitalized by using our walk rally application. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed application, we conducted a demonstration experiment involving three shoutengai in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo. By analyzing the behavior logs obtained from the experiment, we clarified that our store appeal value is appropriate.

In particular, this research explores how trust works in the domain of film exhibition and curating. A group of film professionals were studied to explore how they navigate published information that the film industry produces. The trust at stake in this context seems to be the credibility and the authenticity of the information. Participants were sensitive to the interplay between what could be described as ‘factual material’ and its representation by different writers. Each participant had developed somewhat different heuristics over the span of their professional practice. We find that once more basic strategies to inform trust are considered, the design of trust becomes complex and contradictory. This finding can be extrapolated to other groups who share documents professionally.	counterfactual definiteness;distrust;extrapolation;heuristic (computer science);text-based (computing);trust (emotion)	Natasha Dwyer;Tom Clark;Piotr Cofta	2011	J.

This paper surveys and assesses the claims made on behalf of robots in relation to their capacity to meet the needs of older persons. We consider each of the roles that has been suggested for robots in aged care and attempt to evaluate how successful robots might be in these roles. We do so from the perspective of writers concerned primarily with the quality of aged care, paying particular attention to the social and ethical implications of the introduction of robots, rather than from the perspective of robotics, engineering, or computer science. We emphasis the importance of the social and emotional needs of older persons—which, we argue, robots are incapable of meeting—in almost any task involved in their care. Even if robots were to become capable of filling some service roles in the aged-care sector, economic pressures on the sector would most likely ensure that the result was a decrease in the amount of human contact experienced by older persons being cared for, which itself would be detrimental to their well-being. This means that the prospects for the ethical use of robots in the aged-care sector are far fewer than first appears. More controversially, we believe that it is not only misguided, but actually unethical, to attempt to substitute robot simulacra for genuine social interaction. A subsidiary goal of this paper is to draw attention to the discourse about aged care and robotics and locate it in the context of broader social attitudes towards older persons. We conclude by proposing a deliberative process involving older persons as a test for the ethics of the use of robots in aged care.	computer science;robot;robotics	Robert Sparrow;Linda Sparrow	2006	Minds and Machines	10.1007/s11023-006-9030-6	psychology;human–robot interaction;robot;social relation;simulation;ethics;media lab europe's social robots;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;communication;social psychology	Robotics	-79.16291451737649	-11.233233722225684	141117
9ff55656a503b5014c3bedff7be97d8d7861140c	an examination of computer attitudes, anxieties, and aversions among diverse college populations: issues central to understanding information sciences in the new millennium		Studying the impact of computer attitudes on the production of knowledge is central to the understanding of information sciences in the new millennium. The major results from a survey of diverse college populations suggest that Liberal Arts College (LAC) students, in this demographic, have somewhat more ambivalence toward computers than students in a Community College (CC) or a nontraditional Business College (BC) environment. The respondents generally agreed that computers were an important part of daily life and not particularly frustrating. In addition, it appears that today’s students like computers, know at least something about them, feel competent when using one, and are not tired of hearing about computers as a matter of daily discourse. The participants generally agreed, although not strongly so, that they would like to learn more about computers. The surveyed students generally expressed an interest in on-line courses, although students from the LAC were more neutral about on-line courses. On-line courses were generally considered somewhat inferior to traditional classes. Most of the respondents feel that they have a reasonable amount of computer-related experiences and, as a result, have considerable competence and success when using one, and believed that they could successfully master new software. The majority of the students expressed at least some degree of enjoyment from computer and non-computer games. Last, students at the LAC and BC appeared to possess greater knowledge about computer operation, a fact that may in part be due to the age of the respondents.	computer;experience;information science;online and offline;pc game;population	William H.

However, the relationships between personal values and perceived values are unclear to explain individuals' adoption of technologies. E-books changing the publishing industry with a high adoption rate in a global market are used as the area of investigation. The study proposed a new framework to examine the relationships between five personal values (hedonism, stimulation, self-direction, power, and achievement) and three perceived values of e-books (functional value, emotional value, and social value), and their effects on individuals' intentions to use e-books. The results show that people who attach more importance to """"power"""" have a concern about the success in their lives and pay more attention to social and functional values of e-books. People who attach more importance to """"achievement"""" are more concerned with enjoying life, exciting life, and freedom life while people who put a high value on """"self-direction"""" are more concerned with exciting life and enjoying life. People who attach more importance to """"hedonism"""" pay more attention to emotional value of e-books and ones who put a high value on """"stimulation"""" pay more attention to the social value of e-books.

But when deciding whether to disclose their personal information to Internet businesses, consumers may weigh the concerns of giving up information privacy against the benefits of information disclosure. This article examines how Internet businesses can motivate consumers to disclose their personal information. Based on a synthesis of the literature, the article identifies seven types of extrinsic or intrinsic benefits that Internet businesses can provide when soliciting personal information from consumers. Through comprehensive conceptual and empirical validation processes, the article develops an instrument that allows Internet businesses to gauge the preference of consumers for the various types of benefits. By testing a set of nomological networks, some ideas are presented to Internet businesses about what types of benefits may be more effective given the personality traits of particular consumer populations. Besides providing a foundation for efforts aimed at developing theories on information, privacy and information disclosure, the results of this research provide useful suggestions to Internet businesses on how best to solicit personal information from consumers.

The study explored how media and audience factors, such as country of residence, media ownership, polychronicity, or the preference to do multiple things at the same time, predict media multitasking behaviors and if different motivations to multitask mediate the effects of these factors. The study is based on a cross-cultural survey (N=1972) that included respondents from the United States and Taiwan. The findings indicated that media ownership, polychronicity, and four motivations (control, entertainment, connection, and addiction) positively predicted media multitasking behaviors. The four motivations were also found to mediate the effect of media ownership. American respondents were higher polychronics and heavier multitaskers than their Taiwanese counterparts. In the Taiwanese sample, polychronicity and motivations increased the effects of media ownership on media multitasking. In the American sample, polychronicity contributed little to the effect of media ownership, and the mediating role of motivations decreased with the increase in the level of polychronicity.	computer multitasking;internet	Anastasia Kononova;Yi-Hsuan Chiang	2015	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.052	multimedia	HCI	-87.57461655989374	-20.770464549660556	141852

One main motivation for this transition is to limit or eliminate advertisem nt exposure. As a result, online advertisers are developing new techniques to compensate for this av oid nce. One technique, advertisement choice, allows online viewers to select the message they watch. Previous research on advertisement choice has shown various cognitive ef fects. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the number of options presented within this choice moderated these effects. Participants from two Midwestern universities (Unit ed States institutions) were randomly assigned to conditions that varied in the number of options. Some participants were not allowed to choose what type of message to watch (i.e. zero opti ns). Other participants were presented with a choice between two, three, or six options. The amount of cognitive effort allocated to the advertisement after the choice manipulation was the dependent variable of this study. The results showed a curvilinear relationship between t h number of choice options and cognitive effort. Effort was significantly higher for choice s using two and three options compared to no choice and six options.

This paper examines the influence of tolerance for ambiguity, computer anxiety, and gender on interest in acquiring IT competency among 123 accounting and AIS majors. In comparison to individuals majoring in accounting, the AIS majors were more tolerant of ambiguity (p = .025) and had slightly more positive attitudes toward computers. However, neither computer anxiety (p = .112) nor gender (p = .915) explained major selection. The results suggest the accountants with strong interests in IT are more comfortable with ill‐defined, ambiguous problem‐solving situations. The study implies that tolerance for ambiguity, a characteristic increasingly valued by the profession, should be considered in the classroom and in hiring decisions.

On one hand, the results suggest that the average e-participation offered by Chilean municipalities in the North of Chile is still low. On the other hand, municipalities providing a high level of eParticipation services are not always the ones getting better levels of citizen's satisfaction with their services.

We found that generalist organizations, or organizations with heterogeneous goals, play several key roles in the connective public good. Generalist NGOs promoted the most legitimate face of the issue network, acting as brokers and authorities to other generalist NGOs, and initiators for both specialist and generalist NGOs.	hyperlink;logical connective	Michelle Shumate;Justin Lipp	2008	J.

As the antecedents of self-disclosure, the study included the need for affiliation and the motivations for relationship maintenance and initiation. Using data from an online survey (N = 249), structural equation modeling analyses revealed that self-disclosure amount and positivity were positively associated with intimacy, while self-disclosure honesty and intent were not associated with intimacy. The study also found no direct association between the need for affiliation and self-disclosure. Rather, the need for affiliation was associated with the motivations for relationship maintenance and initiation, which in turn affected self-disclosure and intimacy. The theoretical implications of the study were discussed. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	structural equation modeling	Namkee Park;Borae Jin;Seung-A.

The key contribution of this paper is the content based analysis showing that people mostly share events from their everyday lives, even if the information is repetitious or does not have any informational meaning, this practice prevailing even though most such updates were regarded as uninteresting ones. Moreover, a considerable amount of status updates was seen to fall into category of 'small talk'. The results show that the communication through Facebook has strong element of phatic communion, i.e. it serves the purpose of maintaining and defining social relationships and enacts social cohesiveness. Our results reveal an interesting contradiction between uninteresting content and (obviously) interesting service; and suggest that small talk type entries can be seen as a tool for increasing one's social capital by being active.	group cohesiveness;social capital;social media	Ari-Heikki Sarjanoja;Minna Isomursu;Jonna Häkkilä	2013		10.1145/2523429.2523449	psychology;public relations;communication;social psychology	Web+IR	-83.90888356113668	-17.071810771375414	144272

The study shows that there was no relation between a movie's rank in the IMDb listing and the number of copies held. Relationships appeared between number of library holdings and country of production (U.S. productions favored), genre (family, sci-fi, animation, adventure favored), and Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating (G, PG, PG-13 preferred).

This study attempts to identify the underlying predictors of such parental misconceptions. A national sample survey (nonrandom) of 456 matched parent–child pairs revealed that a permissive parenting style, difficulty communicating about online risks, and household environmental variables such as having access to a private computing space play a role in parental underestimation of risky social interactions that their children encounter and experience online.

159481ae5c19039a3b66a77b72d08b611b99a673	the effects of consumer perceived different service of trusted third party on trust intention: an empirical study in australia		With the advantages including the high interaction, convenience, transparency and individualization, the Internet makes the online shopping become increasingly popular among businesses and consumers. The online transaction environment is characterized by virtuality and anonymity, so the trust plays an indispensable role. Currently the trust issue has become one of the main reasons that troubles and hinders the online shopping behavior of consumers. In this paper, the trusted third party (TTP) in Australia's business is studied and the factors influencing consumers' trust behavior are examined from the perspective of consumers online trust of online shopping. Based on the literature review and combined with the development status and background of Australia's e-commerce, underpinned by the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Institutional Theory and Signaling Theory, an integrative service framework of TTP is proposed and empirically tested in this paper. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling was conducted to assess the hypotheses. This study proposes that an integrative service framework of TTP should include the following five aspects: payment service, logistics &amp; distribution service, guarantee &amp; insurance service, certification service, and rating &amp; recommendation service. The empirical results, obtained in a sample of 282 online shopping users, indicate that the above-mentioned five different types of TTPs, which have combined effect on the trust motivation and behavior of consumers. Through building an integrative service framework of TTP, the level of consumer trust can be more fully strengthened. When consumers think that more services from TTP are owned by an enterprise, they have smaller barrier in their expected future trust and stronger control of their own trust behavior, and finally enhance the consumers' trust behavior.	ampersand;e-commerce;logistics;monte carlo method;online shopping;partial least squares regression;sampling (signal processing);structural equation modeling;trusted third party;virtuality (gaming)	Cong Cao;Jun Yan;Mengxiang Li	2017	2017 IEEE 14th International Conference on e-Business Engineering (ICEBE)	10.1109/ICEBE.2017.19	theory of planned behavior;trusted third party;marketing;knowledge management;empirical research;signalling;internet privacy;payment;computer science;the internet;certification;institutional theory	Metrics	-88.94967283394028	-10.564007397109322	144545

We focus our analysis on tweets regarding the 2013 federal government shutdown; a topic that was at the forefront of U.S. politics in late 2013. Our results demonstrate that the positions of the members of the two major political parties are mirrored by the positions taken by the Twitter communities that are aligned with them. We also analyze retweeting behavior by examining the differences in the moral loadings of intra-community and inter-community retweets. We find that retweets in our corpus favor rhetoric that enhances the cohesion of the community, and emphasize content over moral rhetoric. We argue that the method proposed in this paper contributes to the general study of moral cognition and social behavior.	cognition;computation;digital rhetoric;microsoft forefront;reblogging;shutdown (computing)	Eyal Sagi;Morteza Dehghani	2014			moral reasoning;moral psychology;social psychology;harm;social cognitive theory of morality;moral disengagement;moral foundations theory;sociology;government;moral development	NLP	-82.10741245468937	-17.211800758323463	144896

0c900f6a4391fecd51cb60efa04ff29d3b036033	monetizing freemium communities: does paying for premium increase social engagement?		Making sustainable profits from a baseline zero price and motivating free consumers to convert to premium subscribers is a continuing challenge for all freemium communities. Prior research has causally established that social engagement (Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2013) and peer influence (Bapna and Umyarov 2015) are two important drivers of users converting to premium subscribers in such communities. In this paper, we flip the perspective of prior research and ask whether the decision to pay for a premium subscription causes users to become more socially engaged. In the context of the Last.fm music listening freemium social community, we establish, using a novel 41-month-long panel dataset, a look-ahead propensity score matching (LA-PSM) procedure coupled with a difference-in-difference estimator of the treatment effect, that payment for premium leads to more social engagement. Specifically, we find that paying for premium leads to an increase in both content-related and community-related social engagement. Free users who convert to premium listen to 287.2% more songs, create 1.92% more play lists, exhibit a 2.01% increase in the number of forum posts made, and gain 15.77% more friends. Thus, premium subscribers create value not only for themselves by consuming more content, but also for the community and site by organizing more content and adding more friends, who are subsequently engaged by the social diffusion emerging from the focal user’s activities.	baseline (configuration management);difference in differences;focal (programming language);last.fm;monetization;organizing (structure);propensity score matching	Ravi Bapna;Jui Ramaprasad;Akhmed Umyarov	2018	MIS Quarterly		business;commerce;labour economics	HCI	-86.40047130062973	-13.724485915155308	145197
86302b9e17b0574f981d423141815bd4b9ab7ce9	the role of social networking in the social reform of young society		Social networks are virtual communication sites that allow its participants to connect, building relationships, and collaborate on social issues. It became part of our lives and spread rapidly among youth. Young people join these sites to keep strong relationships with friends and to make new ones. Therefore, it is important to investigate the factors that influence the intention to use social networking sites SNSs to gain better position in the social reform among young people. This study developed an integrated theoretical model which has five major factors that predict the intention to use SNSs. An empirical test was conducted, where a sample of 302 university students and an instrument containing 27 items was used. The results provide consistent evidence that all hypothesized positive associations exist except for the isolation variable. After taking into account different demographic and attitudinal variables, Facebook use still predicted respondents' social reform. The future work might focus on a specific context such as the effects of using social networks on education, and focus on students' environment in education and the influence of social network. Detailed results, conclusions and future work are stated in later sections.

4f75a5829eba601cc51cfb98aa7d81034faed189	social influence and reciprocity in online gift giving		Giving gifts is a fundamental part of human relationships that is being affected by technology. The Internet enables people to give at the last minute and over long distances, and to observe friends giving and receiving gifts. How online gift giving spreads in social networks is therefore important to understand. We examine 1.5 million gift exchanges on Facebook and show that receiving a gift causes individuals to be 56% more likely to give a gift in the future. Additional surveys show that online gift giving was more socially acceptable to those who learned about it by observing friends' participation instead of a non-social encouragement. Most receivers pay the gift forward instead of reciprocating directly online, although surveys revealed additional instances of direct reciprocity, where the initial gifting occurred offline. Thus, social influence promotes the spread of online gifting, which both complements and substitutes for offline gifting.	echelon conspiracy;internet;online and offline;social network	René F.

For this purpose, we conducted two laboratory studies to explore how the credibility cues in message contents, website features, and user reviews could differentially impact younger and older adults' credibility judgments. Results from the first experiment showed that older adults, compared to younger ones, were less sensitive to the credibility cues in message contents, as well as those in the website features. Results from the second experiment showed that user reviews that were consistent with the credibility cues in message contents could reinforce older adults' credibility judgments. Older adults, compared to younger adults, seemed to be less swayed by user reviews that were inconsistent with the message contents. These results provided implications for designing health information websites that better support older adults' credibility judgments.	display resolution;internet;terminator 2: judgment day;user review	Qingzi Vera Liao;Wai-Tat Fu	2012		10.1145/2110363.2110404	political science;multimedia;internet privacy;social psychology	HCI	-85.30870045367419	-18.799722055680807	145906

Particularly, we posit that Web use leads to intention to purchase online. Impulsiveness, Web use, and subjective norm are included in the model to test several hypotheses concerning online consumer beliefs, intentions, and the effect of psychological traits. We developed a survey instrument to collect data and used structural equation modeling to validate the research model. All of our hypotheses were confirmed except the one that links subjective norm and online buying behavior. The positive relationship between consumer impulsiveness and online purchasing behavior suggests that online stores should design their Web sites to attract impulse purchases.	ibm tivoli access manager;online shopping;purchasing;structural equation modeling	Xiaoni Zhang;Victor R.

Starting in June 2017, roaming within Europe will become free for mobile phone users, as an enforcement of the European parliament. The goal being to obtain a unified digital market: this seems at first sight to largely benefit to users, who will not have to worry about their usage abroad. We design in this paper a model analyzing the impact of free roaming enforcement on users and ISPs' pricing strategies, with respect to paid roaming to verify this assumption. We particularly focus on the strategies on transit payments between ISPs in different countries. We highlight that scrutiny is required since, depending on parameters, consumer surplus or subscription penetration are not necessarily maximized if free roaming is enforced.	interaction;mobile phone;numerical analysis	Patrick Maillé;Bruno Tuffin	2017	2017 8th International Conference on the Network of the Future (NOF)	10.1109/NOF.2017.8251216	worry;roaming;mobile phone;enforcement;computer security;payment;pricing strategies;economic surplus;business;scrutiny	Robotics	-82.6966777060274	-9.989834265413037	146221

Following the theory of planned behavior, this study develops a research model of privacy concern (PC), privacy risk (PR), and perceived enjoyment (PE) as attitudinal beliefs, subjective norm (SN) as normative belief, and smartphone self-efficacy (SE) as control belief to understand users’ intention to use mobile social networking apps. In particular, the impact of culture was investigated, considering the user base of mobile social networking apps is distributed globally and culturally diversified, and cultural values have direct impact on behavior.

Design/methodology/approach – A profiling approach is employed to analyse 114 (out of 3,934 from 2000 to 2012) e-government publications (with specific focus on user satisfaction) including examining variables such as country of research, sample size, type(s) of respondents, data collection methods, and statistical tools and techniques employed. Findings – Among the research design, methodologies and approaches adopted in the extant e-government research studies, the quantitative research based approach supported by statistical analysis was the most dominant approach applied by authors in the last decade. Few studies were found to use qualitative-based approaches such as case studies and interviews. Originality/value – The prime value and uniqueness of this research lies in presenting the type of research design, methodologies and approaches used in studies that focus on issues surrounding user satisfaction in e-government research. This has been achieved by synthesising existing publications in Electronic Government: An International Journal (EG), Electronic Journal of Electronic Government (EJEG), International Journal of Electronic Government Research (EJEGR), Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy (TG:PPP), Government Information Quarterly (GIQ), Public Administration Review (PAR), Public Administration: An International Quarterly (PA), Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory ( JPART), and Local Government Studies (LGS).	computer user satisfaction;e-government;eurographics;profiling (computer programming);statistical model	Zahir Irani;Vishanth Weerakkody;Muhammad Mustafa Kamal;Nitham Mohammed Hindi;Ibrahim H.

We argue that public administrations in modern democratic societies are in both their organizational structures and their activities subservient to legal and political norms in a way that is different from private organizations; therefore, public administration cannot slavishly emulate CSCW applications that have proven themselves in a private context. Public administrations have to assess forms of CSCW in the light of the normative structure that is specific for them. We argue that the introduction of CSCW will further the tendencies to bureaucratisation and skew power biases towards public administration and away from the citizen. We give evidence for this contention on the basis of a comparison of different national attempts to introduce CSCW in Social Security offices in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Although each of these countries is inspired by different ideals about the relationship between state and citizen in the social security sector, the influence of CSCW in all three cases goes in the same direction.	computer-supported cooperative work;social security	I.

Social networking applications therefore developed on the Web 2.0 platform are designed around an architecture of participation and communal collaboration (Sena, 2009). Individuals are using social websites for communication, collaboration, information sharing, networking, finding ‘lost’ friends and forming communities. Although business organisations are also resorting to social web sites for advertising, marketing and engaging employees (Singh, Davison, & Wickramasinghe, 2010) the focus of this paper is on ‘social’ user issues and characteristics of social networking. Web 2.0 based social networking sites are in very widespread use with new ones emerging almost every day. It is proposed to identify the most popular sites (each with over 30 million users) and determine their ‘dimensions’ of networking and communication. These are noted in Table 1. Adoption of social web sites by individuals is so significant that users of these sites range from 30 million on MyHeritage to 500 million on Facebook (Table 1). The growing number of users indicates the importance of social websites and their relevance to society. Due to social websites being so widely adopted in a very short period of time, and accessible on a variety of platforms including PCs, mobile phones, laptops and other ubiquitous technology (Turban, Lee, King, Liang, & Turban, 2010) it is considered essential to explore key components of social networking that are making them so prevalent. Although there are numerous publications on one or more aspect of Web 2.0 technologies, significant earlier studies on this topic are focused on its taxonomy (Kim, Jeong, & Lee, 2010), definition, history and scholarship (Boyd, 2006) risk, trust and privacy concerns (Fogel & Nehmad, 2009), changes in user behaviour (Patchin & Hinduja, 2010), self disclosure model (Krasnova, Spiekermann, Korolevu, & Hidebrand, 2010; Posey, Lowry, Roberts, & Ellis, 2010), and impact on business environment (Sena, 2009; Singh, Davison, & Wickramasinghe, 2010). A generic consideration and understanding of why they are so widely used, what is the content shared on it, who are the users, where is it used, in which time zones they can be used and how do they support communication are not known. This paper is an attempt to highlight the reasons for such fervent use of social networking sites, the content shared on these sites, potential participants, temporal aspects of communication, as well the linguistic elements of social networking by critically reviewing the extant literature. We structure the extant literature in the following section under purpose, content, participants, technology, time and linguistic elements to establish the components of social websites and their increased adoption around the world. This enables an understanding of the wide use of social websites as a communication and collaboration tool, the content shared, who the users of this media are, the mode of use, the linguistics elements involved and issues for future research.	bruce ellis;david b. fogel;entity;laptop;mobile phone;network theory;relevance;social media;social network;web 2.0;world wide web	Mohini Singh;Yogesh Kumar Dwivedi;Ray Hackney;Konrad Janusz Peszynski	2012	IJANTTI	10.4018/jantti.2012010104	social web;public relations;global information system;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;social network	HCI	-82.50423206379922	-15.568929154870341	146822

This paper describes a model of patients' peer-to-peer engagement, based upon qualitative studies of three patient or carer groups searching for online information and advice from their health peers. We describe a three-phase process through which patients engage with peer experience (PEx). In phase I (gating) patients determine the suitability and trustworthiness of the material they encounter; in phase II (engagement) they search out information, support and/or advice from others with similar or relevant experience; and in phase III (evaluation) they make judgments about the costs and benefits of engaging with particular websites in the longer term. This model provides a useful framework for understanding web based interactions in different patient groups.	in-phase and quadrature components;interaction;peer-to-peer;trust (emotion)	Elizabeth Sillence;Claire Hardy;Peter R.

3e9059740ca3c54b213b3f70e91a503afaa271af	examining the alternative media ecosystem through the production of alternative narratives of mass shooting events on twitter		This research explores the alternative media ecosystem through a Twitter lens. Over a ten-month period, we collected tweets related to alternative narratives—e.g. conspiracy theories—of mass shooting events. We utilized tweeted URLs to generate a domain network, connecting domains shared by the same user, then conducted qualitative analysis to understand the nature of different domains and how they connect to each other. Our findings demonstrate how alternative news sites propagate and shape alternative narratives, while mainstream media deny them. We explain how political leanings of alternative news sites do not align well with a U.S. left-right spectrum, but instead feature an antiglobalist (vs. globalist) orientation where U.S. Alt-Right sites look similar to U.S. Alt-Left sites. Our findings describe a subsection of the emerging alternative media ecosystem and provide insight in how websites that promote conspiracy theories and pseudo-science may function to conduct underlying political agendas.	align (company);ecosystem;media ecology;theory	Kate Starbird	2017			alternative media;internet privacy;computer science;ecosystem;narrative;multimedia	Web+IR	-81.81014418854296	-15.581905386364527	147019

Many devices and systems that could relieve the suffering of the global poor have been understood for centuries, but a major challenge of our generation is to adapt and disseminate them for sustainable and socially just development. Technology Seeding (TS) is here proposed as a design and dissemination methodology to answer that challenge. It is defined as: development by the transfer and participatory adaptation of appropriate proven conceptual designs. Key characteristics include the building of technology from first principles, local adaptation, and self-propagation, and it draws upon appropriate design, technology transfer, and development scholarship. By way of analogy, scientific principles are like the genetic material of a seed, and engineering principles the seed itself. Simple devices and systems are like seedlings, and increasingly completed technologies like increasingly complex and mature plants. Technology Seeding, in contrast to most current methods, promotes the transfer of technology at an appropriately basic level - seeds rather than mature plants -- and enables end users to cultivate them to their own social ends. It will be shown that in comparison with competing models, has the potential to fill a gap in sustainable long-term development. A technology-for-development project led by the authors, Lathes For Africa (LFA), was important source material for developing the formalized TS methodology. Despite excellent wood craft skills, the daily income for fundi is limited to daily net income of $2 - $5, often insufficient for them and their families to live comfortably or to save. Through participatory design with 30  fundi, a human-powered design costing less than 5% ofcommercial cost was implemented. Without further intervention, some of the actors in Tanzania have built an improved lathe for income and education.	norm (social);seed;software propagation	Alexander J.

Taking into consideration that the market is being saturated and revenue from new subscriptions is increasingly deteriorating, mobile carriers tend to focus on customer service and high levels of customer satisfaction in order to retain customers and maintain a low churn rate. In this context, it is a matter of critical importance to be able to measure the overall customer satisfaction level, by explicitly or implicitly mining the public opinion towards this end. In this paper, we argue that online social media can be exploited as a proxy to infer customer satisfaction through the utilization of automated, machine-learning based sentiment analysis techniques. Our work focuses on the two leading mobile broadband carriers located in the broader North American area, AT&T and Verizon, by analysing tweets fetched during a 15-day period within February 2013, to assess relative customer satisfaction degrees. The validity of our approach is justified through comparison against surveys conducted during 2012 from Forrester and Vocalabs in terms of customer satisfaction on the overall brand usage experience.	benchmark (computing);mined;norm (social);online and offline;real-time transcription;sentiment analysis;social media	Demitrios Pournarakis;Dionisios N.

Based on homophily theory, we expected dolescent ultilevel p2 model urope similar opinions, leisure activities, religion, risk behaviour and socioeconomic factors to (partly) explain ethnic ingroup preferences. Multilevel p2 models on 13,272 pupils in 625 secondary school classes in England, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden showed that adolescents tend to have friends similar in ethnicity, cultural and socioeconomic characteristics. We find no evidence, however, that ethnic homophily is explained by cultural and socioeconomic homophily. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These communities can be simultaneously social and commercial, organization sponsored and heavily relying on member interaction. We explore modding behavior that allows members to evaluate other members' contributions both with numerical value and qualitative rating. We show that approximately half of all members received mods on their comments, that the majority of mods given were positive, and that the amount of mods received for a comment was related to the position of the comment in the community website's thread. Contributing to the emerging literature of social network sites and virtual communities, we discuss implications for theory, future research and management.	modding;virtual community	Stefan Haefliger;Philip Reichen;Peter M.

GitHub supports version-controlled code sharing and social-networking functionalities and Stack Overflow is a social forum for question answering on programming topics. Motivated by the features' overlap of the two networks, we set out to mine and analyze and correlate the members' core contributions, editorial activities and influence in the two networks. We aim to better understand the similarities and differences of the members' contributions in the two platforms and their evolution over time. In this context, while studying the activities of different user groups, we conducted a three-step investigation of GitHub activity, Stack Overflow activity and inter-network activity over a five-year period. We report our findings on interesting membership and activity patterns within each platform and some relations between the two.	stack overflow	Ali Sajedi Badashian;Afsaneh Esteki;Ameneh Gholipour;Abram Hindle;Eleni Stroulia	2014			computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;machine learning;time series;data mining;database;world wide web;statistics	SE	-81.29095582126834	-19.881902187263158	148122

A between-participants experiment of 458 college students confirmed the formation of more positive attitudes toward a product review website when an expert rather than a computer/website served as the source of product review information, specifically when the expert source was accompanied by a rating of four stars vs. one star. A product review authored by other users also induced more favorable attitudes toward the website when it was presented with a higher level of star ratings than a lower one. The study also revealed perceived authority and bandwagon heuristics mediated the relationship between the presence of social plugins and favorable attitudes toward the website via credibility perceptions. Findings not only underscored the power of the authority and bandwagon cues when users make quick judgments on product review sites but also discovered a theoretical path that explained the role of social plugins—a seal of credibility—on e-commerce sites. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed for designing information-based websites. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2b16a1df869403b519ddb31ccc3de34d8d403dd7	weak signals as predictors of real-world phenomena in social media	london riots;forecasting;weak signals;market research;semantics;media;content analysis;sentiment analysis;predictive models;collective action;twitter;social media;early detection	Global and national events in recent years have shown that online social media can be a force for good (e.g., Arab Spring) and harm (e.g., the London riots). In both of these examples, social media played a key role in group formation and organization, and in the coordination of the group's subsequent collective actions (i.e., the move from rhetoric to action). Surprisingly, despite its clear importance, little is understood about the factors that lead to this kind of group development and the transition to collective action. This paper focuses on an approach to the analysis of data from social media to detect weak signals, i.e., indicators that initially appear at the fringes, but are, in fact, early indicators of such large-scale real-world phenomena. Our approach is in contrast to existing research which focuses on analysing major themes, i.e., the strong signals, prevalent in a social network at a particular point in time. Analysis of weak signals can provide interesting possibilities for forecasting, with online user-generated content being used to identify and anticipate possible offline future events. We demonstrate our approach through analysis of tweets collected during the London riots in 2011 and use of our weak signals to predict tipping points in that context.	online and offline;social media;social network;theme (computing);user-generated content	Christos Charitonidis;Awais Rashid;Paul J.

This paper develops and presents a theory for designing effective online civic engagement systems. The theory draws from several decades of work in the group support systems literature as well as the historical context of civic engagement in the United States to identify seven key dynamics (the kernel) to address and include when designing such systems. These seven dynamics include five focusing on promoting individual-level interaction: authentication, authorization, masking, interests, and expertise. Two focus on group-level interaction: local access and timeliness. The author analyzes existing systems in light of these seven dynamics and identifies two additional design accommodations that would specifically promote youth engagement.

This study examined the claim of democracy in computer-mediated communication with regard to amount of participation and communicative style of genders and the effect of topic of discussion on these aspects. To this aim, 300 randomlychosen messages from two listservs (language testing and taxonomy) were coded for the number of female and male participants, frequency and length of messages, frequency of new topics, frequency of responses to each topic type and to the same and cross gender topics, stylistic features of females’ and males’ language, and frequency of flaming. For each aspect of analysis, v statistical test was applied to examine the significance of the differences between genders in and across the lists. The results indicated that given the amount of participation, the democracy claim was breached as male dominance and presence was more ubiquitous. However, the results supported the provision of a democratic platform as far as manner of participation is concerned since both genders presented common communicative needs and priorities and there was no support for differentiation of genders’ communicative styles. The findings promise implications for EFL/ESL education. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

User perceptions of the quality of information accessed through the internet and through more traditional sources of information may shift over time as the underlying social, cultural, and political environment changes. This study reports the results of a longitudinal survey study of perceptions of information quality of young adults using the internet in China. Results suggest that perceptions of the information quality of internet-based information have shifted more from 2007 to 2012 than perceptions of traditional text sources of information.

We conducted an interpretive study that examines a particular community blog, MetaFilter, by drawing on the concepts of communities of practice as a theoretical lens. Theoretically, we contribute to the body of knowledge of online communities by identifying the structures of an emergent type of community that is brought together by blog technology. Our findings suggest that cohesion in a community blog is brought about by the following practices: (a) explicit ground rules regarding membership, (b) presence of moderators, (c) availability of profile information, (d) ‘net etiquette’, (e) tacit warrants for discerning pertinent posts, and (f) the deployment of specific techniques of discipline.	blog;emergence;emoticon;metafilter;online community;relevance;software deployment	Leiser Silva;Lakshmi Goel;Elham Mousavidin	2009	Inf.

This study examines the efficacy of different types of service channels in customer complaint handling. The theoretical framework, developed using complaint handling and social media literature, is tested against data collected from two different channels (hotline and social media) of a German telecommunication service provider. We contribute to the understanding of firm’s multichannel distribution strategy in two ways: a) by conceptualizing and evaluating complaint handling quality across traditional and social media channels, and b) by testing the impact of complaint handling quality on key performance outcomes like customer loyalty, positive word-of-mouth, and cross-purchase intentions.	emoticon;online service provider;social media	Alexander Rossmann;Gerald Stei	2015			hotline;digital transformation;business;social media;marketing;public relations;communication channel	HCI	-87.9785971444683	-11.394028880229758	149241

We find that television advertising for financial services brands increases both the number of related Google searches and searchers’ tendency to use branded keywords in place of generic keywords. The elasticity of a brand’s total searches with respect to its TV advertising is 0.17, an effect that peaks in the morning. These results suggest that practitioners should account for cross-media effects when planning, executing, and evaluating both television and search advertising campaigns.	elasticity (data store);online search;search advertising;television	Mingyu Joo;Kenneth C.

What triggers fairness in elections? In this article, I aim at emphasizing the Internet's potential in improving the fairness and objectivity of elections. Through a multiple regression analysis with data from> 120 countries across the globe, I establish that there is a rather strong link between higher internet penetration and fairer and more transparent elections in both countries that allow a free press and in countries that do not allow a free press. I can derive both practical and theoretical implications from this finding. More practically, this result highlights that the internet improves access to political news, accommodates pluralistic sources of information, and produces platforms for political discourse; all of which should make the electoral process more transparent. More theoretically the article introduces an additional variable aimed at explaining variation in the fairness of the electoral process; a factor, which should be included in future analyses.	fairness measure;internet;objectivity/db	Daniel Stockemer	2018	Government Information Quarterly	10.1016/j.giq.2017.11.009	economics;public relations;the internet;objectivity (philosophy);electoral integrity;politics	ML	-77.93649279043544	-13.990729937070794	149479

Therefore, this paper proposed the communication model of interactive advertising and drawn two related important conclusions, interactivity has brought positive effect to advertising communication, different type of consumers tend to use different interactive options in different ways. Furthermore, this paper also presented three related optimization strategies to improving the communication of interactive advertising, namely, 1.changing communication model from one-way to two-way, 2.renovating new communication process and effect-generated path, 3.renovating new strategy portfolio to improving the communication effect of interactive advertising.	exploratory testing;interactive advertising;interactivity;mathematical optimization;new media;one-way function	Wanxing Ding	2016	CoRR	10.5121/ijma.2016.8102	advertising campaign;advertising research;native advertising;computer science;multimedia	HCI	-83.50746796680276	-12.357967689475773	149650
cee7d1b2b04364128db6f6ab6cd347782b0bdf9c	types of fantasy sports users and their motivations		Over 15 million people participate in online fantasy sports. Applying a uses and gratifications framework, we use Q-methodology, a quantitative means for developing typologies of people, to examine types of online fantasy sports users and their motivations. Five types of players emerged, with casual players, skilled players, and isolationist thrill-seekers being the three most common types. Differences among types of users were primarily associated with two motivations—arousal and surveillance—while entertainment, escape, and social interaction motivations were judged to be less important. The minimal importance of social interaction to fantasy sports users in this study was unexpected, based on previous research, and implies that not all online communities build or maintain relationships.

Research on Social Networking Games (SNGs) often focuses on the “social” aspects—how this newer style of games engenders social relationships from disparate locations. This essay examines the genre of gaming in terms of their industry category, “Invest/Express Games.” Using the Invest/Express label as a means of rethinking the role of interstitial time, this essay proposes that the gaming style taps in to what can be understood as “feminine leisure style.” In many ways, the significance of Invest/Express embodies a shift toward a feminization of popular video games.	interstitial webpage	Shira Chess	2018	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444816660729	simulation;marketing;multimedia;advertising;world wide web	HCI	-85.03691918539063	-15.464959334594331	150217
777e189ae66add135203ec1d30d3081bdba3aea0	understanding the determinants and dynamic process of user exodus in social networking sites: evidence from kaixin001		Understanding the factors and mechanism that affect the usersâ€™ abandon behaviors is necessary for the sustained use of Social Networking Sites (SNSs). This study focuses on a special SNS discontinuance phenomenonâ€”user exodus. Compared to individual discontinuance behavior studied in prior research, the SNS user exodus possesses its own characteristics: a huge magnitude of users abandon a given SNS product in a very short time. Given the fatal blow of exodus to SNS providers, this exploratory research seeks to unravel why and how the SNS user exodus occurs. Specifically, we conducted a mixedâ€ method research combining laddering interview and network analysis. Drawing on the meansâ€ end chain theory, laddering interviews were first used to collect data from discontinuers of a Chinese SNS, Kaixin001, which has experienced a severe user dropout. Then we identified various factors triggering user exodus by content analysis. Last, network analysis was employed to establish the connections between various attributes, consequences, and values. The results showed that user exodus in SNS is strongly related to three types of value: functional, affective, and social value. More important, we also emphasized the dynamics process of exodus by highlighting the role of lurking. Possible contributions and implications of our findings are discussed.	exodus	Yuxiang Zhao;Xiaojuan Xu;Xixian Peng;Shijie Song	2018	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23974	laddering;exploratory research;computer science;affect (psychology);content analysis;knowledge management;social network	HCI	-88.12612497300496	-12.975949925200323	150277

The reason for this research is the lack of focused qualitative studies or extensive investigations in this area. Against this backdrop, we developed a research to expand the knowledge on the subject, and the reality of what and how that is translated in the PPR’s performed in the PL’s. We seek to assess concepts and discourses that frame the promotion of reading; identify and characterize dominant or singular developed PPR; know the role of mediation and participants in these PPR; know the assessment given by librarians about the PPR that they promoted. This seems relevant in a time global transformation, where the domain of the practice and uses of reading and skills in various literacies are compelling and cross needs in a culture of information context.

4d337c92c374b0de1593ed177430f7b09a2960f7	methical jane: perspectives on an undisclosed virtual student		We examined the ethical implications of a mythical online student with a carefully concealed real identity who took part in an online post-graduate course. The mythical online student took part in all student activities and provided co-students with cognitive and technical support as a covert second facilitator; consequently, students found scaffolding unobtrusive and integrated the unknown virtual student into the learning community. We explored the ethical implication of undisclosed identity and analyzed students' reaction to the disclosure of the mythical student after the course. The study confirmed our success in creating a convincing virtual student, but this success precipitated some shock, disbelief, and dismay. Most students accepted the presence of a virtual student, but some felt betrayed because her real identity was hidden. Recommendations for implementing such a virtual tool ethically are advanced, along with suggestions for teaching situations that may benefit from its use.	jane (software);recommender system;technical support;unobtrusive javascript	Lynette Nagel;Seugnet Blignaut;Johannes C.

This growth has increased the concern about data protection and personal privacy of users. Facebook, in particular, is a social network of researchers' interest by having a large number of users worldwide. In this study, we applied a set of 08 methods and assessment tools empirical and analytical for evaluating aspects of privacy from the perspective of usability, accessibility and emotional responses of users. The results of applying these methods and instruments provided evidence that users face problems of usability and accessibility in performing tasks related to privacy on Facebook, which produces a direct impact on the emotional responses of the interaction.	usability	Kamila R.

However, literature on open source suggests a complex social structure underlying the meritocracy. Social work environments such as GitHub make the relationships between users and between users and work artifacts transparent. This transparency enables developers to better use information such as technical value and social connections when making work decisions. We present a study on open source software contribution in GitHub that focuses on the task of evaluating pull requests, which are one of the primary methods for contributing code in GitHub. We analyzed the association of various technical and social measures with the likelihood of contribution acceptance. We found that project managers made use of information signaling both good technical contribution practices for a pull request and the strength of the social connection between the submitter and project manager when evaluating pull requests. Pull requests with many comments were much less likely to be accepted, moderated by the submitter's prior interaction in the project. Well-established projects were more conservative in accepting pull requests. These findings provide evidence that developers use both technical and social information when evaluating potential contributions to open source software projects.	distributed version control;open-source software;social structure	Jason Tsay;Laura A.

We interviewed 13 veterans who were re-integrating into civil society. Veterans are unique in that they experience several transitions at once-that is, after returning home, they often suffer from PTSD, become homeless, change occupations, etc. Amongst other things, veterans often undergo identity crises as caused by the lack of continuity between military and civilian social structures. We show how veterans are resilient through their uses of ICTs when navigating identity crises. We find that they use ICTs to develop identity awareness-that is, they connect with a human infrastructure through which they can develop a """"big picture"""" understanding of unfamiliar rules and norms and receive support when navigating civil society.

One would have to distinguish at least substitutable and fundamental references. A supposed correlation between peer review assessments and citation counts is conceptually problematic, because peer review includes objective as well as subjective considerations (convictions). With refined methods, however, a differential citation analysis might be able in the future to answer if a given article did or did not have positive cognitive impact on subsequent research.	advance directive - proxy;citation analysis;evaluation procedure;peer review;proxy server;scientific literature	Martin Ricker	2017		10.1007/s11192-017-2374-2	computer science;data mining;operations research;citation analysis;world wide web;information retrieval	Web+IR	-77.99776615823018	-21.17007308420497	150945

At the same time, increased use of interactive web and social media technologies as well as the integration with online social networking platforms suggests that citizens have unprecedented access to government representatives. In this paper, we report results from an exploratory usability study involving average young adults in an engagement task. More precisely, we observed college students while they searched for appropriate online contact points with the federal government to communicate concerns related to various problem domains. We report a mixture of quantitative and qualitative results including an analysis of post-study interviews with the participants. Less than 30% of our subjects were able to accomplish the objective of the given task scenarios. We find that a combination of individual and institutional factors limit participants. In addition, we do not observe a significant utilization of cues related to online social networking tools. We attribute this finding to a still limited acceptance of such communication tools for political participation by average young adults.	web 2.0	Frank Bridges;Lora Appel;Jens Grossklags	2012	Information Polity	10.3233/IP-2012-0271	public relations;political science;multimedia;social psychology;online participation	HCI	-88.14688886364911	-16.390191486614057	151145

Many of initiatives also deal with the quality of life (QoL) of those persons and discuss possible impacts of ICT use on that quality. By comparing persons with and without disabilities, this study examined the extent to which (1) individuals used IC-based technologies, (2) their QoL was improved due to the use of those technologies, and (3) this use (USE) was related to that QoL improvement (IQoL). It was found that both USE and IQoL were lower for persons with disabilities, and that correlation between USE and IQoL was stronger for those persons. The study examines the role of education and its potential to improve the QoL for persons with disabilities as a result of better use of ICTs.

In contrast to the existing metrics such as Bibliometrics, Altmetrics or Webometrics, which are based on measuring the number of interactions in the scholarly network, Semantometrics build on the premise that full-text is needed to understand scholarly publication networks and the value of publications. Up to date many studies of scientific citation, collaboration and coauthorship networks have focused on the concept of cross-community ties (Shi et al., 2010; Guimerà et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2014). It has been observed that in citation networks, bridging or cross-community citation patterns are characteristic for high impact papers (Shi et al., 2010). This is likely due to the fact that such patterns have the potential of linking knowledge and people from different disciplines. Likewise, in collaboration and coauthorship networks, it has been shown that newcomers in a group of collaborators can increase the impact of the group (Guimerà et al., 2005). The studies up to date have been focusing on analysing citation and collaboration networks without considering the content of the analysed publications. Our work has focused on analysing scholarly networks using semantic distance of the publications in order to gain insight into the characteristics of collaboration and communication within communities. Our hypothesis states that the information about the semantic distance of the communities will allow us to better understand the importance and the types of the cross-community ties (bridges). More specifically, in order to gain insight into the type of collaboration between authors we are currently investigating the possibility of utilising semantic distance in a coauthorship network together with the concept of research endogamy. In social sciences, endogamy is the practice or tendency of marrying within a social group. This concept can be transferred to research as collaboration with the same authors or collaboration among a group of authors. The concept of research endogamy has been previously used to evaluate conferences (Montolio et al., 2013) as well as journals and patents (Silva et al., 2014). Furthermore, in (Knoth & Herrmannova, 2014) we have introduced and tested the first Semantometric measure which we call contribution(p) and which can be used to estimate research publication contribution. Our results suggested that measuring semantic similarity of publications can be utilised to provide meaningful information about the value of a research publication, which is not captured by traditional bibliometric measures.	altmetrics;bibliometrics;bridging (networking);citation graph;interaction;scientific citation;semantic similarity;semantometrics;webometrics;word lists by frequency	Drahomira Herrmannova;Petr Knoth	2015				AI	-78.21137540199985	-18.869230089938068	151272

Several metrics such as h-index or journal impact factor (JIF) are often used as a means to assess whether an author, article, or journal creates an """"impact"""" on science. Unfortunately, external forces can be used to manipulate these metrics thereby diluting the value of their intended, original purpose. This work highlights these issues and the need to more clearly define """"impact"""" as well as emphasize the need for better metrics that leverage full content analysis of publications."""

Extending theoretical understanding of HMP, this study has two purposes: (a) to examine the roles of different types of involvement in hostile media effect (HME), that is, value-relevant and outcome-relevant involvement, and (b) to explore relationships between HMP and other media-related perceptions, such as congruency of perceived media influence, media skepticism, and perceived opinion climate. Data were collected from college students in South Korea. Results suggest that value-relevant involvement, rather than outcome-relevant involvement, is a critical predictor of HMP in the context of news coverage of the National Security Law in Korea. HMP also was a significant predictor of congruency of presumed media influence, which in turn predicted perceived opinion climate.

It was here the U.S. Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. To write about the use of information and communication technology and democracy requires not a hyper-speed view that everything will change in the next two years, but rather it is the principles we establish and the actions we take that will set the course for the next 200 years of democracy in the information age. We must ask ourselves: Do we want to build the Internet into the very nature our many democracies? Or will we maintain the default course where democracy is a burdensome add-on and side application that happens to run on the Internet? Just as we spend time and resources to make the Internet safe for e-commerce, shouldn’t we do the same for e-democracy? Back in 1994, I thought I had invented the term “e-democracy.” I was into democracy, email, and Minnesota politics. That election year a group of volunteers created Minnesota E-Democracy, the world’s first electionoriented Web site. In recent years I discovered an article from 1987 that used the term, but the point is that citizens spontaneously built something new on top of one of the most important institutions of humankind— democracy. We rolled up our sleeves and did the work required to move beyond the hype toward real results. While I continue to volunteer with Minnesota EDemocracy, I am also involved in the “convergence of democracy and the Internet” around the world through my Democracies Online effort. I recognize that the social, political, and economic differences in countries, even communities around the world result in many different democracies. Despite these dynamic differences, forms of representation and public decision-making are pulling the Internet and other information and communication technologies into the heart of what they do. However, from parliaments and local councils to civil society and media groups, the sectors of democracy are primarily focused on the end applications and not the fundamental infrastructure of the Internet. We need a generation of civic technologists who engage the fundamental infrastructure of the Internet and standards processes in the public interest. We need talented people with an eye toward making the Internet a democracy network by nature. Just as hypertext transfer protocols and mark-up languages enable free speech, what standards could assist electronic free association or geographically based Internet content navigation? Meaningful online speech only seems to occur where people can form sustained audiences or within active online communities. Real democracy is also fundamentally based on geography, yet Web sites are incredibly difficult to navigate and search, making it difficult for people to find information relevant to local community issues. As I have tracked the Internet Engineering Task Force and other technical groups, it is clear that you must have “standing” to contribute or influence these technical meritocracies. It is not enough to believe something should be done and there is no expectation that anyone has a right of representation. Those who want an Internet that works naturally in the public interest and democracy must be engaged with merit in both the development and promotion of Internet standards. We need civic-minded technologists who not only encourage technical developments but also take a lead in developing technical solutions and applications to gain respect, acceptance, and power within the Internet’s meritocracy. We need to not only state the justification for a standard or open-source solution, but also write and code solutions that make our technical goals a reality.

This study fills several research gaps by comparing query results (N = 6320) from China’s two leading search engines, Baidu and Google, focusing on accessibility, overlap, ranking, and bias patterns. Analysis of query results of 316 popular Chinese Internet events reveals the following: (1) after Google moved its servers from Mainland China to Hong Kong, its results are equally if not more likely to be inaccessible than Baidu’s, and Baidu’s filtering is much subtler than the Great Firewall’s wholesale blocking of Google’s results; (2) there is low overlap (6.8%) and little ranking similarity between Baidu’s and Google’s results, implying different search engines, different results and different social realities; and (3) Baidu rarely links to its competitors Hudong Baike or Chinese Wikipedia, while their presence in Google’s results is much more prominent, raising search bi...	web search engine	Min Jiang	2014	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444813481196	ethics;search engine optimization;ranking;bias;sociology;advertising;internet privacy;law;world wide web;china;search engine	Web+IR	-80.59284447086664	-19.15784116632583	152099

Already the institutional level requires the application of more sophisticated techniques than customary in evaluation of national research performance. In this study institutional profile clusters are used to examine which level of the hierarchical subject-classification should preferably be used to build subject-normalised citation indicators. It is shown that a set of properly normalised indicators can serve as a basis of comparative assessment within and even among different clusters, provided that their profiles still overlap and such comparison is thus meaningful. On the basis of 24 selected European universities, a new version of relational charts is presented for the comparative assessment of citation impact.	benchmark (computing);bibliometrics;chart;comparison and contrast of classification schemes in linguistics and metadata;critical mass (sociodynamics);database normalization;mesoscopic physics;qualitative comparative analysis;scientometrics;window function	Wolfgang Glänzel;Bart Thijs;András Schubert;Koenraad Debackere	2008	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-008-2109-5	computer science;data mining;management science;operations research	Web+IR	-77.6217815117211	-21.732327075651583	152298

Traditional macro-payment methods, like credit and charge cards and digital currency, are suitable for large-value, low-volume transactions. However, large-volume, lowvalue commodities, such as discrete units of information from a web site, better-suit a micropayment model. In micro-payment, customers pay for large numbers of small value goods (e.g. per-web page view) with “e-coins”, typically of very small value each. We have carried out an empirical assessment of micro-payment and macro-payment purchasing models for an on-line newspaper application. We report on the design of our experiment, the two kinds of micropayment (client and server-side e-wallets) used, and customer feedback. We also carried out an assessment of customer effort and economic trade-off when using these services and compare the results of this assessment to a survey of customers using each system. We present directions for further on-line payment research aiming to improve the overall satisfaction and efficiency of payment models for end-users.	application server;database;digital currency;digital wallet;e-commerce payment system;micropayment;online and offline;page view;prototype;purchasing;server (computing);server-side;thin client;units of information;web page	Xiaoling Dai;John C.

bae1fca41a7ccbca810d0a12b97d09a4cfcd98c1	"""slowing the meatgrinder: reducing """"burnout"""" and increasing job satisfaction in user services"""	job satisfaction	Are unyielding stress and quick burnout inevitable features of a position in front-line user services? Several features of the support encounter guarantee high levels of stress, including time pressures, uncontrolled interruptions, and an ever-increasing customer base. Relations with other departments within the computing service apparatus can also be problematic. The low status often associated with customer support positions contributes to burnout and rapid turnover. Support managers sometimes fall victim to prevailing institutional attitudes, and begin to see their staff positions as stepping stones to “real” jobs. Helpful strategies do exist. One class of interventions attempts to bolster the “personal resources” of support staff. Some of these include suggestions as simple as showing appreciation for good work. Others require new attitudes on the part of department managers to empower staff members with greater discretion, and include them in the decision making process, rather than simply on implementation. Opportunities for professional growth are important. So, too, are efforts to improve the perceived status of the user support function and enhance interdepartmental cohesiveness. Instrumental “departmental resources” are also part of the arsenal to fight burnout. For example, implementing highly functional problem-tracking systems can leverage staff time. Help desks are useful as well. Inter-departmental procedures need also to be examined. Clear departmental policies and priorities—preferable enumerated in a public document—are vital. Finally, top management must understand the importance of an effective user support team. INTRODUCTION It’s difficult to ignore the problems that plague academic computing user services.

5c98f1dec6c97296407b8d39d6946663b87eaade	what online reviewer behaviors really matter? effects of verbal and nonverbal behaviors on detection of fake online reviews		AbstractThe value and credibility of online consumer reviews are compromised by significantly increasing yet difficult-to-identify fake reviews. Extant models for automated online fake review detection rely heavily on verbal behaviors of reviewers while largely ignoring their nonverbal behaviors. This research identifies a variety of nonverbal behavioral features of online reviewers and examines their relative importance for the detection of fake reviews in comparison to that of verbal behavioral features. The results of an empirical evaluation using real-world online reviews reveal that incorporating nonverbal features of reviewers can significantly improve the performance of online fake review detection models. Moreover, compared with verbal features, nonverbal features of reviewers are shown to be more important for fake review detection. Furthermore, model pruning based on a sensitivity analysis improves the parsimony of the developed fake review detection model without sacrificing its performance.

The findings suggest that fear appeals and point of reference collectively influence users' perceived persuasiveness of the IT security communication messages. Specifically, higher fear messages are generally more persuasive than low fear ones when the messages are self-referenced. However, in other-referenced messages, the levels of fear appeals do not make differences. Further, our results indicate that users regard IT security issues as peripheral for them and it is suggested that personalized IT security communications might have greater potential in successfully persuading end users for security compliance.	computer security;experiment;peripheral;personalization	Honglu Du;Heng Xu;Mary Beth Rosson;John M.

However, scholarly works regarding location-based advertising are still few and far between. This study examines the significance of association between format of advertisement, product involvement, privacy, and brand credibility and consumers’ attitudes towards the location-based advertising. The relationship between attitudes towards the location-based advertising and attitudes towards brands is also investigated. The experimental design with web surveys was conducted on 464 staff members of MobiCom Corporation, the largest mobile phone operator in Mongolia. Results show that animated location-based advertising, less personal information embedded advertisement message and foreign-brand products advertised through location-based advertising are significant contributors to a positive attitude towards locationbased advertising. Moreover, there is a statistically significant relationship between attitude towards the location-based advertising and attitude towards brands. The implications of the findings are provided.	design of experiments;embedded system;location-based service;mobile phone;personally identifiable information	Jengchung V. Chen;Bo-chiuan Su;David C.

People are often not adequately cautious with the disclosure of their personal information in digital contexts and may make poor decisions to reveal private information. Warnings reduce unnecessary information exposure, but the effectiveness may depend on source credibility and expertise on influencing risk perceptions and attitudes. The warnings must be designed for users acting in a digital context. The current research was conducted to determine whether adding a trustworthy and expert source to a message that warned individuals not to disclose their personal information would impact decisions to disclose. First, a survey (pilot study) was conducted to identify the source considered the most trustworthy (among Google, FBI Cyber Division, and Department of Justice) and competent with respect to online security. Google received the highest ratings. In a later experiment, warnings with sources did reduce the extent of disclosure, with the FBI Cyber Division (not Google) being the most effective source. The results indicate that warnings need to be tested with respect to the actual target behavior (in this case, disclosure), rather than relying on individuals’ perceptions of trust, risk, or influence of a warning message when designing effective warnings.	digital identity;fbi cyber division;personally identifiable information;trust (emotion)	Sandra Carpenter;Feng Zhu;Mini Zeng;Michael Shreeves	2017	Int.

The existence of the phenomenon has been studied in many fields, such as for social networks and especially for a variety of forums and online communities. This paper questions its existence in the context of sensitive data, and more specific in the health data area via a survey which took place in Greece. Given that health-related information is perceived as sensitive personal data it is often excluded from discussions and sharing. This research aims to unravel the paradox’s existence regarding the disclosure of health data information when individuals visit related online forums and communities.	epr paradox;internet privacy;online community;personally identifiable information;social network	Chrysanthi Kosyfaki;Nelina P.

Facebook provides brand or business fan page for business to recruit fans and build direct and interactive communication means with them. Despite major brands have created their respective fan page and have drawn substantial amount of users, relatively little attention has been devoted in exploring factors that affect users’ intention to engage with the brand fan page. To fill this research gap, this study proposed a framework to look into this phenomenon. A preliminary collected data was analyzed using PLS. Results suggested that relationship quality is an influential factors of users’ usage. Moreover, both utilitarian and hedonic value should be considered for brand fan page to maintain high quality relationship with their fans.	display resolution;fansite;partial least squares regression	Shu-ming Wang	2013			information quality;computer science;advertising;exploit;marketing;social media;phenomenon	HCI	-87.5111810685246	-12.94094616155086	153521

It was found that among the institutions with the largest output in terms of published research articles, private firms are underrepresented, whereas in the top quartile of institutions with the largest citation impact firms are overrepresented. A firm’s publication output is not a good indicator of its R&D investment: big firms in Pharmaceutics are both heavy investors in R&D and frequent publishers of scientific articles, whereas in Automobiles firms tend to invest heavily in R&D but their publication output is low. This is ascribed to the fact that the former need a validation of their results by the scientific community, while the latter do less so. Private institutions generating the largest citation impact tend to collaborate with the best public research institutions. This reflects the crucial importance of publicly funded research for the private sector.	bibliometrics;scientific literature	Félix de Moya Anegón;Carmen López-Illescas;Henk F.

We study the factors that affect continued user participation in the context of educational Twitter chats. To predict whether a user that attended her first session in a particular Twitter chat group will return to the group, we build 5F Model that captures five different factors: individual initiative, group characteristics, perceived receptivity, linguistic affinity and geographical proximity. Through statistical data analysis of thirty Twitter chats over a two year period as well as a survey study, our work provides many insights about group dynamics in Twitter chats. We show similarities between Twitter chats and traditional groups such as the importance of social inclusion and linguistic similarity while also identifying important distinctions such as the insignificance of geographical proximity. We also show that informational support is more important than emotional support in educational Twitter chats, but this does not reduce the sense of community as suggested in earlier studies.	affinity analysis	Ceren Budak;Rakesh Agrawal	2013		10.1145/2488388.2488404	computer science;information overload;speech code theory;multimethodology;world wide web;group dynamics	Web+IR	-82.8033729519391	-19.41365024647528	153718

Drawing upon a social semiotic visual analysis of 921 ACTA-related images shared online in 2012, the author analyzes a collective reconstruction of the concept of “piracy” and the popular narrative of the conflict in terms of its sides and subject. The study reveals how anti-ACTA images form a medium of national popular culture adaptation of global popand countercultural modalities. The protesters appropriated them to oppose another attempt at global copyright enforcement. New media became not only the tool and environment for these activities but were also collectively depicted as “the commons,” endangered by the agreement.	new media;semiotics	Jakub Nowak	2016	J.

Considering the possession of hardware, growing divides among different categories of income, employment, education, age, and ethnicity can be proved to have existed in the 1980s and 1990s according to official American and Dutch statistics. If only by effects of saturation, these gaps will more or less close. However, it is shown that differential access of skills and usage is likely to increase. The growth of a usage gap is projected. Multivariate analyses of Dutch official statistics reveal the striking effect of age and gender as compared to education.

The unique feature of our model is that the trust value is derived from the social capital built in the social networks over a period of time. First, we introduce a framework for building trust communities using social trust. We then define an underlying social trust model, called STrust. Finally, we report the current state of the development and the analysis of the proposed trust model.	causality;e-government;experience;online community;social capital;social network	Surya Nepal;Wanita Sherchan;Cécile Paris	2011	2011IEEE 10th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2011.112	public relations;cultural economics;social learning;social competence;social engagement;political science;socioeconomics;social psychology;computational trust;social computing;social network	HCI	-83.57127027684693	-16.08756671450835	154146

Recent studies however show that gender inequality is still present in many scientific practices ranging from hiring to peer review processes and grant applications. While empirical findings highlight that collaborations impact success and gender inequality is present in science, we know little about gender-specific differences in collaboration patterns, how they change over time and how they impact scientific success. In this paper we close this gap by studying gender-differences in dropout rates, productivity and collaboration patterns of more than one million computer scientists over the course of 47 years. We investigate which collaboration patterns are related with scientific success and if these patterns are similar for male and female scientists. Our results highlight that while subtle gender disparities in dropout rates, productivity and collaboration patterns exist, successful male and female scientists reveal the same collaboration patterns: compare with scientists in the same career age, they tend to collaborate with more colleagues than other scientists, establish more long lasting and repetitive collaborations, bring people together that have not been collaborating before and collaborate more with other successful scientists. Collaboration is the core task of any scientific discourse. In the course of a collaboration, new ideas shape and eventually result in new discoveries and scientific publications [24]. As a result, collaborations impact researchers’ scientific career and academic success [29, 28, 36, 37]. For example, previous 1 ar X iv :1 70 4. 05 80 1v 1 [ ph ys ic s. so cph ] 1 9 A pr 2 01 7 research has shown that the centrality of a scientist in a collaboration network is associated with his/her success [36, 37] and co-authorship strength is related to high productivity and citations [28, 29]. At the same time gender inequality is still rife in science, for example, in hiring [25], grant applications [19, 43], peer reviews [26, 10], earnings [9, 47], tenure [39], satisfaction [9], patenting [6], productivity [46, 7], labor division in scientific collaborations [21], internationality of collaborations [15] and scientific success [15]. For example, a report from 2006 showed that only one quarter of full professors are female and they earn 80% of their male colleagues on average [47]. More recent research showed that women are more likely to take executive roles in collaborations [21], their collaborations are more domestically oriented and papers where women are the lead author (i.e. solo author, first author or last author) receive fewer citations [15]. While empirical findings highlight that collaborations impact success and that gender inequalities are present in science in various forms, little is known about gender-specific differences in collaboration patterns and how these differences may impact career success. A mentionable exception is a very recent study that investigated if female and male researchers in science, technology, engineering and mathematical (STEM) disciplines differ in their collaboration patterns [49]. While this work offers interesting insights into the average number of co-authors and strength of collaboration among male and female researchers across various disciplines, it does not analyze the temporal evolution of collaboration patterns across career ages and how different network features relate to scientific success. In this work, we aim to close this gap by presenting an empirical study on the temporal collaboration network of researchers that contribute to the field of computer science and explore which patterns are related with scientific success (measured by number of citations and h-index). We analyze genderdifferences in dropout rates, productivity and collaboration patterns and explore if successful male and female scientists show the same collaboration behavior. This study is conducted over time since the collaboration network as well as the success and productivity of scientists naturally change with career age. We use a panel regression method to explain the relation between the success of scientists at different career ages and various features that characterize their collaboration behavior in the past and their gender. Our results show that (1) the dropout rate of women is consistently higher than the dropout rate of men, especially at the beginning of an academic career (40% of men and 47% of women stop publishing after the year in which they published their first publication); (2) the average productivity of men is higher and the productivity gap is increasing over time.

A total number of 217 respondents (50+) in a southern state were used in this study. Path analysis (PROC CALIS in SAS) was performed to test the proposed model. An estimation of the proposed theoretical model revealed that the model fit the data. However, the model should be further examined and applied with caution. as being “different, diverse and demanding” (Harssel, 1994, p. 376). Faranda and Schmidt (1999) suggest that mature tourism marketers must recognize three critical components: the aging process comprehended from multiple disciplines, the acknowledged “heterogeneity and dynamic nature” of the mature market, and the “necessity for sound segmentation methods” (p. 24). Although some aging-related significant social and demographic changes are well-documented in the tourism literature, the research on mature travelers is limited at best, especially how the aging process can be connected with mature tourism.

Guinn and Vincent (2003) suggest that the trip experience played a significant role in enhancing quality of life. The travel experience has become one of the leisure activity options for older adults as they are more affluent, better educated, and more aware of a healthy lifestyle than their previous generations (Hawkins, May, & Rogers, 1996). Studies have shown that baby boomers will enjoy good health and wealth when they are into their old ago (Roberson, 2003). The relationship between life satisfaction and health status has also been documented. Some of findings about older adults’ lifestyles, mindsets, and well-being show that “people who have higher self-esteem are healthier” (p. 9) and “optimists are healthier and happier” (p. 10) (Moschis & Mathur, 2007). In this study, the measure of quality of life focuses on the self-perceived health and global life satisfaction of mature travelers. Both indicators are subjective, which may reflect and describe older adults’ life quality in general. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of past travel experience (i.e., number of trips and number of days away from home in last year, satisfaction with leisure trips in general) on mature travelers’ quality of life (i.e., self-perceived health and global life satisfaction).	path analysis (statistics);sas;theory	Yawei Wang;Francis A.

Nevertheless, online daters struggle to evaluate personality traits of potential partners using profile pages and private messaging in these systems. Meanwhile, Multiplayer Online Games (MOGs) have emerged as a popular way young people find romantic partners for relationships in the physical world. We conducted two interview studies -- one concerning evaluation behavior in online dating systems (n=41) and the other concerning collaborative activities in MOGs (n=35). Insights from these studies reveal the weaknesses in evaluation tools native to online dating and suggest that collaborative activities could potentially address evaluation challenges in online dating. The paper concludes with a discussion of a series of design concepts for online dating in order to improve users' abilities to evaluate their potential romantic partners for in-person meetings.	personal message	Douglas Zytko;Guo Freeman;Sukeshini A.

Where social issues may often be the driver of such public engagement, increasingly the city and, more specifically, the neighborhood itself have become a central objects connecting their inhabitants through online networks and neighborhood events. Tools and apps for citizen participation then weave together neighborhood stakeholders (e.g. inhabitants, municipal parties and entrepreneurs). This paper zooms in on a sample of 40 such tools that enable and organize bottom-up citizen participation in the city of Amsterdam. Combining a theoretical framework with content analysis, digital methods and data visualization, this paper marks the starting point of a longitudinal analysis of online tools for the urban bottom-up movement.	big data;bottom-up proteomics;data visualization;top-down and bottom-up design	Sabine Niederer;Ruurd Priester	2016	Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)	10.1007/s10606-016-9249-6	public engagement;content analysis;knowledge management;socioeconomics;sociology;management;social psychology;world wide web;anthropology	HCI	-79.12103597945105	-12.990440284249496	154863
5efa9b8a1c78b00ad797d9d62dab37974eeb4e2c	towards global music digital libraries: a cross-cultural comparison on the mood of chinese music		Purpose: This paper compares music mood perceptions of people with diverse cultural backgrounds when they interact with Chinese music. It also discusses how the results can inform the design of global music digital libraries (MDL). Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was designed based on the MIREX five-cluster mood model, to solicit mood perceptions of listeners in Hong Kong and the United States on a diverse set of Chinese music. Statistical analysis was applied to compare responses from the two user groups, with consideration of different music types and characteristics of listeners. Listeners’ textual responses were also analyzed with content coding. Findings: Listeners from the two cultural groups made different mood judgments on all but one type of Chinese music. Hong Kong listeners reached higher levels of agreement on mood judgments than their U.S. counterparts. Gender, age and familiarity with the songs were related to listeners’ mood judgment to some extent. Practical implications: The MIREX five-cluster model may not be sufficient for representing the mood of Chinese music. Refinements are suggested. MDL are recommended to differentiate tags given by users from different cultural groups, and to differentiate music types when classifying or recommending Chinese music by mood. Originality/value: It is the first study on cross-cultural access to Chinese music in MDL. Methods and the refined mood model can be applied to cross-cultural access to other music types and information objects.	digital library;library (computing);mdl (programming language);music visualization;statistical model	Xiao Hu;Jin Ha Lee	2016	Journal of Documentation	10.1108/JD-01-2016-0005	multimedia;music and emotion;social psychology	Web+IR	-83.80126678631588	-20.347200132777587	154991

This close physical interaction is an inherent part of the service experience, is highly individual and thus can hardly be evaluated beforehand. This gives rise to a novel type of service uncertainty that we term as rapport uncertainty. Building on the hierarchical decomposition of service quality, we construct an uncertainty model that encompasses three uncertainty categories consumers face when sharing a resource: rapport, technical, and environment uncertainty. Our empirical study in a ride sharing context reveals that rapport uncertainty differs from other categories of uncertainty and significantly reduces the intention to transact with a service provider. Our findings illustrate how the concept of uncertainty must be extended to reflect the nature of shared service experiences. We suggest that owners of these platforms should actively manage this aspect through platform design.

This research examined the training process, and compared a behavior modeling training program, based on Social Cognitive Theory Bandura [Bandura, A. 1977. Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change. Psych. Rev.842 191--215; Bandura, A. 1978. Reflections on self-efficacy. Adv. Behavioral Res. Therapy1 237--269; Bandura, A. 1982. Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency. Amer. Psychologist372 122--147; Bandura, A. 1986. Social Foundations of Thought and Action. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.], to a more traditional, lecture-based program. According to Social Cognitive Theory, watching others performing a behavior, in this case interacting with a computer system, influences the observers' perceptions of their own ability to perform the behavior, or self-efficacy, and the expected outcomes that they perceive, as well as providing strategies for effective performance. The findings provide only partial support for the research model. Self-efficacy exerted a strong influence on performance in both models. In addition, behavior modeling was found to be more effective than the traditional method for training in Lotus 1-2-3, resulting in higher self-efficacy and higher performance. For WordPerfect, however, modeling did not significantly influence performance. This finding was unexpected, and several possible explanations are explored in the discussion. Of particular surprise were the negative relationships found between outcome expectations and performance. Outcome expectations were expected to positively influence performance, but the results indicated a strong negative effect. Measurement limitations are presented as the most plausible explanation for this result, but further research is necessary to provide conclusive explanations.		Deborah Compeau;Christopher A.

The volume of literature keeps on expanding extremely fast, whilst not all papers contribute equal impact to the academic society. Being aware of potentially influential literature would put one in an advanced position in choosing important research references. Hence, estimation of potential influence is of great significance. We study a challenging problem of identifying potentially influential literature. We examine a set of hypotheses on what are the fundamental characteristics for highly cited papers and find some interesting patterns. Based on these observations, we learn to identify potentially influential literature via Future Influence Prediction (FIP), which aims to estimate the future influence of literature. The system takes a series of features of a particular publication as input and produces as output the estimated citation counts of that article after a given time period. We consider several regression models to formulate the learning process and evaluate their performance based on the coefficient of determination (R2). Experimental results on a real-large data set show a mean average predictive performance of 83.6% measured in R^2. We apply the learned model to the application of bibliography recommendation and obtain prominent performance improvement in terms of Mean Average Precision (MAP).	coefficient of determination;ftc fair information practice;information retrieval;mean squared error;while	Rui Yan;Congrui Huang;Jie Tang;Yan Zhang;Xiaoming Li	2012		10.1145/2232817.2232831	digital library;computer science;artificial intelligence;data science;data mining;world wide web;coefficient of determination;regression analysis	AI	-79.04502793901479	-21.014582253257895	155367

Such sites, which we call """"Just Plain Sites"""" (JPSs), are likely to inadvertently present greater privacy risks than highly popular sites, because they are unable to afford privacy expertise. To assess the prevalence of the privacy risks to which JPSs may inadvertently be exposing their visitors, we examined privacy practices that could be observed by analysis of JPS landing pages. We found that many JPSs collect a great deal of information from their visitors, and share a great deal of information about their visitors with third parties. For example, we found that an average of 7 third party organizations are informed when a user visits a JPS. Many JPSs additionally permit a great deal of tracking of their visitors. For example, we found that third party cookies are used by more than 50% of JPSs. We also found that many JPSs use deprecated or unsafe security practices. Our goal is not to scold JPS operators, but to raise awareness of these facts among both JPS operators and visitors, possibly encouraging operators to take greater care in their implementations, and visitors to take greater care in how, when, and what they share."""	blog;deprecation;google sites;jump point search;landing page;privacy	Amirhossein Aleyasen;Oleksii Starov;Alyssa Phung Au;Allan M.

fe12d70b0d849fb4d80153bc2acd11a6d4125ecc	applying social media intelligence for predicting and identifying on-line radicalization and civil unrest oriented threats		Research shows that various social media platforms on Internet such as Twitter, Tumblr (micro-blogging websites), Facebook (a popular social networking website), YouTube (largest video sharing and hosting website), Blogs and discussion forums are being misused by extremist groups for spreading their beliefs and ideologies, promoting radicalization, recruiting members and creating online virtual communities sharing a common agenda. Popular microblogging websites such as Twitter are being used as a real-time platform for information sharing and communication during planning and mobilization if civil unrest related events. Applying social media intelligence for predicting and identifying online radicalization and civil unrest oriented threats is an area that has attracted several researchers’ attention over past 10 years. There are several algorithms, techniques and tools that have been proposed in existing literature to counter and combat cyber-extremism and predicting protest related events in much advance. In this paper, we conduct a literature review of all these existing techniques and do a comprehensive analysis to understand state-of-the-art, trends and research gaps. We present a one class classification approach to collect scholarly articles targeting the topics and subtopics of our research scope. We perform characterization, classification and an in-depth meta analysis meta-anlaysis of about 100 conference and journal papers to gain a better understanding of existing literature.	algorithm;blog;real-time web;social media intelligence;unrest;virtual community	Swati Agarwal;Ashish Sureka	2015	CoRR		public relations;social science;advertising;management;world wide web;computer security	ML	-80.93132657748758	-17.763163505430608	155977

As various types of SNGs are expected to spread, empirical research on the usability of SNGs is necessary. This study investigates whether the influences of gift-giving types on social capital are significant depending on the relation types between users. In addition, the influences of social capital on the continuous usage intention were observed. The relationships are divided into “friends” and “neighbors.” The types of gift-giving are divided into “in-game gift-giving,” in which gifts are exchanged within the game, and “out-of-game gift-giving,” in which gifts are delivered outside the game, for example, through SNS personal messages. We conducted a survey targeting SNG users and found out that most of the social capital was significantly influenced by the gift-giving attitude. To supplement the results from the quantitative research, we conducted interviews to observe whether the results of the survey agreed with respondents’ actual...	social capital;social network;gift	Moon Kyeong Kim;Hee Youn Kim;Youn ah Kang	2019	Int.

This advice is likely to be mixed in nature with some congenial i.e. supportive of a person‟s existing standpoint and some uncongenial. This study examines how people manage the process of advice giving in a cancer support group. A discourse analysis of data collected from an online message forum explores how participants manage to ask for and offer advice within a peer setting. The findings highlight a group who collectively see advice giving as one of their key functions and have developed mechanisms for portraying their competence and trustworthiness. Advice seekers use their initial message as a positioning statement to indicate the boundaries associated with their decision making and the parameters within which advice givers are permitted to operate. Members use a number of discursive techniques to deal with uncongenial advice including, humour, alignment with unnamed others and the presentation of idiosyncratic reasoning. Seeking out very like-minded others provides support and reinforcement for pre-existing views. The results are discussed in terms of the role of online health communities in decision making.	information source;trust (emotion)	Elizabeth Sillence	2010	IJWBC	10.1504/IJWBC.2010.035840	public relations;reinforcement;support;knowledge management;competence;health;management;social psychology;law;world wide web	HCI	-84.63411130606819	-21.087628310951132	156346
fd2f10fb1b1101cd73706bc44e0c54ffbde6afe6	exploring the value of online reviews to organizations: implications for revenue forecasting and planning	business value	¶ Despite the widespread popularity of online opinion forums among consumers, the business value that such systems bring to organizations has, so far, remained an unanswered question. This paper addresses this question by studying the value of online movie ratings in forecasting motion picture revenues. First, we conduct a survey where a nationally representative sample of subjects who do not rate movies online is asked to rate a number of recent movies. Their ratings exhibit high correlation with online ratings for the same movies. We thus provide evidence for the claim that online ratings can be considered as a useful proxy for word-of-mouth about movies. Inspired by the Bass model of product diffusion, we then develop a motion picture revenue-forecasting model that incorporates the impact of both publicity and word of mouth on a movie's revenue trajectory. Using our model, we derive notably accurate predictions of a movie's total revenues from statistics of user reviews posted on Yahoo! Movies during the first week of a new movie's release. The results of our work provide encouraging evidence for the value of publicly available online forum information to firms for real-time forecasting and competitive analysis. ¶ This is a preliminary draft of a work in progress.

60d51da87c09acae9815a0c4bc65d0fc84483e7d	plumx as a potential tool to assess the macroscopic multidimensional impact of books		The main purpose of this macro-study is to shed light on the broad impact of books. For this purpose, the impact a very large collection of books (more than 200,000) has been analysed by using PlumX, an analytical tool providing a great number of different metrics provided by various tools. Furthermore, the study focuses on the evolution of the most significant measures and indicators over time. The results show usage counts in comparison to the other metrics are quantitatively predominant. Catalogue holdings and reviews represent a book’s most characteristic measures deriving from its increased level of impact in relation to prior results. Our results also corroborate the long half-life of books within the scope of all metrics, excluding views and social media.

In-depth interviews with political reporters and editors at US newspapers during the 2012 campaign found that tweets from political leaders are used by journalists in ways that suggest firstand second-level agenda building. Participants gave examples of how political tweets have shaped their coverage in terms of the events they cover, the sources they interview, the quotes they use, and the background information they rely on to decide how to cover an issue. In addition, political tweets that contribute the most to coverage tend to have several elements in common.		John H.

2aca6ba443a5f36857947d5a38bf422264bab016	the effect of information quality on trust in e-government systems		Over the past decades, the citizen–government relationship has changed. Citizens transitioned from traditional communications to interactions through e-government systems. While e-government systems expenditures increased, citizens’ trust in e-government systems was a challenge. Moreover, although the role of information quality (IQ) as a contributor to trust in information systems (IS) received some attention, such role in e-government systems received limited attention. This two-phased study was designed to uncover citizens’ perceived IQ factors, and determine their influence on trust in e-government systems. A list of e-government’s IQ characteristics was developed and validated. Citizens were surveyed on their perceived importance level of IQ characteristics and trust in e-government systems. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) based on 363 records obtained was used. Ordinal logistic regression (OLR) was used to formulate and test the predictive model. Results demonstrated two factors out of the three had a significant influence on trust. Results determined no significant gender differences.	e-government;exploratory factor analysis;exploratory testing;information quality;information system;interaction;logistic regression;ordered logit;ordinal data	Ally Lee;Yair Levy;William Hafner	2012			risk analysis (engineering);computer science;ordered logit;management science;information quality;information system;e-government;exploratory factor analysis	HCI	-88.8957518078332	-10.451996526629221	156754

Thousands of Weibo accounts are created by government agencies and officials, and considered as a new-found channel for information dissemination and citizen service. Chinese government's confidence in social media grows beyond everyone's expectation for benefiting from the adoption of Weibo where public opinions emerges in an endless succession. This paper presents and analyzes a case of Shanghai government Weibo account @Shanghaicity on its definition, content design, characteristics, operation system and challenges to draw a tentative conclusion of Weibo management.

Specifically, we surveyed the breadth of ICT use, technology experiences, and socio-personal characteristics of 198 older adults and analyzed the dispositional correlates of ICT adoption. Results showed that majority of participants used ICT to maintain family and social connections and to access information on health and routine activities. Those aged 65–70 with higher education and/or living with a spouse/ partner were more likely to use ICT. Key relationships between ICT use and perspectives on technology were found. Higher ICT use was associated with self-perceived socio-personal characteristics such as being ‘‘satisfied with activities’’, ‘‘persevering’’, ‘‘physically and emotionally independent’’ and having a ‘‘positive outlook’’. Whereas, the majority of non-users reported that their activities did not change across time and that they felt ‘‘intimidated’’ and ‘‘anxious’’ with technology. The performance of ICT-based activities and/or the desire to perform them were significantly associated with the perceived importance of the activities. The older population’s age, education, attitudes, and personalities influence how they approach ICT. We propose a community-centered socio-ecological model to factor in these dispositional characteristics in future ICT training programs. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of studies on online shopping behavior have indirectly related customer satisfaction to repurchase intention. But very few studies have explicitly studied the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in the online environment. However, recently researchers have argued that customer satisfaction may not be a good indicator of customer loyalty and suggested that perceived value may be a better predictor. In other words, “distinct value propositions” could be used to develop customer loyalty. Therefore, in this paper, we study the relationship between perceived value (developed via web technologies) and customer loyalty. We propose that relational benefits factors formulate the “distinct value propositions” (perceived value) needed to generate customer loyalty in the online environment.	customer relationship management;kerrison predictor;online shopping	Mujtaba Ahsan;Fatemeh Zahedi	2005			computer science;knowledge management;customer satisfaction;loyalty business model;customer delight;customer intelligence;value proposition;customer to customer;marketing;customer retention;customer advocacy	AI	-89.89065688766607	-11.003991881900047	157215

Using textual analyses we provide a classification of emotions within posts across three main themes of interaction emotions, response emotions, and preoccupation emotions and show that many requests for information by young first‐time mothers are motivated by negative emotions. This has implications for how moderators of online news groups respond to online request for help and for understanding how to support vulnerable young parents.

We argue that there are three main antecedents of SOVC, namely, needs, similarity with other members, and impersonal trust, and that SOVC develops through the three processes of exchanging support, creating and making identification, and producing interpersonal trust.	virtual community	Hanna-Kaisa Ellonen;Miia Kosonen;Kaisa Henttonen	2007	IJWBC	10.1504/IJWBC.2007.013778	psychology;identification;social group;social identity theory;public relations;interpersonal relationship;social science;support;similarity;computer science;qualitative research;need;sociology;confidence;communication;trustworthy computing;social psychology	HCI	-90.79258911502397	-18.439666327825684	157423

This paper presents a novel recommendation system in which eWoM citations compiled using search engines are filtered according to the preferences and requirements of users. The proposed mechanism uses descriptive term creation to formalize the language used in searches, which is then classified according to the Rational Decision Making model to facilitate the analysis of eWoM. The proposed system was evaluated by applying it to the search for dental services in Chungli, Taiwan. Experiment results show that the proposed system reduces the time and effort required to sift through search results. Participants reported that the proposed system excels in quality and effectiveness and had a positive effect on their satisfaction and behavioral intentions. From a managerial perspective, the proposed system provides a valuable tool with which to improve service quality by identifying areas in which previous users have provided negative commentary via eWoM.	recommender system	Wen-Chin Hsu;Li-Chuan Chen	2017	IRMJ	10.4018/IRMJ.2017010103	engineering;knowledge management;marketing;multimedia;advertising;world wide web	Web+IR	-90.80201354765791	-13.238822986328346	157526

We report from an experiment with four treatments, where the base treatment is a standard public goods game with simultaneous contribution decisions, while the three other treatments allowed participants to volunteer to be an “early contributor” in their group. In the three leader treatments, we manipulate the level of compensation given to the leader. Our main finding is that a moderate compensation to the leader is highly beneficial, it increases the average contribution by almost 80%. A high compensation, however, is detrimental to public good provision. We show that paying a moderate compensation to the leaders strikes the right balance between the need for recruiting leaders and avoiding a large social crowding-out effect. We argue that the main findings of the paper are important in many real life settings where we would like to use economic incentives to encourage people to lead by example. ∗We have received extremely valuable comments and suggestions from Thomas Dohmen, Tore Ellingsen, Urs Fischbacher, Uri Gneezy, Hans K.

User concerns about online privacy can be a barrier to the use of digital services. Different approaches, mostly from a social science perspective, try to understand user concerns, attitudes, and behaviors in the online context. Especially the so-called privacy paradox, the discrepancy between high privacy concerns and contradicting low privacy protection behavior, has been of interest. This phenomenon has been explained in different ways: users performing a privacy calculus, making affective decisions, or being overwhelmed, resigned by the complexity of online threats and protective measures. Complementing these theories, we hypothesize that different user types approach privacy differently. A survey (N=337) investigates the privacy attitudes, behaviors, and experiences of German internet users. With a cluster analysis, three distinct types of users were identified: the “Privacy Guardians,” highly concerned and taking much privacy protective actions, the “Privacy Cynics,” concerned but feeling powerless and unable to protect their privacy, and the “Privacy Pragmatists,” showing the least concerns which they weigh against benefits. These user groups need different tools and guidelines for protecting their	biological anthropology;cluster analysis;discrepancy function;internet privacy;theory	Eva-Maria Schomakers;Chantal Lidynia;Luisa Vervier;Martina Ziefle	2018		10.5220/0006774301530163	computer security;pragmatism;computer science;public relations;typology	Security	-86.03885316992636	-15.680519574732841	157729

On university campuses, Facebook is increasingly used to organize ad hoc physical gatherings within social groups. The coordination takes place via Facebook event pages and a ‘wall’ that represent online, shared, interactive spaces. This paper explores how such online interactive spaces facilitate the temporal coordination of social events. We content analyze Facebook's event pages and walls to understand how social group behavior is different from prevailing theories of group task progress and media use. The results suggest that, similar to many work groups, social groups exhibit differential interactive behaviors before and after the midpoint of when the event is created on Facebook and when the offline activity is going to happen. However, the results differ in the sense that the interactive behavior is highest before rather than after the midpoint. We also found that the involvement of the creator of the event pages is associated with higher interactive behavior of the social group. We discuss the findings and derive implications for the design of online tools for social event management.		Zuhair Khan;Sirkka L.

The primary audience for this case study is business students who are taking classes in e-commerce, Web 2.0, social media, online business, business strategy, and internet marketing. Due to the fact that many Americans today are having problems with employment and income, but still have time to spend on Facebook or other social media, it may be the right moment in internet marketing history to utilize a social medium they are already wedded to as a platform to make some revenue. The objective is to find out whether utilizing Facebook “friends” on a daily basis can actually be an efficient way to increase Google AdSense revenue rather than relying on search engines to bring customers or clickers to their websites without asking their social capital (Facebook friends) to intentionally click on AdSense advertisements. This case is about the effect of Facebook on Google AdSense revenue based on web content search.	americas conference on information systems;blog;desktop computer;digital marketing;e-commerce;electronic business;google adsense;internet;online advertising;page view;personal web page;social capital;social media;strategic management;technical standard;the industry standard;web 2.0;web content;web search engine	Ehi E.

Tests on the relationship between individual differences and advertising responses form the basis of this empirical study on the Web. The results indicated that consumers have a higher tendency to avoid or experience ambivalence about Internet advertisements under low-interactivity circumstances, and attitudinal ambivalence lead to avoidance when responding to advertisements on the Internet. Personality variables are the main factors in consumer decision-making behaviors and Internet characteristics, such as levels of interactivity, can greatly influence the effectiveness of advertising in online environments. Advertising credibility could influence people's consumer attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors over time on the Web.	advertisements;attitude;behavior;decision making;interactivity;internet;online advertising;world wide web	Chang Hyun Jin;Jorge Villegas	2007	Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	10.1089/cpb.2006.9960	psychology;medicine;computer science;advertising account executive;social psychology	Metrics	-89.52814708663932	-12.539875497471948	157928

Accordingly, perceived usefulness (PU) is divided into perceived utilitarian usefulness (PUU) and perceived hedonic usefulness (PHU) to provide a better understanding of users' intention for accepting IT. To test the proposed model more effectively, this research targets instant messaging (IM), which is an extremely popular and increasingly important communication system, both utilitarian and hedonic in nature. This research compares the difference across two groups: students for hedonic purpose and employees for utilitarian purpose. We conclude that the proposed model, which distinguishes between utilitarian and hedonic usefulness, is more effective than previous models in which the usefulness was not distinguished. Both PUU and PHU have an effect on intention to use. Employees consider PUU more important in their intention to use IM, while students are more influenced by PHU.	information systems;information system;instant messaging;one-class classification	Ja-Chul Gu;Liu Fan;Yung Ho Suh;Sang-Chul Lee	2010	Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking	10.1089/cyber.2009.0167	psychology;medicine;computer science;social psychology;information system	HCI	-90.06327461154453	-10.41075009220769	158022

Personal social media usage is pervasive in both personal and professional lives. Practitioner articles and news stories have commented on the addicting and distracting nature of social media. Previous empirical research has established the negative effects of distractions on primary tasks. To date, little research has looked at the potentially distracting nature of social media and the negative effects that can arise from usage. This research addresses this gap by investigating the effects of personal social media usage on task performance. To extend this research, I also examined the effects that the personal social media usage has on individuals' technostress and happiness levels. I tested these effects by creating a classroom task environment and measuring subjects' usage of social media and their task performance. From this, it was found that higher amounts of personal social media usage led to lower performance on the task, as well as higher levels of technostress and lower happiness. These results are consistent across different levels of attentional control and multitasking computer self-efficacy. These results suggest that the personal usage of social media during professional (vs. personal or play) times can lead to negative consequences and is worthy of further study.	social media	Stoney Brooks	2015	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2014.12.053	psychology;simulation;social media;computer science;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;social psychology;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-85.62600347464868	-19.7945354332435	158267

In this work, we consider topic-based Twitter interaction networks, and address the task of identifying influential players. Our motivation is the strong desire of many commerical entities to increase their social media presence by engaging positively with pivotal bloggers and tweeters. After discussing some of the issues involved in extracting useful interaction data from a Twitter feed, we define the concept of an active node subnetwork sequence. This provides a time-dependent, topic-based, summary of relevant Twitter activity. For these types of transient interactions, it has been argued that the flow of information, and hence the influence of a node, is highly dependent on the timing of the links. Some nodes with relatively small bandwidth may turn out to be key players because of their prescience and their ability to instigate follow-on network activity. To simulate a commercial application, we build an active node subnetwork sequence based on key words in the area of travel and holidays. We then compare a range of network centrality measures, including a recently proposed version that accounts for the arrow of time, with respect to their ability to rank important nodes in this dynamic setting. The centrality rankings use only connectivity information (who Tweeted whom, when), but if we post-process the results by examining account details, we find that the time-respecting, dynamic, approach, which looks at the follow-on flow of information, is less likely to be ‘misled’ by accounts that appear to generate large numbers of automatic Tweets with the aim of pushing out web links. We then benchmark these algorithmically derived rankings against independent feedback from five social media experts who judge Twitter accounts as part of their professional duties. We find that the dynamic centrality measures add value to the expert view, and indeed can be hard to distinguish from an expert in terms of who they place in the top ten. We also highlight areas where the algorithmic approach can be refined and improved.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);blog;broadcast domain;business models for open-source software;categorization;centrality;entity;interaction;real-time transcription;sensor;simulation;social media;subnetwork;trust (emotion);tweeter	Peter Laflin;Alexander V.

This paper studies the association between the degree of interdisciplinarity and the number of citations at the paper level. Different from previous studies compositing various aspects of interdisciplinarity into a single indicator, we use factor analysis to uncover distinct dimensions of interdisciplinarity corresponding to variety, balance, and disparity. We estimate Poisson models with journal fixed effects and robust standard errors to analyze the divergent relationships between these three factors and citations. We find that long-term (13-year) citations (1) increase at an increasing rate with variety, (2) decrease with balance, and (3) increase at a decreasing rate with disparity. Furthermore, interdisciplinarity also affects the process of citation accumulation: (1) although variety and disparity have positive effects on long-term citations, they have negative effects on short-term (3-year) citations, and (2) although balance has a negative effect on long-term citations, its negative effect is insignificant in the short run. These findings have important implications for interdisciplinary research and science policy.	binocular disparity;compositing;dimensions;factor analysis;fixed effects model;tree accumulation;citation	Jian Wang;Bart Thijs;Wolfgang Glänzel	2015		10.1371/journal.pone.0127298	biology;medicine;human factors and ergonomics;diversity index	HCI	-79.25948747098974	-20.24690725310076	158504

However, few studies have directly examined associations between technology use for social reasons and physical and psychological health among older adults. The current study examines the benefits of technology use in 591 older adults from the 2012 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (Mage = 68.18, SD = 10.75; 55.5% female). Social technology use was assessed through five technology-based behaviors (i.e., using e-mail, social networking sites, online video/phone calls, online chatting/instant messaging, using a smartphone). Attitudes toward the usability and benefits of technology use were also assessed. Older adults had generally positive attitudes toward technology. Higher social technology use was associated with better self-rated health, fewer chronic illnesses, higher subjective well-being, and fewer depressive symptoms. Furthermore, each of the links between social technology use and physical and psychological health was mediated by reduced loneliness. Close relationships are a large determinant of physical health and well-being, and technology has the potential to cultivate successful relationships among older adults.		William J.

It also explored the mediating role of social network service (SNS) addiction in the hypothesized relationships between these variables. A sample of 419 college students and employees in their 20s and 30s, who were SNS users in South Korea, participated in the study. The results showed that social and information technology overload did not exert a direct impact on psychological well-being. SNS addiction served as a mediator in the relationships between these variables. The theoretical contributions and useful managerial implications of the study, with respect to reducing SNS users' addiction and improving their psychological well-being, were described. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is well documented that many societies and organizations exhibit a glass ceiling. In this paper we formally define and study the glass ceiling effect in social networks and propose a natural mathematical model, called the biased preferential attachment model, that partially explains the causes of the glass ceiling effect. This model consists of a network composed of two types of vertices, representing two sub-populations, and accommodates three well known social phenomena: (i) the """"rich get richer"""" mechanism, (ii) a minority-majority partition, and (iii) homophily. We prove that our model exhibits a strong moment glass ceiling effect and that all three conditions are necessary, i.e., removing any one of them will prevent the appearance of a glass ceiling effect. Additionally, we present empirical evidence taken from a mentor-student network of researchers (derived from the DBLP database) that exhibits both a glass ceiling effect and the above three phenomena."""	attachments;dbl-browser;glass;mathematical model;population;social network;vertex (graph theory)	Chen Avin;Barbara Keller;Zvi Lotker;Claire Mathieu;David Peleg;Yvonne Anne Pignolet	2015		10.1145/2688073.2688097	socioeconomics;sociology;communication;social psychology	Web+IR	-89.47658857837465	-18.52065438916629	159105

In Singapore, Internet Stock Trading has been at the forefront of this trend since 1998. However, to-date, the penetration rate of online trading remains low. As such, this paper attempts to analyze the factors that affect the growth of Internet Stock Trading. We used Taylor and Todd’s [72] Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) framework to explain investors’ acceptance through their intentions to trade online and to rationalize their intentions in terms of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and other related variables. The model is tested based on 291 responses obtained through personal interviews. The measures and hypotheses were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. Results show that attitude and social factors significantly influence investors’ intention towards adopting Internet stock trading.	bandwagon effect;e-commerce;internet;microsoft forefront;penetration test;structural equation modeling	Joo Eng Lee-Partridge;Pei See Ho	2003		10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174437	e-commerce;structural equation modeling;information and communications technology;the internet;economics;computer science;marketing;digital economy;law;theory of planned behavior;commerce	HCI	-90.1310531982084	-10.631651441070801	159192

Through the use of a survey conducted both in the state of Pennsylvania and nationally, we analyze how interpersonal discussion, issue involvement, media exposure, and affinity for the Penn State football team influence third-person perceptions (TPPs) related to the Penn State case. By examining a dynamic and polarizing social issue involving a previously well-regarded athletic program facing intense social and criminal scrutiny, we are able to better understand how TPPs are formed in the midst of an ongoing scandal. Results reveal the influence of interpersonal discussion—and especially interpersonal disagreement—as a key moderating variable in forming these perceptions of media influence.	affinity analysis;carroll morgan (computer scientist);declaration (computer programming);faceted classification;norm (social);pa-risc;polarizer;problem solving;tpp	Michael E.

However, no study has focused on their potential usefulness to capture the impact of scholarly books. While recent literature shows that citation indicators cannot fully capture the impact of books, other studies have suggested alternative indicators such as usage, publishers’ prestige or library holdings. In this paper, we calculate 18 indicators which range from altmetrics to library holdings, views, downloads or citations to the production of monographs of a Spanish university using the bibliometric suite PlumX from EBSCO. The objective of the study is to adopt a multidimensional perspective on the analysis of books and understand the level of complementarity between these different indicators. Also, we compare the overview offered by this range of indicators when applied to monographs with the traditional bibliometric perspective focused on journal articles and citation impact. We observe a low presence of altmetric indicators for monographs, even lower than for journal articles and a predominance of library holdings, confirming this indicator as the most promising one towards the analysis of the impact of books.	altmetrics;bibliometrics;book;complementarity theory;emergence	Daniel Torres-Salinas;Nicolas Robinson-Garcia;Juan Gorraiz	2017	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-017-2539-z	data science;citation analysis;data mining;citation;citation impact;computer science;prestige;altmetrics	HCI	-77.81999558666341	-20.535500966302365	159494

This study used the bibliometric arrropach to learn about the subject categories, core journals, top countries and leading research institutes in publication, most frequently used author keywords, and most frequently used KeyWords Plus. Also, this study used a “word cluster analysis” method to locate research hot topics. A majority of the subject categories were located in clinical psychology and family studies. The core journals for family therapy located in Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, Contemporary Family Therapy, and Journal of Family Therapy. The US ranked as the top country of world articles with the highest h-index, followed distantly by the UK and Germany. The leading research institutes were Purdue University, University of Miami, and Brigham Young University. “Adolescents” and “adolescent” were highly used words in article titles. Next, the top three most frequently used author keywords were “anorexia nervosa”, “adolescents”, and “psychotherapy”. Finally, the top three most frequently used KeyWords Plus were “psychotherapy”, “children”, and “intervention”. Based on “word cluster analysis” to determine the research hotspots, the research hot topics of family therapy fall into three categories: treated subjects, treated matters, and treatment issues. The research trend in family therapy seems to involve the therapist often treating adolescents or children for eating disorders, substance abuse, depression, or schizophrenia. During treatment or therapy, therapists and researchers must pay attention to the issues of gender, training, and therapeutic alliance.	bibliometrics;cluster analysis;social sciences citation index	Yu-Chiung Lou;Hsiao-Fang Lin	2011	Scientometrics	10.1007/s11192-011-0549-9	social science;scientometrics;computer science;data mining;sociology;world wide web;family therapy	Web+IR	-80.0133596667664	-21.37186776615978	159604

In addition, individuals vary in how much effort they invest in managing their social connections. Using data from a social media site, we study how the interplay between effort and network position affects social media users’ access to diverse and novel information. Previous studies of the role of networks in information access were limited in their ability to measure the diversity of information. We address this problem by learning the topics of interest to social media users from the messages they share online with followers. We use the learned topics to measure the diversity of information users receive from the people they follow online. We confirm that users in structurally diverse network positions, which bridge otherwise disconnected regions of the follower network, tend to be exposed to more diverse and novel information. We also show that users who invest more effort in their activity on the site are not only located in more structurally diverse positions within the network than the less engaged users but also receive more novel and diverse information when in similar network positions. These findings indicate that the relationship between network structure and access to information in networks is more nuanced than previously thought.	freedom of information laws by country;generative model;information access;interaction;multimedia framework;redundancy (engineering);social media;social network;statistical model;world wide web	Jeon-Hyung Kang;Kristina Lerman	2017	TWEB	10.1145/2990506	social media;computer science;knowledge management;world wide web;social network	Web+IR	-83.56616727385328	-15.299209613013629	159681

This study examines variation in satisfaction with physical health status among users of self-help groups for patients with cancer (N = 350). The analytical approach of the study differs from previous work in that satisfaction with physical health is modelled not as a predictor, but as an outcome variable. The study tested the hypothesis that perceived ability to cope with cancer mediates the association between electronic support and health satisfaction. Path analyses using ordinary least squares multiple regressions showed that there is an indirect association between electronic support and health satisfaction via perceived ability to cope with cancer. Electronic support increased perception of control over cancer, which in turn led to higher levels of satisfaction with health status. Ext...

The number of people relying on social networking resources and hospitality/culture exchange travel websites is also increasing. However, there have been voices criticizing hospitality/culture exchange websites for deception, violations of privacy, and lack of dispute resolution process, etc. To address this problem and to glean design insight, our study performed Heuristic Evaluation (with six subject matter experts) on the features and interfaces of CouchSurfing (one of the most popular hospitality exchange websites). The purpose was to understand if current features and interfaces of hospitality travel websites support trust-building among users. Results of the study showed barriers in differing stages of the trust-building process. Results also revealed that the establishment of trust was challenged by the current graphic design, the structure design, as well as the social cue design of CouchSurfing.

Findings – A positive influence exists for each type of perceived value on satisfaction with hedonic value having the strongest relationship. Hedonic value is positively correlated with behavioural intention to use LB-SNS and positive word-of-mouth while social value affects positive word-of-mouth.

In this paper, we hypothesize that the check-ins made by friends help users learn the potential payoff of visiting a venue. We argue that this learning-in-a-network process differs from the classic observational learning model a subtle yet important way: Rather than from anonymous others, the agents learn from their network friends, about whose tastes experience goods the agents are better informed. The empirical analyses are conducted on a unique data set which we observe both the explicit interpersonal relationships and their ensuing check-ins. The key result is that the proportion of checked-in friends is not positively associated with the likelihood of a new visit, rejecting the prediction of the conventional observational learning model.

f71c6309f9e8befc3b0b706cd2b665a4d99bc4ef	how heterogeneous community engage newcomers? the effect of community diversity on newcomers' perception of inclusion: an empirical study in social media service	engagement;community diversity;newcomers;perceived inclusion;perceived uniqueness;social identification	The effect of community diversity on perceived inclusion of newcomers is analyzed.The effect of two dimensions of perceived inclusion on engagement is explored.Three types of community diversity, namely, visible, informational and value are examined.Three types of community diversity play different roles on perceived inclusion.The effect of perceived inclusion on engagement based on gender differences is ascertained. Online communities that provide social media services need to engage newcomers so as to not lose them to competitors. This study examines the role of community diversity (in terms of perceived visible dissimilarity, perceived informational dissimilarity and perceived value dissimilarity) in influencing perceived inclusion of newcomers in the online community and the influence of such perception on newcomers' engagement intention. The theoretical background on perceived inclusion is obtained from the optimal distinctiveness theory, which comprises of two dimensions, namely, social identification and perceived uniqueness. The results support the multiple roles of community diversity on a newcomer's perceived inclusion. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the effect of community diversity on newcomers' engagement behavior, and provide recommendations on designing a personalized community diversity environment.	avatar (computing);differentiated services;entity–relationship model;identification (psychology);social media;taobao marketplace;web page	Zhao Pan;Yaobin Lu;Sumeet Gupta	2014	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2014.05.034	communication;social psychology	HCI	-87.19384767445698	-14.433790637525194	160421
fe6edb59ec13fd9606145ed165320729e55a87af	genealogy tree: understanding academic lineage of authors via algorithmic and visual analysis		Ancestry and Genealogy tree are proven tools to determine the lineage of any person and establish dependencies among individuals. Genealogy tree can be exploited further to gain information about the researcher and his scholastic lineage which is of paramount importance in today’s world of computer technology. This insight into academic genealogy could be ways of helping PhD students achieve academic socialization within the discipline, by making explicit connections that may be influential. Awareness of his scientific heritage, gives the user a broader perspective of his own research project. This paper also highlights and investigates how this academic network is exploited by certain researchers using various visualization tools. It was observed during this work that the credibility and influence factor is determined by the various citations obtained by an author and to improve their rankings in various forums, they tend to collaborate in their academic circle and boost their citation count. A recent trend among researchers is to form communities based on their academic relationships and rely on copious citations for their mutual benefit. Tracing the genealogical relationships can be helpful in detecting such communities and also create a more quality aware metrics using a lineage independent model for computation of author level metrics.

Our comment concerns the 4th experiment where Norenzayan et al. reported that, although there were no cultural differences in accuracy on abstract logical arguments, Koreans made more errors than U.S. undergraduates in judging the logical validity of concrete arguments. Norenzayan et al. concluded that Koreans are less likely than European Americans to decontextualize an argument's content from its logical structure, as Koreans were more likely to consider the believability of the conclusion when assessing an argument's validity (a belief bias). Notably, Korean participants were more conservative (less likely to say an argument is valid) than European American participants when assessing arguments. An analysis of the average of the hit and correct rejection rates in each of the conditions (abstract, concrete-believable, concrete-nonbelievable) revealed that, contrary to conclusions of Norenzayan et al., European Americans were no better than Koreans at determining the validity of concrete deductive arguments with conclusions varying in believability.	deny (action);experiment;reasoning - publishing subsection;rejection sampling;thrombocytopenia	Sara J.

Destination marketing organisations, or DMOs, dedicated to promoting tourism destinations, have used the advantages of information technologies in their websites during the last few years. Recently, a new paradigm, characterised by the use of applications and collaborative tools, which is called Web 2.0, is driving dramatic changes in the promotion of tourist destinations, with a clear shift towards the use of content generated by internet users, and hence, the creation of web-based communities regarding touristic activities around each destination. In this article, we will study and discuss how the major DMOs, according to their ‘popularity on the internet’, are improving their websites with specific tools in order to exploit the enormous potential of user generated content in web-based communities, characteristic of this new Web 2.0 scenario.	blog;collaborative software;directx;internet homicide;programming paradigm;social network;user-generated content;virtual community;web 2.0;web application;wiki	Begoña Betancor García;Antonio Ocón Carreras;Enrique Rubio Royo	2012	IJWBC	10.1504/IJWBC.2012.044685	computer science;marketing;multimedia;advertising;user-generated content;world wide web	HCI	-82.71389326823004	-10.991335904464824	160984

The present experiment examined how support-seekers’ use of cues to personal identity in their user profile can influence the level of personcenteredness and politeness in others’ responses to their support-seeking postings. Results showed that support-seekers whose user profile contained a portrait picture and a first name ID tended to receive higher person-centered and more polite support messages than support-seekers whose user profile did not contain those cues to personal identity.	cyberspace;user profile	Bo Feng;Siyue Li;Na Li	2016	Communication Research	10.1177/0093650213510942	psychology;politeness;multimedia;sociology;advertising;communication;trustworthy computing;social psychology	HCI	-85.42860010672557	-18.345527001377256	160989

Working on the top 100 Interbrand world corporate brands dataset over the 10-years period 2001-10, we analyze the relative positioning of country brands as derived from the structural characteristics of the corresponding portfolios of top corporate brands. We find that the structural complexity of both sector and country variables are not correlated with brand equity. Moreover, we apply an innovative ANN methodology, AutoCM, to build the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the multi-dimensional similarities among the top corporate brands structures at country level, and carry out a further related analysis in terms of the so called Maximum Regular Graph (MRG). We find that while the USA dominates the ranking of top brands at a global level, it does not have a central positioning in the MST and MRG, whereas Germany and other European and Far-Eastern countries do. We show how these results may have significant implications for the strategic intelligence analysis of country and corporate brands, and of their inter-relatedness. Moreover, we illustrate how AutoCM qualifies as a new computational approach that usefully expands the toolbox of scholars and analysts in corporate and country branding in a relevant, as yet unexplored direction.

Mobile social tourism, which refers to the use of mobile social media in tourism activities, is a newly proposed term that fits into the scope of smart tourism in this study. PLS-SEM has been employed to analyse the data collected through self-administered questionnaires. Most structural paths in the framework are consistent with past literatures, except for the negative influences of privacy concern. The mediation analysis suggests that these effects have been neutralized by perceived benefits and sense of belonging, which reaffirms the “privacy paradox” phenomenon in smart tourism research. Overall, the framework could provide adequate explanation towards continuance intention to create user-generated contents under the context of mobile social tourism. Both theoretical and practical implications are then discussed.

In order to do so, a household panel survey was taken to 1075 Spanish respondents and analyzed with a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) approach for grouping both consumers' motivations to reject online shopping and possible motivations to start buying online. After the definition of both sets of groups, a k-means clustering was performed in order to relate both groups in disjoint sets. The results from our study show that there are mainly three types of causes for not shopping through the electronic channel -namely, absence of physical presence of the goods or channel preference, security concerns and privacy risks, and lack of internet access and/or skills- and six different attitudes towards future use of Internet as a shopping channel, revealing a total of ten different sets of non-buyers. Implications for theory and practice are discussed in the final section.	e-commerce;online shopping	Ángel Hernández-García;Santiago Iglesías-Pradas;Alberto Urueña-López	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-35879-1_10	public relations;knowledge management;marketing;advertising;management;world wide web	ECom	-88.70810266618984	-10.770562998338594	161051

However, social media channels are more widely available to investors, both nonprofessional and sophisticated, and allow for interaction between users via postings and comments. The opinions of others, as expressed in their comments on social media, may influence investors' perception of the news in a manner that is beyond that of the traditional disclosures envisioned by the SEC. This research explores this issue by examining the influence of disclosures and attached comments via social media on nonprofessional investors' perceptions of the news, valuation judgments, and perceptions of management's credibility.

The technologies and services include resort websites, microblogging services, and online coupon services. The decision tree models reveal that ski resorts use specific strategies for these segments. Also, the paper reveals the impact that the technologies and services have on resort sales. The impact is positive and both immediate and sustained in nature. The research is the first of its type in the ski industry and represents a novel use of decision tree models for profiling promotional and advertising strategies. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

fc0e3a3484eead919f8da36449650e5f5316408d	group-based trajectory modeling gbtm of citations in scholarly literature: dynamic qualities of transient and sticky knowledge claims	universiteitsbibliotheek;statistics;citation indexes	Group-based Trajectory Modeling (GBTM) is applied to the citation curves of articles in six journals and to all citable items in a single field of science (Virology, 24 journals), in order to distinguish among the developmental trajectories in subpopulations. Can highly-cited citation patterns be distinguished in an early phase as “fast-breaking” papers? Can “late bloomers” or “sleeping beauties” be identified? Most interesting, we find differences between “sticky knowledge claims” that continue to be cited more than ten years after publication, and “transient knowledge claims” that show a decay pattern after reaching a peak within a few years. Only papers following the trajectory of a “sticky knowledge claim” can be expected to have a sustained impact. These findings raise questions about indicators of “excellence” that use aggregated citation rates after two or three years (e.g., impact factors). Because aggregated citation curves can also be composites of the two patterns, 5 th -order polynomials (with four bending points) are needed to capture citation curves precisely. For the journals under study, the most frequently cited groups were furthermore much smaller than ten percent. Although GBTM has proved a useful method for investigating differences among citation trajectories, the methodology does not enable us to define a percentage of highly-cited papers inductively across different fields and journals. Using multinomial logistic regression, we conclude that predictor variables such as journal names, number of authors, etc., do not affect the stickiness of knowledge claims in terms of citations, but only the levels of aggregated citations (that are fieldspecific).	journal citation reports;kerrison predictor;multinomial logistic regression;polynomial;sticky bit	Susanne E.

One of the main differences besides the technical platform is that i-Mode is focusing on entertainment applications while WAP service providers concentrate on professional business offerings. It is often argued that i-Mode's success has to be attributed to its cultural background and cannot be replicated easily in other environments. Challenging this view we view the technical, market related, cultural and consumer-group-specific success factors of i-Mode. Additional insights are derived from positioning the i-Mode and WAP approach in the framework of reach and richness. Based on our analysis we argue that the main factors for i-Mode's success are not merely cultural thus enabling European companies to build on the Japanese experiences.

Design/methodology/approach – Seven focus group interviews, four in the United Kingdom and three in Denmark, were conducted among consumers with different degrees of experience with internet grocery shopping. This diversification of respondents was chosen to capture a broad range of the consumer beliefs that predict intentions to buy groceries online or not. The TPB framework was used to construct the interview guide that was followed in all focus groups. Findings – An unexpected result of the explorative study was that the seven groups consisting of more or less experienced internet shoppers differed only little in their pool of beliefs (outcome and control beliefs). Beliefs about internet grocery shopping, positive as well as negative, were remarkably congruent across groups. In the minds of consumers, internet grocery shopping is an advantage compared with conventional grocery shopping in terms of convenience, product range and price. Disadvantages, which could act as mental barriers, are, for instance, the risk of receiving inferior quality groceries and the loss of the recreational aspect of grocery shopping. Research limitations/implications – An important potential limitation of this research is the choice of focus groups as research methodology, which can prevent the elicitation of certain types of beliefs. If important beliefs concern issues of a more sensitive, personal character they are not likely to be mentioned in a focus group. Another limitation is the explorative nature of the research, which makes it impossible to attach weights to the importance of the elicited beliefs in predicting internet shopping behavior. Practical implications – The findings could be used to direct attention to consumer beliefs about internet grocery shopping which have the potential of acting as barriers to this line of e-commerce. Originality/value – To shed some light on the role of consumers in an underperforming and understudied branch of internet retailing. Barriers in the consumers’ minds to shop for groceries online are identified using an established theoretical framework.	diversification (finance);e-commerce;focus group;internet	Kim Ramus;Niels Asger Nielsen	2005	Internet Research	10.1108/10662240510602726	e-commerce;design methods;computer science;marketing;focus group;methodology;advertising;world wide web;theory of planned behavior;commerce	ECom	-89.65536096777375	-13.979313010763486	161314

Using data provided by 388 players of a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) via an online questionnaire, psychometric measures of engagement and addiction to the MMORPG taking into account the distinction between core and peripheral addiction criteria are shown to be differentially related to personality factors (extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, negative valence, and attractiveness). Addiction scale scores are shown to increase as negativity on all five personality characteristics increases, with these characteristics predicting 20% of the variance in addiction scores, but the same pattern is shown to occur for only one characteristic (negative valence) for the engagement scale, with personality characteristics predicting only around 2% of the variance in engagement scores. It is concluded that there is reasonable support for the distinctions between addiction and engagement and between core and peripheral criteria. Implications are discussed.		John P. Charlton;Ian D.

However, the free exchange of electronic information also brings the threat of providing easy, and many times unwanted, access to personal information. Given the potential backlash of consumers, it is imperative that both researchers and practitioners understand the nature of consumers' concern for information privacy and accurately model the construct within evolving research and business contexts. Drawing upon a sample of 355 consumers and working within the framework of confirmatory factor analysis, this study examines the factor structure of the concern for information privacy (CFIP) instrument posited by Smith et al. (1996). Consistent with prior findings, the results suggest that each dimension of this instrument is reliable and distinct. However, the results also suggest that CFIP may be more parsimoniously represented as a higher-order factor structure rather than a correlated set of first-order factors. The implication of these results is that each dimension of CFIP as well as the supra dimension derived from the associations among dimensions are important in capturing CFIP and associating the construct to other important antecedents and consequences.	information privacy	Kathy A.

We analyze the coauthorship network of Wikipedia articles about breaking news demanding intense coordination and compare the properties of these articles and the editors who contribute to them to articles about contemporary and historical events. Using p*/ERGM methods to test a multi-level, multi-theoretical model, we identify how editors' attributes and editing patterns interact with articles' attributes and authorship history. Editors' attributes like prior experience have a stronger influence on collaboration patterns, but article attributes also play significant roles. Finally, we discuss the implications our findings and methods have for understanding the socio-material duality of collective intelligence systems beyond Wikipedia.	collective intelligence;interaction;social network analysis;theory;wikipedia	Brian Keegan;Darren Gergle;Noshir S.

In addition to examining authors’ attitudes toward and coverage of the BP oil spill, the study examines community-level variables that shaped attitudes and coverage. The community structure literature has suggested that news media in smaller, more homogeneous communities, which are economically dependent on a polluting industry (as are many communities along the Gulf Coast), are more reticent to be critical in their coverage of pollution. Scholars have suggested, though, that the Internet transcends local geography and that the Internet is more open to alternative perspectives. This study suggests, though, that while the distribution of online content may make local geography less relevant, its production is still rooted in local communities. As a result, Tweets about the oil spill were shaped by many of the same social and economic forces that shaped journalists’ coverage.	gulf of evaluation;gulf of execution;internet;web content	Brendan R.

To investigate this transition, newspaper article titles were collected and analyzed. This study adopted the classification, text network analysis (by co-occurrence symmetric matrix), and clustering techniques as part of its social network analysis. Using the definition of network centrality, it found a primary framework, which was divided into periods. As a result of the identified framework shifts, the accessibility of personal information has extended from the public sector to the private sector, and the boundary of data spillage has expanded overseas. Therefore, it is urgent to institutionalize the protection of personal information from a global perspective.	accessibility;centrality;cluster analysis;personally identifiable information;resource description framework;social network analysis	Eunmi Lee;Hyun Suk Cho;Seo Hwa Jeong	2016		10.1145/2912160.2912178	simulation;engineering;data mining;computer security	AI	-80.25896027300759	-16.942844975369965	162116

Focus groups and pre- and post-questionnaires were used to collect data. Descriptive analysis, data screening, and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques were used for data analysis. The study found that the determinants of intention-to-use significantly predict actual use behavior. Direct impact of perceived usefulness and indirect impact of perceived ease of use to both behavior intention and actual behavior indicated the importance of ease of use at the early stage of technology acceptance. Non-significant intention-behavior relationship prompted thoughts on the measurement of actual behavior and multidimensional characteristics of the intention construct.		Donghua Tao	2009	AMIA ...

This study integrates relational capital into the information systems continuance model in order to explain consumer participation in on-line communities. It also investigates the moderating effect on the participation process of two personal attributes-on-line interaction propensity and ability to contribute to the community. Last, it analyzes the effect of on-line communities on consumer behavioral intentions to use the on-line community's products and to follow the community's advice. Data from 456 members of on-line travel communities reveal that integrating relational capital into the information systems continuance model effectively predicts consumer participation in these communities. The data also confirm the moderating effect of selected personal attributes for determining consumer participation. Finally, participation in on-line travel communities has a positive effect on consumer intention to use on-line community products, and trust in the community has a positive effect on intention to follow advice obtained from the community.

0da38f9a9f414d7ab710becd3bfd0efc06347719	do social bots (still) act different to humans? - comparing metrics of social bots with those of humans		As a consequence of the growing relevance of social media and improved algorithms and techniques, social bots have become a widely recognized phenomenon. Social bots can disrupt or influence online discourse in social media in many ways (e.g. spreading spam or astroturfing). In this paper, we compare 771 social bots with 693 human accounts. Our analysis is based on a Twitter data set concerning the U.S. election in 2016. Our study shows that human Twitter users and bot accounts differ in many ways. E.g. we found differences regarding the number of follower and the retweets per day of an account, as well as between the used links per day and the retweets per day. Our findings are helpful to identify social bots and to get insights about the impact of social bots in public social media communication.	humans	Stefan Stieglitz;Florian Brachten;Davina Berthelé;Mira Schlaus;Chrissoula Venetopoulou;Daniel Veutgen	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58559-8_30	internet privacy;computer science;social media;phenomenon	Robotics	-83.32765922464499	-18.21673043007698	162690

Hence indexes must not just measure features of web sites but also accurately indicate underlying government processes. eGovernment rankings are in a process of maturation in that direction, moving from purely measuring web sites to assessing use and government qualities. One such measurement is the UN eParticipation index, intended to measure how well governments connect to their citizens. This paper analyzes the quality of the index by validating it against other indexes of government-citizen relations qualities, democracy, internet filtering, and transparency. Results: The relation between the index and democracy and participation is non-existent. Countries which are authoritarian or obstruct citizen internet use by filtering can score high on eParticipation by window-dressing their webs. We suggest that the eParticipation index includes an element of reality check and propose ways to do that.	content-control software;epr paradox;reality check (tv series)	Åke Grönlund	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-22878-0_3	public relations;e-government;information science;computer science;knowledge management;data mining;public administration;informatics;management;law;world wide web;computer security;democracy	Web+IR	-79.53572340039635	-16.151594923947663	162759

Effective website design plays a critical role in attracting and maintaining customers interest and in influencing their purchase behavior. Despite the singular significance of website design, little theoretical knowledge is available regarding how web-design elements impact the purchase behavior of online shoppers. By drawing on the theory of planned behavior and interpersonal influence, we develop and empirically test a conceptual model for the process by which web design elements could influence the purchase intention of online customers. This research provides a theoretical framework for the design decisions regarding websites in order to accommodate the salient features of online shopping.	e-commerce payment system;internet;online shopping;web design	Jaeki Song;Fatemeh Zahedi	2001			e-commerce;web design;computer science;marketing;advertising;world wide web	AI	-88.87235267728535	-12.101764191683555	162833

Facebook's third-party applications (apps) add an additional layer of complexity and confusion for users seeking to understand and manage their privacy. We conducted a novel exploratory survey (conducted on Facebook as a Platform app) to measure how Facebook app users interact with apps, what they understand about how apps access and exchange their profile information, and how these factors relate to their privacy concerns. In our analysis, we paid special attention to our most knowledgeable respondents: given their expertise, would they differ in behaviors or attitudes from less knowledgeable respondents? We found that misunderstandings and confusion abound about how apps function and how they manage profile data. Against our expectations, knowledge or behavior weren't consistent predictors of privacy concerns with third-party apps or on SNSs in general. Instead, whether or not the respondent experienced an adverse privacy event on a social networking site was a reliable predictor of privacy attitudes.	confusion matrix;facebook messenger;kerrison predictor;privacy	Jennifer King;Airi Lampinen;Alex Smolen	2011		10.1145/2078827.2078843	service provider;privacy software;computer science;internet privacy;privacy;world wide web;computer security;social network	Security	-89.41888583500712	-15.141647204471337	162987

Prior research on the conceptualization of social presence, the degree to which a person is perceived as real in a mediated communication, results in two lines of perspectives. The media richness view conceives social presence as a media attribute while the relational view considers social presence as a quality of relational systems, emphasizing the relational aspects of communication. Drawing upon the relational view of social presence, this research incorporates the commitment-trust theory to investigate the influence of social presence on virtual community members’ continual participation. Moreover, this research considers sense of virtual community (SOVC) as the mediator between social presence and virtual community participation. The contributions of this research are three-fold. First, this research contributes to social presence literature by focusing on the social relational aspects of communication that are dependent on the participants rather than on the medium. Second, this research examines the role and importance of social presence in SOVC and virtual community participation. Lastly, it helps clarify how social presence contributes to continual participation in virtual communities.	conceptualization (information science);digital media;social presence theory;trust metric;virtual community	Kai Wang;Jeffrey C.

Furthermore, consumers have the opportunity to respond to the organization’s posts about the crisis. Little is known, however, about how organizations should deal with online consumer comments to such posts. Therefore, the current study examines how organizations in crisis best deal with positive and negative consumer comments to an organizational crisis-related post. A 2 (tone of voice organizational response: personalized versus corporate) x 2 (consumer comment valence: positive versus negative) between-subjects experimental design (N = 264) was used to examine if a personalized organizational response to consumer comments is advisable to protect organizational reputation, and whether or not the desirability of it depends on the valence of these comments. Results show that a personalized organizational response to a consumer comment on an organizational crisis message post beneficially affects organizational reputation through higher perceptions of conversational human voice (CHV) and sequentially lower consumer skepticism. However, the effect of response personalization is not unanimously positive. When consumer comments are positive, a personalized organizational response damages organizational reputation due to increased consumer skepticism. The positive effect of a personalized response on organizational reputation through CHV disappeared when responding to positive consumer comments. When consumer reactions are negative, however, personalizing the organizational response is beneficial for organizational reputation due to increased perceptions of CHV.	personalization	Hannelore Crijns;Veroline Cauberghe;Liselot Hudders;An-Sofie Claeys	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.05.046	organizational commitment;organizational learning;personalization;social psychology	HCI	-89.32493374061914	-13.38039094926758	163284

A total of 455 Chinese elementary school students participated in two waves of a survey with a 6-month interval, and 19 of these students participated in focus group interviews. The results indicated that seeking schooland life-related information on the Internet predicted more life satisfaction and less loneliness through improved self-esteem. Furthermore, self-esteem moderated the effects of Internet information seeking on loneliness. Internet information seeking predicted less loneliness only for children with low self-esteem. A moderating role of self-esteem in the associations between Internet information seeking and life satisfaction was not found in this study. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A. Simon) in the article text were retrieved from JSTOR, a full-text database with broad disciplinary coverage. Two subsets were analyzed—a 10 % systematic sample of all records and a set of all articles in Economics journals (with the addition of the Journal of Economic Theory). A majority of articles in the 10 % sample came from Economics and Management journals, while Psychology was poorly represented. In the 10 % sample, based on the percentage of true implicit citations between 1992 and 2009 in the 80 % of records that had a catchphrase in the body of the article, rather than just in the reference list, annual OBI ranged from 0 to 70 % (mean 33 %) with no discernible trend. The Economics articles showed a narrower range of OBI—fluctuating around 40 % implicit citations over the same time period. In both data sets, a large proportion of indirect citations were to sources that themselves cited a relevant work by Simon. Over 90 % of the articles in both the 10 % sample and the economics journal set would not have been retrieved with a database record search because they lacked the catchphrase in the record fields.	bibliographic index;obi-wan's adventures;obliteration by incorporation;rationality;row (database);simon	Katherine W.

A “postwar famil” refers to a family in which: (1) men and women are married; (2) husbands work as regular employees and wives are dependent homemakers; and (3) husbands and wives seldom get divorced. Therefore, the social security system is particularly generous towards dependent wives and widows. However, these premises are no longer valid because Japanese nuptiality behavior has completely changed since the 1980s. Marriage rates have decreased and divorce rates have significantly increased. Nevertheless, society still suffers from a wage inequality between men and women. As a result, the number of never-married or divorced elderly women will increase, and these women might face a serious poverty risk in the future. In this study, the author makes simulations of the living arrangements and poverty rates for the elderly in Japan and evaluates the effect of changes in nuptiality behavior on these poverty rates using a dynamic microsimulation model. The simulation results indicate that changes in nuptiality behavior will affect the poverty rate for elderly women, but not for elderly men.

28d55558c8f039d4143620211c942827794fddf0	lack of quality discrimination in online information markets		Online social networks are marketplaces in which memes compete for our attention. While one would expect the best ideas to prevail, empirical evidence suggests that high-quality information has no competitive advantage. Here we investigate this puzzling lack of discriminative power through an agent-based model that incorporates behavioral limitations in managing a heavy flow of information and measures the relationship between the quality of an idea and its likelihood to become prevalent at the system level. We find that both information overload and limited attention contribute to a degradation in the market’s discriminative power. A good tradeoff between discriminative power and diversity of information is possible according to the model. However, calibration with empirical data characterizing information load and finite attention in real social media reveals a weak correlation between quality and popularity of information. In these realistic conditions, the model provides an interpretation for the high volume of viral misinformation we observe online. ∗These two authors contributed equally to this work †Corresponding author.

Our paper visualizes the results of author ranking with the consideration of authors’ contribution. In this paper, every author’s contribution to his/her field is calculated according to the co-authorship among papers. By extracting the papers and authors information from a field since they started publication, the co-author network are constructed. We also get the clusters partition of those authors by Girvan-Newman algorithm. For conducting detailed experiments to show the visualized our results, we select the field of Intelligent transportation system (ITS) as an example. Since thousands of papers were published by scientists each year in the ITS field, academic co-authorship in this field expands fast. We design our dataset composed by data from four journals in the ITS field to visualize our algorithm.	bibliometrics;social network	Xiujuan Xu;Ruisi Zhang;Zhenzhen Xu;Feng Ding;Xiaowei Zhao	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-46771-9_37	bibliometrics;data science;data mining;information retrieval	ML	-77.47209520061125	-19.17896844648986	163887

This paper seeks to provide a better understanding of the forces that influence the diffusion of the Internet in Singapore. A push-pull framework that incorporates the political, technological, economic, and social factors is developed as the basis for examining this phenomenon. Based on this framework, a content-analytic approach is used to analyze the messages conveyed in Singaporeu0027s two local English-medium newspapers. The results show that both push and pull forces predominated in the early stages of Internet diffusion. However, as time went by, the pull forces predominated over the push forces. The results also show that factors such as building telecommunication infrastructure, having on-line information and services, and creating business opportunities were important in the diffusion of the Internet in Singapore.

This research-in-progress paper aims to develop a measurement scale of Information Quality (IQ) for social Q&A from the perspective of the user perception. Based on the previous studies with a set of attributes, a conceptual framework of IQ in social Q&A context is developed. Five scholars in the IS field are also interviewed for helping us modify this scale. Baidu Knows, which is the most influential Chinese social Q&A website, is used to conduct the empirical study. This paper employs the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to test our preliminary measurement scale and make some further revisions. The findings show the IQ of social Q&A includes four dimensions, i.e., Content Quality, Source Quality, Performance Quality, and Emotion Quality with a total of 19 key indicators. This tentative study of IQ evaluation is effective in identifying high-quality answers on social Q&A sites. Moreover, it also has the potential to contribute to the interaction design of social Q&A sites.

7152fdbf6248721adfb9cff37d65057c9a8dd4c7	norms matter: contrasting social support around behavior change in online weight loss communities		Online health communities (OHCs) provide support across conditions; for weight loss, OHCs offer support to foster positive behavior change. However, weight loss behaviors can also be subverted on OHCs to promote disordered eating practices. Using comments as proxies for support, we use computational linguistic methods to juxtapose similarities and differences in two Reddit weight loss communities, r/proED and r/loseit. We employ language modeling and find that word use in both communities is largely similar. Then, by building a word embedding model, specifically a deep neural network on comment words, we contrast the context of word use and find differences that imply different behavior change goals in these OHCs. Finally, these content and context norms predict whether a comment comes from r/proED or r/loseit. We show that norms matter in understanding how different OHCs provision support to promote behavior change and discuss the implications for design and moderation of OHCs.	artificial neural network;computation;deep learning;judy array;language model;logistic regression;social support;word embedding	Stevie Chancellor;Andrea Hu;Munmun De Choudhury	2018		10.1145/3173574.3174240	multimedia;word embedding;disordered eating;social support;online health communities;social psychology;behavior change;language model;moderation;computer science;social media	HCI	-85.40302654934455	-19.564571772272995	164133

While using Facebook individuals like number of brands appearing on their news feed. The motivation for liking brands may be diverse for distinctive individuals. But whether liking a brand on fan page truly represents some emotional connection with the brand or not is still unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by determining whether liking a brand on Facebook results into brand love or is it just a fad. Further, the paper attempts to find whether there exists a relationship between brand “liked” on the fan page and purchase intention, and if this in turn leads to positive word of mouth. A survey of Facebook users who engage with the brand of small scale companies by “liking” it was undertaken as part of the study. The five small scale companies were selected on the basis of their popularity on Facebook. Structural equation modeling was applied using the data collected from 311 survey respondents to arrive at relevant outcomes.

This article makes a strong case for the relevance of the shift from the isolation experienced within these ‘non-moments’ towards an altered experience of this isolation, which has been moulded and partially broken by the possibility to share our dreams in real time, and communicate with our significant others (here, partners), while tearing us further apart from those who share with us these moments in the same place. The analysis of such non-moments will help us to shed light on how our intimate relationships are woven on a daily basis, and how electronic communication is part of a differentiation process in which we can share our imaginaries just as we produce them.

The study investigated participants' reported agreement regarding the characteristics of phishing attacks, types of media where phishing occurs and the consequences of phishing. A multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that there were significant differences in agreement regarding phishing characteristics, phishing consequences and types of media where phishing occurs for these three nationalities. Chronological age and education did not influence the agreement ratings; therefore, the samples were demographically equivalent with regards to these variables. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze the categorical variables and nationality data. Results based on self-report data indicated that (1) Indians were more likely to be phished than Americans, (2) Americans took protective actions more frequently than Indians by destroying old documents, and (3) Americans were more likely to notice the """"padlock"""" security icon than either Indian or Chinese respondents.

We introduce two different models that emphasize the role of publicity in representative systems. Jeremy Bentham argued that publicity is needed to enable citizens to control the acts of the representatives. From the perspective of Kantian tradition, recently developed by the theorists of deliberative democracy, publicity is regarded as a test for the validity of the reasons given for public decisions. According to many theorists of deliberative democracy, legislative assemblies can be regarded as central forums of public deliberation in representative democracies. We analyse the contents of the parliamentary websites in 18 democratic countries and find that these contents are rather similar in established democracies across the world. We argue that parliamentary websites can be instrumental to citizens' capacity to control the representatives in the Benthamite sense, although information provided on parliamentary websites does not necessarily provide a sufficient account of all aspects of parliamentary decision-making, most notably in party groups. From the deliberative perspective, however, publicity on parliamentary websites cannot replace the role of such mediating actors as journalists, political activists and parties who """"filter"""" and reflect upon the representatives' arguments and actions."""

The factors include journal impact factor, individual collaboration, international collaboration, institution prestige, country prestige, research funding, abstract readability, abstract length, title length, number of cited references, field size, and field type and will be modelled in association with citation counts, Mendeley readers, Twitter posts, Facebook posts, blog posts, and news posts. The results demonstrate that eight factors are important for increased citation counts, seven different factors are important for increased Mendeley readers, eight factors are important for increased Twitter posts, three factors are important for increased Facebook posts, six factors are important for increased blog posts, and five factors are important for increased news posts. Journal impact factor and international collaboration are the two factors that significantly associate with increased citation counts and with all altmetric scores. Moreover, it seems that the factors driving Mendeley readership are similar to those driving citation counts. However, the altmetric events differ from each other in terms of a small number of factors; for instance, institution prestige and country prestige associate with increased Mendeley readers and blog and news posts, but it is an insignificant factor for Twitter and Facebook posts. The findings contribute to the continued development of theoretical models and methodological developments associated with capturing, interpreting, and understanding altmetric events.	altmetrics;blog;ecosystem;mendeley;population;science communication;scientific literature;social media;theory	Fereshteh Didegah;Timothy D.

Yet, research on activism beyond organizational boundaries and the role that new technology may play in it is scarce. This study explores this phenomenon by studying the dynamics of social activism through the Internet for expressing resistance to a powerful organizational regime. We first develop a critical mass approach to online activism to understand longitudinal data (2009-2013) collected from three YouTube-based cases and supplementary interviews. We then integrate the results of within-case and cross-case analyses in a process model that explains how online activism started, generated societal outcomes, and changed over time. The model suggests that online activism helped organize collective actions and amplify the conditions for revolutionary movements to form. Yet, it provoked elites’ reactions such as Internet filtering and surveillance, which do not only promote self-censorship and generate digital divide, but contribute to the ultimate decline of activism over time. We provide a theoretical path for studying the phenomenon of online activism and present opportunities for organizations and social activists to direct online activities’ focus from one being based on the creation of ‘knowers’ to one based on the empowerment of ‘learners’.	content-control software;internet;process modeling;self-censorship	Shahla Ghobadi;Stewart Clegg	2015	Information and Organization	10.1016/j.infoandorg.2014.12.002	psychology;information asymmetry;public relations;digital divide;social science;economics;social movement;engineering;qualitative research;artificial intelligence;process modeling;sociology;critical mass;management;social psychology;law;economic growth;anthropology	Web+IR	-81.54870622739774	-15.036766617502469	164704

A cross-sectional survey research was used to collect the data from participants who had used one of these three social networking sites: Facebook, Instagram, and Line. All in all, the results showed that personality traits, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, attitude toward using SNS, social influence, and SNS usage did contribute to online social support satisfaction and frequency. Specifically, Agreeableness, perceived enjoyment, attitude toward using SNS, social influence, and the amount of Facebook use positively predicted support satisfaction. In addition, perceived usefulness, social influence, the number of friends on Facebook and Line, and the amount of time on Instagram positively predicted overall support frequency.	cross-sectional data;instagram;social support;usability	Vikanda Pornsakulvanich	2017	Computers in Human Behavior	10.1016/j.chb.2017.07.021	agreeableness;psychology;social psychology;knowledge management;social competence;usability;online social support;social network;social influence;personality;big five personality traits	HCI	-87.4650433559087	-19.137597741219103	164707
81c16c1ea5252497cec77d74b54957af22aaea52	fairness in technological design	social justice;models theoretical;technology;humans	This paper addresses an important multi-disciplinary issue of current interest, that is, the implications of technological design for fairness. A visual, graphical methodology centered on the Taylor-Russell diagram is proposed to address this issue. The Taylor-Russell diagram helps to identify and explore ways in which predictions built into designs can pit the interests of different constituencies against one another. The configuration of the design represents a trade-off between the interests of the communities involved. Whether or not the trade-off is appropriate constitutes a problem of fairness or distributive justice. The breadth of this methodology is supported by a diversity of examples analyzed. These include a surveillance system, an automotive safety system, a civic information system, and the international food distribution system. These examples provide models for application of the methodology to the analysis of designs in further areas of concern. Limitations of the methodology are also discussed. While it helps to identify and clarify issues of fairness in technology design, the methodology does not provide a general theory of fairness, nor can it provide fair solutions to such issues without appeal to further principles or concepts.	addresses (publication format);automotive occupations;community;diagram;fairness measure;graphical user interface;information system;numerous;solutions;interest	Cameron Shelley	2012	Science and engineering ethics	10.1007/s11948-011-9259-1	psychology;computer science;engineering;management science;sociology;social psychology;operations research;law;technology	EDA	-77.4955892902125	-12.976158893450146	164843

This exploratory study focuses on the outcome of the job searches of skilled PRC immigrants. Local employers rarely recognize the immigrants' human capital as indicated by their foreign credentials and work experience. Immigrants can alter this reception somewhat by sending 'signals' to prospective employers that do not denote these foreign attributes. We compare three job search paths - social networks, employment agents, and the Internet - to describe how each constructs and filters 'signals' about their capabilities and appropriateness for various jobs. We then determine which path results in better employment. Analyzing data from 303 respondents to our online survey and 28 follow-up interviews, our results suggest that the Internet is the best path to obtain good employment, measured by job status	credential;foreign key;internet;job stream;norm (social);prospective search;social network	Arent Greve;Janet W.

Therefore, a model that went beyond intention and included key relational concepts (satisfaction, value, loyalty, etc.) was developed. Trust and its components are a major part of this model, which was based on strong theoretical foundations. Fifteen hypotheses were formulated. Data on the constructs were collected from 420 respondents and analyzed using elliptical re-weighted least squares as the estimation method to test model validity and the hypotheses. An additional relationship between satisfaction and customer loyalty was investigated. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed.	e-commerce;ibm tivoli access manager;least squares;risk assessment;unified model	Prashant Palvia	2009	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2009.02.003	psychology;e-commerce;the internet;systems modeling;consumer;transaction processing;relational database;computer science;artificial intelligence;marketing;unified model;sociology;advertising;confidence;trustworthy computing;management;social psychology;least squares;world wide web	AI	-91.87613602005108	-10.774819355301695	164886

With the ordered logistic regression model, we find that social norms and social supports from online social ties positive related with both dietary and exercise behavior. We also find that the competing relationship gets a stronger relationship with behavior than the mutual support relationship. This study extends the research on health behavior to online social environment. The result could be used for guiding users to make use of online social ties for changing and keeping health behavior, and for helping the healthcare website improve their services.	exploratory testing;logistic regression;norm (social);ordered logit;social support	Yumei Li;Xiangbin Yan;Yong Tan	2016	2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)	10.1109/HICSS.2016.94	public relations;interpersonal ties;social learning;social competence;health belief model;shape;social engagement;role;socioeconomics;social position;norm;social determinants of health;online participation	HCI	-87.4757517630336	-20.140509556543712	165437

Managing customer relationship through social media engagement has become an important component of successful electronic marketing strategies. Though the concept of customer engagement has received considerable attention in the business community, there is a paucity of theory-guided empirical research in customer engagement in an online social platform. More importantly, there is a lack of consensus regarding its definition, forms, dimensionality, and operationalization. This study addresses these limitations in part by theoretically conceptualizing and empirically validating a scale to measure customer engagement in an online social platform. In this research-in-progress paper, we present our conceptual model of customer engagement and propose a rigorous approach in scale development and validation. The authors believe that this research will contribute to the development of online community literature and add to the repository of rigorous research instruments for researchers to use.	customer relationship management;new media;online community;social media	Christy M.

cfbe2a2314bbe7213e2a23b3c430da9760fc6462	social structural behavior of deception in computer-mediated communication		Abstract Deception essentially takes place in social interaction. While deception has been studied from the perspective of interpersonal interaction, little is known about social structural characteristics of deceptive communication. To fill the knowledge gap, this research investigates deception behavior in computer mediated communication (CMC) via the lens of social structure by answering the questions of how one deceiver socially interacts with multiple receivers and what structural characteristics can be used to delineate deception in CMC. To this end, we first conceptualize deception in terms of social structure by drawing on the interpersonal deception and social network theories. We then propose a model of structural behaviors of deception in CMC that consists of three components: centrality, cohesion, and similarity, followed by an empirical evaluation of the model with real-world data collected from a game website. The findings of this study provide new evidence that deception is a strategic activity where the deceiver juggles between the dual goals of promoting his or her deceptive agenda and avoiding detection.	computer-mediated communication	Jinie Pak;Lina Zhou	2014	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2013.08.010	artificial intelligence	ECom	-82.9317062673415	-17.523663952500556	165600

Hence, understanding what SB means to the public would provide businesses with additional insights that they could apply to social promotion and marketing. We retrieved more than 200,000 tweets containing the words “social business” and utilized text mining algorithms to extract the SB status. The mining results provide marketers with insights that they can apply when making decisions about SB marketing and promotion and provide policymakers with the information necessary to design an SB ecosystem. Our approach contributes a broad view on SB to the literature and differs from conventional methods, such as case studies, surveys, and statistical analyses.	social media	Chien-Wen Shen;Jung-Tsung Ho	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-93803-5_52	social business;data mining;social promotion;social media;computer science;marketing;public opinion;text mining	HCI	-79.32457307282688	-16.640698454927833	165674

However, the factors that act as systematic and heuristic processing cues and affect the success of persuasion have not been adequately described in social lending contexts. This research examines the effectiveness of systematic and heuristic cues in persuasive requests in Kiva lending teams intended to convince members to donate. An analysis of 88,596 requests exchanged in 1,610 teams shows that certain heuristic processing cues (e.g., liking between requesters and potential lenders, advocates low authority in their teams and the importance of the team to the lender) strongly predicted whether lenders would contribute to a loan request. In contrast, cues that required systematic processing are less influential. We also found that behavioral cues are more important than verbal ones. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our work.	heuristic;peer-to-peer lending;theory	Diyi Yang;Robert E.

Although learners retain choice and personal agency, even the most neutral-seeming technological environment may encourage some ways of interacting whilst discouraging others. Taking a constructionist perspective, the authors first compare peer-to-peer interaction in online and face-to-face environments. Online self-presentation is adjusted using identity management tools. These tools may provide efficient ways to locate and interact with other learners as well as protection mechanisms for personal information. In particular, the authors discuss the effects of anonymity and pseudonymity on trust and social capital. To illustrate these concepts, the authors discuss two social networking systems, iHelp and The Landing...	systems architecture	Marguerite Koole;Gale Parchoma	2012	Interactive Learning Environments	10.1080/10494820.2011.593526	psychology;educational technology;social science;knowledge management;sociology;communication;management;social psychology;world wide web;pedagogy;social network	HCI	-81.6853532590636	-13.744775024840417	165864

The results of the study show computer self-efficacy, compatibility, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use have a great positive effect, and computer anxiety has a great negative effect, on the behavioral intention to use online learning courses. By explaining adolescents' behavioral intentions from a user's perspective, the findings of this research provide insight into the best way to promote new e-learning tools for adolescents.

In this work, a source normalization of the journal impact factor is proposed. We use the aggregate impact factor of the citing journals as a measure of the citation potential in the journal topic, and we employ this citation potential in the normalization of the journal impact factor to make it comparable between scientific fields. An empirical application comparing some impact indicators with our topic normalized impact factor in a set of 224 journals from four different fields shows that our normalization, using the citation potential in the journal topic, reduces the betweengroup variance with respect to the within-group variance in a higher proportion than the rest of indicators analysed. The effect of journal self-citations over the normalization process is also studied.	aggregate data	Pablo Dorta-González;María-Isabel Dorta-González;Dolores-Rosa Santos-Peñate;Rafael Suárez-Vega	2014	J.

Volume 22, Article 1, pp. 1-32, January 2008 Citation counts of refereed articles are a potentially valuable measure of the impact of a researcher's work, in the information systems discipline as in many others. Citation counts can be generated from a number of data collections, including Thomson’s ISI database and Google Scholar. This paper reports on an exploratory study of the apparent impact of IS researchers, as disclosed by citation counts of their works in those two collections. Citation analysis using currently available databases is found to be fraught with many serious problems, particularly if the ISI collection is used. Unless these problems are appreciated and addressed, IS researchers will be under-valued by those with authority over research funding and employment, to the serious detriment of the IS discipline.	citation analysis;database;exploratory testing;google scholar;information sciences institute;information systems;information system	Roger Clarke	2008	CAIS		public relations;interstimulus interval;world wide web	Web+IR	-78.54256606413144	-21.08376414189749	165935

Here we present evidence of a network effect which biases the digital reputations of the users of P2P networks, showing that P2P networks display exceedingly high levels of reciprocity. In fact, these are so large that they are close to the highest levels structurally compatible with the networks’ reputation landscape. This shows that the crowdsourcing process underpinning digital reputation is significantly distorted by the attempt of users to mutually boost reputation, or to retaliate, through the exchange of ratings. We show that the least active users are predominantly responsible for such reciprocity-induced bias, and that this fact can be exploited to suppress the bias itself.	aggregate data;crowdsourcing;peer-to-peer;reputation	Giacomo Livan;Fabio Caccioli;Tomaso Aste	2016	CoRR		public relations;computer security	ECom	-85.38968087229716	-14.964577272876431	165983

The lifetime citations are counted by hand of the leaders of the world’s top 100 universities identified in a global university ranking. These numbers are then normalized by adjusting for the different citation conventions across academic disciplines. Two statistical measures are used -Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's rho. This study documents a positive correlation between the lifetime citations of a University’s president and the position of that university in the global ranking. Better universities are run by better researchers. The results are not driven by outliers. That the top universities in the world -who have the widest choice of candidates -systematically appoint top researchers as their vice chancellors and presidents seems important to understand. This paper also shows that the pattern of presidents life-time citations follows a version of Lotka’s power law. There are two main areas of contribution. First, this paper attempts to use bibliometric data to address a performancerelated question of a type not seen before (to the author’s knowledge). Second, despite the importance of research to research universities -as described in many mission-statements -no studies currently exist that ask whether it matters if the head of a research university is himself or herself a committed researcher. Given the importance of universities in the world, and the difficulty that many have in appointing leaders, this question seems pertinent.	bibliometrics;coefficient;relevance	Amanda H.

In Crowdfunding, the sentimental factor of the text description may impact the backersu0027 investment intention on the project. The authors study the textual description from the sentimental aspect on the pledge results by employing text mining. The study proves that positive sentiment in the blurb and detailed description promotes the successful campaigns while it should not contain any sentimental factor in title. The predictive analysis shows that the predictive accuracy can be improved 7% based on the baseline model after considering sentimental factors from 64.4% to 71.7%.	crowdfunding;text mining	Wei Wang;Kevin Zhu;Hongwei Wang;Yen-Chun Jim Wu	2017	IET Software	10.1049/iet-sen.2016.0295	systems engineering;marketing;pledge;computer science;user-generated content;social status;internet privacy;personality;text mining	HCI	-87.7941167471976	-12.616165217562234	166069

In December 2008, the Mozillavariant ‘niche’ browser, Blackbird, was released. Blackbird’s cultural affiliation with African American users became the rupture for pundits and early adopters. It was derided as racist, unnecessary, and pejorative to the actual needs of Black internet users. This article examines the racial and technological discourses surrounding Blackbird’s release on technology and cultural blogs. Findings indicate that racial ideologies play a factor in the reception of this culturally themed ICT artifact.	blog;information literacy;steam rupture	André Brock	2011	New Media & Society	10.1177/1461444810397031	cyberculture;discourse analysis;sociology;advertising;communication;world wide web;culture;computer-mediated communication;race	HCI	-81.7861149970847	-16.876710760381624	166151

We found that Chinese managers were more likely than US managers to categorize attempts to outperform others as an instance of both competition and cooperation. Further, the Chinese managers were more likely than the US managers to perceive a given working relationship as being both cooperative and competitive. The two findings were linked: culturally-guided beliefs about whether the cooperation-competition paradox should be integrated or kept separate influenced how individuals understood their social relationships. More broadly, the implication is that category membership and relations between categories are guided by cultural influences distinct from the particulars of the categories themselves that normally enter into cognitive science research on categories. In addition, those categorization choices are consequential for the network of social relationships individuals form.	categorization;chinese room;cognitive science	Joshua Keller;Jeffrey Loewenstein;Martin Kilduff;Jin Yan	2013			social psychology;diplomacy;streams;categorization;ranging;china;beijing;sociology;mutually exclusive events;cultural studies	ML	-81.99155933105841	-14.682574193032183	166309

For years, researchers have purported that individuals often act out more frequently, impulsively, or intensely in online mediums compared to face-to-face mediums. This is the ODE effect. Yet, the toxic aspects of ODE, such as rudeness, aggression, animosity, and disrespect appear to be increasing in social networking sites (SNS); users express resignation and frustration over angry and disrespectful tone and content. As an antidote, we would be wise to consider a bedrock of the aforementioned Judeo-Christian tradition: humility. If we sift our behaviors in the digital realm through the filter of humility, our digital humility would open wide the sluices for respect to flow. Humility births civility. With digital humility, we contemplate our effect on others when we post, send, or click. We courageously self-reflect to assess if our online presence could be less boastful and more unpretentious. We think more about others, and less about ourselves.		Christine Perakslis	2017	IEEE Technol. Soc.

5730b2eb087d2c5ae4212553e1b6571675bcdc6a	credibility in online social networks: a survey		The importance of information credibility in society cannot be underestimated given that it is at the heart of all decision-making. Generally, more information is better; however, knowing the value of this information is essential for the decision-making processes. Information credibility defines a measure of the fitness of the information for consumption. It can also be defined in terms of reliability, which denotes the probability that a data source will appear credible to the users. A challenge in this topic is that there is a great deal of literature that has developed different credibility dimensions. In addition, information science dealing with online social networks has grown in complexity, attracting interest from researchers in information science, psychology, human–computer interaction, communication studies, and management studies, all of whom have studied the topic from different perspectives. This work will attempt to provide an overall review of the credibility assessment literature over the period 2006–2017 as applied to the context of the microblogging platform, Twitter. The known interpretations of credibility will be examined, particularly as they relate to the Twitter environment. In addition, we investigate levels of credibility assessment features. We then discuss recent works, addressing a new taxonomy of credibility analysis and assessment techniques. At last, a cross-referencing of literature is performed while suggesting new topics for future studies of credibility assessment in a social media context.

Its meaning has been stretched to apply to experiences ranging from the mundane to the exceptional. Serendipity, however, is consistently associated with unexpected and positive personal, scholarly, scientific, organizational, and societal events and discoveries. Diverse serendipitous experiences share a conceptual space; therefore, what lessons can we draw from an exploration of how serendipity unfolds and what may influence it? This article describes an investigation of work-related serendipity. Twelve professionals and academics from a variety of fields were interviewed. The core of the semi-structured interviews focused on participants’ own work-related experiences that could be recalled and discussed in depth. This research validated and augmented prior research while consolidating previous models of serendipity into a single model of the process of serendipity, consisting of: Trigger, Connection, Follow-up, and Valuable Outcome, and an Unexpected Thread that runs through 1 or more of the first 4 elements. Together, the elements influence the Perception of Serendipity. Furthermore, this research identified what factors relating to the individual and their environment may facilitate the main elements of serendipity and further influence its perception.	experience;recommender system;semiconductor industry	Lori McCay-Peet;Elaine Toms	2015	JASIST	10.1002/asi.23273	information model;computer science;qualitative research	HCI	-81.92834483399116	-20.508309667014593	167110

Seventy-six college students were included in this study and had completed the Internet use function questionnaire (social function, informational function, leisure function and the virtual emotional function) and the Chinese Internet Addiction Scale (compulsive use, withdrawal, tolerance, time management problem and interpersonal and health problems). The study revealed not only the relationship between the social function and the index of the Internet dependence (compulsive use, withdrawal, tolerance and the problems in the interpersonal relationship and health), but also the correlation between the information function and the index of the Internet abuse (the problems in the interpersonal relationship and health).

Perceptible relational problems, such as strain and changes to relational rules, originate from three commonly experienced transgressions on social networking sites: having a friend request declined or ignored, having a public message or identification tag deleted, and issues related to Top Friends applications. This investigation examines factors that contribute to the experience of relational problems following the three most common relational transgressions over social networking sites. The findings reveal that self-esteem, relational satisfaction, and publicness of the event, moderated by network esteem, affect the magnitude of the relational problems. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
