By taking the research groups as Decision Making Units (DMUs), the budget of the projects and size of the groups as inputs and the quantity and quality of publications produced by the groups as outputs of the model, the relative efficiencies of 21 research projects are evaluated. Then, we move to focus on the issues of knowledge management of the organizations that undertook these projects and attempt to explore the underlying reasons of high research efficiency. Through integrating the evaluation outcomes into research process, three indicators of knowledge management are identified for the best practice groups with highest research efficiency. The findings verify that the proposed model is valid and practical to assess research performances on the basis of bibliometric indicators.	best practice;bibliometrics;data envelopment analysis;information science;knowledge management;performance	Jiancheng Guan;Junxia Wang	2004	Scientometrics	10.1023/B:SCIE.0000013303.25298.ae	productivity;bibliometrics;scientometrics;computer science;operations management;evaluation;chine;management;operations research;world wide web;china;best practice	SE	-83.83949577796508	8.965826611120763	90219

Tourism product design and development have become important activities in many areas/countries as a growing source of foreign and domestic earnings. On the other hand, customer relationship management is a competitive strategy that businesses need in order to stay focused on the needs of their customers and to integrate a customer-oriented approach throughout the organization. Thus, this paper uses the Apriori algorithm as a methodology for association rules and clustering analysis for data mining, which is implemented for mining customer knowledge from the case firm, Phoenix Tours International, in Taiwan. Knowledge extraction from data mining results is illustrated as knowledge patterns, rules, and knowledge maps in order to propose suggestions and solutions to the case firm for new product development and customer relationship management. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The new challenges facing DoD missions and IT applications require DOD’s traditional needs for the IT enterprise to be transformed into a powerful infrastructure of new-generation technology. The new technology must provide capabilities to collect, process, and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of secure information, logistics, and knowledge that will support dispersed and mobile services to users anywhere, and at any time. The goal is to provide such an improved infrastructure. GIG will allow unfettered collaboration among DoD services and users with high levels of agility.	centralized computing;data security;emergence;global information grid;information logistics	Raymond A.

Using novel data collected from a career intelligence website, we study whether and why high-tech firms rely more heavily on non-wage benefits, such as free meals, transportation subsidies, and athletic facilities (“work-related perks”). We find that employers engaged in IT innovation are more likely to offer work-related perks, but not more traditional non-wage benefits such as health insurance and retirement. Additionally, we find that these perks are correlated with demand for on-the-job skill acquisition and the longer work hours this skill acquisition requires. These findings suggest that high-tech firms offer work-related perks to attract and motivate IT workers who can quickly adapt to technological change.	technical support	Xuan Ye;Prasanna Tambe	2015			technological change;marketing;subsidy;computer science;high tech;dreyfus model of skill acquisition	HCI	-85.51243532343014	6.334580054017705	91233

So far, stakeholder models in the e-government context focus on individual stakeholder perspectives. They do not show or analyze interactions between stakeholders in detail. However, taking stakeholders’ interactions into account is important, since stakeholders influence each other - which can result in a change of their perspectives. Hence, our contribution illustrates how a stakeholder interaction model helps identifying different stakeholder perspectives. Therefore, we reviewed literature on existing stakeholder models. Besides, we conducted a stakeholder analysis in an e-government project in Germany and elicited stakeholders, assigned them to corresponding categories and modeled a stakeholder interaction model. Finally, we compared the findings of the literature review with the developed model. This contribution enlarges the theoretical foundations of the e-government research field. The stakeholder interaction model can be used by practitioners to identify stakeholders and their interactions.

The hypotheses were tested to predict whether functions and sectors influence the formal of governance between relational versus classical. The findings suggest that development purpose and high sectors predict relational governance, while marketing/sales functions and low technology sector predict classical (arms-length) alliances. However, contrary to the expectation, real estate as a low technology sector predicts relational rather than classical alliances.	coat of arms	Abdullah A.

Recently, for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), these elements have represented a challenge and an opportunity for the consolidation of innovation processes, knowledge protection, and the path to sustained profitability. The aim of this paper is to analyse the effects of ICT on KM and their link with innovation and intellectual property (IP) in order to identify how SMEs can achieve higher yields. The data were obtained from a self-directed survey administered to the managers of 412 industrial and service companies established in Northwestern Mexico. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for the statistical analysis of the data.

Major concerns are the relationship between push and pull technologies, and the role of platforms, service innovation, power and control in ecosystems. As the first step in their mixed-method research approach, using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a research approach and the STOF business model as a research framework, the authors aim to identify design issues for m-payment services from mobile network operators' perspectives. Furthermore, the authors compare insights from semi-structured interviews with experts in the field to the empirical findings, to assess how the actual business model of Chinese m-payment services can be improved based on design issues derived from the business model. The results show that components such as building customer trust on payment services, innovative payment experience, and extend market to new segments, guarantee security and privacy issues, user profile management, and hardware problems involving existing infrastructure, customer/merchant relationship, platform interoperability, and cost saving on fraud detection need to be improved to enhance the potential of m-payment, supported by a viable and sustainable business model. There is also a role for policy and regulation to be played.	mobile payment	Jie Guo;Shahrokh Nikou;Harry Bouwman	2015	IJSSOE	10.4018/IJSSOE.2015040102	artifact-centric business process model;database;mobile business development;management;new business development;world wide web;computer security	ECom	-78.59894674871988	6.598683975243828	92405

We propose and test a model that analyses the influence of firms' previous experience and environmental factors on e-B2B adoption and the effects of e-B2B adoption on the perceived benefits and the intention to continue adopting B2B. Our results show that the more e-B2B is used in SMEs, the higher the level of perceived benefits and this, in turn, has a positive influence on the intention to continue doing B2B e-commerce. Managerial implications of these findings are also discussed.

5d221f9c962ca339b1fff843d6f661409422a04d	the use of experts panels in erp cost estimation research	peer reviewed;chapter	This paper is an effort towards illustrating the use of expert panel (EP) as a mean of eliciting knowledge from a group of enterprise resource planning (ERP) experts as an exploratory research. The development of a cost estimation model (CEM) for ERP adoptions is very crucial for research and practice, and that was the main reason behind the willingness of experts to participate in this research. The use of EP was very beneficial as it involved various data collection and visualisation techniques, as well as data validation and confirmation. Beside its advantages, one of the main motives for using a group technique is that it is difficult to find a representative sample for a casual survey method, as ERP experts and consultants are rare to find, especially in the scope of SMEs’ ERP implementations. It is worth noting that the panel reached consensus regarding the results of the EP. The experts modified and enhanced the initial cost drivers (CD) list largely, as they added, modified, merged and split different costs drivers. In addition, the experts added CF (sub-factors) that could influence or affect each cost driver. Moreover, they ranked the CD according to their weight on total costs. All of this helped the authors to better understand relationships among various CF.	data validation;erp;enterprise resource planning;expectation propagation;expert system;point of view (computer hardware company)	Ahmed Elragal;Moutaz Haddara	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16419-4_10	peer review;computer science;data science;data mining;operations research;world wide web	DB	-82.90891412434566	9.891520776368589	93612

Collaboration demands additional management effort. Project management needs to coordinate the three levels of participating organizations, virtual teams and representatives. Three project lifecycle management functions, which relate to collaboration formation, initiative development, and the take-up and implementation of ebusiness, create extra management challenges. Project management needs to focus on four “meta factors” derived from the critical success factors used by practitioners and identified by researchers. These “meta factors” are motivation, capability, communication and coordination. This summary paper proposes that these ten concepts (three levels, three lifecycle management functions and four “meta” factors) need to be addressed in a theoretical framework capable of supporting effective management of ebusiness collaborative projects, providing an understanding of outcomes and reducing failure.	best practice;bridging (networking);electronic business;failure rate;file spanning;gap analysis;interaction;systems development life cycle	Julie Cameron	2005			program management;opm3;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science;project management 2.0;project management triangle	HCI	-78.15930023837248	6.5445939299577045	94304

Traditionally, many accountants believed the most effective standards were those set by industrial engineers with the participation of operating managers to be evaluated. However, some accountants argue that such standards set by the Engineering Approach cannot verify if the standards are too loose or too rigid and fail to provide sufficient incentives for employees to improve beyond the standards. Limitations of the Engineering Approach arise from an ever-changing industrial environment. Under fluctuating circumstances, human deduction and thinking processes utilize non-binary logic and therefore contain fuzzy factors. With fuzzy factors excluded from the Engineering Approach, its ability to reflect problems is doubtful. This paper combines the fuzzy Delphi method with industrial standard costing so as to develop a convergent gray zone test (CGZT). The CGZT not only includes fuzziness but also effectively tests appropriateness of setting standards in an unstable climate. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This study focuses on global similarities and differences in technology trends (e.g., management concerns, influential technologies, budgets/spending, organizational considerations) among geographies to gain insight into the challenges that IT and non-IT executives face today as well as provide an understanding of the impact these technologies have on the organization’s long-term plans and investments. The results for the 11-year period show that the top five management concerns are: (i) IT-business alignment; (ii) business agility; (iii) business cost reduction/controls; (iv) business productivity; and (v) security/privacy. The five most influential technologies are: (i) analytics/business intelligence; (ii) cloud computing; (iii) ERP systems; (iv) CRM systems; and (v) security technologies. Taken together, these findings suggest that the alignment of IT and the business and leveraging IT to reduce business expenses and generate revenue are and will remain essential. The results also suggest that the role of the CIO is evolving and offshore outsourcing is on the rise. Budgets, hiring, and salaries are also increasing, albeit cautiously. This research provides important implications for IT managers to benchmark considerations such as organizational, sourcing, spending, issues/concerns, and technologies across geographies, and sheds light on a perspective on leveraging important IT trends to make thoughtful decisions about them over the coming years, and address current business	benchmark (computing);chief information officer;cloud computing;customer relationship management;erp;emoticon;enterprise resource planning;outsourcing;procurement	Jerry N.

A review of existing work on enterprise systems benefits reveals that current frameworks pay limited attention to contextual and temporal variations, socio-technical and business change, and levels of benefit realization. This research study investigates the complex mix of expected and realized benefits specifically arising from ERP systems. The aim is to address the limitations of current frameworks and extend theoretical understandings to provide a richer picture of ERP benefits and their contextual variation. Drawing on data gathered from more than 60 case study organizations of differing size, maturity and industry sector the study adopts an iterative content analysis to empirically derive a comprehensive benefits framework. The extended classification and the methodology used to construct it are presented and discussed along with their implications for future research and practice.	capability maturity model;erp;enterprise resource planning;enterprise system;iterative method;sociotechnical system	Petra Schubert;Susan P.

A corporate network is made up of LANs linked by WANs. This paper provides a framework for its performance management. The framework, in the form of a life cycle, is broken down into demand forecasting, internetworking, data distribution, local configuration, performance evaluation, and system operation. By viewing a corporate network as an integrated entity, this framework replaces an ineffective and often ad hoc approach with structured and integrated management. A transaction delay model is proposed for managing user performance effectively. Furthermore, a design support system is developed and a real-life case is illustrated to demonstrate the applicability of the framework and model.		Heeseok Lee;Jongwon Lee;Sufi M.

Given their limited resources, exporting is one of the most viable modes of entry into foreign markets for SMEs. The present study is an attempt to contribute to the research that identifies the factors associated with SME export performance. Specifically, the association between top management team demographic composition and SME export performance was examined in an emerging market context and drawing from upper echelons perspective. Focusing on such commonly examined upper echelons attributes as age, education level, and tenure, the present research assessed whether top management team composition distinguished between SMEs in terms of their export levels. Data were collected from 128 SMEs operating in Ankara and Bursa regions of Turkey. Results obtained by a hierarchical regression analysis indicated that SMEs with lower mean industry tenure and higher age separation diversity had higher levels of export performance.		F.

Little is known, however, about firms' IT signaling propensities. Here, contents of firms' press releases and annual reports are coded to test a model explaining a firm's propensity to signal stakeholders about its IT-related activities. Results demonstrate that firms transmitting greater numbers of IT signals tend to be low performers in their industries, tend to reside in industries characterized by a transform industry IT strategic role and tend to be larger. Implications of these findings for research design are provided.	archive;transmitter	Robert W. Zmud;Teresa M. Shaft;Weijun Zheng;Henry Croes	2010	J.

2bbc131e2e04ec51ba8c217901ca071c5ef189df	towards a market entry framework for digital payment platforms		This study presents a framework to understand and explain the design and configuration of digital payment platforms and how these platforms create conditions for market entries. By embracing the theoretical lens of platform envelopment, we employed a multiple and comparative-case study in a European setting by using our framework as an analytical lens to assess market-entry conditions. We found that digital payment platforms have acquired market entry capabilities, which is achieved through strategic platform design (i.e., platform development and service distribution) and technology design (i.e., issuing evolutionary and revolutionary payment instruments). The studied cases reveal that digital platforms leverage payment services as a mean to bridge and converge core and adjacent platform markets. In so doing, platform envelopment strengthens firms’ market position in their respective core markets. This study contributes to the extant literature on digital platforms, market entries, and payment.	converge	Erol Kazan;Jan Damsgaard	2016	CAIS		marketing;commerce	ECom	-77.56970990144971	6.164850939051398	95426

Traditionally, researchers studying the diffusion of information technology innovations regard “adoption” of technologies by individual and organizations the dependent variable. This paper breaking away from tradition quips what if we regard critical mass the dependent variable? Critical mass seems an appealing dependent variable for an e-market can attain critical mass only when adequate number of end users adopt and participate. However, critical mass can be regarded the dependent variable only when we are able to predictively measure critical mass. Potential adopters’ expectation regarding an e-market’s profitability is proposed a measure for critical mass. Critical mass is explained here a moving target. The exact point in time at which an e-market would attain critical mass cannot be specified just as the market equilibrium in reality cannot be specified.

6acb30bfe8677d39c82324955332414da9f22bfc	an analytical framework for exploring context-specific micro-economic impacts of ict capabilities		ABSTRACTIncreasing investments in ICT is often premised on the assumption that such investments will lead to improvements in productivity and other aspects of development at the organizational and national levels. However, it is reasonable to expect that any such impact will vary depending on the context, including the ability to modify and manipulate a chain of intermediate links within the “investments in ICT → outcomes of investments in ICT” process. In this study, we present a new framework for exploring context-specific impacts of ICT capabilities on microeconomic outcomes. The proposed framework is tested within the context of 24 economies that fall into a set of five mutually exclusive economy groups, where group membership is based on a classification scheme of the International Monetary Fund (2011). The results of the data analysis yield (1) a set of context-specific factors that differentiate five economy groups in terms of the microeconomic impact of ICT, and (2) offer insights into specific ar...

Most conventional business process analyses focus on qualitative methodologies, but these lack solid measurement for supporting the business process improvement. Therefore, a quantitative methodology using an activity model that is described in this paper is proposed. This model involves the use of an adjacent matrix to empirically identify inefficient and ineffective activity looping, after which the business process flow can then be improved. With the proposed quantitative methodology, a time series intervention ARIMA model is used to measure the intervention effects and the asymptotic change in the simulation results of the business process reengineering that is based on the activity model analysis. The approach is illustrated by a case study of a purchasing process of a household appliance manufacturing enterprise that involves 20 purchasing activities. The results indicate that the changes can be explicitly quantified and the effects of BPR can be measured. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

7dd9ae7dfdd5f66824266563503b1e79500ba928	business challenges of online banking portals		During the last few years, the growing interest in the banking industry on the Internet has led to the development from simple banking Web sites into comprehensive online banking portals (OBP). These portals offer a great variety of services in addition to traditional bank products and thereby enable customers to obtain financial advice from a single source. Very few contributions in the academic and business literature concerned OBP compared to other topics dealing with banking in general such as adoption factors and customer acceptance studies. This chapter could be a major contribution in this field by bridging the gap in the literature. It gives a comprehensive definition of OBP and analyses the diversity of competitive, technical and strategic challenges faced by banks on the Internet.

We characterize each customer by her intrinsic preference towards each firm, the contribution margin she generates for each firm, and her responsiveness to each firm’s retention and acquisition efforts. We show that a firm should invest most heavily in retaining those customers that exhibit moderate responsiveness to its CRM efforts. Further, a firm should most aggressively seek to attract those customers that exhibit moderate responsiveness to their provider’s CRM efforts and those that are moderately profitable for their current provider. Investing more in customers that are more responsive does not always lead to higher firm profits, because stronger competition for such customers tends to erode the effects of higher CRM efforts of an individual firm. When firms develop a customer relationship over time to generate higher contribution margin or customer responsiveness, we show that such developments may not always be desirable, because sometimes these future benefits may lead to more intense competition and hence lower profits for both firms.	artificial intelligence;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;customer relationship management;dd (unix);fo (complexity);information trust institute;lu decomposition;linear algebra;nist hash function competition;numerical aperture;proactive parallel suite;responsiveness;schmidt decomposition;terabyte;web service	Andrés Musalem;Yogesh V.

While these initiatives are typically undertaken in the quest for improved firm performance and competitiveness, empirical research to date has been equivocal in supporting the efficacy of these initiatives. In addition, extant research has not thoroughly examined factors or conditions that may influence or moderate the performance impact of workforce downsizing. In this paper, we address the question: Do industry conditions moderate the impact of workforce downsizing on firm performance? We examine this question using matched primary and secondary data on a sample of U,S, manufacturing firms. After controlling for a set of industry and firm-level variables, including firms' prior performance levels, our results indicate that downsizing is associated with decreases in subsequent firm profitability and that these negative effects are more pronounced in industries characterized by research and development (R&D) intensity, growth, and low capital intensity.	competitive analysis (online algorithm);software performance testing	James P.

8b1dcd58fa931f7de31b071b413293ef07160195	evaluating the impact of virtualization characteristics on saas adoption		ABSTRACTSoftware as a service (SaaS) is a service model in which the applications are accessible from various client devices through internet. Several studies report possible factors driving the adoption of SaaS but none have considered the perception of the SaaS features and the organization’s context. We propose an integrated research model that combines the process virtualization theory (PVT), the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and the institutional theory (INT). PVT seeks to explain whether processes are suitable for migration into virtual environments via an information technology-based mechanism as SaaS. The TOE framework seeks to explain the effects of the intra-organizational factors, while INT seeks to explain the effects of the inter-organizational factors on the technology adoption. This research addresses a gap in the SaaS adoption literature by studying the internal perception of the technical features of SaaS and technology, organization, and environment perspectives. Ad...

23144524a58c65e4b43a91096f07cf5abb9648c7	integrated product architecture and pricing for managing sequential innovation	sequential innovation;product design and pricing;modular upgradability	Science and technology advances drive firms to continually enhance their product's performance and launch sequentially improving offerings. Firms face challenges in marketing such improving products to well-informed, forward-looking consumers who anticipate product improvements and seek to delay their purchase timing. Product design, specifically a modular upgradable architecture in which improving and stable subsystems of a product are separated and selectively upgraded, can be a valuable approach for marketers to alleviate consumer concerns about product obsolescence. However, such an architecture-based approach can present new challenges as well, and dealing with them requires carefully coordinated cross-functional decision making by the firm. In this paper, we identify and formalize the notion of design inconsistency, which refers to the monopolist firm's inability to commit to future product design architectures. We find that firms experience design inconsistency even when they are able to commit to future prices, and design inconsistency lowers firm profits as well as consumer surplus. We then derive a joint product architecture and pricing approach to solve this problem; this enables an innovating firm to optimally and in a time-consistent manner launch modular upgradable products. The modeling and analysis in the paper lends insight into types of markets and products for which modular upgradability is most appropriate and offers guidelines on making pricing and product design decisions jointly for managing sequential innovation.#R##N##R##N#This paper was accepted by Preyas Desai, marketing.

26738a7145e0e5b4a9aefd4a1422b66dae8cc170	quantifying variability impacts upon supply chain performance		Efforts to control variability in segments of the supply chain can bring about counterintuitive results. This illustrates the importance of employing analytics in support of any supply chain process improvement or policy initiative. Modeling and simulation (M&S) helps managers identify improvements that will positively affect the supply chain's performance. M&S provides a way to evaluate the relative effects of budgetary decisions on cost, performance, and readiness over a variety of timeframes. M&S also provides a structured methodology to quantify process improvements and variability reductions. Analysis of the Department of Defense supply chain identified three recurring sources of variability: 1) procurement lead time, 2) depot repair time, and 3) retrograde. To evaluate the effect of variability, we employed three hierarchically integrated models: a system dynamics model for strategic decisions; 2) an analytical readiness-based sparing model for tactical decisions; and 3) a discrete event simulation model for logistical and operational performance decisions.	heart rate variability;logistics;procurement;simulation;spatial variability;system dynamics	Julie A.

3394552ff4bed0133ccef83b4600cb8ac1c35980	readiness to adopt e-business among smes in malaysia: antecedents and consequence		The adoption of the Internet as a business strategy tool is becoming an important way for firms to expand their business through innovative strategies. This study provides an insight concerning the factors that influence the adoption of the Internet to support business activities, also known as e-business among SMEs in Malaysia. In addition, the study also examines the relationship between e-business adoption and the business performance of the SMEs. Using a structured survey questionnaire, a usable response was received and statistically analyzed from 177 SMEs that currently use e-business. The research found that organizational characteristics, technology characteristics and environmental characteristics influence e-business adoption and that the adoption of e-business has a direct influence on the business performance of the SMEs. The findings of this study can aid and encourage the SMEs in developing countries to build a competitive advantage by using the Internet in their business strategy practices. increasing productivity, accomplishing business goals faster, responding to customer needs and communicating with other businesses (Beheshti & Salehi-Sangari, 2006). Electronic business (e-business), as an important strategic tool, has attracted much interest among the SMEs, as it expands the firm’s market, enables a new business model and embraces globalization (UNCTAD, 2003). Although research has been done on e-business, the majority of the research specifies the determinants of e-business adopDOI: 10.4018/jea.2011070101 2 International Journal of E-Adoption, 3(3), 1-19, July-September 2011 Copyright © 2011, IGI Global.

SMEs are also found to be different from larger companies in the context of IT adoption since SMEs have fewer resources compared to larger organizations. Therefore, SMEs have to incur higher risks when it comes to adopting information technology such as e-business (Choong, Ooi, Lin, & Tang, 2009). Furthermore, SMEs are relatively concerned about the perceived benefits of having e-business since the benefits gained are inconsistent with the extent of e-business usage (Mohamad & Ismail, 2009). Thus, the potential of e-business to improve the business performance of SMEs needs to be studied. Moreover, this kind of study is very important for SMEs in developing countries where they are struggling to achieve competitive advantage by developing an effective strategy with the support of the Internet (UNCTAD, 2001, 2003). This study suggests the need for advancing the understanding of the key factors experienced concerning the adoption of e-business in a developing country. SMEs represent the largest proportion of established businesses in most of the developing countries. One noteworthy developing country to study is Malaysia, as with other developing countries, the SMEs in Malaysia represent the largest percentage of establishments in Malaysia at 99.2 percent. In terms of their economic contribution, SMEs contribute 32 percent to the gross domestic product, 56.4 percent to the total workforce and 19 percent to the total exports of the country (SMIDEC, 2008). The Malaysian government has embarked on a major push to persuade SMEs to adopt the Internet as to embrace business potential and to enhance nature of doing business. Therefore, various regulatory infrastructure initiatives and funding facilities were introduced to encourage the adoption and implementation of the Internet, especially as e-business application tools among SMEs (Hashim, 2007). However, the SMEs in Malaysia are still slow in incorporating some form of e-business application into their business operations (Zakaria & Hashim, 2003; Alam & Ahsan, 2007). Having a clear understanding of the factors that influence e-business adoption among the SMEs who are currently using the Internet in their business, and the effect of adopting e-business on the business performance of SMEs in one developing country like Malaysia, will assist SMEs in other developing countries to advance into e-business adoption to support business applications. Thus, this research aims to investigate the factors that may contribute to the adoption of e-business and its implications for business performance among the SMEs in Malaysia.	electronic business;internet;strategic management	Malliga Marimuthu;Azizah Omar;Thurasamy Ramayah;Osman Mohamad	2011	IJEA	10.4018/jea.2011070101	marketing;commerce	HCI	-81.78423218188078	5.927083470192615	101628

The utility of the progressive phases is demonstrated by their capability for discriminating with 23 variables (adapted from Miller's Failure Syndromes) the propensity toward business decline and to distinguish regular variation on a continuum of 16 measures widely used to evaluate the quality of financial performance and cause of failure. The analysis supports Miller's earlier notion of a stepwise movement in clustering of syndromes from impulsiveness to stagnation to leader-lessness in heightening the likelihood of bankruptcy and demonstrates concurrent validity of progressive phases associated with perceived deterioration in the quality of business organization. The analysis of levels and phases of failure implicitly addresses an area of unique interest : via the intersection of information management and quality organization. Although the levels and phases are progressively prepotent and pathogenic in predicting organizational propensity toward decline, different patterns and paths through the phases for organizations are indicated as deriving from faulty information. Information resources are regarded as a factor in business decline and the findings have important implications for the acquisition and management of information.		Albert S. King	1996	J.

86e23ac083d0cec0730f6d43d80b11cd7040d95d	a new it organizational form for multinational enterprises		Globalization has been a major phenomenon since the 1980s. As many multinational enterprises (MNEs) grow their presence globally, they have been supported by distributed IT resources that are organized either as centralized IT, decentralized IT, or federated IT. However, despite the significant increase in business complexity in the last decade, there has been relatively little systematic research on new IT organizational forms capable of coping with the sophistication of today’s complex (e.g., multi-strategy, multi-product, and multi-geography) MNEs. Drawing from our understanding of the development of organization form in the organization design literature, we examine the applicability of a contemporary organization form, i.e., the multidimensional organization (Ackoff 1999; Galbraith 2009; Strikwerda & Stoelhorst 2009) to the organizing of IT function in MNEs. Through a revelatory case study of the global IT organization at Siemens, we demonstrate the possibility of a multidimensional design for IT organization in MNEs, where the IT organization is organized into IT Customer-, IT Product-, and IT Resource units. The strategic application of lean and flexible lateral coordination mechanisms enables the multidimensional IT organization to achieve multiple objectives in totality. Implications for research and practices are discussed.	centralized computing;lateral thinking;organizational architecture;organizing (structure);ws-coordination	Sia Siew Kien;Christina Soh;M.

We draw on differentiation-integration duality and contingency theory to suggest that manufacturing firms should seek to achieve both integration through supply chain coordination activities and differentiation through modularity-based manufacturing practices (MBMP). Using a sample of 261 manufacturing firms, we identify an inverse U-shaped relationship between SCI and operational performance. Furthermore, we find support for the importance of differentiation-integration duality as a fit between high levels of SCI and high levels of MBMP results in enhanced operational performance. We find support for a contingency perspective as fit is especially critical at higher levels of environmental uncertainty. Implications for theory, practice, and further research are suggested.

2d8f9bfb17913d73ce355e9ef8714cd012058378	a tale of two teams: success and failure in virtual team meetings	virtual team;software development;face to face	Interaction between two teams with the same team leader and with similar size and goals moved from weekly face-to-face meetings to virtual meetings because of the temporary displacement of the team leader to a time zone six hours ahead of the rest of the team. One team focused primarily on software development and the second team on developing and testing a research instrument. The Software Team floundered through multiple different meeting arrangements and eventually agreed to disperse until the leader returned to the same time zone. In contrast, the Research Instrument Team kept a single meeting time that was set before it moved to virtual gatherings, and continued to be an active and productive team. This paper explores what factors led to this divergence in team success and concludes that the implicit temporal structures entraining the members of the Software Team coupled with an inability to repair member unhappiness and an unequal dispersion of skill sets among virtual and co-located members led to one team’s eventual shutdown.	displacement mapping;shutdown (computing);software development	Marilyn Tremaine;Allen E.

However, managing the tacit knowledge underlying the interfaces is costly and complicated. Modularization of the outsourced business process can mitigate such complexity and the risk of knowledge misappropriation. This research-in-progress paper introduces the concept of modularization of outsourced business process (MOBP), which is viewed as the operational concept of “modular global sourcing” proposed by Infosys, a leading Indian outsourcing provider. Standing the position of the client firm, we examine the antecedents and consequents of MOBP based on transaction cost economics theory and knowledge-based theory. We explore the impacts of process human asset specificity, environmental uncertainty, behavioral uncertainty, small-number trading, strategic criticality of process knowledge, and process knowledge ambiguity on the extent of MOBP and also the impacts of MOBP on cost reduction and knowledge spillover. This paper also describes the research plan to test the research hypotheses. Contributions to research and practice are highlighted.	business process;criticality matrix;icis;indium tin oxide;knowledge management;knowledge spillover;outsourcing;sensitivity and specificity	Wenhua Hou;Dahui Li	2009			computer science;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;modular programming;management science;management	AI	-79.25317373114885	4.916885638955632	105934
cc0307e2fb9ce9ea62d3a4aa30e3566cef53f79a	applying data mining techniques to understand the impact of information technology on organizational productivity	information technology;data mining	We explore conditions under which investments in Information Technology (IT) have a statistically significant impact on productivity. Rather than using a traditional analytical technique such as regression, we use two data mining techniques (i.e. regression trees and regression splines) for doing data analysis and integrated their results. Our analysis indicates the following: 1) IT investments have a positive impact on organizational productivity only when IT investments meet certain conditions; and 2) the IT impact is not uniform but varies depending on the amounts invested in other related areas, such as Non-IT Labor, Non-IT Capital, and IT Stock. Thus, our study leads to some suggestions to top managers that organizations should assess the current state of investments in Non-IT Labor, Non-IT Capital, and IT Stock before making any further commitments to invest in IT as this current state partially determines the potential impact of additional investments in IT on organizational productivity.	americas conference on information systems;data mining;decision tree;smoothing spline;spline (mathematics)	Kweku-Muata Osei-Bryson;Myung S.

Multisourcing is defined as the blending of services from multiple company-internal and external suppliers. To date, performance measurement and governance-related aspects have been scarcely covered in the academic literature of IT outsourcing. With this study, we intend to broaden understanding of how business groups utilize governance mechanisms in a multi-sourced IT environment. This article contributes to the body of knowledge in three ways. First, it describes established IT governance mechanisms, second, it presents insights into a real-life example of IT governance mechanisms at a leading financial services provider, and third, it extends current literature toward multisourcing in a group-context by proposing a framework of IT governance mechanisms targeting the different relationships of multisourcing in business groups. In addition, this research is useful for corporations facing similar challenges.	alpha compositing;outsourcing;real life	Thomas Herz;Florian Hamel;Falk Uebernickel;Walter Brenner	2012	2012 45th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2012.30	public relations;computer science;marketing;information management;management;law;information technology;commerce;outsourcing	DB	-81.15744248461776	4.564395948568629	106088

We propose a new approach to providing the directions of IT investments to improve organizational efficiency. The proposed approach is based on the integrated form of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and decision tree (DT), and composed of two steps. First, DEA is conducted to measure organizational efficiency with the selected inputs and outputs. Second, DT is built based on efficiency scores obtained from DEA and IT factors, as a target variable and predictor variables, respectively. In doing so, we can identify the relative impact of IT investments on organizational efficiency and set priorities to the IT investments to improve efficiency from a view point of each organization. A case study on the Korean local governments is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

It has been noted that in the practice of the implementation of IT projects there are large discrepancies in the approach to the implementation of IT project management. They result from the fact that experts and consultants were accustomed to applying previously used methods, their simple incompetence, convenience or lack of understanding of the essence of the need to manage IT projects. Among the selected group of specialists in this field and field consultants at the turn of 2016 and 2017, the CAWI method was used to study opinions on the use of project management techniques and processes in the implementation of IT projects. Then, based on the obtained results, the analyses were conducted, and relevant conclusions and recommendations resulting from the study were presented. The formulated conclusions may be the starting point for creating an effective quality management system for project management.

The new service HOQ adds a dimension of quality economics to solve the problems of economic evaluation in the process of transferring customer requirements into service characteristics by traditional HOQ. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the traditional two-dimensional HOQ, this paper constructs a three-dimension service HOQ by adding an economic dimension into the traditional structure, so that the transformation process from customer requirements into service characteristics can be evaluated with quality economic perspective. The key concern of this new model is to balance the quality improvement and economic gain of a service. The other improvement of this paper is that it uses structural equations to present the coefficient matrix in the new HOQ model to avoid human errors in the evaluation. A case study is used to verify the effectiveness of the new model. Findings – Quality gains and costs should be considered in service design and quality improvement. The three-dimensional service HOQ uses the dimension of quality economics to balance customer requirements and service characteristics, which is more effective than the traditional one. Practical implications – The method exposed in the paper can be used by service companies for decision making in service design and quality improvement. Originality/value – This paper establishes a new three-dimensional HOQ, by which quality economics can be effectively analyzed in service design and quality improvement.	coefficient;requirement	Zhuo Zhang;Yanyu Wang	2012	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684921211243374	quality function deployment;house of quality;service quality	Networks	-80.32250796911234	9.846703802758743	107289

This paper proposes a methodology for measuring the national competitiveness and uses the 10 Southeast Asian countries for illustration. The basic idea is to deconstruct the complicated concept of national competitiveness to measurable criteria. The observations (data) on the criteria are then aggregated according to their importance to obtain an index of national competitiveness. For data collected from questionnaire surveys, a calibration technique has been devised to alleviate bias due to personal prejudice. In data aggregation, the importance is expressed by both a priori weights and a posteriori weights. These two types of weights consistently show that Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand have the highest national competitiveness, while Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos are the least competitive countries. The performance of each country in every criteria measured also provides directions for these countries to make improvements and for investors to allocate resources. 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.	competitive analysis (online algorithm);data aggregation	Chiang Kao;Wann-Yih Wu;Wen-Jen Hsieh;Tai-Yue Wang;Chinho Lin;Liang-Hsuan Chen	2008	European Journal of Operational Research	10.1016/j.ejor.2007.03.029	questionnaire;economics;marketing;operations management;mathematics;economy;economic growth;statistics	ML	-85.43306148372052	4.96216842400458	107477

An OEM supplier and a final assembly plant were selected to perform the study. Interviews with the workers, supervisors and managers have been performed. Case studies were collected in order to analyse the problems and to illustrate technical as well as cultural solutions. The analysis showed that important differences and coincidences in the manufacturing solutions could be explained from the cultural (French and Mexican) standpoint. The conclusions integrate some recommendations for French and Mexican companies that are in actual cooperation or that are planning to globalise in the corresponding countries.	computer-aided software engineering;interviews	Carlos Acosta;Rafael Sánchez;Adoración Rodríguez;Jorge León	2003	AI & SOCIETY	10.1007/s00146-003-0291-9	subsidiary;management science;original equipment manufacturer;operations management;computer science;automotive industry	HCI	-79.69421131123738	10.950818505716638	107489

In this paper, we contribute to this important, yet understudied, topic by examining the antecedents of the business value of open source infrastructure technologies. The paper puts forward a new model for explicating the organizational benefits of these technologies. Our findings suggest that in order to realize benefits from open source infrastructure technologies, organizations should have the human and technological capacities to absorb and utilize them as well as the ability to establish, maintain, and leverage ties with the technologies’ communities of developers and users. The paper focuses on open source databases (specifically, MySQL) as an instance of open source infrastructure technology. A PLS analysis of 149 responses from organizations that have implemented MySQL revealed that absorptive capacity for the database, ties with the technology’s user/developer community-of-practice, and an open source IT infrastructure that facilitates MySQL utilization explain about 20 per cent of the business value of the open source technology. These findings should help organizations realize the numerous potential benefits of open source technologies.		InduShobha N. Chengalur-Smith;Saggi Nevo;Pindaro Demertzoglou	2010	J.

Application service providers (ASP) are firms that offer outsourcing application services to many organizations via the Internet. By contracting ASP, organizations are having information technology (IT) staff focusing their efforts on core competencies while, at the same time, capitalizing on the expertise of outsourcer. On the other hand, many ASP turn some of their projects to global outsourcer. The study develops a framework that identifies the critical factors influencing ASP' decision to outsource globally. These factors are product development costs, IT talent, product quality, communication technology, tax incentives, and cultural differences. The rest of the paper discusses the differences between different types of global outsourcing, explore the emerging trend and advantages of utilizing ASP, and recommend measures to ensure the success of projects to...	outsourcing	Khalid S.

This question addresses the critical problem of separating the outcome of all the different ‘‘managements’’, which usually are at work concurrently in a living company. Besides supply chain management (SCM) you may find other areas, trying to improve the performance of a company at a single point in time. Isolating the impact of SCM on the bottom line will thus be difficult. The paper at hand explores suitable metrics to measure the effectiveness of SCM. The outcome of this piece of research will present six unique sets of metrics to measure performance of SCM.

First, relying on insights from the resource- and competence-based theories of the firm and the literature on social networks and financial economics, we identify the factors that might differentiate ASUs and other NTBFs. Then, we combine the results of prior studies on NTBFs and the evidence from four theory-building case studies of Italian ASUs to formulate a series of empirically testable hypotheses that relate to the differences between ASUs and other NTBFs as to the extent and nature of the initial funding and knowledge gaps, and the strategies that firms adopt to close them. Our analysis suggests that ASUs' major relative strengths reside in the lower initial funding gap and greater investments in technical activities. Conversely, ASUs' major weakness consists of the lack of commercial knowledge: ASUs suffer from greater initial gaps in this field and encounter serious obstacles in implementing effective strategies to close them. The paper also offers original insights relating to the impact of the appropriability regime of technology on the financing and alliance strategies of ASUs as opposed to those of other NTBFs. More specifically, when the appropriability regime is weak, ASUs' choices as to the characteristics of external investors and alliance partners, and the organisation of the relations with them are influenced by the desire to mitigate appropriability hazards. Conversely, appropriability hazards have a smaller influence on the decisions of non-ASU NTBFs.	social network;theory	Massimo G.

This is increasingly problematic as, faced with high competitive intensity and environmental turbulence, boards and executive teams seek to formulate and execute dynamic strategy. In the absence of a clearly defined, long-term strategic plan, the IT infrastructure platform needs to be designed and managed in concert with organisational design to achieve the degrees of flexibility the executive team most expects to need. The paper combines IT architecture with multivariate theories of organisational fit into an activity that creates a joint architecture of IT and organisation. The distinctive advantage of the approach is that the architecture is harmonised to the increasingly widespread desire to make strategy on the run. Based on a 98 organization study, we describe relevant concepts, roles and practice for achieving an organisational architecture.	organizational architecture;theory;turbulence	Chris Sauer;Leslie P.

SaaS not only possesses the advantages of low upfront investment, flexible customization, rapid implementation and professional services but also has some disadvantages, such as higher long-term rent, lack of personalized solutions, network instability and data security. On the basis of the analysis above, it summarizes all kinds of constraints which enterprise information systems suitable to SaaS should follow, including industry standardization, business complexity, system performance and security requirement. Then, a fitness evaluation model is established. The model evaluates enterprise information systems from three aspects: enterprise resource, system features and SaaS service. At last, the paper makes some comments on the evaluation results and estimates whether SaaS is suitable for the information system evaluated.	data security;enterprise information system;faceted classification;instability;personalization;qualitative comparative analysis;software as a service;software maintenance	Yonghe Lu;Bing Sun	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on e-Business Engineering	10.1109/ICEBE.2009.81	web service;database index;qualitative comparative analysis;the internet;computer science;marketing;software engineering;software as a service;database;data security;software maintenance;law;computer security;information system;enterprise information system	DB	-79.37860559867055	12.849157158329113	109552
8cb6536f6c47d3ed9d2c07e01c1c56c57dd8cff9	the value of information technology in e-business environments: the missing links in the renewed it value debate	business environment;it value;value of information	After more than a decade of intensive studies, business value of information technology continues to generate interest and debate among both academics and practitioners. Drawing upon the IT value literature and the resource-based view of the firm, we develop a process-oriented model of IT value creation in the context of electronic business. Instead of a dichotomous measure of “adoption vs. non-adoption” as typically found in the literature, this model incorporates three stages (investment–usage–value) of the diffusion process at the firm level, with actual usage being an important mediating variable. The model also includes both IT resources and organizational factors, and tests the complementarity between them. A large-scale international dataset, involving 2,139 firms from 10 countries, is used to test the theoretical model. After controlling for firm size and industry effects, our empirical analyses based on structural equation modeling have shown that the investment–usage–value linkages are significant (although the direct link between investment and value is weak), suggesting that usage would be a “missing link” if not included. Another finding is that, while IT still matters (especially deeper use of IT such as back-end integration), complementary organizational resources (e.g., management support and external relationships) are found to be highly significant in creating value from e-business investment. On the other hand, these relationships tend to be moderated by environmental factors. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate over IT value—in this case, the value of Internet technologies in the e-business environment. They also offer important implications for the way firms approach IT investment and management in the post-bubble Internet era.	complementarity theory;electronic business;inline linking;internet;list of code lyoko episodes;structural equation modeling;transitional fossil	Kevin Zhu;Sean Xin Xu	2004			social science;economics;marketing;operations management;business value;value of information;management;commerce	HCI	-82.17452037007705	5.238248401878605	109749

While the focal point of connected research is predominantly on instruments, models, and methodologies, only moderate attention has been given to understand and improve the value realisation process of IS. We adopted the DeLone and McLean model of IS success for the design of a value realisation model of IS in the financial services domain. While this model has been originally contrived for the area of information systems, it basically conquers the process of value realisation. In executing so, it is not only well-founded but its practical application can been broadened to other areas too. Hence, this paper presents a re-specification of DeLone and McLean’s IS success model as a value creation model, examining it empirically in the context of financial services. A conceptual framework is proposed from a comprehensive review of IS success and value creation literature that evaluates IS success and value. Six variables are employed to measure IS system success and value in financial services industries. This conceptual FS-IS value creation model is tested and validated using data collected from banking and non-banking Indian financial companies. Primary contributions of the study include a new financial services information system success value model and a validated rating scale to measure information system constructs and performance for use by banking and non-banking companies.	angela mclean (biologist);conceptual schema;focal (programming language);information system;information systems success model;rating scale	Lawrence Harold;M.

f181bf7b74e39da9fcd8ed0299d2c66ce83ddc9f	integrating sna and dm technology into hr practice and research: layoff prediction model		Recent developments in social network analysis (SNA) and data mining (DM) technology have opened up new frontiers for human resource management (HRM). SNA appears to be an effective tool for mapping relationships in an organization. The increased use of information technology provides useful new data about the user behavior automatically stored in database or web log files. Data mining methods were applied in practice to explore information from this huge amount of data. Data mining can be used to gain insight into the usage behavior based on objective data in contrast to subjective data. In this chapter we suggest ways in which combine SNA and DM be analyzed using network software and DM tool. We propose an example used exploratory research design conducting a single case study in Taiwan. This research aims at introducing the importance of the application of DM and SNA to predict layoff through an empirical study.

Sales managers are in need of insights regarding how to set up their selling centers (SC) with regard to SC’s heterogeneity of expertise and values to raise the success of new services. However, literature in the area of SC heterogeneity in relationship with service innovations is scarce. Noting the increasing practical relevance, this study investigates how the different forms of SC heterogeneity influence the customers’ intention to adopt a service innovation, considering the moderating effects of degree of service digitalization as well as buying center (BC) heterogeneity of expertise and values. Drawing on organizational buying behavior theory, we hypothesize a positive effect of SC heterogeneity of expertise on the intention to adopt, while SC heterogeneity of values is expected to weaken the intention to adopt. In addition, we propose varying moderating effects for the two different forms of BC heterogeneity as well as the degree of service digitalization. We will test the proposed hypotheses on the basis of a dyadic data collection. The expected findings will help sales managers to design their SCs in order to increase adoption rates of new services.	dyadic transformation;relevance;service innovation	Nicolas Zacharias;Ferdinand Rausch	2017			marketing;business	HPC	-82.3427313148282	5.4387062987746155	110682

Two reseller organizations participated in an in-depth set of surveys around e-business sales and distribution of IT products and services. A set of working research hypotheses was formulated for investigation. A survey instrument was developed, pre-tested and administered to thirteen executives in two reseller organizations. Managerially the findings were focused around the need to offer a differentiated set of e-business service offerings and to then decide how the organization should best develop partnering relationships and/or outsource the expertise. Outsourcing relationships, it was found, reduces the complexity of delivering overall e-business solutions, while also creating project management challenges. Strategic acquisitioning was a key factor in making e-business initiatives successful in the IT distribution channel.	electronic business;outsourcing	Donald L. Amoroso;Heather E.

The conventional wisdom suggests that early mover advantage would not be substantial when barrier to entry is low. However, this research argues that etailers, even when barrier to entry is low online, can enjoy early mover advantage because of the relatively high switching cost in the uncertain online environment, and the system design features of ecommerce platforms. Customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities, as measured by customer attraction, conversion and retention capabilities, can help enhance the sources of online early mover advantage. Panel data of 7,309 etailers from the cosmetics and women’s clothing industries is analyzed to verify the hypotheses. The empirical evidences strongly corroborate the predicted early mover advantage for online retailers and the role of CRM capabilities in boosting early mover advantage as well as etailer performance.	customer relationship management;e-commerce;online shopping;panel data;systems design	Shan Wang;Hasan Cavusoglu;Ziliang Deng	2013			marketing;barriers to entry;computer science;commerce	AI	-87.67708794193277	5.941976565207754	110863

Their importance is now acknowledged. But information technology-equipment and services-is available to all firms, and most applications can be duplicated. The copying firm often enjoys the advantages of newer and better technology, learns from the experience of the innovator, and thus can offer comparable services at lower costs. When can an information technology-based strategy confer sustainable competitive advantage? The answer may lie with the role of strategic resources in explaining the allocation of economic benefits from an IT innovation. Specifically, information technology can lead to sustainable competitive advantage when it is used to leverage differences in strategic resources. This may be true even in cases where duplication is relatively easy and there are few dynamic effects, like first-mover advantages, to protect the innovation. An important characteristic of IT is its ability to manage interactions among economic activities; the economic theory can be used to establish a link between this characteristic of IT and shifts in resource values. This allows us to identify and examine some opportunities for deploying IT to leverage structural resource differences among firms, including differences in vertical integration and diversification as well as differences in the quality and organization of key resources.

(e.g., · participatory mechanisms, social media, geo-coded data from personal electronic devices) and · how to handle it? (e.g., how to ingest, sort, store, and link up disparate data sets). A question that receives far less attention is that of Collaborative analysis of Big Data; how can a multi-disciplinary layered analysis of Big Data be used to support robust decisions, especially in a collaborative setting, and especially under time pressure? The robust Decision Engineering required can be achieved by employing an approach related to Network Science, that we call Relationship Science. In Relationship Science, our methodological framework, karassian netchain analysis (KNA), is utilized to ascertain islands of stability or positive influence dominating sets (PIDS), so that a form of annealed resiliency or latent stability is achieved, thereby mitigating against unintended consequences, elements of instability, and “perfect storm” crises lurking within the network.	big data;cryptographic hash function;instability;lurker;network science;personal digital assistant;social media;unintended consequences	Steve Chan;Wesley Rhodes;Charles Atencio;Caroline C Kuo;Brent Ranalli;Anna Miao;Simone Sala;Stephen Serene;Robert Helbling;Sarah Rumbley;Marc Clement;Lisa Sokol;Loren Gary	2012	8th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom)	10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2012.250715	network science;lead;predictive analytics;von neumann stability analysis;civil society;selection bias;sparse matrix;cascading failure;name resolution;telecommunications;computer science;data science;computational intelligence;pattern matching;data mining;database;brittleness;velocity;data analysis;programming language;management;operations research;storm;world wide web;volume;computer security;sentiment analysis;robustness	DB	-83.56934610743856	12.053113335112622	112040

For application services outsourcing (ASO), selecting applications to outsource is critical for successful outsourcing. Thus, the implementation of application portfolio management (APM) is essential, in order to provide the necessary transparency throughout the entire life-cycle of an application. APM enables the classification of applications which guides the outsourcing decision. Furthermore, the application life-cycle perspective allows a differentiated and comprehensive view, which is required for selecting applications for ASO. In combination with common selection criteria identified by prior research, we studied the decision to in-or outsource an application. We evaluated outsourcing decisions in a comparative cross-case study with 37 German and Swiss companies. Our research revealed that the life-cycle perspective allows a differentiated view on outsourcing decisions.	advanced power management;app store optimization;archive;outsourcing;switzerland	Saskia Zelt;Alexander A.

More specifically, as such determinants, the study proposes customer knowledge accumulated in electronic knowledge repositories (EKRs) as a digital knowledge source along with expertise location as a human knowledge source. Moreover, the study considers technological IT resources (TIR) as another determinant of CSRs’ service expertise and service quality. Finally, the study examines the relationship of service expertise and service quality. A total of 292 responses were collected from CSRs working at call centers and were used for the analysis. The key findings are as follows: first, customer knowledge in EKRs, expert location and TIR considerably increased CSRs’ service expertise. Second, customer knowledge in EKRs and expert location were positively associated with service quality, but TIR had no significant effect on service quality. Finally, CSRs’ service expertise greatly enhanced service quality. The results imply that CSRs’ service expertise and service quality depend on knowledge sources and IT resources provided by the call center.	customer knowledge;information repository;quality of service	Sujeong Choi;Jaejon Kim;Min Qu	2014			public relations;service level requirement;service level objective;organizational learning;economics;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;service design;service desk;customer service assurance;service quality;customer advocacy	Web+IR	-82.19104277308809	5.395668733794249	113276

Grounded in the resource-based theory in conjunction with transaction cost economics, we develop a conceptual model that links three IT-related resources (backend integration, managerial skills, and partner support) to firm performance improvement. The model differs from previous studies by proposing a moderating effect of competition on the resource-performance relationships. Using data of 743 manufacturing firms, our analysis indicates significant contribution of IT to supply chains, which is generated through development of the digitally enabled integration capability and manifested at the process level along the supply chain. The technological resource alone, however, does not hold the answer to IT value creation. In fact, managerial skills, which enable adaptations on supply chain processes and corporate strategy to accommodate the use of IT, are shown to play the strongest role in IT value creation. Furthermore, backend integration and managerial skills are found to be more valuable in more competitive environments. While commodity-like resources have diminishing value under competition, integrational and managerial resources become even stronger. Overall, our results shed light on the key drivers of IT-enabled supply chains, and provide insights into how competition shapes IT value.	attribute–value pair;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;contingency (philosophy);dd (unix);fo (complexity);ibm translation control entry;linear algebra;numerical aperture;situated;strategic management;synergy;tree accumulation;value (computer science)	Shutao Dong;Sean Xin Xu;Kevin Zhu	2009	Information Systems Research	10.1287/isre.1080.0195	competition;economics;service management;marketing;operations management;microeconomics;supply chain;management;law;information technology;commerce;resource	HCI	-81.69383373360046	4.562247732872883	114041

Within a benchmarking exercise, we propose a method for selecting a preferable development path that consists of a sequence of intermediate benchmarks. First, an outranking multi-criteria approach is used to establish the hierarchical position of benchmarking units. For each unit, we evaluate possible development paths and distinguish those that are characterised by balanced improvement steps along the whole path. The proposed method can help decision makers to 1) detect disparities among benchmarking units and 2) identify intermediate benchmarks for less successful ones in each stage of their progress toward the ultimate benchmark target. The method is applied to benchmark European Union Member countries against Digital Agenda key performance targets. Benchmarking is a management tool defined as a systematic process of measuring products, services or business practices against those recognised as business leaders [1]. The idea behind benchmarking is to evaluate one's own performance relative to the others to select the best practice exemplars and to consider performance improvements by learning from more successful competitors. All of these considerations require specific decision-making activities that range from how to gauge pertinent statistics on performance and pinpoint areas that need improvement to setting goals and finding ways to meet them. Hence, there are a number of DSS (decision support systems) that exploit benchmarking as an underlying method, whereby prevails its use as a tool to compare and/or to set target values. A recent example is the study of Dong et al. [2], who presented the model that identifies the managerial benchmark (for the purpose of comparison). Similarly, Tremblay et al. [3] define three types of benchmarks to use for comparisons. There are two essential elements of benchmarking. The first involves comparing with other practice exemplars, which allows for a more objective evaluation of one's own performance. The second involves evaluating against other benchmarks—the term refers to a point of reference, a target, or the best in class standard, that is, someone or something to revere. Originally, benchmarking was used to measure and improve processes and performances of various types of business entities, but over time its scope and level of implementation have been extended. At the international level, benchmarking serves as a tool for comparing national successes in a specific field of interest. Benchmarking involves determining how well a country is doing …	benchmark (computing);best practice;decision support system;entity;marc tremblay;performance;relevance;stepwise regression	Marijana Petrovic;Natasa Bojkovic;Ivan Anic;Mladen Stamenkovic;Snezana Pejcic-Tarle	2014	Decision Support Systems	10.1016/j.dss.2013.12.002	electre;operations management;data mining;management science	Web+IR	-78.25042083164665	10.622371560277747	114130
ddb9ec434a831ef8e2354941930175977b4d9b07	reinvestigating the relationship between information technology capability and firm performance: focusing on the impact of the adoption of enterprise systems		Though many information systems researchers have made various attempts to investigate the relationship between information technology capability and firm performance from diverse perspectives, we have not come to a conclusion yet with some mixed results. In this research, focusing on the adoption of Enterprise Resource Planning systems by firms as a proxy measure of information technology capability, we re-examine whether the association is positive or negative. With the sample of Korean firms which have adopted Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems in 2009, we match ERP adopters and non-adopters with propensity score matching, and compare financial performance between them with difference-in-difference estimation between preand post-adoption period. According to our analysis, we find out that there is no positive and significant relationship between information technology capability and firm performance in profit ratios. This research shows that contrary to the era of propriety information systems, standardized information systems make no more competitive advantages against competitors these days.	difference in differences;erp;enterprise resource planning;enterprise system;information system;propensity score matching	Sehwan Oh;Saerom Lee;Hyunmi Baek	2015			computer science;marketing;competitive advantage;enterprise system;knowledge management;enterprise information system;enterprise life cycle;information system;enterprise software;enterprise resource planning;enterprise integration	AI	-81.79988098607299	5.353174780014072	114231

Human resource management (HRM) activities, on the other hand, assume strategic significance by supporting the three cases above through a process that we call managerial entrepreneurship. Furthermore, HRM takes on different forms when supporting each of these types of rents. Hence, this rent-based view has greater potential to help explain the contribution of human resources to firms' competitive advantages than approaches that are grounded in the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, which primarily reflects the Ricardian view of rents. Moreover, a rent-based approach suggests fruitful new ways to address many of the theoretic challenges confronting the strategic human resource management (SHRM) literature.	causality	Clint Chadwick;Adina Dabu	2009	Organization Science	10.1287/orsc.1080.0375	industrial organization;economics;entrepreneurship;international trade;human resource management;management;human resource management system;competitive advantage;commerce;resource	NLP	-79.04487129587994	4.500524396843362	114280

However, the source of these differences is unclear. In this study we analyze the role of the competitive environment in moderating the productive impact of information technology and regular capital. We focus on two important features of an industry's competitive environment: industry concentration and industry dynamism. Industry concentration is the degree to which the output of an entire industry is produced by a few firms and is considered an inverse proxy for industry competitiveness. Industry dynamism denotes change that is difficult to predict, measured as the deviation of industry sales from a trend line. We analyze the moderating impact of concentration and dynamism on the output elasticity of information technology and regular capital by estimating a production function using 5211 firm-year observations spanning the years 1987 to 1994. We find that the marginal product of IT is lower in more concentrated industries, while the opposite is true for regular capital. There is limited evidence that the marginal product of IT is higher in more dynamic industries, and strong evidence that the marginal product of regular capital is lower in more dynamic industries. Taken together, our results suggest that IT provides enhanced productivity impacts to firms in more competitive industries without any productivity loss in dynamic industries, in contrast to regular capital. The findings underscore the salience of inclusion of the competitive environment in studies of the productive impacts of information technology.		Nigel Melville;Vijay Gurbaxani;Kenneth L.

As most decisions today are based on data collected by Information Systems (IS), the IS itself must become more adaptable. This is particularly challenging in the domain of Business Intelligence (BI) Systems since the underlying architectural approach of enterprise-wide decision support systems is not build upon agility, but on reliability and robustness over a period of time. In order to determine the agility of BI, a unique understanding of agility and its underlying criteria is required. This paper provides a literature review which aims to summarize the known criteria from IS literature that can be applied to the domain of BI. The results can be interpreted as a framework for understanding the agility of BI systems and form the basis for generating mandatory criteria for assessing agility.	decision support system;information system;turbulence	Tobias Knabke;Sebastian Olbrich	2013	2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2013.581	decision support system;competitive intelligence;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;software framework;management science;business intelligence	DB	-77.92754158029449	8.29439330557339	114553

Although shipping operations are beneficial to global trade as well as economic development of countries, the related activities can cause environmental harm, e.g., CO2 emissions and ballast water discharge. As a result, public concerns about the environmental damages caused by shipping activities in servicing international trade are on the rise. To balance environmental protection and business performance improvement, shipping firms should pay more attention to the environmental and financial ramifications of their business routines. This study proposes the concept of Greening and Performance Relativity (GPR) and uses an input-output analytic approach to investigate how greening operations are related to firm performance in shipping operations. We present theory-driven arguments on the link between environmental and financial performance outcomes and empirically validate them with survey data collected from shipping firms. We also examine application of the GPR concept using survey data from the shipping industry in Hong Kong. Our analysis results show that there is a positive association between greening and firm performance in shipping operations. The results also indicate that shipping firms possess reasonably good capability in the business routines of """"company policy and procedure"""", """"shipping documentation"""", """"shipping materials"""", and """"shipping design for compliance""""."""	numerical relativity	Y.

0a8878cb61fdedcf105b8c5e4082787beace4b2c	hypercompetition in the erp industry: it takes all the running to stay in place		Applying the Red Queen Theory (RQT), the study posits that an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software vendor counters the Red Queen Effect (RQE) in the hypercompetitive ERP industry by strategically aligning itself with multiple partners to form an ecosystem that can be leveraged for growth, provide multiple opportunities for innovation, and produce and deliver a product to its customers. By carrying out a cross-case analysis of ERPCorp, its partners and rivals based on multiple qualitative interviews, the paper shows that ERPCorp was able to survive the entry process as well as adapt and avoid the competency trap by using a partner network to sell, implement and develop complementary offerings. The key finding is that in order to survive the “race”, ERPCorp has to adopt new strategies to match or exceed the actions of its rivals which creates various tensions with partners, thus requiring the ability to manage an inter-organizational network effectively.	americas conference on information systems;bastion;converge;erp;ecosystem;enterprise resource planning;evolution;focal (programming language);how to survive;new product development;niche blogging;software bug	Michelle Antero	2012			red queen hypothesis;knowledge management;multiple partners;leverage (finance);software vendor;enterprise resource planning;computer science;hypercompetition;competence (human resources)	Networks	-81.34790039746233	8.139263406297955	114696
adbf2016a576ac11ee921cd0214ffcacb3c80340	impact of executive compensation on the execution of it-based environmental strategies under competition		Correspondence: Ricky Y. K. Chan, Department of Management and Marketing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Tel: (852) 2766 7110; E-mail: msricky@polyu.edu.hk Abstract Drawing on agency theory and the contingent natural resource-based theory, this study employs firm-level archival and survey data of US manufacturing firms to examine the impact of CEO compensation forms on the execution of IT-based environmental strategies and the moderating influence of competitive intensity on this impact. The findings reveal that CEO fixed pay and bonus negatively affect the execution of the two types of IT-based environmental strategies, green IT strategies and IT-enabled green strategies, whereas CEO stock option positively influences such execution. The moderation analysis further highlights that while competitive intensity reinforces the positive impact of CEO stock option on both strategies, it weakens the negative impact of CEO fixed pay and bonus only on IT-enabled green strategies. The findings suggest that a highly competitive operating setting represents an ideal setting for using stock option to motivate CEOs to execute these two strategies. At the minimum, this setting helps mitigate the deterrent effect of fixed pay and bonus on CEOs’ execution of IT-enabled green strategies. The findings also suggest that firms should align their CEO compensation package with the characteristics of high uncertainty and long payback periods of IT-based environmental strategic endeavors and the competitive conditions they face.

However, extant research is primarily focusing on technical aspects, such as security and scalability, hence the assumed paradigm shift has not been explored in more detail yet. Focusing on Software as a Service (SaaS) as underlying Cloud model, we conducted an extensive literature review to derive a conceptual model presenting the influence of flexible, SaaS-based business processes on operational agility. Moreover, these processes were classified into three categories, Enterprise Resource Planning Services, Work Support Services, and Decision Support Services. In addition, we conducted ten in-depth interviews with Cloud experts to reflect on potentially missing categories and to substantiate the categories derived from extant literature. The theoretical and empirical parts of our paper reveal that SaaS-enabled processes have a positive influence on operational agility of enterprises which provides first preliminary evidence for the predicted paradigm shift.	business process;cloud computing;computer security;enterprise resource planning;programming paradigm;scalability;software as a service	Sabine Fremdt;Roman Beck;Sven Weber	2013	2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2013.182	cloud computing security;decision support system;cloud computing;computer science;knowledge management;cloud testing;software as a service;database;management science;services computing;expert system	SE	-78.38893826617019	8.40147514349936	117014
5db5b31bbd3e3fe8440c20b7d274a477d93a55a7	business model formation within the online news market: the core + complement business model framework		The business model literature is both rich and rapidly-growing. Authors identify specialpurpose business and eBusiness models – and, increasingly, develop taxonomies of business models types. But, in searching for a comparatively simple way to understand the components of a “typical” internet business model, as part of our work for the EC research project SimWeb, we found that these taxonomies had little overlap and offered only a modest assistance to smaller companies trying to identify their own business identity. In this paper, therefore, we present the preliminary results of a three-year research project into appropriate business models for the online news and music industries. Having identified the problems, we describe the general taxonomies and components of Internet business models found in the literature, and explain our own core + component framework for developing an internet business model – using the online news industry as our example. We show how a combination of core and complementary components can be combined by any news-providing organisation for its Internet business model on the basis to its specific needs, resources and changing circumstances – and illustrate the usefulness of our this framework by means of “mini-case” examples of regional online newspapers in Germany.	dot-com company;internet;taxonomy (general)	Kornelia van der Beek;Cornelia Krueger;Paula M.

We model the system using a local threshold process for adoption decisions and with a cost associated with creating each seed adopter. We compare random selection, selection of nodes with highest degree and selection of nodes with highest betweenness centrality. We then consider the situation in which the cost of identifying the target nodes is considered; the decision maker must make a trade-off between identifying the best nodes and saving resources for converting the seed nodes to the new technology.	betweenness centrality;semantic network;social network	Peter Ludlow;Babak Heydari	2014		10.1016/j.procs.2014.09.051	simulation;bioinformatics	HCI	-88.04487928785423	6.680205958624917	118394

Therefore, a strategy for management and utilisation of knowledge in its different state is needed. It is sensible to assume, that this strategy is strongly influenced by a respective consulting firm’s business model. This paper provides an analysis of the interrelation between business model and Knowledge Management strategy. Four determinants are defined to allow a detailed description of different Knowledge Management strategies. Methods and techniques of Knowledge Management are subsumed under these determinants. The use of these methods determine, whether a Knowledge Management strategy is dominated by central or de-central elements. This article describes different types of business models and derives recommendations for corresponding Knowledge Management strategies. Case studies of four international consulting firms with different business models and different Knowledge Management strategies are used to validate these recommendations.	fits;hartmut neven;knowledge management;strategic management;switzerland	Sven Grolik;Dirk Kalmring;Dietrich Lehner;Chiara Frigerio	2003			business model;computer science;knowledge management;management science;process management	DB	-77.63077515658094	5.405468177642306	118668

Our main findings demonstrate that the adoption of XBRL is positively associated with market reactions to earnings surprises around 10-Q and 10-K filing dates only for Phase II, not for Phase I, filers except when a Phase I filer is followed by fewer analysts. The full-sample test shows that the hypothesized effect also exists for Phase III filers, and we observe an increase in market reaction for Phase II filers after their second year of adoption. We believe this study has policy implications and may alleviate firms' concerns regarding the benefits of adopting XBRL. JEL Classifications: M41. Data Availability: All data are publicly available.

The 32 respondents in the final round of the survey were mainly project managers from South African software houses. Various academics and users of e-commerce systems also contributed to the survey. The Delphi technique was used to gather the data and to rank the risks. Misunderstanding the users' requirements emerged as the most significant risk, followed by the absence of declared business benefits. As with conventional systems, there is a risk of top management not getting totally committed to the project, very often giving verbal encouragement to the IT team but overlooking the impact on the business as a whole. Respondents place a high importance on the security issues surrounding e-commerce projects. Transactions are subjected to more threats, and developers have to incorporate procedures to ensure transaction integrity and confidentiality, and then convince potential customers of the system's security. Other related issues include transaction tracability and database security and integrity. Hype in the market suggested that there was a large risk of delivering systems too slowly as a result of ''cumbersome'' methodologies. The research did not find this to be the case. Different perspectives emerged from the viewpoints of developers, project managers, clients/users and academics.	e-commerce payment system	Tom Addison	2003	Int J.

Results suggest that more advanced exporters tap into specialized skills and gain knowledge from different foreign environments. During the internationalization process, organizational learning occurs, more advanced and specialized skills are sought and firms become more knowledge intensive.	exporter (computing);internationalization and localization	Élisabeth Lefebvre;Louis A.

In order to optimise the produced software we approached the issue following a methodology and procedures based on the theory of project management, particularly that of risk management. The methodology and procedures will subsequently be described in the project. The management of risks in software projects is a difficult and complex process. Its implementation includes three main stages that are search and locate the risks, evaluate, and finally overcome them. Based on the above characteristics we have created a questionnaire that aimed to identify the potential risks during the creation of this software category. The survey results were recorded and then evaluated. Upon completion of this process we were able to create a list of potential risks related to the creation of educational software for use on the Internet through social media.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper conducts literature reviews regarding motives of transfer pricing manipulation and then conducts questionnaire survey and expert interview to select and generalize the transfer pricing manipulation decision making. Analytic network process (ANP) is then applied to obtain factors’ weights and model construction. Findings – The paper finds that tax minimization is no longer the focus of transfer pricing manipulation strategies of Taiwanese MNEs, and their real concerns are winning maximum economic profits, enhancing the competitiveness of the enterprise, and effectively repatriating profits to parent companies in order to facilitate greater economic profits. Research limitations/implications – It is found from the model that most of the transfer pricing manipulation motives are based on low-price strategies, which circumvent the exchange rate risks of low quotes. A possible reason is that current business operational patterns that have been limited to the electronic industry adopt the quantity-based pricing strategy of “narrow profit margin and large volume.” However, the transfer pricing manipulation has great influence on the financial structures of the enterprises. The enterprises, as a result, must understand and reinforce the working of pricing transfer manipulation in the business development. Originality/value – The paper collects questionnaires and investigation results from experts and scholars and uses ANP to construct a complete pricing strategic decision-making model that may be taken by actual MNEs under different motives, in order to provide reference to MNEs when making transfer pricing manipulation strategies.	competitive analysis (online algorithm)	Ching-Wen Lin;Hsiao-Chen Chang	2010	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635571011077843	variable pricing;multinational corporation;investment theory;economics;marketing;management;commerce	AI	-81.60017588913506	7.05294779241555	120673

Shareholder returns from these mergers have often been disappointing. This study finds delays in implementing potential operating savings and realizing benefits of scale economies may be one reason bank mergers have disappointing returns. We analyze a 200 branch network formed in a merger of four banks. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to benchmark the operating efficiency of each branch against """"best-practice"""" branches within both the combined merged bank and the four individual pre-merger banks. DEA applied to the entire merged bank identified opportunities to reduce branch operating costs by 22 percent. In contrast, DEA benchmarking within each pre-merger bank suggests cost saving opportunity of under seven percent. This suggests that beyond traditional merger cost savings, such as closing branches, new added savings can be generated by benchmarking across the larger merged bank. More rapid and aggressive consolidations of management control systems in bank mergers may increase profits and shareholder value, improving returns in bank mergers. This study's contributions include: 1)exploring the potential new use of DEA in analyzing mergers; 2)confirming the value generated in bank mergers using internal operating data found in contrast to most studies using aggregated publicly reported data; 3)documenting one reason bank mergers may appear to have disappointing returns--deferred rationalization of merged banks' operations."""	benchmark (computing);closing (morphology);control system;data envelopment analysis;synergy	H.

Such services are offered by IT service providers to customer firms and increasingly involve business partners. However little is known of the challenges faced by IT service providers as a result of the involvement of the other firms and their employees (end-users). This paper reports related findings from an interpretive study of IT service provider perceptions in six multinational IT service provider firms (Cooper, 2007). The findings highlight that, for IT service providers, (1) it is important to consider and resolve the needs and concerns of other key stakeholders, and (2) significant challenges exist in doing so. The main contribution of the paper is the identification of the key challenges involved. Important implications for theory and practice are discussed.		Vanessa A.

To establish whether the same is true in the construction sector, a survey was conducted to assess the current level of use and the perceived importance of such methods in both the U.K. and in Mexico. Following a broad review of the literature, various improvement tools, techniques and methods were recognized and grouped using affinity diagrams. A questionnaire was designed to collect the information and served as a basis for comparison. The results of the survey showed that, in terms of use, computer networks, laws and regulations, teams and teamwork, inspection and planning software were common practice in the U.K. while computer networks, customer satisfaction surveys, design software, Gantt charts and laws and regulations were commonly used in Mexico. A similar set of methods were perceived as highly important except that inspection and planning software were replaced by customer satisfaction surveys and customer complaints, respectively, in the case of the U.K. companies and Gantt charts by inspection in the case of Mexico. When comparing the mean use and the mean perceived importance for each method in both countries, significant differences were found mainly in the use of those for gathering and organizing customer needs, those aimed at planning and controlling quality and those for technology.

The authors randomly mailed survey questionnaires to 900 chief executive officers located across the U.S. and obtained quantitative data from 192 individuals. To validate these results, they conducted structured follow-up interviews of 25 executives. The findings suggest that discontinuous innovation increases with environmental dynamism and that structure and processes (intrafirm linkages, experimentation and transitioning, or sequencing from one product/project/program to another) contribute to discontinuous innovation. These results suggest that top managers are active, not passive, in influencing discontinuous innovation within their organizations.	electronic component;randomness	Dawn R. DeTienne;Christine S.

449e5c07c588cce2daca34b806d53d623cb6dba1	the dynamics of the performance-risk relationship within a performance period: the moderating role of deadline proximity	attention;deadlines;performance periods;shifting focus model;risk taking	Risky organizational decisions are frequently made within the confines of performance periods with predefined durations and deadlines for achieving desired levels of performance. The relationship between performance and risk taking has been studied mostly across such periods but rarely within them. Building on the shifting-focus-of-attention model of organizational risk taking, we argue that the temporal proximity of deadlines regulates the focus of organizational attention within a performance period. Decision makers will focus their attention on attaining and maintaining aspirations early in a period; however, as deadlines approach, decision makers in underperforming firms will increasingly be likely to focus on ensuring survival, whereas decision makers in outperforming firms will increasingly be likely to focus on experimenting with slack resources. We propose that the relationship between performance and risk taking should thus be moderated by deadline proximity within a performance period. We tested and found support for our hypotheses in the context of 22,603 fourth-down decisions made by the 32 National Football League teams during the 2000–2005 regular season games. Our findings suggest that the notion of temporally bound performance periods and deadline proximity should play a more central role in attention-based frameworks of organizational risk taking.	earliest deadline first scheduling;experiment;slack variable	David W.

Although many researches could be found that discuss data quality in many areas, few literature exist that particularly focuses on data quality in the field of hydrology. In this paper, we first analyze the key dimensions such as completeness, consistency and accuracy of hydrology date quality, and then propose an efficient date quality management framework based on those dimensions. Moreover, a general date quality assessment model to assess the data quality in these dimensions is also provided. At the end of paper, we proposed a series of methods and techniques to improve the data quality in hydrology database, and carried out in practice to prove it.	data quality	Yufeng Yu;Yuelong Zhu;Jianxin Zhang;Jingjin Jiang	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33469-6_49	data quality;computer science;data mining;management science;information quality;dimension;operations research;quality of analytical results;educational assessment;statistics	DB	-80.86404599802874	15.494453984737396	122318

Field work was carried out in India and in the UK to evaluate the scale and scope of outsourcing activities. CEOs and CIOs were interviewed in fifteen supplier firms in India and two customer firms in UK, about strategic positioning in the offshore outsourcing market; benefits and risks from outsourcing; and other demand and supply-side issues. The findings suggest that, though offshore outsourcing offers new business opportunities for IT suppliers, much of the outsourced work continues to be low risk and low value. The challenge for outsourcing suppliers is therefore to devise strategies to move from body-shopping work to low cost, high value contracts, without incurring additional risk.	outsourcing	Naureen Khan;Wendy L.

Due to a lack of financial resources and expertise, small enterprises tend to find novel ways to utilize IT resources in order to reduce IT adoption costs, to achieve better flexibility, business agility and scalability, and to react faster to market demands. Whereas Taiwan has been promoting cloud computing to help Taiwanese enterprises adopt more effective information technologies, we found that the service strategies of small cloud service providers are individually differentiated in order to survive in the competitive cloud computing market. This paper reports a case study of a small e-learning service provider and its four clients in Taiwan. Some novel insights are revealed through this case study and recommendations are provided accordingly. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A hypothesized model is developed based on both transaction cost analysis and the sales force management literature. Data from 13 electronic component manufacturers covering 159 U.S. sales districts are used to estimate a logistic model of the probability of “going direct” in a given district. Results are shown to be stable across specification and estimation methods and to fit the data well. The transaction cost model is generally supported. The principal finding is that the greater the difficulty of evaluating a salesperson's performance, the more likely the firm to substitute surveillance for commission as a control mechanism, i.e., to use a direct sales force. Among other findings, direct sales forces are also associated with complex, hard-to-learn product lines and with districts that demand considerable nonselling activities. Several factors prove unrelated, including company size, the amount of travel a district requires, and the importance of key accounts.#R##N##R##N#This article was originally published in Marketing Science, Volume 4, Issue 3, Pages 234--254, in 1985.

c0d10998c2f3111095696c6cc68d4a97c1da08b9	the role of synergy in using enterprise architecture for business transformation		Enterprise architecture (EA) provides an integrated representation of an organization’s current and desirable future business capabilities, processes, systems, data and IT infrastructure. EA can interact with and enhance other organizational capabilities, including business transformation capabilities. Despite significant interest and investment in EA, there is little understanding of how EA can augment other organizational capabilities. In this research in progress paper, we focus on the role of EA in augmenting a firm’s business transformation capability. We conceptualize a synergistic relationship between EA and a firm’s business transformation capability and the emergent EA-enabled business transformation capability. We propose a research model that uses synergy and EA-enabled business transformation capability to explain how transformation outcomes and organizational benefits can be enhanced using EA. We argue that EA capability can lead to the exploitation of existing resources by sharing and reuse of assets and exploration of new capabilities by reconfiguring and integrating resources. At an organizational level, EA can increase flexibility, agility and business-IT alignment. The model forms the basis for planned mixed method empirical work combining case studies and a survey.	emergence;enterprise architecture;synergy	Ida Asadi Someh;Keith Frampton;Michael J.

5210184bc949080d710ed3563f371bef5260dfc1	productivity impact of it investment in singapore	it investment	"""While much empirical research has been done on the """"productivity paradox"""" problem in the United States (for a recent survey, see Brynjolfsson 1993), Lhere has been little comparable research among newly industrializing economies (NIEs). The recent work of Krae,ner and Dedrick (1993) shows some correlation of IT investment-GDP ratio with GDP growth rate for a cross section of eleven Asia-Pacific economies, but since no attempt is made to control for other influencing factors (e.g., non-IT related investment), such correlations may be spurious. Whether NIEs face the productivity paradox therefore remains an open question. Among NIEs. Singapore has one of the highest intensities of IT investment per capita. This paper investigates the impact of IT investment on overall productivity in the Singaporean economy by estimating an econoiny-wide Cobb-Douglas production function that separates capital stock into an IT-component and a non-IT component. Output of the production function is measured by real GDP, while labor, the other input in the production function, is measured by total employment adjusted for average work-hours per week. Econometric estimation results for the period 1980-1992 show that, for reasonable range of IT and non-IT capital depreciation ratcs assumed. the production function model fits the data reasonably well in tenns of the usual statistical tests. Moreover, the estimated coefficient for IT capital is significant at the .95 level for all cases. Even the lowest coefficient estimate implies a rate of return (ROI) estimate of IT investment exceeding 88%, which is significantly higher Uhan the assumed capital depreciation rate plus interest rate. It is also higher than the estimated ROl of 68% for a sample of 380 large firms in the US over 1987-1991 as reported recently by Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1994). The estimation results thus appear 10 refute the productivity paradox in the case of Singapore. This is in contrast to most other fi ndings for the United States in the literature, but consistent with the recent findings of Brynjolfsson and Hit[. It would be interesting to see whether similar conclusions can be obtained in other NIEs using a similar estimation method. or that Singapore represents a special case."""	coefficient;cross section (geometry);fits;function model;region of interest	Poh-Kam Wong	1994			open-ended investment company;return on investment;computer science;gross private domestic investment;foreign direct investment;saving;economic growth;labour economics	ML	-85.49943164548367	6.9562001065732915	125136

So, it has a great effect on the corporate governance. Using instrumental variables and panel data model, this paper analyses how the earnings quality, measured by accrual quality, affects the agency costs of controlling shareholder empirically. It reveals that earnings quality affects the agency costs of controlling shareholder significantly; companies with higher earnings quality have lower agency costs of controlling shareholder, and the agency costs decreases with the improvement of earnings quality. The results provide new evidence on the corporate governance effect of accounting information.			2010		10.1109/ICEE.2010.1288	corporate governance;information asymmetry;accounting;principal–agent problem;instrumental variable;agency cost;economics;finance;earnings response coefficient;quantum tunnelling;robustness	Crypto	-83.80192309235699	7.709669841875853	125251
2d467f47e4f8dc088156aa3a8028560fe10adc03	design and deployment challenges in immersive and wearable technologies	hardware challenges;software challenges;social networks;wearable computing;privacy	The current century has brought an unimaginable growth in information and communications technology (ICT) and needs of enormous computing. The advancements in computer hardware and software particularly helped fuel the requirements of human beings, and revolutionized the smart products as an outcome. The advent of wearable devices from their development till successful materialisation has only taken less than a quarter of a century. The huge benefits of these smart wearable technologies cannot be fully enjoyed until and unless the reliability of a complete system is ensured. The reliability can be increased by the consistent advancements in hardware and software in parallel. User expectations actually are the challenges that keep the advancements alive while improving at an unmatchable pace. The future of wearable and other smart devices depends on whether they can provide a timely solution that is reliable, richer in resources, smaller in size, and cheaper in price. This paper addresses the threats and opportunities in the development and the acceptance of immersive and wearable technologies. The hardware and software challenges for the purpose of development are discussed to demonstrate the bottlenecks of the current technologies and the limitations that impose those bottlenecks. For the purpose of adoption, social and commercial challenges related to innovation and acceptability are discussed. The paper proposes guidelines that are expected to be applicable in several considerable applications of wearable technologies, for example, social networks, healthcare, and banking.

In this paper, we model the determinants of the economic value of multi-asset firms with market power when the adjustment costs of investing in IT capital turn into organization capital, increasing the future cash flow of the firm. The resulting valuation equation, new in the literature, has four simultaneous sources of economic value: (i) purchase costs of the assets, (ii) adjustment costs, (iii) organization capital, and (iv) rents from market power. The model is tested with a unique data base from Spanish banks in a time period when these banks invested heavily in IT capital. We find that 54% of the economic value of the representative bank corresponds to the purchase cost of material and immaterial assets, including IT capital. The remaining 46% corresponds to the contributions of: adjustment costs (17%), organization capital (7%) and rents from market power (22%).

Marshall, Richard Nolan Harvard Business School Abstract With the developments in information technology has conie a radical change in the way firms are structured and the principles by which firms are being managed. Nowhere is this trend more apparent than in Financial Services. Financial Service firms, particularly in the Western nations, are more advanced than many other industries in assuming the structures and processes pertinent to tlie new information economy. This is a direct, result of the intangible nature of their services and their compatibility with tlie tcchnology. Evidence from cross-scctor studics of IT invcstaiciit in tlic US ccoiioiiiy is prcsciitcd that stiggcsts this vanguard role of financial service firms in extracting value from their IT investments. Building on a stages model developed by one of the authors, we discuss some of these new management principles, and illustrate their implementation in the Financial Services industry. These principles, we argue, go beyond any single sector of the economy, and thus oKer useful lessons for managers in other industries. These principles cover a wide range of business processes: varying from the strategic, such as how firms will manage their interorganizational relations and the new role of leadership as organizational architect; to the tactical, how firms develop dynamic incentives and tradeoff control and individual empowerment. These principles are illustrated in action using real firms in the Financial Services sector; more rigorous tests of these principles are also suggested as a spur to further research in this area. Finally, we look at how firms in other sectors can learn from the experience of Financial Service firms, and suggest some of the challenges they may face in doing so.	business process;relevance	Chris L.

It provides a framework for the design of an organization-specific decision-making process and for the alignment of a team's microdecision with the “optimal” decision that maximizes the firm's payoff. This study finds that even without changing the team leader, firms could change and even dictate the team's microdecision outcome via adjusting the team member's seniority, empowering team members with veto power or involving a supervisor as a threat to overrule the team decision. This finding implies that to reposition products in the marketplace, structuring cross-functional teams’ microdecision-making processes is essential.

8ffc07dd19c725c4a164ca7b2841371f39c9993a	a study of the risks in an information system outsourcing partnership	information technology;risk reduction;information technology services;it outsourcing;information system;retail banking	The objective of this paper is to report the findings of a case study into the risks involved in an information systems outsourcing  partnership between a retail bank client and the vendor, an information technology service provider. By drawing on the case  study, the paper proposes a theoretical development of shared benefits and shared risks in IT outsourcing partnerships. The  paper argues that the longevity and success of the outsourcing partnership depends largely on managing shared risks and goals  in the outsourcing partnership, which may gradually deteriorate over time without frequent, open interactions between partnership  members. The outsourcing partnership contractual agreements alone may have limited scope in contributing to shared risk reduction  in the IT outsourcing partnership if relationships deteriorate.    This research is based on an investigation of two organizations that used a formal contract to bind each partner’s benefits,  risks, roles, and responsibilities in an IT outsourcing partnership. Future research should seek to explore shared outsourced  partnership benefits and risks across organizations in other sectors. Findings indicate that shared outsourced partnership  risks need to be actively managed in order to reap the benefits. This paper argues that success in an IT outsourcing partnership  relies on managing shared risks in the outsourcing relationship.      	information system;outsourcing	Shabareesh Ajitkumar;Deborah Bunker;Stephen Smith;Donald Winchester	2008		10.1007/978-0-387-87503-3_23	business administration;management information systems;knowledge process outsourcing;business;information technology consulting;information security management;commerce;outsourcing	ML	-81.84106162372017	4.984046175267786	127952

Little is known however as to the actual role played by e-learning with regard to the training problems faced by SMEs. A multiple case study of 16 SMEs in the Atlantic region of Canada, including 12 that use e-learning with varying degrees of intensity, was designed to explore this question. We observed the firms’ training process in terms of training needs analysis, method selection, tool selection and evaluation, and ascertained how this process is impacted by their use of e-learning. E-learning is then characterised in terms of opportunity and feasibility for the development of SMEs and their region.	data assimilation;electronic business;needs analysis	Andrée Roy;Louis Raymond	2008			computer science	HCI	-80.72853772309104	7.4521885073501535	128269

It has been suggested that the adoption of Internet technologies by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) follows a sequence of stages. These models imply a development of their Web sites from the most basic to the most advanced level of sophistication and integration. However, these staged models have been discredited in the literature and are now accepted as being flawed and inadequate to describe the actual adoption of Internet technologies by SMEs. A framework distinguishing three dimensions of change (process, content, and drivers) has been developed to study and classify this evolution. The aim of this research is to study, empirically and by case studies, how SMEs Web sites change over time to gain insights into the actual evolving strategies and motivations behind Internet investments.	device driver;internet;web presence	Fernando Alonso Mendo;Guy Fitzgerald	2005	Ninth European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering	10.1109/CSMR.2005.2	three-dimensional space;the internet;web design;computer science;internet presence management;empirical research	SE	-80.26177011449938	6.306012308474936	128328
06c08dbf07efec7b1b54b825b949f2a99fb8ade5	measuring risk using existing frameworks	information technology	his article focuses on risks to information technology (IT) systems. Technically speaking, risk to an IT system is a function of the likelihood that some threat will attack, or exploit, some vulnerability in the system and a calculation of the potential impact resulting from these attacks or exploitations. Two ways exist to calculate risk to an IT system: quantitatively and qualitatively. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. Quantitative risk assessment attempts to calculate some “regret for loss,” as Case and Smith describe it. This is usually expressed in monetary terms. On the other hand, a qualitative risk assessment expresses risk in abstract terms such as high, medium, or low. Calculating risk, however, is not the same as measuring risk, nor is it the same as creating risk metrics. Calculating risk is about a single issue, or a single threat and vulnerability pairing. Measuring risk — or risk metrics — is about monitoring risk over time.	exploit (computer security);regret (decision theory);risk assessment;riskmetrics;security controls;software framework;threat (computer)	Edwin Covert;Fran Nielsen	2005	Information Systems Security	10.1201/1086/45098.14.1.20050301/87268.4	vulnerability;computer science;data mining;information technology;computer security	Security	-81.92240212348322	17.116460117764206	128371

Improved board structures, administrative procedures and disclosure requirements could result in better-governed banks, which are more likely to allocate investments proficiently. Therefore, a strong corporate governance can be an important pillar for banking organizations assets, because effective boards of directors complement the regulatory oversight. Efforts to promote good corporate governance in financial institutions face a number of challenges. One is getting the most innovative and experienced people to serve on bank’s boards and management, given the complexity of the business environment and new financial products. This requires also finding competent leaders who also understand new business opportunities and their risks, have a healthy scepticism and take decisions quickly. Regulatory and supervisory frameworks alone cannot guarantee financial stability. Effective corporate governance, change management approaches and innovative managerial skills can act as a first line of defence for banks and financial institutions, against any impending crisis and unethical business practices.

Therefore, we conducted a literature review, more specifically a systematic review of relevant articles in five different databases and among several international conference proceedings. Ultimately, we identified 185 relevant papers (95 single or multiple case studies, 55 surveys, and 35 literature reviews or articles from which CSFs can be derived). From these existing studies, we discovered 31 different CSFs for ERP implementation. The top three factors identified are Top management support and involvement, Project management, and User training. However, most of the relevant papers focus on large enterprises. Only 12 papers explicitly focus on smaller and medium-sized enterprises (S&MEs), which is clearly a research gap in this field.	database;erp;enterprise resource planning;systematic review	Christian Leyh	2011				SE	-78.66757417902413	8.644439342690076	128748

Building customer knowledge base through knowledge management provides firms with strategic weapon for customer value creation, average level of customer knowledge enhancement, cost and time reduction, service quality improvement and quicker customer knowledge creation. The main objective of this study is to propose a conceptual framework for exploring the relatedness of the three dimensions: resource provision, knowledge management process and customer knowledge performance. The proposed conceptual framework emphasizes the link between knowledge management with corporate mission and vision and that they set out the direction of corporate knowledge management. This study takes a kitchenware manufacturer and seller in Taiwan as an example to perform a field study to collect the concerned data for exploring the expressed relatedness among the three dimensions of the proposed framework as reported by the respondents in the case company. From the responses of the surveyed case company, it is also demonstrated how customer knowledge can be enhanced through resource provision and knowledge management and that people who surely understand their corporate mission and vision can outperform in knowledge management process and in customer knowledge performance compared with people who do not in this particular setting.	customer knowledge;field research;knowledge base;knowledge management	Hwanyann Su;Yichen Lin;Chiuhua Lai	2004			customer to customer;voice of the customer;organizational learning;knowledge economy;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;customer reference program;customer delight;customer intelligence;business;personal knowledge management;customer retention;knowledge value chain;customer advocacy	AI	-78.98728198386583	7.048859728864036	129136

However, empirical research on complementarity is still rare and frequently inconclusive, especially in the context of small and medium-sized enterprises. We propose a theoretical framework with the independent variables business resources, dynamic capabilities and IT assets. Survey data of 146 small firms suggest that the Internet is complementary with business resources and dynamic capabilities but not with IT assets. Therefore, the framework may enable small firm managers to create competitive advantage by identifying strategic assets that are complementary with the Internet. Furthermore, our research our research highlights the threat of an over-investment in IT assets.	complementarity theory;internet	Frank Schlemmer;Brian R.

The Taiwan government initiated a program for developing the biotech industry as early as the 1980s. However, Taiwan's biopharmaceutical companies have failed to deliver any new drugs to the market in the last 30 years. Therefore, the managerial efficiency of these biopharmaceutical companies in Taiwan needs further examination. Traditional managerial efficiency measurements are either output-oriented or input-oriented, respectively. In this study we apply the directional distance function to estimate the relative managerial efficiency of eleven publicly-traded biopharmaceutical firms during the period 2012-2014. We also measure their productivity by means of the Malmquist-Luenberger index. Our results show that, during 2013-2014, the mean productivity of these companies declined, which can be possibly explained by the significant reduction in mean gross sales due to the occurrence of a serious food safety crisis in 2014. Taiwan's pharmaceutical firms have to pay more attention to their quality control over ingredients that are being used in food and drug production.	british informatics olympiad;dynamical systems theory;input/output	Y.

A business may have processes that do not contribute towards their organisational strategies. Additionally, there may be organisational strategies that are unfulfilled as there are no processes within the business that can satisfy them. Through process composition and assessing strategic alignment, businesses can ensure that all components of the organisation work towards the core goals and the company vision. The motivation of this thesis stems from a lack of formal understanding of the subject. To develop and define concept of alignment in the space of organisational strategy, this dissertation explores the nature of strategy, business process management & composition, integration, compliance and, goal realization. It then provides deep analysis on how these fields can be connected to create a general method for alignment. This thesis seeks to develop a methodological framework and supporting toolkit to provide a measurable assessment of alignment between a portfolio of business processes and the strategic landscape of an organisation. This can be further used to establish re-alignment in a dynamic enterprise context. A suite of tools (TextSeer) as well as a method to assess strategic alignment has been designed and developed through this thesis. These tools enable businesses to better understand their operations. This understanding allows an organisation to manage their processes more efficiently with clear process descriptions and process to strategy mappings. The thesis aids in the modeling and management of processes and business strategies by relating each process within an organisation to related organisational strategies.	business process;dynamic enterprise	Evan D.

96dd52c49c682d952ba858bddc1c99cfdbd859b9	linking web design strategy with business strategy		Given the modern trend toward the Internet, firms can now use web sites to achieve marketing and advertising effectiveness for their businesses. This usage creates a new model of marketing strategy. Experts in the field have indicated that links between marketing and competitive strategies are critical to organisational performance and business success. However, empirical studies conducted in various countries have shown that the web designs are misaligned with organizational strategic objectives. In this study, the authors view web sites as marketing applications, and investigate how corporate sites effectively support three types of business strategy: the prospector, analyser, and defender strategies. The authors conducted a series of in-depth interviews with web site designers and established design techniques through grounded theory approach to indicate how particular web sites support a specific type of business strategy. They also established the relationship between web design strategies and business strategies, which should help practitioners improve the strategic positioning of their web sites.	web design	Kao-Hui Kung;Wei-Hsi Hung;Chuan-Chun Wu;Chun-Chia Liao	2014	IJWP	10.4018/IJWP.2014070101	knowledge management;marketing strategy;technology strategy;profit impact of marketing strategy;management;new business development;world wide web	HCI	-78.92650982281292	7.984551429744686	130204

Along with the growth of online sales, the number of e-commerce retailers has also increased. This has inevitably put additional demands on existing companies as well as new market entrants to ensure that their growth (if not just survival) as well as competitiveness are sustainable and evolving. Web personalisation has been adopted as a means to support business sustainability and competitiveness. It is now increasingly common and has been recognised by e-commerce businesses and consumers as a feature and functionality, expected to be offered as ‘standard’. Recent World Wide Web technology advances have greatly improved the way ecommerce websites are designed and deployed. However, the analysis of academic literature and professional practices shows that these advances are not used to their full potential. This research gap is an opportunity for this community to consider how techniques such as ontologies could be used to enhance personalisation of e-commerce websites. This thesis presents a novel approach to e-commerce website personalisation (PERSONTO), and in particular, personalisation of content presentation. Personalisation is achieved by means of an ontology-based e-shopper profiling. For this purpose, a reusable, extendible and Semantic Web compatible customer profiling ontology OntoProfi is designed and implemented. A ‘proof-of-concept’ prototype of PERSONTO confirmed the feasibility of the proposed approach. The analysis of achievements of the research objectives and outcomes showed that the approach is flexible, extendible and reusable, and that it was achieved by using systematic methods in the system design and implementation of the prototype. The evaluation of the acceptance of the proposed approach suggests there is a high level of acceptance of the approach by the prospective end users and e-commerce developers.	competitive analysis (online algorithm);customer relationship management;e-commerce payment system;extensibility;gödel's ontological proof;high-level programming language;online shopping;ontology (information science);personalization;prospective search;prototype;semantic web;systems design;world wide web	Natalia Edwards	2015			engineering;marketing;data mining;world wide web	AI	-79.23897462133006	13.28161732085943	130274

We hypothesize and empirically show that a certain piece of IT governance, the explicit documentation of roles and responsibilities of staff residing in the client firm’s retained organization contributes to social alignment in terms of interaction quality, shared knowledge, and trust between the client firm’s business and side and the outsourcing vendor. Our model is quantitatively tested by using data from 171 IT outsourcing arrangements in the German banking industry. We show that the documentation of tasks and responsibilities affects the service quality delivered by the vendor in terms of reliability and responsiveness, and that this impact is fully mediated by both client-internal social alignment and vendor/client alignment. This result represents a piece for helping practitioners to develop a better understanding of how to design their outsourcing governance to maintain and improve ongoing outsourcing relationships.	americas conference on information systems;documentation;outsourcing;quality of service;reliability engineering;responsiveness;zeller's congruence	Heinz-Theo Wagner;Daniel Beimborn;Frank Schlosser	2010			public relations;knowledge process outsourcing;business;commerce;outsourcing	Web+IR	-81.83419224661938	4.845026107326191	130869

This is an important issue for any company in pursuit of enhanced operational performance because the whole raison d'être behind the application of patents is the anticipation of achieving maximum competitive advantage. A prerequisite for such a company is a decision analysis model of patent portfolios because this has the added advantage of being readily applicable to the evaluation of the quality of its competitors' portfolios; thus, by understanding both itself and its competitors, a company can attain a superior position. To demonstrate this, we examine patent priority networks (PPNs) formed through patent family members and claimed priority patents, performing a model of patent portfolio analysis and then going on to determine the algorithms. We suggest that information retrieved from this network can provide a useful reference tool for decision-making by company CEOs, CTOs, R&D managers, and intellectual property managers. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Among those is the `trust gap' that exists, according to the PCAST report. Trust is a complex human construct that signi cantly includes risk. In this paper, we examine the risks faced by the di erent user classes proposed by the FCC for sharing in the 3.5 GHz band. We argue that the invisible hands of spectrum sharing in this band is the balance between spectrum sharing gain and associated risks. We nd that both gains and risks can be linked to the distance between incumbents' systems and Citizen Broadband Radio Services (CBRS)' systems. The risk portfolio is linked to spectrum rights that each tier has, since the rights they have determine risks and risk mitigation strategies. We further propose a model to calculate spectrum sharing utilities for di erent tiers. The optimized utility determines the distance between incumbents and CBRS systems.	ibm 1400 series;loom;multitier architecture;prototype;risk aversion	Liu Cui;Martin B. H.

Effective management of these networks relies on the ability to sense where value lies within the network, and this can be achieved through information visibility. We therefore examine the performance potential of information visibility and the essential enablers of visibility in value networks. Based on the relational perspective of the firm, a research model was developed to investigate the association between relational antecedents, information visibility and strategic performance. Data collected from 168 firms indicated that both demand-side and supply-side visibility play a significant role in strategic performance, and factors such as relational assets, knowledge routines, complementary resources and effective governance mechanisms positively influence information sharing behaviors. Our findings indicate that cooperative partnerships among network members enhance performance through increased information visibility in the network.	downstream (software development);holism;universal remote console;upstream (software development);value network	Suparna Goswami;Thiagarajan Ravichandran;Hock-Hai Teo;Helmut Krcmar	2012			public relations;computer science;knowledge management;management science;value network	AI	-80.5399812797407	4.4233435258552385	131631

As industries confronted with fast changing and ever increasingly competitive environment, the industries can make use of R&D alliance of project to swiftly obtain complementary resources and assets so that they can create knowledge assets for the organization internally and effective transfer of technology. However, the impact of hidden social resources is most significant in the formation and operation of R&D alliance. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to examine the three aspects of industrial environment, trust relationship among working partners and formation motif of R&D alliance and to investigate the current situation and dilemma of the R&D alliance in the Taiwan machinery industry (TMI).

The results of structural equation model (SEM) show that the nonredundancy improved the ESC significantly in all the three levels. However, the effect of the structural autonomy is significant in just the structural and resources level and the effect of the structural hole strategy reached significant only in the strategic level. We also find a significant correlation between the structural autonomy and the nonredundancy, but no relations between the structural autonomy and the structural hole strategy and the nonredundancy and the structural hole strategy reached significant. Our study also show that the control benefits of the entrepreneurial relation network and the information benefits of the entrepreneurial social resources had a significant influence to the effectiveness of the entrepreneurial opportunity strategy. Suggestions for ESC proliferation are made according to the results.	social capital;structural holes		2011		10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6023809	structural equation modeling;social capital;mathematical model;mathematics;empirical research;correlation	ECom	-83.56496079854914	4.389616090745167	134066

Although previous studies have tried to explain the underinvestment, we focus on how the way in which a portfolio of opportunities is presented in a list affects adoption decisions. We use information on over 100,000 energy-saving recommendations made to more than 13,000 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms under the Industrial Assessment Centers program of the U.S. Department of Energy. We find that adoption rates are higher for initiatives appearing early in a list of recommendations. This sequence effect is consistent and large: simply moving a recommendation one position lower has the same effect on average as increasing up-front implementation cost by at least 17% from the average value. Given this impact of sequence on adoption of individual recommendations, we utilize variations within our data to examine how various sequencing approaches affect adoption at the portfolio level. Sequences in which recommendations are listed from best to worst payback achieve higher potential energy savings given the investments in energy efficiency made by the firms. We also observe a choice overload effect at the portfolio level, but the magnitude of this effect is small.	recommender system	Suresh Muthulingam;Charles J. Corbett;Shlomo Benartzi;Bohdan W.

The strategic character of outsourcing has led many hotels in Greece to appreciate its significant role in the pursuit of improved performance. This study empirically investigates the outsourcing strategy adopted by Greek hotels. The research models were validated, using data collected from 106 questionnaires, completed by Greek hotel managers. It is found that hotel managers believe that outsourcing has a clear, significant and positive influence on achieving operational objectives such as financial and flexibility improvements, access to new managerial and sourcing methods and quality improvements. In addition, the impact of outsourcing on organisational financial and non-financial performance, from the aspect of the strategic value of the activities, is also examined. Surprisingly, the results indicate that there is no evidence supporting the existence of a significant direct effect of outsourcing on the performance of hotels in Greece. Hotel managers, therefore, should realise that outsourcing is a tool that is used sensibly it can help hotels improve specific activities and achieve some, mainly non-financial, targets. Further research should attempt to led some light on the conditions under which outsourcing of specific activities can enhance hotels' performance.	outsourcing	Prodromos D.

This sourcing choice can lead to distinctive exchange and hierarchical hazards. This study’s main interest is in investigating the research question “How can firms reduce those distinctive exchange and hierarchical hazards arising from the make-buy sourcing strategy when dealing with radical technological change?”rnrnrnrnrnDesign/methodology/approachrnrnrnrnrnThe author develops hypotheses that the in-house retention of outsourced component knowledge will likely reduce exchange hazards arising from the buy strategy choice. And prior exploratory technological experience will likely reduce hierarchical hazards arising from the make strategy choice. The author explores the US mountain bicycle industry from 1980 to 1992 to test the developed hypotheses. For endogeneity arising from the make-buy sourcing decision, the author uses Heckman’s two-stage switching regression model.rnrnrnrnrnFindingsrnrnrnrnrnThe major findings are that the in-house retention of outsourced component knowledge and prior exploratory technological experience is distinctive moderating factors improving performance of a buy strategy and a make strategy, respectively.rnrnrnrnrnOriginality/valuernrnrnrnrnSince the extant literature tends to focus on which of the two sourcing strategies provides the greatest performance advantages in the face of radical technological change, there is a strong implication to suggest that if a firm performs poorly with one sourcing decision, the firm should switch to an alternative one. Different from the expositions of the literature, this study elevates the understanding regarding how firms can improve the performance of their current sourcing orientation rather than whether they should switch from one sourcing strategy to another.

In this context co-opetition is understood and operationalized as a combination of sourcing and alignment capabilities of the SMEs and the cooperative orientation of the business partner. The exploratory findings from interviews followed by a survey of 339 SMEs in three European countries show that cooperation in e-business alliances is positively correlated with e-business value-creation in terms of efficiency, complementarities, lock-in and novelty. The research has implications for business managers in both small and big companies as they make decisions regarding inter-organizational cooperation.	complementarity theory;electronic business;vendor lock-in	Tom R.

0de7ae0e5ce62a11a4e1b496565c0b4721db72bb	simulating the effect of workers' mood on the productivity of assembly lines		Production lines have various components, from workers to loads and machines, each of which can influence the productivity of the entire system either directly or indirectly. One of the most vulnerable parts of an assembly line is the human element. Studies have been conducted on the methods to improve assembly line productivity, both from a worker's ergonomic perspective and from a system simulation perspective, but neither approach has considered the worker's mood. This study uses systems simulation capabilities to address some of the major psychological difficulties that may affect worker efficiency beyond the ergonomic conditions, such as emotional and cognitive factors. This study aims to present feasible solutions for increasing the productivity of an assembly line in a backpack company in Montana, with regard to an employee's mood, and cognitive and physical states.	assembly language;clara oswald;cognition;entity;human factors and ergonomics;line level;server (computing);systems simulation	Erfan Pakdamanian;Niroshni Shiyamsunthar;David Claudio	2016	2016 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		productivity;simulation;workstation;computer science;engineering;manufacturing	HCI	-82.99084708435262	14.367502050892751	135496

Through a series of semi-structured interviews with 30+ SMEs, it is concluded that the services required varied in importance depending on the size and stage of development of the SME. As a result, the key IT requirements for operations in SMEs were developed and a suggested list of cloud-based applications to deliver them through a city cloud service was derived. A good initial point for these Cloud services is to provide a set of common services for SMEs to utilise that enhance collaboration capability. This paper presents the architecture of a set of cloud services that can, via a City Cloud, enhance and boost economic activity in the City Cloud region. Significant elements of the architecture have been tested and key results are presented.	platform as a service	Jay Bal;Ahmad Issa;Xiao Ma	2014		10.1007/978-3-662-44745-1_16	simulation;economics;computer science;engineering;marketing;operations management;services computing;management	ECom	-80.32559917999572	7.473949253861326	135808

While numerous econometric studies have established that there is significant business value from IT investments at an aggregate level, it is often unclear how this value accrues specifically and how a particular IS design and specific IS capabilities contribute. Therefore, this article focuses on IT business value (ITBV) antecedents. It analyzes the role of two distinct key IS capabilities: integration and flexibility, which are widely considered central to IS analysis and design. This article is a necessary first step toward decomposing and measuring ITBV antecedents. Subsequent efforts can build on it by developing scales and survey instruments for quantitative-empirical evaluation. This article follows a tradition of theory development adapted and condensed into a four-step approach for IS literature by Zmud (1998), defines and clearly delineates the constructs, and evolves a model that links them with IT business value.	aggregate data;information system;internet	Christoph Schlueter Langdon	2006		10.4018/jdm.2006070101	knowledge management;business value;management;new business development;information system	HCI	-78.99912195310297	5.737229557272411	135833

Thus, firms are forced to make significant ongoing investments in training their employees to remain competitive. Existing research has not examined the role of training in improving firm level productivity of knowledge firms. This paper provides an innovative econometric framework to estimate returns to such employee training investments made by firms. We use a panel dataset of small-to-medium sized Indian IT services firms and assess how training enhances human capital, a critical input for such firms, thereby improving firm revenues. We use econometric approaches based on optimization of the firm’s profit function to eliminate the endogenous choice of inputs common in production function estimations. We find that increase in training investments is significantly linked to increase in revenue per employee. Further, marginal returns to training are increasing in firm size. Therefore, relatively speaking, large firms benefit more from training. For the median company in our data, we find that a dollar invested in training yields a return of $4.67, and this effect approximately grows 2.5 times for the 75 percentile sized firm. A variety of robustness checks, including the use of Data Envelopment Analysis, are used to establish the veracity of our results.	data envelopment analysis;marginal model;mathematical optimization;veracity	Amit Mehra;Nishtha Langer;Ravi Bapna;Ram D.

Yet the empirical evidence supporting such claims remains largely indirect. As a consequence, few studies have been able to directly examine how contextual factors shape the accumulation of this relational asset or define its value in application. We directly measure the value of relationships between suppliers and a large buyer, using the buyer’s choices in Internet-enabled procurement auctions to estimate the degree to which stronger relationship histories with suppliers increase willingness to pay for high-volume commodity-like parts. Our setting also allows us to examine how this willingness to pay for relationships is shaped by the social context in which they develop and by the exchange context in which they are subsequently deployed, while minimizing the confounding influence any private individual interests have on the choice of exchange partners. Our empirical analysis suggests that, even for commodity parts, prior repeated exchange between firms constitutes a valuable relational asset. We also find evidence that suggests that both social mechanisms and incentive considerations underpin the value of relational capital. Further, we find that relational capital exhibits more value when exchange hazards are greater.	internet;procurement;scott continuity;software deployment;tree accumulation	Daniel W. Elfenbein;Todd R.

The paper provides a brief overview of the advantages and benefits that become available through the development of a commercial Web infrastructure, and notes that whilst these advantages and benefits are well documented, small businesses are often ill equipped to exploit them in pursuit of commercial gain. The reasons for this are considered to centre upon the barriers and problems these businesses encounter when attempting to exploit the Web for commercial gain. Consequently a summary of these barriers and problems is presented. The accuracy of this summary and its applicability as a tool with which to analyse and document the impact of the identified barriers and problems is then explored. To do so a case study research strategy is employed that utilises multiple data collection methods to analyse the on-line experiences of a UK small manufacturing business within the context of the framework presented within this paper. Based upon this case study and the paper’s preliminary findings, further research work is then proposed that will build upon the analysis presented within this paper.	online and offline;while;world wide web	James A.

This paper extends research on a commercial bank’s status quo in pricing its small business loans. The result indicates that this bank mainly emphasizes on risk when pricing small business loans without considering the relationship factor. At last, we propose relationship-lending as the guiding idea for city commercial bank in granting loans to small business, and construct a corresponding relationship lending-based pricing method.

However, e-hubs continue to elicit interest in industries such as car production. Yet, there is little research that investigates firmsâ€™ strategies for e-procurement in the automotive industry and the potential benefits of e-hubs to them. This research re-examines the transition from bespoke electronic data interchange to generic electronic procurement, and conflicting motivations and complex barriers at firm and industry level are revealed. The article develops a framework that examines the benefits and barriers to firms joining e-hubs, applies the framework to the car industry, and proposes an e-procurement matrix that offers alternative strategies. Six cases from vehicle manufacturers and component suppliers demonstrate a shallow industry structure that lacks supplier integration, where a particular concern is the emergence of consortium e-hubs that combine a transactional approach for reducing price, with a collaborative approach that requires sharing knowledge. While this dispels the myth of simplistic e-commerce models, the governance of e-procurement across collaborative supply chains is still uncertain.	e-procurement;procurement;software industry	Mickey Howard;Richard T.

Firms that contemplate IT outsourcing have two alternatives: (1) contract with a vendor (i.e., outsourcing) or (2) set up their own IT subsidiary (i.e. quasi-outsourcing). This study examines some of the determinants of the outsourcing vs. quasi-outsourcing decision. Using primary data collected in France and Germany, we show that the outsourcing vs. quasioutsourcing decision is strongly influenced by both internal (i.e., asset specificity, size and internal organization of IT) and external (i.e., institutional environment) determinants.	outsourcing;sensitivity and specificity	Jérôme Barthélemy;Dominique Geyer	2005	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2004.02.005	economics;operations management;knowledge process outsourcing;economy;management;law;information technology;outsourcing	Security	-82.45729426174027	7.929197913713706	136704

In particular, the usability of the products being developed needs to be evaluated. This has included the application of standards designed to ensure the process of system development is user-centered and takes usability into consideration while a product is being developed. In addition to this, in healthcare, organizations in the United States and Europe have also addressed the need and requirement for product certification. However, despite these efforts there are continued reports of unusable and unsafe implementations. In this paper we discuss the need to not only include (and require) usability testing in the one-time development process of health IT products (such as EHRs), but we also argue for the need to additionally develop specific usability standards and requirements for usability testing during the implementation of vendor products (i.e. post product development) in healthcare settings. It is further argued that health IT products that may have been certified regarding their development process will still require application of usability testing in the process of implementing them in real hospital settings in order to ensure usability and safety. This is needed in order to ensure that the final result of both product development and implementation processes take into account and apply the latest usability principles and methods.

However, not many studies have been conducted to assess the architectural decision-making and decision reuse processes through empirical investigations. Besides, the effect of the relationships among the actors in a software ecosystem on the architectural decisions-making process of each actor is not well studied. Goal: The objective of this paper is to identify the main processes and issues on the architectural decision-making in largescale enterprises by considering the relationships among the enterprises and other actors of the ecosystem. Method: We conducted semi-structured interviews with six Norwegian companies in the software ecosystem of electricity industry. Results: Regarding the architectural decision-making process, the findings are in line with previous empirical studies, showing that most of the companies are not using well-known academic approaches such as ATAM, they are rather using their own procedures. The study also shows that the relationships among the actors of a software ecosystem could significantly affect the architectural-decision making process in each of the actors, for example, by limiting their alternative solutions. Finally, the results confirm that it is advantageous for the enterprises to reuse the architectural decisions across their various projects or for cooperative companies to reuse the decisions across their similar projects. Conclusion: Improving the reusable architectural decision frameworks by considering the relationships among the actors in a software ecosystem would be beneficial for the industry.	architectural decision;exploratory testing	Mohsen Anvaari;Reidar Conradi;Maria Letizia Jaccheri	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-39031-9_14	architectural pattern;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;electric power industry;management science;empirical research	HCI	-78.6313104041245	9.06977766403231	136986

All rights reserved. A critical issue facing managers of information technology (IT) today is how to respond to the emergence and growth of the network organization that is virtually formed by separate firms, each retaining its own authority in major budgeting and pricing matters, to function as integral parts of a greater organization. What can and should be done from an IT standpoint to support and exploit this new organization form? What needs and opportunities exist for new kinds of computer-based systems devised specifically to facilitate management and coordination in network organizations? A prerequisite for answering these questions in a systematic, definitive way is clear understanding of the variables and constructs involved in coordinating such organizations. An empirically supported model of coordination in network organizations is introduced. Our model development takes a reputation-oriented framework of coordination within network organizations as a starting point. The model posits that participating firms reputation strongly influence coordination decisions in networks, affecting each firms initiation into the organization, selection for task execution, and termination from the network.

38ac1ed6f0b915fe441b76d37046aba1aebca528	enabling organizational agility through self-service business intelligence: the case of a digital marketplace		Many organizations are adopting business intelligence and analytics systems in order to cope with the increasing digitalization of data intensive environments. In this paper, we study the role of self-service business intelligence (SSBI), a certain capability provided by a business intelligence system, in enabling organizational agility. In particular, the research question we address is as follows: How does self-service business intelligence enable organizational agility in a multi-sided platform? We focus on two types of organizational agility – namely, market capitalizing agility and operational adjustment agility – and identify how SSBI enables these capabilities in a multi-sided platform environment. We have conducted 12 qualitative interviews by focusing on the biggest digital marketplace of Norway, Finn.no. Our results indicate that SSBI plays an important role in enabling 1) market capitalizing agility by providing better understanding of supply and demand participants, more access to traffic data and user clickstreams, fast response to requests, and more access to supply and demand navigation behavior and 2) operational adjustment agility by redefining current organizational structures, empowering organizational employees, providing equal access to organizational level data and opportunities for data manipulation. The findings provide an empirical evidence for the role of SSBI in enabling organizational agility within the context of multi-sided platform environment. (Less)		Imad Bani Hani;Sinan Deniz;Sven A.

Modularity-based manufacturing is the application of unit standardization or substitution principles to create modular components and processes that can be configured into a wide range of end products to meet specific customer needs. This study defines modularity-based manufacturing practices (MBMP), develops a valid and reliable instrument to measure MBMP, builds a framework that relates customer closeness, MBMP, and mass customization capability, and tests structural relationships within this framework using LISREL. Based on 303 responses from members of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, statistically significant and positive relationships were found among customer closeness, modularity-based manufacturing practices, and mass customization capability. Managerial implications of the empirical findings of this study and future research directions are also discussed.		Qiang Tu;Mark A. Vonderembse;T. S. Ragu-Nathan;Bhanu S.

953843cd7b5cd005f34a41ac027320d21953945e	aggregate collaborative planning in non-hierarchical business networks		The last decade has been characterized by times of change, including increasing levels of globalization and competition. Collaboration allowed SMEs to respond effectively to the development of new complex products and services but presented new barriers concerning the management of their business processes and relations with partners. This paper presents a new collaborative aggregate planning for non-hierarchical business networks, where SMEs collaborate in the selection of partners and definition of the operations plan required to specify, manufacture and distribute a custom made products. The proposed approach is based on negotiations undertaken by the partners in order to promote the creation of alternative operations plans and allow a multicriteria evaluation of the involved costs and delivery dates. The proposed approach promotes the reduction of communication between partners, a reactive analysis of changes to planning and associated impact, enhancement of trust (since all partners have the same weight on the decision process).	aggregate data;aggregate function;business process;centralized computing;high-level programming language;information privacy;information system;local information systems;organizing (structure);requirement	Ricardo Almeida;Cesar Toscano;Luis Maia Carneiro;Américo Lopes Azevedo	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-23330-2_51	engineering;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;management	AI	-77.94703925937202	4.5685588634159595	139523

In order to allow these microanalyses on a quantitative and empirically based level microsimulation models were developed and increasingly used for economic and social policy impact analyses. Though microsimulation is known and applied (mainly by experts), an easy to use and powerful PC microsimulation model is hard to find. The overall aim of this study and of MICSIM-A PC Microsimulation Model is to describe and offer such a user-friendly and powerful general microsimulation model for (almost) any PC, to support the impact microanalyses both in applied research and teaching. Above all, MICSIM is a general microdata handler for a wide range of typical microanalysis requirements. This paper presents the concept, developments and applications of MICSIM. After some brief remarks on microsimulation characteristics in general, the concept and substantive domains of MICSIM: the simulation, the adjustment and aging, and the evaluation of microdata, are described by its mode of operation in principle. The realisations and developments of MICSIM then are portrayed by the different versions of the computer program. Some MICSIM applications and experiences in research and teaching are following with concluding remarks.

A more comprehensive view of marketing identifies three distinct roles of marketing: marketing as business philosophy at corporate level, marketing as strategy at business level, and marketing as tactics (marketing mix) at functional level. Thus, marketing is a synthesis of particular skills and practices learned and resources created translating the philosophy into specific business strategies in order to achieve competitive advantages and superior performance. The empirical study is based on a survey concerning a sample of manufacturing companies with national and international operations. The 42 companies or divisions comprise 38%; of the member companies or divisions of the Finnish Electrical and Electronics Industry Association. Market orientation of these companies or divisions was assessed with MARKOR scale of Kohli, Jaworski and Kumar.

The multifaceted role of information technology (IT) in organizations has been extensively examined. However, the interaction between IT assets and IT management and its impact on firm performance remains less clear. In this paper, we adopt a systems perspective to further examine this important mechanism. In particular, we investigate how IT assets and IT management, as key subsystems within the larger organization system, interact to jointly impact organizational performance. Building on systems theory's notion of open systems, we also examine how the organization and its sub-systems are impacted by the environment in which it is located. Specifically, we investigate how environmental dynamism permeates the boundaries of the organization to moderate the interaction between the IT assets and IT management subsystems. A matched-sample of 214 business executives and IT managers is used for testing the hypotheses.		Yi Wang;Si Shi;Saggi Nevo;Shaorui Li;Yang Chen	2015	Int J.

d5f624de5d8bacd06af58811269a1ffc8d62690b	entrepreneurial orientation and digitalization in the financial service industry: a contingency approach		Financial service firms, and banks in particular, are faced with a shift from traditional, interpersonal forms of service to online services. Digital technologies are more and more becoming today’s standard and challenge traditional business models in the banking sector. Building on the concept of Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO), this study of banks in Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein aims at developing insights that explain how banks can use the tactics and strategies associated with EO to achieve superior performance in the digitalization age. Results from a survey in 102 banks show that: 1) banks that display high levels of EO report a higher level of performance, and 2) the relationship between strategic vision on digitalization and performance is moderated by EO. These results indicate that the sheer level of digitalization of a bank does not affect profitability. Instead, banks should develop a clear vision on digitalization that is characterized by innovation, being ahead of the competition, and a willingness to take risks.	e-services;switzerland;tps report	Thomas Niemand;Coen Rigtering;Andreas Kallmünzer;Sascha Kraus;Stevan Matijas	2017			entrepreneurial orientation;marketing;contingency approach;strategic planning;profitability index;computer science;financial services;interpersonal communication;business model	HCI	-82.64649678938305	5.966822573421572	140257
1bdf42135ae857e8b8311ef7a022a3754abca518	network organizations		It is common to dene a network organization as one that is fast and exible in adapting to changes in the underlying environment. But besides the short-run advantages of adaptability, fast changes in the structure of the organization can also be detrimental in the longer run. This happens because a widespread knowledge of the organizations structure is important in channelling (and thus speeding up) search. I discuss the trade-o¤ between adaptability and structural stability in a changing environment where, if the structure of the organization adjusts, information on the exact nature of the change becomes known only with some lag. The main conclusion is that, as environment becomes more volatile, the optimal operational mode of the organization essentially passes from being totally exible to being completely rigid, i.e. no intermediate options are ever optimal. This has important implications on the dichothomy of stability versus change that has informed recent organization literature.

The goals cited include cost savings, achieving strategic focus, alleviating skills shortages and seeking to implement best practices. Current reports from actual outsourcing case studies indicate that many organizational goals remain unfulfilled. This paper proposes to study the impacts of BPO on the client organization using Coordination Theory. A case study of an organization, which outsourced its service delivery process and subsequently insourced parts of it, is presented. The case study supports the existence of strategic and operational gaps between the client and vendor organizations, which negatively impact the BPO. A follow up empirical study is being pursued to quantitatively measure the success of BPO using three costs vulnerability, coordination and production for different categories of processes. The results of this study will have implications for the selection of business processes or functions that can fare better when outsourced.	best practice;business process;itil;outsourcing	Biswadip Ghosh;Judy E.

444f7c86394b6e3797ed7128e451ba8baec8ab6f	challenges of governing interorganizational value chains: insights from a case study		Existing research has shown that both IT and data within an organization need to be governed appropriately in order to achieve business value from IT and to ensure data quality, compliance, and privacy. For achieving a high level of maturity in IT and Data Governance functions, a combination of governance structures, processes, and mechanisms as well as their establishment within the organization is seen as vital. However, organizations today usually act within bigger networks of organizations to achieve value gains usually consisting of a set of heterogeneous stakeholders pursuing their own goals and having their own IT infrastructures. Especially the way data is exchanged through IT and the quality of this data is of high relevance for inter-organizational business processes. Based on a comparative case study approach, we analyze the challenges of governing IT and data within buyer-supplier relationships drawing upon findings from both IT governance and transaction cost economics. The identified challenges are then used to derive implications for an organization’s governance framework based on a maturity model. This can help organizations to assess their maturity in terms of value chain governance concerning both IT infrastructures and data exchange processes.	business process;capability maturity model;coat of arms;collaborative network;data governance;data quality;discontinuous galerkin method;ecosystem;european conference on information systems;file spanning;high-level programming language;hoc (programming language);interaction;mathematical optimization;microsoft outlook for mac;multi-level governance;norm (social);privacy;process (computing);relevance;sampling (signal processing);tail value at risk;value (ethics)	Sang-Kyu Thomas Choi;Ivonne Kröschel	2015			knowledge management;business process;management science;transaction cost;computer science;stakeholder;capability maturity model;environmental resource management;corporate governance;data quality;business value;data governance	Web+IR	-77.79601174185262	5.87883803873359	140525

Software agents combine and integrate capabilities of several information technology classes in a novel manner that enables supply chain management and decision making in modes not supported previously by IT and not reported previously in the information systems literature. Indeed, federations and swarms of software agents today are moving the boundaries of computer-aided decision making more generally. Such moving boundaries highlight promising new opportunities for competitive advantage in business, in addition to novel theoretical insights. But they also call for shifting research thrusts in information systems. The stream of research associated with this article is taking some first steps to address such issues by examining experimentally the capabilities, limitations, and boundaries of agent technology for computer-based decision support and automation in the procurement domain. Procurement represents an area of particular potential for agent-based process innovation, as well as reflecting some of the greatest technological advances in terms of agents emerging from the laboratory. Procurement is imbued with considerable ambiguity in its task environment, ambiguity that presents a fundamental limitation to IT-based automation of decision making and knowledge work. By investigating the comparative performance of human and software agents across varying levels of ambiguity in the procurement domain, the experimentation described in this article helps to elucidate some new boundaries of computer-based decision making quite broadly. We seek in particular to learn from this domain and to help inform computer-based decision making, agent technological design, and IS research more generally.	procurement;software agent	Mark E.

IS managers tried to influence stakeholder perceptions with ‘soft’ evidence such as successful application projects, user endorsements, and other IS anecdotes. In addition, IS managers used benchmarks to provide more ‘objective’ evidence. Given the hostile environment caused by misalignment, some IS managers used a variety of tactics to manipulate the benchmarks to obtain a ‘good report card’, such as picking a reference group of only mediocre performers and undermining the integrity of the data collection process. We present a framework to understand the context of misalignment which can help stakeholders flush out their differences to arrive at a common strategy for the portfolio of IS activities. In the context of a shared strategy, benchmarks targeted at a performance improvement — rather than turf-protection — can be achieved.	information system	Mary Lacity;Rudy Hirschheim	1995	J.

Results show that environmental uncertainty tends to motivate manufacturers to increase their manufacturing flexibility, with both virtual integration and supplier responsiveness playing a vital, enabling role. The results also demonstrate the importance of supplier responsiveness for manufacturers to obtain manufacturing flexibility and comparative cost advantage in supply chain operations.

IS projects seeking to foster innovation need to balance these forces, and recognize the distinct role that each plays. Through its essential role in generating a design space between existing problems and design options, the requirements phase of a development project represents a domain where exploration and exploitation need to be integrated. Based on a field study involving interviews with 39 IT professionals managing large and complex development initiatives, we analyze the degree to which prevailing requirements practices incorporate the logics of exploration and exploitation. Our findings focus on key challenges faced by project teams in failing to engage exploration as a necessary element in requirements practice. In addition, we offer several recommendations to enhance the pursuit of organizational innovation by supporting both exploration and exploitation.	complexity;exploit (computer security);failure;field research;requirement;requirements analysis	Sean W.

In military domain, HRIS is particularly crucial as the organisation comprises a huge number of personnel who not only possess various skill sets but also are physically scattered at remote locations. Military operations in essence require the selection of right personnel for right tasks during troop deployment in the battlefield. Right selection is very critical as in war there is no second prize for the runner up. As the selection is normally based on the information in HRIS, the system must incorporate the necessary elements of military operations in order to suit the needs and goals of the organisation. This paper discusses the factors that contribute to the success of HRIS implementation for military domain. The factors form a HRIS framework that integrates three important elements in military, namely people, process, product. The framework was proposed based on literature review as well as field study that used interviews and observations techniques as the instruments. The sampling frame consisted of fifteen members of HRIS users from military domain. The data were analysed by using qualitative method. The framework can guide future military HRIS implementation that support armed forces' work processes and needs.	align (company);field research;human resource management system;information system;prototype;requirement;sampling (signal processing);software deployment	Mohamad Mohamad Noor;Rozilawati Razali	2011	Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021559	engineering;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;human resource management;database;management science;information system	HCI	-78.37430718207254	7.282189181656024	144292

RFID can be applied to a variety of tasks, structures, work systems and contexts along the value chain, including business-to-business logistics, internal operations, business-to-consumer marketing, and after-sales service applications. As industry adoption of RFID increases there is an emerging interest by academic researchers to engage in scholarly investigation to understand how RFID relates to mobility, organizational and systems technologies (MOST). In this paper, we seek to make the ‘most’ out of RFID by proposing a research agenda to address a series of broad research questions related to how RFID technology: is developed, adopted, and implemented by organizations; is used, supported, and evolved within organizations and alliances, and; impacts individuals, business processes, organizations, and markets. As with many technology innovations, as the technical problems associated with implementing and using RFID are addressed and resolved, the managerial and organizational issues will emerge as critical areas for IS research.	business process;logistics;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;work systems	John P.

So, this paper argues that for a successful embarkation in e-Business, the choice and design of DMS Business models should be aligned to destination peculiar characteristics. In this aim a theoretical framework for the identification of DMS business models suitable to the different destinations configurations is presented. The conclusions will show as this framework is not static, but it follows and represents an evolutionary e-business implementation pattern for destinations.

However, few people are aware that IC, if not managed properly, may also pose threats, sometime serious, to an organization. Knowledge leakage from an organization, for example, may come about when an experienced employee leaves for another job. Knowledge leakage is pervasive throughout an organization but is seldom noticed until the consequence is felt. This intellectual capital risk has to be systematically and effectively identified, assessed and controlled in the whole value chain of an organization. An AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) based multi-dimensional decision making and assessment model is developed to determine knowledge leakage risk in an organization.	risk assessment;spectral leakage	Haley Wing Chi Tsang;W.

A diversification strategy is both a driver of sunk costs and strategic slack. Strategic slack is a valuable reserve of knowledge, usable to foster innovation. Using linear models, we explore the interplay between research and development (R&D) and organisational slack in large and diversified companies listed on the Euronext 100 Index. We consider the diversification pattern over time, and its interactions with the following three categories: sunk costs, slack resources, and R&D. The results show an antithetic effect of diversification and slack on R&D expenditures. In contrast to unabsorbed and potential slack, diversification and sunk costs hinder innovation. However, diversification is a huge source of strategic slack and, thus, has a positive effect on innovation, indirectly.	diversification (finance)	Beatrice Orlando;Antonio Renzi;Giuseppe Sancetta;Nicola Cucari	2018	Techn.

At this moment, a theoretical understanding of the complexity associated with these business processes and their data is absent. In this paper, we therefore suggest the concept of entropy from thermodynamics as justificatory knowledge for governing design science research efforts. This might lead to a set of prescriptive guidelines for creating business processes exhibiting a low degree of complexity. Our analysis shows that entropy indeed seems a viable concept for this purpose.	business process;complexity;entropy (information theory)	Peter De Bruyn;Philip Huysmans;Gilles Oorts;Herwig Mannaert;Jan Verelst	2014	2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	10.1109/HICSS.2014.462	entropy;computer science;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;data science;management science	Robotics	-78.65465425740399	5.8292519684110955	147544

A view of strategy is recognized which includes an evaluation of the stages and processes of evolution for these markets. A framework encompassing critical elements such as e-market ecosystems, e-alliances, e-knowledge and e-systems, is developed and advanced for further strategic analysis. The model is believed to be of value for conceptual assessment of virtual business communities where unique attention to continuous innovation and dynamic organizational adaptation are considered imperative for competitive success. This is increasingly characterized by paradoxical issues, such as competing in the present time and building long-term strategic competences for the future. The model is validated with relevant examples and a substantive case study. q 2004 Elsevier B.V.

IT persomiel have always been required to keep their technological skills current. During the last two decades additional non-technical skills have been added to the IT person’s portfolio, such as the utnderstanding of business principles and the application of information technology to business practices. Continuous re-skilling is a costly investment for the individual and employer. Consequently, the selection of the right individuals who have the ability to continuously learn new skills is of the utmost importance. The entry level requirement for the South African IT industry is a university, college or technical qualitication. It is the task of such institutions to identify and select students who will successfully contribute to the requirements of today’s dynamic IT industry. Ilow best to select prospective IT students and persomiel has been researched for a number of years. Such research demonstrates that performance-related criteria, such as matriculation results, are useful indicators in the identification and selection of successful IT students and personnel. The psychometric profile of an 1T person appears to also be a useful indicator in the selection procedure. However the psychometric profile of IT personnel is changing as business changes, as new IT careers emerge and current IT careers change or disappear. Research conducted at the University of Port Elizabeth in South Africa, on the identification and selection of successful IT students, has identified new performance and psychometric criteria. This research has also identified a number of nontechnical IT skills which are required to perform successfully in the business envirotunent. Introduction IT personnel are experiencing increased demands, as business faces growing competition, fast-changing technologies and more sophisticated and demanding end-users. The traditional IT person, programming from specifications, having no contact with the end-user and with business, specifying delivery times for programs and hiding behind the application backlog, is now accountable to management and has to cost justify the IT budget. IT personnel must justify their existence and contribution to business success by applying technology to leverage competitive advantage for the company. The traditional IT department developed and maintained application systems for distinct functional areas and activities. With day-to-day business operations being increasingly supported by, or dependant on IT, the modern IT department must now manage a complex information technology infrastructure which supports the complete business process, from tnission critical applications to business innovation and strategic advantage. In South Africa, business is additionally affected by a changing economic, social and political enviromnent and climate. South African business is currently experiencing an acute shortage of skilled IT personnel. The so called ‘brain drain’ has seen skilled IT personnel leaving the country, due to an uncertain future and a prevailing high crime rate. The figure has been estimated at 4% per year (Sunday Times, 23 November 1993), aggravating the IT persomiel shortage and the threat from increased international competition and customer demands for quality service. South African business is demanding that IT personnel support business in providing strategic technological guidance (Sprague et al, 1993). Newly qualified IT students entering the job market are expected to adapt to this changing business environment and to apply technological skills to new strategic business practices. South African Computer Science and Information Systems departments must meet these challenges. However, they are experiencing staff shortages, limited cotnputer facilities and dwindling educational budgets. Staff face heavy workloads, time constraints and a rapidly changing student population. As the numbers of prospective IT students rise, educational institutions are under pressure to ensure that students accepted into the curriculum will be successful. The selection of prospective Computer Science and Information Systems students is crucial, as is the identification and selection of suitably qualified IT persomiel, for future success in business. This is the challenge that faces IT departments in tertiary education institutions.	brain–computer interface;business process;computer science;ipv4 address exhaustion;information systems;information system;organizational behavior;population;prospective search;quality of service;requirement;resultant;service innovation;word lists by frequency	André P.

The focus is on the process of diffusion and adoption of ITO as a management innovation. The paper is written from the perspective of ITO vendors from developing countries and seeks to identify steps that will help these vendors sell ITO services to SMEs in first world countries. The model is motivated by two research streams: diffusion of innovation theory and institutional theory. The model posits that vendors should exploit the fit among three factors (as it is this fit that determines the adoption rate of ITO services): (1) innovation profile, including features such as relative advantage and complexity of service offered; (2) innovator profile, including features such as prestige level of the firm, educational level, and firm size; and (3) field-level characteristics such as intensity of competition, density of inter-firm connections, service professionalization, knowledge codification in the field, and effort level by intermediaries in promoting legitimacy of ITO.	emoticon;indium tin oxide;interconnection;outsourcing	Abhijit Chaudhury;Pratyush Bharati	2008			knowledge process outsourcing;process management;business;commerce	Web+IR	-80.52097637485109	5.1858090415878175	147988

However, the understanding of how to achieve that is limited due to the newness of this kind of business. This paper investigates whether all stakeholders of the platform ecosystem can generate sufficient value when participating in the platform. As stakeholders, we consider application service users, service developers, and service platform providers. We also analyse the interrelationship between these stakeholders. The analysis outcome is a value creation model that allows the calculation of the stakeholders' values. The model also helps inferring the relative impact of different factors on the evolution of values of the software service platform stakeholders. Our simulation results confirm that all stakeholders of a service platform mainly benefit from a growing installed base of application users. However, in a mature market, a large service variety mainly benefits the service platform provider, while the other stakeholders obtain a reduced increase in their benefits. In particular, the utility growth of application users becomes constrained as the benefit from new connections with other users decreases and the number of new services used decreases. Similarly, the revenue of service developer decreases, making service development less profitable. Therefore, we can state that not only a large fraction of the value creation goes to the platform provider but also that the software service ecosystem can collapse, if no mutually beneficial pricing of services is implemented.

Inequalities are exacerbated when employers have high standards and keep only the best workers in house. We found that ambitious workers get higher quality jobs even if ambition does not correlate or even negatively correlates with internal quality.

However, companies typically know little about the underlying individual demand patterns in these processes. Conceptualizing information demand patterns of individuals is expected to allow for using these as foundation to extend the traditional internal information logistic perspective of companies. Digital options could then be used to align individual and organizational information leading not only to new product and service offers, but also to new work structures in organizations. Thus, we extend prior literature regarding business process management and information logistics by highlighting how information demand patterns (IDP) have to be adapted to individual processes. Our exploratory approach is to demonstrate conceptually the conditions and implications of individual IDPs.	align (company);business process;information logistics	Michael Leyer;Kurt Sandkuhl	2017	CSIMQ	10.7250/csimq.2017-13.04		HCI	-78.39834786810172	5.471035938955964	149070

The past decade has witnessed a shift from the need to manage transactions to that of the need to manage relationships. Where Enterprise Resource Planning software dominated the management of transactions era, CRM software leads in regard to relationships. At present, a balanced view of CRM software is scantly presented instead relying on vendor rhetoric. This paper aims to make a contribution to this neglected area by presenting an analysis of some of the key issues associated with CRM systems. Three issues emerge: the limitations of CRM standard software, the need for a holistic view of CRM projects and the problems of a dominant management perspective of CRM projects. It is argued that these issues could be more readily accommodated by organisational detachment from beliefs in IT as utopia, consideration of prior IS theory and practice and a more informed approach to CRM software selection. The paper also raises research questions in relation to CRM systems, IT maturity, standard software trends and the role of the IS function.	business process;capability maturity model;competitive analysis (online algorithm);customer relationship management;design rationale;erp;enterprise resource planning;holism;information system;management system;requirement;resultant;selection (user interface);system integration	Ben Light	2001			enterprise relationship management;customer to customer;voice of the customer;customer relationship management;enterprise software;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;customer reference program;digital firm;customer intelligence;process management;supplier relationship management;technology strategy;business relationship management;customer retention;service quality;enterprise planning system;relationship marketing;enterprise information system;customer advocacy	SE	-77.70268570944963	6.390579781023051	149220

Nonetheless, multipartner alliances do benefit from built-in stabilizing third-party ties that mitigate opportunism and conflict between partner pairs. Previous empirical research on multipartner alliance stability has been inconclusive. We shed some light on these inconsistencies by recognizing that within multipartner alliances, schisms can occur not only between a pair of partners but also between subgroups of partners that are divided by faultlines. We suggest that divisive faultlines can form between subgroups of partners within a multipartner alliance as a function of their prior experience with one another. When a subgroup of alliance partners has relatively strong ties to each other and weak ties to other partners, destabilizing factions can develop that hamper reciprocity among the partners. Using a longitudinal analysis of 59 multipartner alliances, we found that, in general, faultlines as modeled by the dispersion of tie strength within multipartner alliances increase the hazard of unplanned dissolutions. We also found that multipartner alliances comprising a mix of centrally and peripherally positioned partners within the industry network were less apt to suffer the effects of divisive faultlines. We suggest that this is due to the greater opportunity costs of dissolution and the presence of relatively high-status partners who can act as peacekeepers and coordinators of their lower-status partners.

Practically, product complexity not only affects the cycle time of its development, but also impacts production cost, quality, serviceability and customer satisfaction. Moreover, product complexity will even have a profound impact on manufacturing organization and management style of producer. It is, therefore, one of most important factors for a company to consider in its product development process. Theoretically, measurement of product complexity has had many problems needed to be overcome, since in perspective of product life cycle, a product is not only a complex system but a complex process. This paper provides a model in which product complexity is measured in terms of technology, size, organization, and environment. It uses a multi-level indicator system to present product complexity. A grey coefficient is provided to comprehensively evaluate the system complexity of a product, so that it can be used to optimize a product design and evaluate alternatives of product schemes. It can further be used to reveal relationship between product complexity with cost, quality, cycle time, and customer satisfaction.	coefficient;complex system;complexity;computer cluster;new economy;new product development;optimal design	Zhuo Zhang;Qunhui Luo	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4413624	product proliferation;complexity management;product design;new product development;product engineering	Robotics	-77.89844158134366	14.175280341422562	151710

This investigation not only provides evidence for the systemic influence, that is, systemic risk, of the crisis, but also reveals the contagion mechanism of the crisis, which supports the stress testing. Second, the authors use a network-related business intelligence algorithm, the combined hyperlink-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm, to measure the contribution of a given individual industry to the overall risk of the economic system or, in other words, the systemic importance of the individual industry.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Findings#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#The HITS algorithm considers both the market information and the interconnectedness of the industries.

This is done in terms of analysing changes in the tactical planning processes, effects on company performance, and how the APS is used in a practical planning context. Design/methodology/approach – This research is based on a longitudinal case study in the process industry. The case company, a high-end steel producer, has been studied during several years using a combination of data sources: literature reviews, interviews, archival records, and also attendance at meetings, workshops, seminars, etc. Findings – This case study points to the fact that implementing an APS and reorganizing the planning department and the planning processes are mutually dependent. The positive effects at the tactical planning level (in terms of service levels, fast and reliable order promises, more accurate forecasts) could not have been realized without the APS. On the other hand, the APS could not have been effectively utilized without the organizational change. Research limitations/implications – The results presented in this paper are based on a single case study, but in the context of our literature review and other case studies the findings are still valid and an important step towards better understanding of the practical use of APSs. Practical implications – The process descriptions, lessons learnt, and issues encountered in case studies like this should be helpful to practitioners on their way to implement APSs, and companies seeking new ways to improve their planning can use this research to investigate the use of an APS. Originality/value – Studies on the practical use of standard APS software are still scarce. As such this paper provides enhanced knowledge and understanding on the use of APSs in industry settings.	archive;computer file;organizational behavior;terms of service	Martin Rudberg;Ola Cederborg	2011	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635571111133579	service level;economics;design methods;systems engineering;engineering;marketing;operations management;management science;demand management;management	HCI	-79.54834468378563	8.854811737623713	151907

While there is research focusing on the classification and impact of different ERP modification strategies, research addressing the cost implication of ERP modifications is still lacking. In this paper, we look at existing literature to classify ERP modification strategies, and then we focus on the issue of evaluating the relative cost of different strategies. We gather the opinion of experts in ERP implementations about the relative cost of alternative strategies using an AHP-based online questionnaire. Based on the results of the data collection, we build cost functions to compare the relative cost of alternative strategies. Our approach represents a first step in quantifying the relative cost of different ERP implementation strategies and can be exploited in decision-making problems related to ERP change and evolution.	business process;erp;enterprise resource planning	Minou Parhizkar;Marco Comuzzi	2015	2015 International Conference on Enterprise Systems (ES)	10.1109/ES.2015.27	systems engineering;knowledge management;operations management;business	SE	-77.96751595659643	9.650220128282632	151982

The goals of this study are therefore not only to investigate the performance effects of such innovation, but also to identify the possible antecedents and moderators. This study used a sample of 1595 firm-year observations for manufacturing firms in the S&P 500, spanning the period 2001–2013, to test the proposed hypotheses. The results show that a higher level of AI leads to better performance. A firm with a diversified technological portfolio (TP) is thus likely to achieve higher degrees of AI as well as see better firm performance. The empirical findings also reveal that AI plays a mediating role in the relationship between TP and performance. Furthermore, absorptive capacity is found to strengthen the relationship between TP and AI.		Chinho Lin;ChiaChi Chang	2015	Techn. Analysis & Strat.

3b79510c0c09b3342adc74cac5f5eb81c3dbd228	the impact of multi-channel and multi-product strategies on firms' risk-return performance		Abstract This paper investigates the impact of a firmu0027s multi-channel and multi-product strategies on its risk-return performance. We argue that channel diversity is positively associated with a firmu0027s profitability and negatively associated with its profit volatility, and that channel diversity and product diversity are complementary in driving these profit-enhancing and volatility-suppressing effects. We test our hypotheses in the U.S. credit union industry, in which credit unions offer a variety of loan and deposit products through a variety of online and offline channels, including physical branches, ATMs, telephone banking, online banking, and mobile banking. By analyzing a longitudinal dataset of 7577 credit unions in 2009–2016, the study provides empirical evidence that operating a full spectrum of online and offline channels leads to higher profitability and lower profit volatility for credit unions. The study also reveals differential moderating effects of loan product diversity and deposit product diversity, in that loan product diversity enhances the profit-enhancing effect of channel diversity while deposit product diversity enhances the volatility-suppressing effect of channel diversity. This paper contributes to the studies of channel-based strategic differentiation as a competitive strategy and the studies of firmsu0027 risk-return performance.

The existing frameworks for classifying interorganizational systems (IOS) are either conceptually too complex to be readily applicable to IOS planning or too outdated to explain numerous forms of emerging communication networks. Based upon two dimensions, role linkage and system support level, we propose a new framework that classifies IOS into four basic types: (1) resource pooling; (2) operational cooperation; (3) operational coordination; and (4) complementary cooperation. The framework conceptually draws upon the linkage of roles played by business organizations joining the IOS. We review select cases that fit into each category and consider the characteristics of systems in each category. It is argued that each category of IOS needs to be linked with a specific business strategy, although they employ a common technical infrastructure. # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It employs six index variables as independent variables, and finds main affecting factors by multiple regression analysis. It is concluded that the long-term debt ratio positively correlated with tangibility and growth opportunities, however, the size, profitability and non-debt tax shield have a negative impact on the long-term debt ratio. Overall, most results of this study are consistent with the propositions that based on the research about other countries, which implies that the Chinese listed firms have followed the basic rules of global economy despite the state controlling ownership. Another empirical finding shows that Chinese firms tend to have lower long-term debt compare with other countries.	chinese wall;database;panel data;technical debt	Qian Xu;Chuanguo Li	2014	2014 Tenth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security	10.1109/CIS.2014.102	capital structure;correlation;profitability index	SE	-84.52542730376047	6.788506887608545	154189

We conclude that manufacturing cells go through, somewhat overlapping, evolutionary stages before they begin to perform at the optimal level. It is important to recognize these evolutionary stages because they must be properly managed in order to reap the benefits of cell implementation efforts. In the first stage, both human and technical problems exist; however human problems dominate – requiring conflict management skills to resolve. In the second stage, human problems improve, and technical problems persist, requiring formal problem-solving methods to resolve. Finally, in the third stage, both human and technical problems improve, and cells begin to perform at the optimal level. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	problem solving	Satya S.

The goal of the present paper is to examine explicitly the effects that use of electronic networks for transactions with suppliers have on firms' degree of virtualization. In so doing, we also highlight factors that influence the use of networks for coordination with suppliers, and the impact such use has on coordination success. Contrary to much recent speculation, the use of electronic networks for transactions was not associated with increased outsourcing, but rather greater dependence on internal production. Moreover, the use of interpersonal relationships for coordination, which many think of as an alternative to electronic network use, was positively associated with greater network use. Surprisingly, use of electronic networks was negatively associated with such outcomes as order quality and efficiency, and satisfaction with suppliers, while more reliance on personal linkages was associated with better outcomes and mitigated the negative consequences of using electronic networks.	e-commerce;hardware virtualization;outsourcing;rel;usenet	Robert E.

We consider the main challenges of STBFs’ vertical alliances as opportunistic risk and coordination concern between partners, and derive four types of vertical alliance portfolios with different extents of risk and return based on the relational perspective. We then examine the impact of each portfolio on performance and the moderating effect of STBFs’ age and technological capability. The results show the portfolio focusing on bilateral alliances is not helpful for STBFs, while the others are useful. The portfolio focusing on unilateral alliances promises young firms better performance, while hybrid portfolios of unilateral and bilateral alliances are more helpful for older STBFs.

The average compensation for the top 20 men was more than 10 times larger than for the top 20 women. We would expect, however, that direct compensation from salary and bonuses would be similar for both genders given the public nature of the data. There have been few academic articles on the topic of gender pay differences among top executives. One paper found marginally significant statistical evidence that women CEOs are paid more than their male counterparts. In this paper, we extend the literature by looking at compensation differences of male and female CEOs. Our sample includes over 40 female CEOs for publicly traded companies and matched pairs of comparable male CEOs. In addition, we use data envelopment analysis to derive a gap measure representing the difference between male and female compensation. The results suggest that there is a statistical difference between male and female potential compensation.		Neethu Mohan;J.

27eb13539a464eec776b0147d7440d715d4f65fb	big data analytics capabilities: a systematic literature review and research agenda		With big data growing rapidly in importance over the past few years, academics and practitioners have been considering the means through which they can incorporate the shifts these technologies bring into their competitive strategies. To date, emphasis has been on the technical aspects of big data, with limited attention paid to the organizational changes they entail and how they should be leveraged strategically. As with any novel technology, it is important to understand the mechanisms and processes through which big data can add business value to companies, and to have a clear picture of the different elements and their interdependencies. To this end, the present paper aims to provide a systematic literature review that can help to explain the mechanisms through which big data analytics (BDA) lead to competitive performance gains. The research framework is grounded on past empirical work on IT business value research, and builds on the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities view of the firm. By identifying the main areas of focus for BDA and explaining the mechanisms through which they should be leveraged, this paper attempts to add to literature on how big data should be examined as a source of competitive advantage. To this end, we identify gaps in the extant literature and propose six future research themes.	big data;systematic review	Patrick Mikalef;Ilias O. Pappas;John Krogstie;Michail N. Giannakos	2018	Inf.

In this paper, we investigate techniques that will enable investors in ubiquitous computing infrastructure and services to recoup their investment through charging for service use. In particular, we identify the key requirements for a ubiquitous computing payment system, discuss existing payment systems and present the Payment Session Protocol (PSP) that is designed to support payment-enabled ubiquitous computing environments.	requirement;ubiquitous computing	Prasad Boddupalli;Fahd Albinali;Nigel Davies;Adrian Friday;Oliver Storz;Maomao Wu	2003		10.1109/MCSA.2003.1240772	context-aware pervasive systems;ubiquitous commerce;operating system;business;world wide web;computer security	HCI	-77.76598056229935	15.549119915176382	156203

The recent emergence of the application service provision (ASP) business model has promised firms remote‐access to industry robust business processes and “best of breed” enterprise applications on a rental basis. This paper examines how the ASP business model facilitates business process and information systems improvements in firms through effective process management. This is pursued through a review of relevant literature and empirical evidence gathered from a case study‐based investigation in six firms in the UK. By examining the features of remote application and business process outsourcing in the context of business process management, this paper outlines how firms can improve their business and IT performance. Findings from empirical evidence are used to substantiate the arguments and suggest areas for future research.		Vishanth Weerakkody;Wendy L. Currie;Yamaya Ekanayake	2003	Business Proc. Manag.

The question of whether there is empirical evidence that services, specifically retail banks, display the characteristics of agility like their manufacturing counterparts is open to debate. Conventional wisdom in operations management posits that most successful services trade off one capability for another. Drawing from the resource-based view of the firm, combinative capabilities view, and the cybernetics work of Ashby (1958), theoretical arguments suggest the contrary. The agility paradigm is viable in environments calling for a mix of strategic responses. Applying cluster analytic techniques to a sample of retail banks, using capabilities as taxons, we identify four strategic service groups: agile, traditionalists, niche, and straddlers. Our empirical results provide thematic explanations consistent with theory that account for how the agile strategic group offers a unique configuration of service concept, resource competencies, strategic choices, and business orientation. Profiles of the operations strategies of each strategic service group suggest that each group has found a fit between what certain segments of the market may want and what they have to offer. In particular, we found that the agile group exhibited greater resource competencies than its counterparts, requiring greater investments in infrastructure and technology. Consistent with theory, agile banks performed better over time on an absolute measure of return on assets.	numerical taxonomy	Larry J. Menor;Aleda V. Roth;Charlotte H.

However, rising software costs and recent corporate failures have brought the provision and value of commercial software into question. Recently, open source software, as a relatively new development in the IS field, has risen in popularity as a possible panacea for these ills. If firms value low acquisition cost, ostensibly plentiful support, and source code access, why have not more firms adopted open source software? The lack of published empirical research in the area means this issue has been inadequately addressed. This paper examines why firms do not adopt open source software. This study surveyed 500 of Australia’s top firms to see why managers rejected open source software. The study found that managers rejected open source software because they could not see that it had any relevance to their operations, perceived a lack of reliable ongoing technical support of it and also appeared to see substantial learning costs or had adopted other software that they believed to be incompatible with open source software. # 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, as IT service platforms will become the founding infrastructure of our economies, the analysis and understanding of the value that a service platform can generate is of great importance. IT service platforms provide all involved market participants with different values. For this paper, we consider application service users, service developers and service platform providers as market participants and analyze the interrelationship between the value creations of these market participants. The basis for the description of the values and their interrelationship is the identification of parameters. Based on these parameters, a simulation model has been developed. It helps inferring the relative impact of these parameters on the evolution of the IT service platform stakeholder values. The results imply that there is a two-sided network effect. All stakeholders of a service platform mainly benefit from a growing installed base of application users. The benefit of a large service variety, however, mainly benefits the service platform provider. Therefore, we can state that a large fraction of the value from two-sided network effects goes to the platform provider.

We started by examining published articles related to marketing, Web 2.0, Customer Relationship Management Systems, CRM, and social media in a step to conduct an extensive review of the available literature. Then, we presented critique of the articles we have examined. After that, we’ve been able to develop the model we are proposing in this research. As this paper shows, the proposed model will help in transforming marketing plans and strategies from its traditional approach into, what we would like to call, marketing 2.0 approach smoothly. There are some unavoidable limitations due to the given time and scope constrains. The factors included in the proposed model doesn’t cover every related aspect, however, they cover the most important ones.	customer relationship management;management system;smoothing;social media;web 2.0;world wide web	Abdulrahman Aldhaheri;Christian Bach	2013	CoRR		digital marketing;engineering;marketing research;artificial intelligence;marketing;marketing strategy	DB	-79.4930946254242	11.30400493954978	158945

Technology cycles offer a useful evolutionary perspective on shaping technology trajectories. The evolution of technology is a result of technological, social and political factors. The four stages in the model include technological variation (stage I), era of ferment (stage II), technology selection (stage III), and technology retention (stage TV). Within each of the four stages, issues related to the formation of strategic alliances - motivations, governance modes, and the selection of partners - are explored. The association between the cyclical model of technological change and the formation of alliances is empirically tested in response to the statement that a missing link exists for empirically validating the model of technology cycles. Specific research questions include: How will the context of cyclical stages of technological change affect the formation of strategic alliances? In other words, will different types of resources and capabilities be most valuable at different stages of technological change? How well does Tushman and Anderson's theory of technology cycles explain technology's impact on the formation of strategic alliances? Data were 594 alliances in the semiconductor industry from the Securities Data Corporation. Findings showed that the model of technological change is a useful framework in studying strategic alliances. More specifically, at the technology variation stage, innovation-driven alliances are the most important motives. Firms lack of promising technologies tend to select firms with promising technologies. Firms with promising technologies tend to select firms with complementary capabilities. At the era of ferment, both innovation- and efficiency-driven alliances for old technologies are the most important motives. Dominant industry players in either the semiconductor industry or other industries surprisingly are not the favorable alliance partners. At the stage of technology selection, manufacturing-type of alliances for new technologies are the most important motives. The more frequently adopted alliance modes are the ones with high control mechanisms and with equity involvement. Partners located either upstream or downstream the focal firm are the most favorable choices. At the technology retention stage, market-driven alliances are the most important motives. However, firms in different industries or established firms in targeted markets are not favorable alliance partners. This study contributes to the literature in two ways: First, it empirically tested the cyclical model of technological change by Tushman and Anderson (1986) and linked the effects of technology cycles with studies on strategic alliances. Second, it empirically validates the argument that certain types of resources are most advantageous under particular technological conditions at various stages of technology cycles. The model provides rich settings to study how firms cope with their technical environment.	control system;downstream (software development);focal (programming language);list of code lyoko episodes;noise shaping;problem solving;semiconductor industry	Lydia Y.

With the lowering of entry barriers and blurring product lines of banks and non-banks since the financial sector reforms, banks are functioning increasingly under competitive pressures. Hence, it is imperative that banks maintain a loyal customer base. In order to achieve this and improve their market positions, many retail banks are directing their strategies towards increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty through improved service quality. Moreover, with the advent of international banking and innovations in the marketplace, customers are having greater and greater difficulty in selecting one institution from another.Hence, to gain and sustain competitive advantages in the fast changing retail banking industry in India, it is crucial for banks to understand in-depth what customers perceive to be the key dimensions of service quality and to evaluate banks on these dimensions. This is because if service quality dimensions can be identified, service managers should be able to improve the delivery of customer perceived quality during the service process and have greater control over the overall outcome.The study suggests that customers distinguish four dimensions of service quality in the case of the retail banking industry in India, namely, customer-orientedness, competence, tangibles and convenience. A methodological innovation in this study has been in the use of TOPSIS in the field of customer-perceived service quality. TOPSIS has been used to evaluate and ranking the relative performance of the banks across the service quality dimensions. Identifying the underlying dimensions of the service quality construct and evaluating the performance of the banks across these factors is the first step in the definition and hence provision of quality service in the Indian retail banking industry.

50da7559bca19e748727213be0cacf67f43a0da0	benchmarking based performance management for construction contractors	performance management	In a competitive industry, effective performance management is an essential element of business success. However, despite their importance, performance management systems have not yet been widely implemented in construction companies. That said, many construction companies have become increasingly aware of the need to more systematically identify, implement, and sustain performance improvements in recent years. The objective of this paper is to develop benchmarking based performance management for construction contractors. This paper investigates examples of PMSs in the U.K., U.S., Brazil, and Chile and discusses the lessons learned. Then, to overcome the limitations of existing PMSs, a new performance measurement framework, in the form of a ‘Construction’ BSC, is presented. And a learning process using knowledge push is proposed. Finally, this paper develops a PMS for benchmarking in construction companies and recommends further areas of study for this research topic.

The study discusses how the researched projects were linked with enterprise strategy, how their efficiency was measured and in what extent they defined implementation goals. The investigated projects were divided into groups on the basis of their duration, scope, company size and success level achieved. The results demonstrate the real need for improvement as regards investigated conditions of ERP projects. The practitioners should be more focused on the business benefits during implementation project, elaborate the mechanisms in order to measure the implementation effectiveness and pay more attention to the definition of measurable implementation goals. The research outcome also reveals that practitioners from most complicated projects are most aware of the overwhelming implementation challenge, while, on the other hand, the relatively simpler projects seem to be underestimated.	erp;enterprise resource planning	Piotr Soja	2005			implementation;management science;knowledge management;enterprise planning system;process management;enterprise resource planning;computer science	SE	-78.29274035491264	9.324337400611874	160114
aa0cb3e10bb617920a3c4afbbfecfa3c201c8258	open innovation in the high-tech firms: evidence from the biotechnology industry	open innovation	Open innovation is based on a different knowledge landscape, with a different logic about the sources and uses of ideas. It implies that firms increasingly rely on external sources of innovation by emphasizing these ideas and resources. Recently, really good ideas are coming from outside the organization, especially in the high-tech industry. Using datasets from the UK biotechnology industry, this paper explores a firm’s willingness to participate in open innovation. The results indicate that trust and IT infrastructure lead firms to participate in open innovation, while commitment and switching costs hinder participation. Although the level of knowledge for firms to share increases with the level of trust between the firms, high switching costs protect the knowledge exposure in open innovation. This research broadens the study of open innovation by applying the concept as a medium of knowledge transfer in the biotech industry.	open innovation	Jong-Ho Lee;Dongwon Lee	2007			open innovation;biotechnology;marketing;information technology management;knowledge transfer;computer science;high tech	Web+IR	-82.33878811427897	5.128851277505753	160273

We develop a conceptual model to explicate the significance of IS on several critical operational dimensions drawing examples from the context of the Chinese automotive supply chains.	dependability;information system;responsiveness;system integration	Yi Wu;Margi Levy	2008			systems engineering;operations management;process management;business	ECom	-80.6085545536053	4.341029088922884	160530
d6f6323b6ed91a5bd572ece94974d66f973d50f6	the impact of capabilities on performance	project management;dynamic capabilities	Purpose – The research finds how much the different types of capabilities influence the performance outcome of a company. A special focus is put on companies that use projects in their daily work; project-orientation is an expanding field, but their capabilities and influence on performance are not enough investigated. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Quantitative research setting was applied in EU member country Estonia. Survey was carried out with 189 responses. Findings – Interestingly, project-related capabilities are singly more significant to performance than business capabilities. Capabilities mostly influence financial performance and less project performance (PP). Traditional project time/scope/cost management (iron triangle) and project delivery capabilities significantly influence the variance of outcome indicators. Surprisingly, companies should be careful in aligning projects with strategy and pay great attention to teamwork threats, as these present the most negative influence on the outcome in circumstances where they have been conventional benefit factors. Research limitations/implications – Estonia is a small and innovative country, which makes results generalizable for similar types of countries worldwide and/or neighboring countries with geographical and cultural proximity. Practical implications – Companies behave in isomorphic environments (e.g. high competition, short new product development cycle, full of imitations, standardized business models), and therefore companies look for ways how to differentiate. Usually, findings that describe a 5 percent variance of outcome gain attention, variables used in this research provide much higher variance (48-83 percent). Due to constant environmental changes, companies should put more focus on project-related capabilities due to their high impact on performance. Originality/value – Capabilities are complex and not widely researched empirically from different angles, such as project management. This research takes a comprehensive base by involving a large variety of capabilities, including project-specific capabilities, not only a few common large companies’ specific capabilities. The capabilities impact on PP is not yet investigated, also the influence from project capabilities on performance is not thoroughly researched.	best, worst and average case;entropy maximization;graph isomorphism;logistics;netpbm format;new product development;strategic management	Mait Rungi	2014	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/IMDS-04-2013-0202	economics;engineering;environmental resource management;marketing;operations management;management	DB	-83.27938726989676	5.2286665750125385	160631

The model was tested using partial least squares analysis on a sample of 57 information systems executives from US organisations. Top management support was found to influence SISP success both directly and indirectly through the information systems plan usefulness, but not through the information technology (IT) infrastructure flexibility. The former was found, as predicted, to be a significant mediator of the effects of top management support on SISP success. By contrast, IT infrastructure flexibility was not found to be a significant mediator.	strategic information system	Gerald Elysee	2015	IJBIS	10.1504/IJBIS.2015.066126	structural equation modeling;information and communications technology;strategic planning;economics;computer science;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;database;partial least squares regression;management;scanning electron microscope;law;information technology;contingency;computer security	AI	-80.67714904612416	4.43902970363171	160893

59b1de96137e3bb8ebe1daf25dc3c42d5779c3be	maximizing the collective learning effects in regional economic development		Collective learning in economic development has been revealed by recent empirical studies, however, investigations on how to benefit most from its effects remain still lacking. In this paper, we explore the maximization of the collective learning effects using a simple propagation model to study the diversification of industries on real networks built on Brazilian labor data. For the inter-regional learning, we find an optimal strategy that makes a balance between core and periphery industries in the initial activation, considering the core-periphery structure of the industry space — a network representation of the relatedness between industries. For the inter-regional learning, we find an optimal strategy that makes a balance between nearby and distant regions in establishing new spatial connections, considering the spatial structure of the integrated adjacent network that connects all regions. Our findings suggest that the near to by random strategies are likely to make the best use of the collective learning effects in advancing regional economic development practices.	collective intelligence;core-periphery structure;diversification (finance);expectation–maximization algorithm;software propagation	Jian Gao	2017	2017 14th International Computer Conference on Wavelet Active Media Technology and Information Processing (ICCWAMTIP)		economic growth;empirical research;computer science;data modeling;maximization;collaborative learning;diversification (marketing strategy)	ML	-86.83162240638919	4.7344108952526724	162550

This has been attributed to several factors: the decline of traditional banking activities (deposit taking and lending), poorly performing debts (arising from poor lending decisions) and for domestic banks to factors such as depressed property prices and important local industrial sectors performing badly. However the analyses of bank performance tend to be short-term and narrow in their outlook, and seldom attempt to explain the underlying trends and processes of change. In this paper it is argued that the broad competitive forces of information technology, globalisation and deregulation are de-stabilising the banking industry which leads to irrevocable changes which allow new entrants, disintermediation, innovation and customer changes on a much greater scale than has occurred in the past. These concepts are illustrated using a range of different bank markets as examples. To compete in these new markets different approaches are needed. Possible strategies for addressing new bank markets are outlined with reference to size and type of bank and the long-term outlook for banking is discussed.	disintermediation;filter bank;microsoft outlook for mac	Christopher Patrick Holland;A.

Thus, we challenge two assumptions common in prior research: (1) that significant variance exists at the focal level of analysis, while other levels of analysis are assumed to be homogeneous, and (2) that the focal level of analysis is independent from other levels of analysis. Accordingly, we advance a set of hypotheses to simultaneously assess the direct effects of antecedents at the individual, firm, and network level on innovation output. We then investigate whether a firm’s antecedents to innovation lie across different levels. To accomplish this, we propose two competing interaction hypotheses. We juxtapose the hypothesis that the individual, firm, and networklevel antecedents to innovation are substitutes versus the proposition that these innovation mechanisms are complements. We test our multi-level theoretical model using an unusually comprehensive and detailed panel dataset that documents the innovation attempts of global pharmaceutical companies within biotechnology over a 22-year time period (1980-2001). We find evidence that the antecedents to innovation lie across different levels of analysis and can have compensating or reinforcing effects on firm-level innovative output.	complement (complexity);computer scientist;diplomatic bag;focal (programming language);interaction;multilevel security;path dependence;programming paradigm;theory	Frank T.

It focuses on a model that represents the management’s view of the success of an IT project. This is of particular interest due to demand for developing and examining such a model. To show the effects of the success criteria and their dimensions a survey of 646 participants was conducted. The effects of the criteria and dimensions on IT project success were subsequently studied with structural equation modeling. Because of some inconsistencies within the original model of IT project success a deducted model had to be developed. Some of the success criteria and dimensions had to be rearranged or removed from the original model due to the results of the study. The new model shows that the perception and the results of a project have a significant impact on the success rating of an IT project.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, empirical research on IT productivity generally did not identify significant productivity improvements. More recently, as new data are identified and more sophisticated methodologies are applied, several researchers have found evidence that IT is associated not only with improvement in productivity, but also in intermediate measures, consumer surplus, and economic growth. Nonetheless, new questions emerge as old puzzles fade. This survey reviews the literature, identifies remaining questions, and concludes with recommendations for applications of traditional methodologies to new data sources, as well as alternative, broader metrics of welfare to assess and enhance the benefits of IT .

Little is known about what factors influence the relation between information systems outsourcing and firm value. This study examines the effect of information systems outsourcing announcements on firm value by analyzing whether equity market reactions are associated with the management's strategic intent for outsourcing and firm characteristics of the outsourcing firm. After examining 103 IS outsourcing announcements made during the period from 1996 to 2003, results suggest that value is created for firms outsourcing with short-term operational intent rather than for longer term strategic reasons. In addition, the increase in firm value from an IS outsourcing announcement is positively associated with the firm's operating asset efficiency and the firm being in a service industry.

In this paper, we present a modeling framework that is conducive to constrained variance, by supporting user driven process adaptations. The focus of the paper is on providing a means of utilizing the adaptations effectively for process improvement through effective management of the process variants repository (PVR). In particular, we will provide deliberations towards a facility to provide query functionality for PVR that is specifically targeted for effective search and retrieval of process variants.	best practice;competitive programming;digital video recorder	Ruopeng Lu;Shazia Wasim Sadiq	2006		10.1007/11841760_34	simulation;economics;knowledge management;database;management;computer security;business process modeling	AI	-78.459978874184	11.668479636864475	166399

This study is important to researchers, professionals, and policy makers as it provides empirical evidence from the capital market that outsourcing is considered to be a value‐added business exchange for contract‐granting firms. Research findings indicate positive and significant market value gains for smaller vs. larger firms and service vs. nonservice industry firms. The significant effects observed in this study are explained by the existence of information asymmetry in the capital market for smaller firms and service firms, and by the relatively higher investment made by service firms in information technology.

Leveraging a transaction cost perspective, we investigate how changing environmental conditions (i.e., demand uncertainty and technological uncertainty) and unpredictable partner actions (i.e., behavioral uncertainty) trigger ex post governance adaptations in alliances, and how these adaptations in turn affect alliance performance. Using data collected from 178 partner firms in China, we find that the partner firms will undertake more extensive alliance adaptations as demand uncertainty and behavioral uncertainty increase. However, while the extent of alliance adaptations increases as technological uncertainty increases, there is a threshold level of technological uncertainty beyond which the extent of alliance adaptations decreases. The results also suggest that although alliance adaptations enhance alliance performance, this positive impact may diminish after alliance adaptations reach a certain threshold level. Overall, we contribute to the alliance evolution literature by focusing on why partner firms undertake alliance adaptations and how they benefit from these ex post governance adaptations.

As investment in these systems is steadily increasing in a wide range of industries, it is important to understand the effect they have on companies. We claim that BI systems impact companies in two important ways: 1) they stabilize the decision-making process, and 2) they increase the visibility of company information to stakeholders. With BI decisions become increasingly data based and reports available to stakeholders become more informative. This in turn, can lead to more consistent and predictable company performance. Hence, we hypothesize that BI systems can help to reduce the company’s stock return volatility. To test this hypothesis, we have conducted an empirical analysis on a sample of firms that have deployed a BI system. The results indicate a significant reduction in stock return volatility after BI deployment.	information;software deployment;volatility	Eran Rubin;Amir Rubin	2013	Information & Management	10.1016/j.im.2013.01.002	financial economics;volatility swap;event study;volatility;economics;volatility risk premium;computer science;marketing;business intelligence;management;commerce	AI	-82.68015541870079	7.659918866678607	166920

A distributed database management system (DDBMS) is an example of a technology that may enhance a company’s profitability but is also likely to change the way it does business. Specifically, DDBMS adoption may disturb the locus of power, alter the organizational structure, and change the culture of a company. This exploratory study examines the organizational factors that influence the likelihood of DDBMS adoption. It identifies organizational hurdles to adoption, offers an agenda for research validation, and proposes strategies for overcoming the identified hurdles.	distributed database;locus	Steven R.

8f07d8673cfabcb33772f0ce453e4c07ce5b6b15	organizational boundary spanning and brokering as business innovation - an empirical analysis of a software development company		Boundary-crossing individuals, either called “boundary spanners” or “brokers”, are important for facilitating knowledge sharing between internal organizational units and between companies and their external environment. While previous literature recommends strategizing and institutionalizing the use of such boundary-crossing individuals, it gives no specific recommendations or guidelines for how to do so. In this paper, we present findings from an extensive field study in a medium-sized software development company. We present the example of a dedicated organizational unit as a business innovation whose members act as both internal knowledge brokers between units and as boundary spanners between the dynamic, flexible environment and the non-flexible, more static world of the company. We analyze how and why this team became a success within the company, but we also show the downsides and problems related to this strategy and approach.	field research;file spanning;organizational unit (computing);service innovation;software development	Christoph Rosenkranz;Karlheinz Kautz	2015			organizational unit;boundary spanning;software development;computer science;recommendations or guidelines;knowledge management;knowledge sharing	HCI	-77.63420797030105	4.586676106174513	167668

This entails managing the sharing and transfer of a huge amount of knowledge from one project to another over time, fostering synergy and learning. Many firms are thus investing in new Information and Communication Technology (ICT) applications like three-dimensional Computer Aided Design (3-D CAD), internal and external computer communication networks and Product Data Management (PDM) systems. On the basis of the results of three exploratory case studies and a survey of 79 companies, this paper investigates relations between different approaches to knowledge transfer and patterns of adoption of ICT applications, also exploring effects on firms' innovation capabilities in the long term.

The focus of this paper is the empirical testing of a normative web-based commerce adoption model developed from a review of the extant literature related to electronic marketing, the Internet and the diffusion of new innovations. A preliminary test of the model’s theoretical contentions lent support to its overall focus, but found that the firm’s existing learning capabilities were diminished during the adoption of web-based commerce. Consequently, sub-optimal adoption outcomes were associated with insufficient knowledge development.	imperative programming;internet;requirement;the australian;web application	Colin Jones;Robert Hecker;Peter Holland	2002	Australasian J. of Inf.

But still there is a virulent lack of frameworks to explain the profit impact of IT in general and to guide firms in exploiting the IT resource as a source of competitive advantage. By incorporating findings from the resource based view (RBV) and strategic alignment literature we elaborate key concepts potentially leading to a sustained competitive advantage (SCA). Supported by four case studies from the financial services industry, our findings suggest that the exploitation of SIS for achieving SCA requires IT business alignment based on organizational routines of cross-departmental interaction. These concepts are explicitly modeled and integrated into a formal model using microeconomic theory. Especially interactions between the IT and business domain are found to be a key success driver.	business domain;function representation;interaction;mathematical model;money;strategic information system	Heinz-Theo Wagner;Tim Weitzel	2005			computer science;management science;knowledge management;competitive advantage;resource-based view;profit impact of marketing strategy;business domain;financial services;strategic information system;strategic alignment	AI	-79.65702449849191	4.766580547501311	168371

It has been documented that information found in the Compustat database differs from both the information found in other accounting databases and the information disclosed in corporate financial filings (San Miguel 1977; Rosenberg and Houglet 1974; Yang, Vasarhelyi, and Liu 2003; Tallapally, Luehlfing, and Motha 2011, 2012; Boritz and No 2013). In this study, we conduct the first large-scale comparison of Compustat and 10-K data. Specifically, we compare 30 accounting line items of approximately 5,000 companies for the period from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012. We find that the values reported in Compustat significantly differ from the values reported in 10-K filings. We also find that the amount and magnitude of the original data alterations introduced by Compustat depend on the type of the accounting item and company characteristics, such as industry and size.	computer security	Roman Chychyla;Alexander Kogan	2015	J.

Our typology identifies barriers specific to the valuation process (industry and organizational barriers), and to the conversion process (resource, knowledge and usage barriers). Following the development of our analytical framework from existing economic and organizational theories of IT valuation and technology adoption and diffusion, we analyze a series of case studies of Internetbased travel reservation systems in electronic commerce (EC). These cases provide evidence in support of the usefulness of the framework, and illustrate the extent of the difficulties faced by travel industry firms in making their investments in EC systems pay off.	biological anthropology;e-commerce;value (ethics)	Alina M.

This paper significantly advances prior proposals concerned with the evaluation of IS performance by detailing the development of a reliable, effective and low cost instrument for measuring facets of quality of delivered systems. QUALIT achieves this by considering the viewpoints of a broad cross sectional representation of end-user stakeholders in the performance of their jobs.

This paper examines the analyst's decision regarding allocation of effort to the precision and timeliness of earnings forecasts with financial decision support systems. Once an analyst decides to follow a firm, the analyst must choose the level of effort to devote to generating outputs, such as earnings forecasts. This paper provides insights into this by examining three issues concerning the forecasts of the individual analyst. First, forecast accuracy and frequency are modelled simultaneously. Then, whether these two effort allocation choices are complements or substitutes is tested. Finally, how competition affects these two characteristics is examined. The accuracy and frequency are examined with simultaneous equations. Results from this analysis suggest that analysts allocate effort among these two forecast criteria in a...	enterprise information system	Lihong Liang	2008	Enterprise IS	10.1080/17517570701846539	competition;actuarial science;simultaneous equations;decision support system;financial services;computer science;marketing;finance;management;financial market	OS	-84.81225378132142	7.584115736072247	169320

NIS efficiency rating should be considered as a key element for achieving greater innovation and competitive advantages. This study applies the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach with the traditional DEA models, bilateral models, and critical performance measures, respectively, combing multiple outputs and inputs to measure the magnitude of performance difference between the countries. Empirical results indicate that the overall technical inefficiencies of the NIS activities in these countries are primarily due to the pure technical inefficiencies rather than the scale inefficiencies. Korea and Taiwan perform very well on their NISs and rank numbers 1 and 2 respectively on the Asian list, while Romania ranks number 1 among the European countries. In addition, the Asian countries are generally better performers than the European countries in production activities. Finally, the key input/output influencing the countries' NIS performance have been identified. The innovative features of Korea, Taiwan and Romania are also discussed.

6f6a73a607d80f939d6f4a3246c0e23814eb545c	analyzing resource behavior to aid task assignment in service systems		Service organizations increasingly depend on the operational efficiency of human resources for effective service delivery. Hence, designing work assignment policies that improve efficiency of resources is important. This paper explores the role that data (specifically service execution histories) can play in identifying optimal policies for allocating service tasks to service workers. Using data from the telecommunications domain, we investigate the impact of assigning similar and distinct tasks within the temporal frames of a day, across days and a week. We find that similar work, when done within a day, significantly improves the efficiency of workers. However, workers working on distinct tasks across days also have higher efficiency. We build a simulation model of the service system under study, to gain insights into the dispatch policy considering similarity and variety of tasks assigned. Our work demonstrates use of data to generate critical insights on resource behavior and efficiencies, that can further aid in improving task assignment to resources.		Renuka Sindhgatta;Aditya K.

The projects are evaluated against the lists of project failure factors commonly cited in the literature. The results of the study show that deviation from the initially planned schedule and/or budget does not affect the success perception, providing that the project was properly managed and its business outcome is achieved.	erp;exploratory testing	Przemyslaw Lech	2013	IJITPM	10.4018/jitpm.2013010102	earned value management;systems engineering;operations management;project management triangle;management;schedule;project planning;project portfolio management	HCI	-77.52827429525935	10.169713749075067	170362

Based on data from the period 2002 to 2007 from a sample of 53 insurers, this study found distinct strategic groups operating in this segment. Each of these groups has unique differences in their modes of operation. Accordingly, these groups are classified as Cost Leaders, Mid Tier Players, Geographic Niche Players, High Cost Niche Players, and Diversified Firms. However, despite the differences in strategic posture, these groups had comparable performance, indicating equifinality in operational modes. Study findings offer several insights to firms planning entry or operating in the private passenger segment of the property-casualty insurance industry.	equifinality	B.

The process is complex because it involves many interrelated business decisions, and a wide range of companies at different levels. So far, little is available to assist managers in analysing and monitoring a supply network performance. This paper proposes a tool, supply network analysis process (SNAP), to address this gap. SNAP can be implemented in a three‐stage process. The tool enables managers to explore, connect, and visualise the interaction of network decisions in such a way that it is easy to understand and communicate, that engage more people within an organization, and that unlock the creativity of participants. A case study is used to illustrate the application of the SNAP tool. Finally, the implication of this research to managers and academics is discussed.	social network analysis	Choy Leong Yee;Kim Hua Tan	2004	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635570410530766	supply;supply chain management;strategic planning;economics;network analysis;systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;marketing;operations management;network performance;management	Logic	-77.94852611747552	6.71212299939348	170630

Using a cross-sectional field study of 169 companies, our research found that CIOs with high strategic IT and business-related knowledge enjoyed significantly greater participation in top management teams. Further, CIO’s strategic IT and business knowledge and their participation in top management teams influenced their firms’ extent of IT deployment in business strategies and value-chain activities. The strength of these relationships was most prominent where firms viewed information technology’s role as fundamentally transforming their business processes or industry structure. Further, interestingly, we found no direct impact of the top management team’s IT knowledge or reporting relationship of the CIO with the CEO on the firms’ extent of IT deployment.	business process;chief information officer;cross-sectional data;field research;software deployment	Curtis P.

However, many organizations fail to achieve the objectives. One of the important determinants is the deployment of electronic CRM (eCRM) in organizations. In essence, CRM is complex in comprising product, channel, consumer, delivery, and service aspects. This requires different approaches in eCRM development. Determining user requirement is the most important phase and the key to the final success in system use. This research proposes a strategy-based process for system requirement analysis. Previous research has not discussed the important role of the CRM strategies in building eCRM. Moreover, the implemenation process was only reported partially in literature. Basically, the framework contains three steps: (1) define CRM strategies, (2) identify consumer and marketing characteristics, and (3) determine system requirements. This framework is further examined by empirical data. The results indicate that CRM strategies have positive impact on system requirement analysis while developing eCRM.	customer relationship management;requirement;requirements analysis;software deployment;system requirements;user requirements document	Ing-Long Wu;Ching-Yi Hung	2008			requirements management;computer science;knowledge management;user requirements document;management	HCI	-77.89374801439104	9.372853313405889	172822

Such ‘node collapse’ can radically restructure the network in one transaction, constituting a revolutionary change compared to the incremental effect of tie additions and deletions, which have been the focus of prior research. We explore several properties of node collapses: their efficacy in helping firms achieve superior network positions, the externalities they impose on other network actors, and how they provide exclusive control over both internal and network resources. Using a simulation in which actors compete to acquire one another, we model network dynamics driven by node collapses.

Many companies rely on partnerships with key suppliers to improve operational effectiveness through minimized inventory, information and culture integration to boost their lean/ agile credentials. The Fractal Manufacturing Partnership (FMP) is new manufacturing strategy, whereby OEMs form relationship with key suppliers. The former cede autonomy of non-core activities to tried and tested suppliers, while concentrating on their core competencies. The latter become assemblers of their components with heightened sense of responsibility while co-owning the OEMs' facility. The objective of this relationship is maximization of flexibility ability to respond swiftly and robustly to changes in environment, requiring physical network and more importantly, cultural network linking the people rather than their machines. In this paper, integration of OEM and suppliers is modeled and simulated to highlight critical factors in this partnership and quantifying and harnessing benefits of this new approach.	agile software development;assembly language;credential;entropy maximization;finite model property;fractal;mutual exclusion;simulation;synergy	Sameh M.

Given this motivation, firms are unbundling their value chain processes and exploring new sourcing mechanisms. With the emergence of world-class skills and capabilities in offshore locations, new sourcing mechanisms have become available beyond traditional domestic insourcing and outsourcing. However, there is little systematic research examining how firms choose sourcing mechanisms for their business processes. This study views the digitally enabled extended enterprise as a complex system of business processes and examines how sourcing choices are made in such enterprises. It builds on the modular systems theory to posit that modularization of business processes and their underlying information technology (IT) support infrastructures are associated with the choice of sourcing mechanisms for the processes. The study tests this proposition in a sample of business process sourcing choices made by 93 medium and large U.S. firms. The results show that firms tend to choose domestic outsourcing for processes that are high in modularity and offshore outsourcing for processes that are low in modularity. Further, when processes can be detached from a firm's IT infrastructure, firms tend to use offshore outsourcing. However, when processes are tightly coupled with underlying IT infrastructure, it may be infeasible to detach processes and execute them in remote locations. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.	business process	Hüseyin Tanriverdi;Prabhudev Konana;Ling Ge	2007	Information Systems Research	10.1287/isre.1070.0129	offshoring;transaction cost;economics;insourcing;marketing;operations management;microeconomics;business process;management;commerce;outsourcing	Logic	-77.64055633374777	5.331230387732576	173724

E-business can lead to competitive advantage and at the same time, increase profitability. There are several factors resulting on the success of e-business. One of the most important factors is trust. Acquiring customers’ trust depends on many things that an e-business controls. Some relating factors for gaining customers’ trust are: appeal of the website, product/service offering, branding, quality of service, and trusted seals. Actually, trust can be viewed from many angles such as transaction, information content, product, technology, and institution. There are huge numbers of impact on the way businesses think about designing, developing, and deploying Web-based applications. Web services may be an evolutionary step in designing distributed applications; however, they are not without problems. Therefore, we have to concern on the issue which is relating to the security in web-services of e-business. This paper discusses the issues relating to problems and prospects rose of the trust and security in e-business and also addressed security concerns in web services. It also discusses on the role of trust from the transaction perspective and analyses the things that what business could do in building customer trust.	distributed computing;electronic business;quality of service;self-information;web application;web service;world wide web	Manivannan Senthil Velmurugan	2009	IJEBM		public relations;web of trust;marketing;business;computational trust;commerce	Security	-79.19968002524955	12.935276383607356	174660

However, market entry and communication via the Internet have affected the dynamics and traditional process in B2B commerce. Difficulties resulting from these new trends have been cited in the literature. Research into identifying what are the critical success factors for global market entry is rare. This research presents a comprehensive review in this field. The study identified 21 critical success factors applicable to most of the B2B IIM. These factors were classified into five categories: marketing strategy, Web site, global, internal and external related factors. The significance, importance and implications for each category are discussed and then recommendations are made.	criticality matrix;digital marketing;ecological interface design;internet;internet research;n. ahmed;online advertising;software development	Riyad Eid;Myfanwy Trueman;Abdel Moneim Ahmed	2002	Internet Research	10.1108/10662240210422495	public relations;the internet;strategic planning;marketing;marketing strategy;critical success factor;cooperation;cultural diversity;competitive advantage	HCI	-79.45754951839798	5.97757948194558	175079

Abstract Nowadays game-related statistics in the sports industry are demanded by coaches, players, managers, journalists, supporters, fans, video games developers, betting markets and academics. However, the employment of game-related statistics to analyse performance in football (soccer) has inherent problems given it is a multifaceted and complex phenomenon. This study analyses the importance of a large number of possible determinants of sport performance in the ‘Big Five’ European football leagues during the period 2012/13–2014/15. To this end, Bayesian model averaging techniques and relative importance metrics are employed. The results obtained point to the existence of a set of robust determinants in sport performance. This set of drivers comprises (i) assists, (ii) shots conceded, (iii) saves made by the goalkeeper, (iv) the number of precise passes with respect to the total number of passes, and (v) shots on target. The results of the study support the idea that offensive actions are more relevant than defensive ones. In addition, we find the existence of some performance indicators that have usually been ignored by previous analyses, such as saves made by the goalkeeper and assists. These findings could help the decision-making process of the coaching, scouting and managerial units of football clubs. Finally, the modelling techniques employed in this context can be generalized to gain knowledge in other fields of knowledge to extract factors affecting complex problems from large data sets. This could be particularly interesting when previous research has not yet obtained a well-defined and robust set of factors explaining these complex problems.

While the influence of system factors (e.g., variances in delivery times and amount, queuing strategies) is well understood, the influence of interface and human factors on supply chain performance is currently insuffi‐ ciently explored. In this article, we analyze how performance is determined by the correctness of Decision Support Systems and specifically, how correct and defect systems influence subjective and objective performance, subjective and objective compliance with the system, as well as trust in the system. We present a behavioral study with 50 participants and a business simulation game with a market driven supply chain. Results show that performance (−21%), compliance (−35%), and trust (−25%) is shaped by the correctness of the system. However, this effect is only substantial in later stages of the game and occluded at the beginning. Also, people’s subjective evaluations and the objective measures from the simulation are in congruence. The article concludes with open research ques‐ tions regarding trust and compliance in Decision Support Systems as well as actionable knowledge on how Decision Support Systems can mitigate supply chain disruptions.	correctness (computer science);cyber-physical system;decision support system;defective by design;domain driven data mining;human factors and ergonomics;microsoft outlook for mac;milgram experiment;obedience (human behavior);open research;schmitt trigger;simulation;sociotechnical system;software bug;zeller's congruence	Philipp Brauner;André Calero Valdez;Ralf Philipsen;Martina Ziefle	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58484-3_26	reliability engineering;knowledge management;operations management;business	HCI	-81.07253058071599	13.522030281640609	175701

Significant differences were found across industries—banking, publishing, petroleum, and retailing—in the number of times information technology was mentioned, the types of applications discussed, and the content of the discussion. The results of the industry analysis were in keeping with expectations based on the relative information intensity of the various industries. An analysis of the letters over time suggests that the position of IT in the firm, at least as seen by the CEO, was not much different in 1987 than it had been in 1982, but has expanded considerably from its position in 1972 and 1973. Reassuringly, we also found that the number of IT related phrases in the CEOs' letters to the shareholders was positively correlated with the firm's yearly net profits as a percentage of sales.

However, the effect of such relationships was expected to be contingent upon the amount of time that team members had worked together in the past (i.e., previous working ties). Hypotheses were tested in a field study involving 62 global software development teams distributed across Europe and Central and South America. Teams with high levels of previous working ties developed greater quality software at a faster pace. National diversity had a positive effect on software quality in teams with high levels of previous working ties, but a negative effect in teams with low levels of previous working ties. National diversity also had a negative impact on software development speed, but the effect was less pronounced among teams with high levels of previous working ties than on teams low in previous working ties.

Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the effectiveness and performance of UK banks. Based on their assets, banks are distinguished into small and large ones and a classification of UK banks in a multivariate environment for the period 1998–2002 takes place. The PAIRCLAS multicriteria methodology is employed to investigate the performance of UK small and large banks over multiple criteria, such as asset quality, capital adequacy, liquidity and efficiency/profitability. A comparison with discriminant analysis (DA) and logistic regression (LR) facilitates the investigation of the relative performance of PAIRCLAS against them. The results of the study determine the key factors that specify the classification of a bank as small or large and provide us with the responsible banking decision makers for future readjustments.

A major gap that exists is the absence of empirical studies that addressed business value of green IS (information systems). Thus, drawing on the resource-based view of the firm and IT (information technology) business value literature, this study aims to develop a comprehensive research model of green practice-IS alignment, the key cross-functional coordination of green practices with manufacturing and marketing functions, and firm performance. The study provides a better understanding of the relationship between green practice-manufacturing coordination and green practice-marketing coordination, and how both variables mediated the relationship between green practices-IS alignment and environmental performance. The data used in this study were collected from manufacturing firms. The results show that a firm’s green practices-IS alignment had a positive effect on both green practicesmanufacturing coordination and green practices-marketing coordination. In turn, both green practices-manufacturing coordination and green practices-marketing coordination are the significant predictors of environmental performance. Meanwhile, green practices-IS alignment had an indirect effect on environmental performance via both green practices-manufacturing coordination and green practicesmarketing coordination. Moreover, the findings of this study show that environmental performance is an important predictor of economic performance.	information system;kerrison predictor	Sungyul Ryoo;Chulmo Koo	2013	Information Systems Frontiers	10.1007/s10796-013-9422-0	operations management;management science;management	HCI	-80.89802542972978	4.378948483620038	177109

In this paper, we consider the papers that apply DEA methods specifically to financial services, or which use financial services data to experiment with a newly introduced DEA model. We examine 620 papers published in journals indexed in the Web of Science database, from 1985 to April 2016. We analyse the sample applying citations network analysis. This paper investigates the DEA method and its applications in financial services. We analyse the diffusion of DEA in three sub-samples: (1) banking groups, (2) money market funds, and (3) insurance groups by identifying the main paths, that is, the main flows of the ideas underlying each area of research. This allows us to highlight the main approaches, models and efficiency types used in each research areas. No unique methodological preference emerges within these areas. Innovations in the DEA methodologies (network models, slacks based models, directional distance models and Nash bargaining game) clearly dominate recent research. For each subsample, we describe the geographical distribution of these studies, and provide some basic statistics related to the most active journals and scholars.

However, the concern about confidential knowledge exposure makes most enterprises hesitate to outsource software development to community resources. Unlike the traditional legal protection mechanism that prevents community resources from exposing the already known confidential knowledge, this paper presents a proactive confidential knowledge protection technology, which prevents the community resources from learning the confidential knowledge in software development activities. First, the client is facilitated on identifying confidential knowledge involved in the software development activity. Then, the risky software design elements that might expose confidential knowledge are identified in both qualitative and quantitative way. Based on the identification result, a holistic proactive protection solution is presented by orchestrating task reservation, task pretending and task partition activities. Finally, the processed software development tasks are dispatched to community developers without worrying about the confidential knowledge exposure. The technology has been preliminarily validated in two community-based software development cases.	confidentiality;holism;interrupt;outsourcing;proactive parallel suite;protection mechanism;software design;software development	Xin Zhou;Ying Liu	2010		10.1145/1833310.1833323	community development;economics;engineering;knowledge management;software design;software development;software engineering;data mining;management science;software walkthrough;management;software deployment	SE	-78.56441470708194	14.361943929403573	178616

Using a large and original data set of Catalan firms, the authors have conducted a micro econometric analysis following Henry et al.’s (1999) investment model and von Kalckreuth (2004) methodology empirically contrasting the relationship between firms’ investment spread over time and their financial structure. Results show that it exits a positive and significant relationship between firms’ investment shift and financial structure, emerging financial constraints for more innovative firms. Furthermore, these constraints are higher for micro companies and firms within the knowledge-advanced services’ industry. Finally, the authors find that advanced ICT uses by more innovative firms allow them to reduce constraints of access to sources of finance.	knowledge society	David Castillo-Merino;Dolors Plana-Erta	2010	IJKSR	10.4018/jksr.2010100106	business model;economics;computer science;knowledge management;marketing;management;economic growth;commerce	AI	-82.95604507489334	6.530160322395805	179139

Recently, the establishment of global alliances to leverage core competencies has led organizations to seek new ways of conducting business; these have demanded a rethinking of organizational structures, processes, and culture. One of the fundamental tasks has been the establishment of appropriate information technology (IT) platforms to co-ordinate business processes and provide coalition mechanisms for global business. This paper proposes ®ve important dimensions of transnational strategy: the con®guration of value chain activities, the coordination of such activities, centralization, strategic alliances, and market integration. These dimensions de®ne the manner in which the value-added activities of the ®rm are dispersed and co-ordinated across nations, the hierarchical structures responsible for decision making, the strength of the external alliances of the ®rm and the managerial philosophy of global business conduct. These dimensions can be used to de®ne a taxonomy of transnational strategy. A basic proposition is that a ®rm's transnational strategy will be re ̄ected in the design of its information systems (IS). In order to address this proposition, a two-stage questionnaire study was conducted. Respondents included 150 multinational corporations from 20 countries and 25 industries. The study has implications for practitioners when evaluating existing transnational business strategies and designing effective transnational information systems. It should also help researchers in determining factors that impact on the design of transnational IS. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This has caused a critical dependency on IT that call a specific focus on effective IT governance. Accordingly, the success factors for governance over IT resources must be established and adhered to if an organization has to increase the contribution of IT in achieving its objectives. Several researches have been done on such IT governance effectiveness and necessary success factors but with no focus on such organizations in a developing country like Tanzania (environment). Several frameworks for IT governance exist with various approaches. These include control frameworks such as COBIT, and IT service management such as ITIL. However none of these frameworks has looked at such improvement to effective IT governance from a high level and holistic view to Critical Success Factors (CSFs). Such view to CSFs on what few aspects to concentrate on for effective IT governance is paramount in such an environment, which on the one hand is characterized by higher IT resources, knowledge, and culture constraints and on the other hand by the increase of IT investment and applications. In this paper, based on design science research we have specifically addressed this gap by developing a CSFs framework for implementing effective IT governance in this environment (CEITG framework). It was mainly achieved using the four previous studies in this environment as a basis, opinions of 43 IT/business people from 25 organizations and 6 industry/academic experts and a case study in one of these organizations during its development and evaluation. This led to a high level and holistic view framework with concrete practices for effective IT governance implementation in this environment.	cobit;high-level programming language;holism;itil	Edephonce N.

Organisational policies, standards, and structures are institutionalised as organisations increase their process maturity, leading to higher levels of process capability. This concept has been applied to supply chains by researchers through the development of a supply chain maturity model for enhanced supply chain performance.

In order to suggest a practically relevant future research agenda, first a comprehensive literature review was performed to identify research areas covered in the literature. Then, 15 warehouse managers and senior consultants were interviewed to add empirical input to the development of potential future research areas. The literature review reveals gaps, both methodology- and topic-wise. A considerable methodological imbalance is observed. Some of the highlighted managerial concerns have been investigated in the literature extensively, but the managerial concerns emphasized mostly do not belong to the most researched categories. While most of the practitioners’ concerns relate to supportive aspects of warehousing business, a relatively high number of the reviewed studies highlight operational problems. The suggested future research agenda highlights the importance of supportive aspects of the warehousing business, employment of real data in analysis and empirical research methods. The insights from practitioners stress the expected trends of business environment such as more volatile demand, higher desire for customized services and more expansion of e-commerce.

This would not have been possible through conventional strategies such as trade fairs and road shows. Despite the availability of B2B opportunities, SMEs may not be able to benefit from participation in the B2B marketplace. Prior to making a decision on participation in the B2B marketplace, an SME needs to decide on whether to pay for its presence on the website of a B2B marketplace operator. Building on the real option theory, this study seeks to examine such a decisional situation by proposing and validating a set of factors, which could potentially influence the decision of an SME to continue (Adner and Levinthal) its position in the B2B marketplace. Results from a survey involving 74 SMEs reveal that the perceived flexibility in such investments significantly affects the perceived real option value, which in turn affects the inclination of an SME to continue its presence in the B2B marketplace.	e-commerce;electronic business;service in informatics and analysis	Jinbi Yang;Liqiang Huang;Yani Shi;Nan Wang;Chuan-Hoo Tan;Choon-Ling Sia	2012			public relations;marketing;business;commerce	HCI	-80.78586900828775	6.172246682892121	180626

The current study draws on the concept of fit between environmental factors and organizational factors. We collected survey data from both pure online and click-and-mortar companies and tested the model using 133 firm reports. Cluster analysis was performed to analyze survey data and to find groups of companies that pursue similar strategic positioning. The findings of the current study lend support to the hypothesis of distinctive grouping based on environmental factors and resources. The findings also support the hypothesis that strategic positioning influences firm performance. The major implication of this study is that innovative differentiation strategies together with technological resources strongly affect firm performance in the e-business context, a context where there is considerable turbulence in technological development. r 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We draw from two fields of financing adjacent to equity crowdfunding, venture capital (VC) and angel investing, as well as rewards-based crowdfunding, to develop an understanding of the drivers of investment decisions in equity crowdfunding. Using data from a leading equity crowdfunding platform in Northern Europe, we explore factors that drive the number of investors and amount of funding attracted by equity crowdfunding campaigns. The results suggest that the investment decision criteria traditionally used by VCs or business angels are not of prime importance for success in equity crowdfunding. Instead, success is related to pre-selected crowdfunding campaign characteristics and the utilization of private and public networks. The findings are relevant for the decision making of entrepreneurs and crowdfunding platforms, as both parties benefit from campaign success. Many crowdfunding campaigns tend to remain unsuccessful.We develop an understanding of the success drivers underlying equity crowdfunding campaigns.We find that the criteria used by VCs or business angels are not of prime importance for success in equity crowdfunding.Success is instead related to pre-selected crowdfunding campaign features and the utilization of private and public networks.The findings can support the decision making of entrepreneurs and crowdfunding platforms, as both aim for campaign success.	equity crowdfunding	Anna Lukkarinen;Jeffrey E.

It argues that a focus on comparative economic theories and models can improve our ability to explain outsourcing within the larger context of organizational strategy and environment. Specifically, the research constructs of production cost, transaction cost, and financial slack are examined simultaneously to understand what inf luences the Robert Zrnud was the accepting senior editor for this paper IS Outsourcing in Banks outsourcing decision. To empirically test these relationships, information was gathered from senior IT managers in 243 U.S. banks. Financial indices from the archives of the Federal Reserve Bank were a second important source of data. Results of the study show that IS outsourcing in banks was strongly influenced by production cost advantages of fered by vendors. Transaction costs played a role in the outsourcing decision, but they were much smaller than production costs. Finally, financial slack was not found to be a significant explanator, although firm size was a significant control factor. The paper has important implications for research and practice. For researchers, the findings provide evidence that financial criteria can be key factors in outsourcing decisions and compare the relative effects of production and transaction costs. For practitioners, the findings suggest that managerial sourcing strategies need to weigh both costs when hiring systems integrators.	archive;http 404;outsourcing;slack variable;strategic management;systems integrator;theory	Soon Ang;Detmar W.

This research responds to the need expressed by the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) for understanding these priorities. This study is part of a planning session on future enhancement of its members’ competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach – The survey, developed by Takala, was modified to gather feedback and opinions from top executives of ten service providers. These companies mainly provided technical services to customers. This survey consisted of six criteria or competitive priorities with a total of 31 dimensions. The analysis and computations were on both relative and global weights of the responses, derived from the analytical hierarchy process. Findings – Quality represented the most important competitive priority. Quality was given the highest weight of 36.4 percent, while service provision, customer-focus, and know-how were at 20.4, 12.9 and 12.5 percent, respectively. The remaining weights were 9.8 percent for costs, and 8.0 percent for flexibility. Practical implications – The awareness on competitive priorities was beneficial to the future organizational development of service providers in Thailand. These findings also helped reassure the FTI’s current efforts on promoting quality among its members. Originality/value – The knowledge on competitive priorities potentially helps companies formulate future strategies and action plans. It serves as feedback and a milestone for the FTI’s effectiveness on promoting quality among the members in its service-related clusters.	analytical hierarchy;computation;feedback	Kongkiti Phusavat;Rapee Kanchana	2008	Industrial Management and Data Systems	10.1108/02635570810844052	service provider;analytic hierarchy process;service;economics;design methods;marketing;operations management;service design;management science;management;organization development;competitive advantage	HCI	-81.89587009698637	6.8814537203486585	182223

While the importance of IT coupled with organizational changes for business performance has been widely discussed in the information systems (IS) literature, there has been little empirical research on the issue. Using information week's annual data set of IS budgets and the Compustat database, this research examines empirically the relationship between IT and diversification by employing multiple diversification measures. It also examines empirically the relative impact on performance of IT and diversification. Results show that diversification coupled with increased IT spending improves firm performance when its strategic emphasis is on related diversification. The results also show that firms place strategic focus on related diversification when they increase IT spending, and that they require more IT when their strategic emphasis is tilted toward related diversification. The findings imply that by providing a better means of coordination, IT enables scope economies, efficient utilization of business resources and collaboration across individual business units, eventually leveraging the benefits of diversification	business process;diversification (finance);information system	Namchul Shin	2007	2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07)	10.4018/jec.2009010105	industrial organization;diversification;marketing;management;law;information technology;commerce;collaboration	DB	-82.51466536057488	5.145842561688548	183039
dba2ddacf0e16ff6a73dcbad13ce979147524ef5	the roadmap of trust and trust evaluation in web applications and web services		In the 1980s and 1990s, the issue of trust in many aspects of life has drawn much attention in a significant number of studies in social science. Nowadays, with the development of Web applications, trust evaluation has become a significant and important issue, especially when a client has to select a trustworthy one from a pool of unknown service providers. An effective and efficient trust evaluation system is highly desirable and critical to clients for identifying potential risks, providing objective trust results and preventing huge monetary losses. This research roadmap presents an overview of the general structure of trust, the bases of trust and the concepts of trust in different disciplines. Then the typical trust evaluation methods in each area of Web applications, including e-commerce, P2P networks, multi-agent systems, recommendation systems, social networks and service-oriented computing, are briefly introduced from technology, state of the art and scientific challenges standpoints. This roadmap provides not only the necessary background for on-going research activities and projects, but also the solid foundations for deciding on potential future research on trust evaluation in broader contexts.	e-commerce;multi-agent system;peer-to-peer;recommender system;service-oriented infrastructure;social network;web application;web service	Lei Li;Yan Wang	2014		10.1007/978-1-4614-7535-4_4	web application security;web of trust;web development;web analytics;web accessibility initiative;web standards;ws-policy;web intelligence;web 2.0	Web+IR	-79.22156314276576	13.526578872841172	183101

Therefore, e-business applications were expected to have a high cumulative growth and be widely applied by companies in different sectors of the global economy. This paper outlines the state of e-business on one of the most dynamic sectors in the area of B2B electronic commerce, the electronic consumer goods industry in the highly competitive German market. The intention is to develop a better understanding of the level of information technology application to support business relations as well as the reasons and the course of e-business initiatives in this sector.	business process;e-commerce;electronic business;experience	Eulalio G.

a29dd91b3b156a218f365240c28deee35fb366bd	quality management in service desk - how does service desk managers define and measure quality		Many public and private sector organisations are depending on IT services provided by external service providers. The quality of the service affects the customer satisfaction and consequently the customer behaviour. The concept of quality has many meanings in the literature. In this paper, we study how service desk managers perceive the concept of quality and how to manage it in an organisation which has adopted ITIL. Our findings indicate that the quality is seen only in terms of how the agreed service levels are achieved. This view excludes the quality of the processes used to deliver IT services. Quality measurements are reflecting the perception of the concept of quality.	itil;quality of service;software quality assurance	Maiju Hjelt;Nestori Syynimaa	2018		10.5220/0006779903140319	knowledge management;quality management;computer science;service desk	DB	-77.84581139898799	9.545970746956248	186067

Answers to this question are crucial for small businesses in today’s environment. These businesses face a growing demand for IT usage at the same time that they typically can count only on limited resources. This has become a common situation that is particularly critical for small businesses operating in developing countries with emerging economies. We develop propositions and test them with a dataset of service small businesses in an emerging economy. We find that the use of IT services is positively related to firm productivity and that this relationship is positively moderated by entrepreneurs’ management education. Our findings indicate that firm productivity is associated with a combination of human and technology resources.	complementarity theory	Ana Cristina O. Siqueira;Maria Tereza L. Fleury	2011	Techn.

This article proposes and tests an approach for evaluating the benefit to the organization gained by the use of an individual information systems application. The test group was comprised of a random sample of 310 medium and large sized manufacturing organizations. We found that different organizations gain different benefits by using the same information system applications, and that the benefit an organization gains from using a computerized application increases as a function of the increase of two types of independent variables representing the level of complexity and uncertainty regarding a specific activity (customers, suppliers, etc.r, and the impact of the decision supported by the added information on the organizationrs objectives.	information system	Arik Ragowsky;Niv Ahituv;Seev Neumann	1996	Information & Management	10.1016/S0378-7206(96)01072-5	complexity;profit;uncertainty;analysis of variance;economics;engineering;operations management;management information systems;manufacturing;fabrication;management;operations research;information system;statistics	DB	-83.13384212716103	9.03040451186601	186597

Using a resource-based perspective, portal delivery functionalities, considered as non-physical IT resources, are analysed using the dimensions of portal usefulness, portal interface, and service-oriented portal functions on SMEs users’ perceived outcomes of organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach-Qualitative and quantitative approaches are used to explore the research hypotheses. Data were collected using field interviews and survey from senior executives of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Taiwanese textile industry. FindingsResults indicate that the service-oriented portal function dimension, consisting of portal maintenance service, B2B function, and cloud computing, significantly influences organisational performance. Unexpected findings, such as the negative impact of greater industry benchmark information on perceived SME performance, deserve further investigation. Research implication/ limitationThe study extends the theory and knowledge on the resource-based view and its implications on e-business organisational performance of SMEs. The study also offers findings relevant to the design of portal sites for SME administrators and information service providers. Limitations of the research include a small size and the industry-specific data limiting the generalizability of the findings. Practical implicationsResearch results practically serve as informative indicators for policy makers, information service providers, and SMEs executives to evaluate feasible elements for web portal design in traditional industry. Findings from this study may help portal service providers in designing better web portal functionalities for SMEs.

These forms of integrative information technology are considered key facilitators of supply chain management. The research model embeds these systems within a broader model of facilitators of interfunctional integration. The model is tested by path analysis, using a survey sample of 120 manufacturing facilities located in the United States. The results suggest that integrative information technology has a significant effect on collaboration, and that the level of demand uncertainty moderates the effect on collaboration.

50c047869cd66590b447e11a4d6424ea7a33f7bd	business dashboards- challenges and recommendations		Business Dashboards have become an important Business Intelligence (BI) tool available to managers and executives to monitor various aspects of organizational functioning including continuous performance monitoring. Similar to the dashboard on a car that shows the current status of the trip and monitors vital statistics of the car, business dashboards can offer realtime information about the organization and aid in better managerial decision-making and agility. Business dashboards are a fairly recent phenomenon and, as a result, offer several challenges and opportunities. This research examines characteristics of dashboards as a tool that should have a unique place when compared to other BI tools. It discusses some issues related to dashboards and puts forward some suggestions/recommendations. It uses a post-implementation survey for a dashboard implementation, conducted in a regional North American bank to support the issues and recommendations proposed in this research.

First, this study assesses a number of different indicators of innovation quality in the automobile industry. Second, this study examines the relationship between innovation quality and firm performance. Five indicators are developed (namely, patent count, relative citation ratio, citation-weighted patents, science linkage, scope of innovations) for measuring innovation quality using patent counts and patent citations from the US Patent and Trademark Office database. Time-series cross-section patent data from 17 global automobile firms between 1983 and 2002 were used for random effect model. The empirical results show obvious differences among 17 automobile firms in five indicators of innovation quality, and three indicators measuring firm innovation quality (that is patent count, citation-weighted patents and scope of innovations) positively and significantly affect firm profits.	linkage (software);random effects model	Chun-Yao Tseng;Lei-Yu Wu	2007	IJTM	10.1504/IJTM.2007.011809	performance measurement;marketing;operations management;management	Metrics	-84.84332002310364	7.449580635840521	187682

While many studies have been discussing how firms’ R&D behavior is affected by the internal factors and external factors, little has been done to link it to firms’ founding conditions. Using resourcebased view theory, this study suggests the firms’ R&D activities in their later stages are partly determined by firms’ starting resource bundle. We propose that the financing structure, entrepreneurs’ education background, and intellectual property of the new firms will affect their R&D behavior. The study examines the performance of a random sample of firms established in 2004 using data from the Kauffman Firm Survey. The result shows that the founders’ education and the ownership of intellectual property have a positive and long-lasting impact, while firms’ financial capital matters mostly in the short term. The study also finds subsequent resource development is highly reliant on the initial resource bundle.	java resource bundle	Jue Wang	2014	Techn. Analysis & Strat.

024ed806506ec4b05a9dc1597d9af25cc1a5e2b2	conflict of interest regarding information transparency in a business-to-business electronic market with two-sided competition		As a platform to facilitate information sharing, business-to-business (B2B) electronic markets allow buyers and sellers to conduct transactions in a digital environment with greater information transparency. Vertical information transparency about demand has been shown to be beneficial to supply chain management. Thus, information technology (EDI, B2B e-markets) is believed to offer great benefits. Yet, the literature generally assumes that either the downstream firm (retailer) or upstream firm (manufacturer) is a monopoly. Little is known whether this is still the case if both sides face competition. Built on the existing literature, this paper develops a simple two-level e-market model with upstream and downstream competition to study the effects of information transparency. We find that information transparency enabled by electronic markets can create value for the whole supply chain, yet it affects retailers and manufacturers very differently: one side will be hurt, depending on the competition mode (Cournot or Bertrand) in the downstream industry. Unfortunately, it never unanimously benefits the two sides; conflict of interest persists. Then, the theoretical benefits of information transparency recognized in the literature will not materialize. It illustrates a fundamental challenge with electronic markets and offers a possible explanation to the difficulty faced by many B2B e-markets. To deal with this issue, we propose a discriminatory pricing scheme for the e-market operator to internalize informational benefits among retailers and manufacturers so that the online market mechanism can be sustainable.	bertrand (programming language);digital environment;downstream (software development);electronic data interchange;electronic markets;monopoly;upstream (software development)	Kevin Zhu;Zach Zhizhong Zhou	2007			industrial organization;commerce	AI	-81.04020595424794	6.40117601146808	188134

This study employed a structured content analysis of coding data from multiple sources and collected competitive actions and responses for the period between 1999 and 2011 in the Taiwanese banking industry. The results show that response likelihood, response imitation and response speed are positively associated with firm performance and that environmental dynamism weakens the relationships among firm performance, response likelihood and response speed. Furthermore, the intensity of strategic action strengthens the relationship between response imitation and firm performance. This study first investigates the roles of environmental dynamism and action types on the relationship between competitive response characteristics and firm performance. This study considers not only the impact of individual firms' responses on their performance but also the impact of collective actions taken by other firms, thus providing new insights in competitive dynamics research.

The challenge of implementing, operating and maintaining Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and the outsourcing service offered by ERP vendors have made ERP outsourcing an attractive option for some organizations. However, although information systems outsourcing is now a major industry, the outsourcing of ERP applications is still in its infancy. In this paper we explore ERP outsourcing in terms of the Application Service Provider (ASP) approach where a third party vendor hosts, manages and maintains various data and ERP applications on behalf of different clients. Critical to the management of the ERP outsourcing relationship is the outsourcing contract, which if improperly or incompletely written can have significant negative implications for the outsourcing firm. Contracts that encourage vendor performance and discourage under-performance are therefore clearly of interest to managers. Although many articles have appeared on outsourcing, the issue of incentive contracts for ERP outsourcing has not been adequately addressed by researchers, partly because of the infancy of this area. In this paper, an approach to analyzing incentive schemes and structuring ERP outsourcing contracts for the mutual gain of the parties is presented.	erp;enterprise resource planning;information systems;information processing;information system;outsourcing;partial template specialization	Kweku-Muata Bryson;William E.

The collaborative design and analysis are performed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of over 20 members from both academia and industry. This research is based on experiences of these team members who joined a successful e-SCM project, used as a case study in this research, between the world's largest semiconductor foundry and the world's largest assembly and testing service provider. This study adopts focus group methodology for collaborative design and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) for collaborative analysis. The result of the design is a structured and comprehensive key processes model consisting of four dimensions: strategy and planning, manufacturing, logistics, and risk management (SMLR) with a total of 15 key processes included in these four dimensions. The resulting weightings from FAHP analysis can identify the most critical one dimension and four key processes since they account for approximately half of the overall weighting in their level. The SMLR model provides a structured and comprehensive reference model for future SC network management project executives, ensuring that all key processes are supported to avoid extremely costly failure. The resulting weightings provide these managers with the relative importance of these key processes and can help them make critical decisions in allocating limited resources to support the most critical processes. To confirm the results and further explore the managerial implications, a second session of focus group meeting was conducted and practices of the top three key processes in the semiconductor manufacturing industry were used to illustrate what actions can be performed to improve these processes and hence benefit the entire SC network. The research results can serve as a foundation for related academic researches. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is the largest segment of the United States economy, representing more than 80% of both the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employment. For other industrialized nations, the percentages are somewhat lower, but they are also approaching 80%. Services are also the fast-growing sector. The Goods Sector comprises Manufacturing, Construction, Agriculture and Extraction. Until recently, the Service Sector has also been characterized by low productivity compared to the Goods Sector. Tien and Berg have focused on the growing importance and complexity of services and, in particular, on the systems within which services operate. They have indicated that the availability of information technology aids its growth, access, speed and declining costs, thereby enabling real time decision making through the application of a systems engineering approach. It is only recently that productivity in the Service Sector, which has historically lagged behind that of the Goods Sector, has increased significantly. Economists are still trying to understand what is causing this increase; without doubt, the contributors include low cost information technology and telecommunications technology. These have had tremendous impacts on new services, employment levels and shifts due to outsourcing. The nature of global competition has been redefined.

19e298ad79beaaa08ded1ae148a48757ce05238d	e-logistics comparative positioning model: a multi-national enterprise airline study		By capturing the hidden value in the multi-national enterprise’s (MNE’s) supply-chain in areas such as quality, value and innovation; logistics providers can increase the MNE’s operating efficiency and enhance its capital utilization, within and enhanced competitive advantage framework. Today, many multinational enterprises (MNEs) use the global communication channels of the internet to strategically move their global activities to more competitive positions. The trend has been to outsource more and more of their non-strategic business functions, with their logistics providers acquiring these new sources of business. These logistics providers are classified as 1 to 4 party logistics providers [1]. A 4 party logistics provider (4PL) offers the complete supply side coordination solutions for the MNE, plus a degree of demand side coordination service [2]. At its peak, the MNE-logistics provider model activates the entire service value chain. Here the 5PL delivers a value chain level of both outsourcing and service. The complete integration of the value chain logistics provider with its vast array of ‘added-value skills’ and its block of partnered MNEs, yields a unique, innovative, flexible and highly agile partnership, whereby pathways towards ‘sustainable’ competitive advantage [3] may be developed, and possibly maintained. The MNE, whilst maintaining its final assembly, branding, research, and innovation functions, is increasingly becoming a service orientated, highly ‘front-end’ (or customer focused) operation. This paper develops a technique to ascertain the positioning of MNE and logistics provider(s), and where the logistics provider – MNE integration level may be enhanced.	agile software development;global positioning system;internet;logistics;outsourcing;provider model;while	John Hamilton	2004			operations management;business;commerce	ECom	-82.2856676495707	6.816193516949128	189634

Due to the changing environments of IT organizations themselves, one key to IT success lies in not only the establishment, but also the sustainability of ad-hoc professional IT functions. As IT organizations face many kinds of process standards to implement for various IT functions and although the implementations may be different due to various IT domains, from the management point of view, these implementations may not exist individually. This article attempts to highlight a possibility of an integrated effort to effectively manage the implementations of IT standards in an IT organization. Such a shared management refers to the integrated institutionalization design, which provides a road map for all IT functions to systematically improve and sustain the implementation results. A case example is provided for demonstrating the proposed attempt.	design rationale;hoc (programming language);itil;information needs;relevance	Pei-Chi Chen;Ching-Chin Chern;Chung-Yang Chen	2011			computer science;knowledge management;management science	AI	-77.9663744487285	5.056754436516119	189771

However, without the support of sound management systems, the contribution of technology to productivity is limited. As an empirical verification, four major factors of automation technology are evaluated for fifteen machinery firms in Taiwan to constitute a composite index as an indicator of the achievement of technology. Similarly, eighteen subjects concerning production management are evaluated to result in an index for management. To construct a productivity frontier as a function of the two indices, a total factor productivity is also calculated. The productivity frontier shows the maximal attainable productivity at different levels of technology and management. It is worthwhile to note that, in the sampled firms, management presents a much stronger effect on productivity than technology does.

Although it lacks the necessary characteristics to be regarded as a strategic resource, the internet seems to be a useful tool to provide support for competitive strategies. In this study, we discuss how the internet can be used to support the development of capabilities and redefine firm boundaries. Using a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms, we find positive relationships between the use of the internet and product differentiation based on innovation as well as the introduction of organisational changes. In addition, we present evidence that the internet modifies firm boundaries as a result of the positive relationships found between the use of the internet and the degree of vertical integration, as well as the establishment of technological agreements.	internet;strategic management	Zulima Fernandez;María Jesús Nieto	2006	IJTM	10.1504/IJTM.2006.009234	economics;marketing;operations management;product differentiation;management;competitive advantage;commerce;collaboration	ECom	-79.30748497666052	4.5011720983686105	190404

Past studies on EDI have focused mainly on large firms, as they were the major users at the time. With the advance of technology, however, EDI applications that used to require mainframe computers can be used on PCs at a much lower cost. At a result, small businesses are now able to enjoy the benefits of EDI. Using a technology–organization–environment framework, this study proposes a perception-based small business EDI adoption model that is tested against data collected from 575 small firms in Hong Kong. Six factors are tested using logistic regression and five are found to be significant in distinguishing adopter firms from non-adopter firms. The results suggest the perception-based model using a technology–organization–environment framework is a useful approach for examining factors affecting the adoption decision. For small businesses, while direct benefits are perceived to be higher by adopter firms than by non-adopter firms, indirect benefits are not perceived differently by either adopter firms or non-adopter firms, contrary to the findings in studies on large business. In addition, adopter firms perceive lower financial costs and higher technical competence than non-adopter firms do. Also, adopter firms perceive higher government pressure but lower industry pressure than non-adopter firms do. Implications of the findings and future research areas are discussed.	electronic data interchange;machine perception	Kevin K. Y. Kuan;Patrick Y. K.

aa367b0383126736c561a10cec2f00a774cf18a1	integrating e-government through enterprise application integration		Information Systems (IS) integration is considered to be highly significant in supporting organisations to be competitive and cost effective. This paper examines a potentially important area of information systems integration in the government sector through Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) technology. A review of the literature indicates that EAI has been a focal technology for several organisations in solving their integration problems. However, is relatively novice in the government sector; thus research literature around it is limited. Yet the impact of information systems integration remains under explored, as little research has been conducted to comprehend the governments’ perception of integration that influences their decisions and actions. The author demonstrates that there is a need for an integrated architecture that facilitates reuse of existing applications and flexibly implementing business processes across the government sector. In attempting to explore information systems integration area, this paper focuses on EAI technology and presents factors that influence its adoption in an electronic Government (e-Government) environment. Thus, resulting in the development of a conceptual model that may be used to support decision-making in the government sector.	americas conference on information systems;autonomous robot;business process;centralisation;e-government;enterprise application integration;focal (programming language);information system;scientific literature;system integration	Muhammad Kamal	2004			systems engineering;engineering;knowledge management;management science	AI	-78.29398284982578	4.868362623202774	190663

However, almost all findings on IT productivity have been based on data collected in developed countries, while research on productivity in developing countries has been sparse. We studied the effect of IT investment on firm-level productivity in the Chinese electronics industry using a production function model. We found that the direction and size of the impact of IT investment on productivity in China were generally similar to results of studies for the United States and concluded that Chinese firms should invest more in IT. Finally, contrary to popular belief, labor is still an important factor in the production function of the Chinese electronics industry, despite its status as a high-technology industry.

As companies deploy virtual teams to guarantee a seamless work on different projects, the question arises how the performance of virtual teams should be measured and how the performance should be rewarded. Using a strategic human resource management framework, the paper develops several propositions on the design of appraisal and rewards systems for virtual project management teams. The aim of the analysis is to shed light on the question what challenges arise by measuring the performance of teams, how to possibly resolve them, how to design an adequate rewards system for virtual project management teams and what are the consequences for company performance.	internet;seamless3d;software industry	Lars W.

In both models, market provision of firm-specific training is inefficient. However, the nature of the inefficiency depends on the balance between the two key components of training, namely productivity enhancement and employee evaluation. In the informational model, training results in a proportionate increase in productivity enhancement and employee evaluation, and training is underprovided by the market. In the productivity-enhancement model, training results in an increase in productivity enhancement but no change in employee evaluation, and training is overprovided by the market. In both models, turnover is inefficiently low.		Leonardo Felli;Christopher Harris	2018	J.

The phenomenon of captive buyer and supplier relationships grounded in substantial unilateral monetary and organizational investments in achieving business objectives contrast with strategic partnerships, which emerge through bilateral investments. The current research examines buyer/supplier relationship dyads finding that buyers’ trust has a direct effect on the occurrence of captive buyer relationships; moreover, captive buyer and supplier relationships have a direct effect on each parties’ respective perceived benefits. More importantly, each partners’ trust has a direct effect upon the occurrence of strategic partnerships, which in turn has a direct effect on perceptions of derived benefits for each.	adobe streamline;bilateral filter;business process;captive portal;customer relationship management;strategic computing initiative	Richard Klein	2005			business process;computer science;knowledge management;supplier relationship management;marketing;asset specificity;customer relationship management;phenomenon	HCI	-81.77805609731861	4.769901661745795	192653

The literature review discusses environmental scanning variables and steps in the environmental scanning process. In the empirical survey a questionnaire was e-mailed to the CEOs of 1000 South African enterprises, on 20 March 2015 asking them to return the questionnaire before 30 April and a response rate of 32.5% was achieved. Ninety five per cent of the respondents indicated that they regarded the competitive situation in South Africa as intense or very intense and most respondents were convinced that they coped above average with changes in the business environment. Only 30% of respondents had a separate environmental scanning department and only 27% had a formal environmental scanning system. Annual reports, market research reports, newspapers and trade journals were the most important secondary information sources, while customers, sales staff and suppliers were the most important primary information sources. All entities responding used competitor analysis, industry macro-environmental analysis and SWOT analysis to analyse environmental information. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to test these factors across three developing countries to see if manufacturers treated their local distributors differently in different environments. A comprehensive survey was conducted in three developing countries; South Africa, India, and Pakistan. A total of 116 interviews were carried out with local distributors in these countries to test a conceptual model of the hypothesized relationships between satisfaction, perceived conflict, use of coercion by distributor, use of coercion by manufacturer, role performance, and dependency. This study furthers our understanding of the relations between U.S. manufacturers and their local distributors. Several key findings suggest ways to improve these relationships. From our study it was clear that manufacturers treat their local distributors differently in different settings. We show that the more developed a market was (a buyers market) the better a local distributor was treated and stronger the overall relationship. The local distributors in less developed markets were found to be treated worse and there was more antagonism in the relationship. Our sample was limited to 116 interviews with higher level managers who generally spoke English. We also limited our research to a very specific industry. Care should be given in extrapolating these results to other industries.#R##N##R##N#The paper elucidates the notion that U.S. companies do not always have the best relationship with their local distributors. If they wish to develop these markets more care should be given in developing long-term relationships built on trust.

This paper presents an empirical research aiming to measure how business efficiencies in terms of scale efficiency and technical efficiency are influenced by the implementation of the ERP system. Six cases of large-scale companies in Taiwan are investigated. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) are the two main analytic methods used in this measurement. The key decision variables with their weights, which may significantly impact on business efficiencies, are firstly identified by employing AHP and then used by the DEA model to measure business relative efficiencies resulting from ERP implementation. Through this hybrid approach of objectively quantified analysis, we attempt to obtain more reliable business efficiency, which is truly affected by the implementation of ERP system.	enterprise information system	Ruey Kei Chiu;S.

We use Data Envelopment Analysis /Malmquist index to analyse 49 such companies. The change in R&D efficiency is analysed by decomposing the Malmquist index into ‘catch-up’ and ‘frontier shift’ indices, and by comparing cumulative indices to those at the starting period. Those cumulative indices are obtained at both a firm and an industry level. Results indicate that the overall R&D efficiency of these globally leading R&D companies declined slightly during the period 2007–2013. At a firm level, this study determines in detail how the trend of each firm in R&D activities differs from other companies.	qualitative comparative analysis	Hongseok Jang;Suchul Lee;Euiho Suh	2016	Techn.

In terms of study design, an extensive literature review was first performed in order to elaborate a comprehensive model of project risk factors. To test the applicability of the model, we next conducted a longitudinal multiple-case study of two large-scale ICIS demonstration projects carried out in Quebec, Canada. Variations in the levels of several risk dimensions measured throughout the duration of the projects were analyzed to determine their impact on successful implementation. The analysis shows that the proposed framework, composed of five risk dimensions, was very robust, and suitable for conducting a thorough risk analysis. The results also show that there are links between the quality of the risk management and the level of project outcomes. To be successful, it is important that the implementation efforts be distributed proportionally according to the importance of each of the risk factors. Furthermore, because the risks evolve dynamically, there is a need for high responsiveness to emerging implementation problems. Thus, implementation success lies in the ability of the project management team to be aware of and to manage several risk threats simultaneously and coherently since they evolve dynamically through time and interact with one another.	information systems;risk assessment	Claude Sicotte;Guy Paré;Marie-Pierre Moreault;André Paccioni	2006	JAMIA	10.1197/jamia.M2012	risk assessment;risk management tools;risk analysis;it risk management;risk management;data mining;project risk management;management science;risk management information systems;management;clinical study design;risk factor;risk management plan;factor analysis of information risk	NLP	-78.11512024092896	9.318508009859737	194364

Using relational model bases for real-time, operational decision making in organizations facilitates a transition to dynamic (vs. forecast-driven) resource allocation decisions. These and related systems offer development of a new generation of DSS applications which can be applied to extend preemptive decision making across many industries. This approach is illustrated through a description of a detailed conceptual case (scenario) pertaining to its application in agribusiness. This approach to decision making can be viewed as an extension of well-known techniques pertaining to DSS but also represents the opportunity to address problems not amenable to traditional post hoc analysis. Researchers can learn from the accumulated knowledge pertaining to DSS but can also examine innovations that push forward into new territories. The article presents and discusses a variety of emergent research questions prompted by the application of these technologies in the business environment.	real-time business intelligence;relational model	Elizabeth White Baker	2013	CAIS		decision engineering;computer science;organization;engineering;knowledge management;marketing;data mining;management science;business intelligence;management;computer security;business decision mapping	AI	-77.68142023083941	8.119223854909869	194464

We employ standard variables for measuring firm productivity and performance, including labour productivity, return on assets, return on equity, inventory turnover, profit margin, asset utilization, and Tobin’s q. Our regression estimations show that (i) firms’ performances remain unaffected during the implementation period of the reengineering projects, and (ii) on average, returns to reengineering seem to accrue two to three years after the end of implementation period.	business process;code refactoring;data model;panel data;performance;technical standard	Kemal Altinkemer;Yasin Ozcelik;Zafer D.

On a unit level, commanders often face this challenge within the constraints of limited resources --- people, time and funding. As a result, many are turning to training alternatives to help them meet their readiness goals better, smarter, faster and cheaper. The use of military simulations provides a viable solution, but often, the use of these tools are not cost effective. Because of this, military leaders are turning to the commercial gaming market for potential solutions to bridge cost and training requirements. Games, both commercial and government off the shelf, are not a panacea for training resource shortfalls, but they can be used in conjunction traditional training tools to meet readiness requirements within a resource constrained environment. The challenge now is to define how to map military tasks to a game, how to select a game that meets the training need and how to conduct an event on the unit level using games. These hurdles can be easily overcome, but a deliberate methodology must be used in order to ensure success.	full scale;requirement;simulation	Joseph M.

Is it to protect the growth of advanced manufacturing SMEs, or to inhibit the growth of SMEs in advanced manufacturing? the paper brings the medium variable – technological innovation to explore acting paths of intellectual property protection in enterprises’ value improvement. Through analysis of panel data of 80 SMEs of advanced manufacture collected during the period from 2013 to 2015, Research results show that as for SMEs of advanced manufacture, the inverted-U relationship still exists in the influences brought by intellectual property protection to enterprise values. Meanwhile, U-shaped relations exist between intellectual property protection and technological innovation. Increase of technological innovation investment can promote increase of enterprise values.	panel data	Zhenyuan Liu;Renyan Mu;Shuhua Hu;Li Wang;Song Wang	2018	Cognitive Systems Research	10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.08.012	empirical research;machine learning;enterprise value;knowledge management;advanced manufacturing;psychology;intellectual property;artificial intelligence;panel data	SE	-80.73864637593422	5.090429330285378	195264

In China, the bank loan is the only financing channel, which endangers the national economy. The paper introduced trust loan as a new financing channel to the industry. The paper studied the financing of the Ploy International Plaza project to illustrate how trust loan can be an effective way to finance real estate project. It can be concluded that trust loan is not only an innovation of project financing for real estate industry in China, but also simplifying the process of financing and better combining the interest of the parties involved in real estate industry.	channel (communications);funding	Xu Feng;Xie Dan	2010	2010 International Conference on E-Business and E-Government	10.1109/ICEE.2010.685	real estate development;financial management;internal financing;economics;bridge loan;capitalization rate;finance;financial system;china;real estate investment trust;real estate	Robotics	-84.67125451108204	6.405321910970265	195311

We examine publicly listed family firms in Taiwan to shed light on a key debate: is family control beneficial because it fills the institutional void or is it harmful because it abuses it. One side of the debate holds that informal family norms, such as trust and obligation, substitute for weak formal institutions and hence reduce costs that stem from owner-management conflicts (i.e.PA agency cost). The other side of the debate argues that the lack of legal protection for minority shareholders gives the family more incentive and leverage to exploit minority shareholder wealth, which can lead to costs from conflicts between family owners and minority owners (i.e. PP agency cost). International organisations, like the IMF and World Bank, and emerging market governments tend to favour the latter view and have advocated or mandated the appointment of independent directors in order to provide checks and balances between family and minority shareholders. Many of the institutional voids in emerging markets such as absence of laws protecting shareholders or difficulty in enforcing contracts, resulting in more opportunities to abuse shareholders, have corporate governance implications. Furthermore, the lack of trust between owners and professional managers is another serious governance issue with the latter not always working in the best interest of the former. Due to weaker market institutions, i.e. lack of sophisticated firms that help connect buyers and sellers, such as stock analysts, head hunters, market research firms, lack of monitoring and sophisticated information gathering, etc. there is a higher chance for professional managers to deceive owners or for family insiders to deceive external shareholders. Under this setting, whether family governance fills or abuses the institutional void depends on the particular firm's pattern of family control. Our approach underscores the importance of unpacking the heterogeneity within family firms, and of examining the performance implications. We look at the different types of family firms and analyse which one is the best configuration for the company: 1) family ownership control alone; 2) family ownership control plus control over strategy but not operation; 3) family control in ownership, strategy and operation. Our finding is that there is an optimal pattern of family ownership and control that fills the institutional void and contributes to better …	computer;corporate governance;diversification (finance);nsa product types	Xiaowei Rose Luo;Chi-Nien Chung	2013	Organization Science	10.1287/orsc.1120.0751	corporate governance;principal–agent problem;actuarial science;economics;management;emerging markets	Arch	-85.04247314534834	5.604293412067554	196244

In the current competitive and rapidly expanding market environment, shopping website providers must establish effective methods for measuring and improving service quality to increase customer satisfaction levels. In this study, four service quality dimensions of the e-core service quality scale (E-S-QUAL; efficiency, system availability, fulfillment, and privacy) were used to measure the service quality of shopping websites. Subsequently, the simultaneous importance-performance analysis (SIPA) method and analytical Kano model were integrated to analyze the market competition strategies adopted among members of the shopping website industry. Finally, suggestions are provided regarding potential management methods for the case companies.

The ERP hype has already reached SMEs, so the authors have examined the strategies, methods and critical success factors from SMEs point of view. The results of our survey in SMEs in Slovenia have shown that SMEs have to pay attention to different critical success factors in different phases of the implementation process. Moreover, there are differences in implementation process as opposed to large companies. Case studies of two SMEs have shown similar results. Recommendations for future SME implementations and comments of our findings can be found in conclusion.

VCs foster trust among their members and allow them to interact, exchange ideas and experiences, regardless of their geographical or ethnic origin. Organisations should consider VCs as a new market place since their members are current or future customers. Through the interaction with the members of a VC, companies will eventually learn more about the needs of their customers, they will strengthen their relationships and they will be able to customise their services. This exploratory study reports on a survey of 43 information systems and marketing managers of insurance companies in the UK and Greece. It investigates the potential of VCs in the services sector with respect to their contribution to consumers' loyalty and discusses the requirements for the functionality of a VC. The results of this study are useful both for the design of VCs and the evaluation of their business value.	virtual community	Dimitris Kardaras;Bill Karakostas;Eleutherios Papathanassiou	2003	Int J.

In the complex system described by the football transfer market can we identify the strategies pursued by successful teams? Where do they search for new talents? Does it pay to constantly change the club roster? In this work we identify archetypal market strategies over 25 years of transfer market as depicted by UEFA professional clubs and study their impact on sportive success. Our analysis underline how, regardless from clubs' available budgets, transfer market strategies deeply impact – on the long run – football sportive performances.	categorization;complex system;darknet market;high- and low-level;performance	Giulio Rossetti;Vincenzo Caproni	2016	2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)	10.1109/ICDMW.2016.0029	simulation;computer science;mathematics;correlation;read-only memory	Robotics	-86.76610122440617	6.208312434201406	199906
