b3db24c6be379cd0ded3a7fdc6871f1a70a8f186	design and implementation of an e-learning model by considering learner's personality and emotions	learning model;virtual learning;teaching and learning;design and implementation;individual difference;knowledge base	Emotion, personality and individual differences are those effective parameters on human’s activities such as learning. People with different personalities show different emotions in facing an event. In the case of teaching and learning, personality difference between learners plays an important role. In virtual learning projects this point should consider that the learners’ personalities are various and the teaching method used for each learner should be different from the other learners. In this chapter, a new model presented according to the learning model based on emotion and personality and the model of virtual classmate. Based on their knowledge base, the virtual teacher and classmate express suitable behaviors to improve the process of learning according to the learner’s emotional status.

Increasingly, the video-recorded lectures in e-learning systems are becoming more important to learners. In most cases, a single video-recorded lecture contains more than one topic or sub-topic. Therefore, to enable learners to find the desired topic and reduce learning time, e-learning systems need to provide a search capability for searching within the video content. This can be accomplished by enabling learners to identify the video or portion that contains a keyword they are looking for. rnThis research aims to develop Video Content Search system to facilitate searching in educational videos and its contents. Preliminary results of an experimentation were conducted on a selected university course. All students needed a system to avoid time-wasting problem of watching long videos with no significant benefit. The statistics showed that the number of learners increased during the experiment. Future work will include studying impact of VCS system on students’ performance and satisfaction.

However, facing the enormous amount of learning resources, guidance on E-Learning platform for meeting the educational objectives is still a neglected issue. The learning experiences cannot be optimized and personalized. In this study, a semantic and systematic mechanism is proposed to discover the educational objectives of learning resources with competency information on E-Learning platform. To verify the feasibility of mechanism proposed in this study, the design and implementation of prototype system for the assessment of E-Learning effectiveness using the proposed mechanism are also discussed and demonstrated. By feasibility verification with system implementation for practical requirement, the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism can be basically certified.

The well known theory of user modeling is used to collect user characteristics and as second step a classical machine learning approach is incorporated in order to intelligently use these characteristics to create student groups. The resulting student groups promote win-win collaboration, thus support the learning process and provide additional educational benefits for the learners.	machine learning;user modeling;whole earth 'lectronic link	Maria Virvou;Efthymios Alepis;Christos Troussas	2012	2012 IEEE 24th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence	10.1109/ICTAI.2012.154	robot learning;instance-based learning;collaborative learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;user modeling;computer science;knowledge management;machine learning;multimedia;adaptive learning;active learning;hyper-heuristic;synchronous learning;k-means clustering	Robotics	-80.45822526157751	-47.766623051830635	59995

Situated learning and Authentic Learning). Tutor Bot knowledge base, structured in AIML (Artificial Intelligent Markup Language), is questioned in natural language using a mobile device (smart-phones, tablet, etc...) that, with a specific software decodes the instructions contained in a QR label placed on the real object observed by the learner. Through the information contained in the QR-Code Tutor Bot provides, in natural language, labeled object description and refers to further investigations: for example referring to multimedia resources related to the observed object. With the help of these tools, learners can expand their learning experience by interacting directly with a virtual tutor and real with the virtual world. With this technique, the activity of learning by doing, Situated Learning, Authentic Learning and Collaborative Learning, can be enhanced and virtualized by increasing the educational efficiency.	aiml;interaction;knowledge base;markup language;mobile device;natural language;qr code;situated;smartphone;tablet computer;virtual reality;virtual world	Orlando De Pietro;Giovanni Frontera	2012	2012 Sixth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2012.154	natural language processing;robot learning;collaborative learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia	Robotics	-80.9382230488535	-46.5981121645937	60509

Tracing can also help programmers build a model or representation of how a programming language responds to code. This article describes the LISP Evaluation Modeler (LEM), an on‐line tracing tool designed to (a) help novices form an understanding of and facility with the LISP evaluation process, and (b) assist all programmers in designing and debugging programs. An empirical study of LEM demonstrates its advantages for design, comprehension, and debugging and suggests ways in which LEM can help novices learning LISP.		Lydia M. Mann;Marcia C. Linn;Michael J.

One of the learning objectives of the course is network programming and routing. Our philosophy of teaching is """"learning by doing"""", which means in practice that one of the requirements for passing the course is a programming assignment. The programming assignment introduces the student to socket programming and gives the student the possibility to practice implementing simplified routing protocols.The solutions to the programming assignments have previously been demonstrated to assistants and the reports were submitted as paper printouts and all students have done the same assignment. The students have complained that the submission method is out-of-date and inappropriate for a course about computer networks since the course curriculum includes many examples of applications that could be used to submit the assignments over the Internet.To answer the above requirements and to reduce the work load of the course personnel without hindering the students learning process, we are implementing an online learning environment for the Computer Networks course. This system creates and sends individual assignments for students, accepts solution submissions via the Internet, and, finally, checks them automatically. The system also notifies the students of possible mistakes in their solutions. This way, the students can learn from their mistakes and fix them and resubmit the corrected solutions. The goal of the implementation is that the teacher only needs to start the system when the course begins and verify the assignment results when students have finished their work.We can achieve multiple learning objectives simultaneously with this online learning system. The students learn how to implement simple user authentication, how to implement real working network programs for the Internet with different application programming interfaces (APIs), and learn how to apply the routing theory into practice. The submission using the Internet frees students from the boundaries of time and place since course assignments can be solved when and where students want to do them. Automatic correction gives fast feedback and allows students to learn from their own mistakes because they can still remember what they have done.The course provides a server and students implement corresponding client software to contact the server. In this phase of the assignment, students rehearse their knowledge of concurrent network programming. The server emulates a network that has several routers. A student's client represents one router whose routing table is calculated on the basis of the information sent by the server. The server can send routing data that is based on simplified versions of routing protocols such as distance vector or link state protocols. In other words, the second phase of the assignment is for learning routing in an internetwork.We believe that our system will have strong positive impact on learning results. Routing is one of the most difficult concepts related to computer networks. Theoretical studying alone does not help to understand the real practical problems. In addition, our system allows combining theory and practicalities since theory presented in the course lectures can be immediately applied in students' own work in a very concrete way."""	application programming interface;assignment (computer science);authentication;client (computing);computer network programming;distance-vector routing protocol;emulator;feedback;internet;internetworking;link-state routing protocol;online machine learning;requirement;router (computing);routing table;server (computing)	Janne Lindqvist;Sanna Liimatainen	2006		10.1145/1140124.1140225	simulation;ambient intelligence;application programming interface;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;software engineering;distributed computing;routing protocol;programming language;computer network programming;information technology;systems thinking	Networks	-85.07198989915909	-40.42504190133714	60577

Nevertheless, it is still difficult for users to find appropriate resources for specific learning scenarios among the vast amount offered on the Web. Our goal is to give users the opportunity to search for authentic resources from the Web and reuse them in a learning context. The LearnWeb-OER platform enhances collaborative searching and sharing of educational resources providing specific means and facilities for education. In the following, we provide a description of the functionalities that support users in collaboratively collecting, selecting, annotating and discussing search results and learning resources.	accessibility;user-generated content;world wide web	Jaspreet Singh;Zeon Trevor Fernando;Saniya Chawla	2014	CoRR		knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-80.15741050361306	-43.76660705194413	60924

The experiment tested whether the program comprehension of a set of Fortran 77 programs can be predicted by the Oviedo/Van Verth model of program complexity. In the study, student programmers were asked to demonstrate their ability to understand programs through use of the cloze procedure. Three different kinds of Fortran 77 programs were used at three different levels of complexity determined by the model. It was hypothesized that program comprehension would decrease, i.e. the number of incorrect answers would increase, as the complexity of the programs increased. Due to a variety of reasons, the results were inconclusive. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the experiment, the method selected, and implications for future experiments.	computer science;experiment;fortran;list comprehension;program comprehension;programmer	Patricia B. van Verth;Lynne Bakalik;Margaret Kilcoyne	1989		10.1145/65293.71206	computational science;experience design;computer science;software engineering	SE	-81.83667938046354	-38.321107961163655	61075

We have built a MOOC for teaching CS1 with the intent of offering it for degree credit. To test its eligibility for credit, we delivered it as an online for-credit course for two semesters to 197 on-campus students who selected the online version rather than a traditional version. We compared the demographics, outcomes, and experiences of these students to the 715 students in the traditional version. We found the online students more likely to be older; to be underrepresented minorities; and to have previously failed a CS class. We then found that our online students attained comparable learning outcomes to students in the traditional section. Finally, we found that our online students perceived the online course quality more positively and required less time to achieve those comparable learning outcomes.	experience;massive open online course	David Joyner	2018		10.1145/3231644.3231665	knowledge management;underrepresented minority;sociology;medical education;demographics	HCI	-77.72268318178496	-40.08618943285907	61458

326a810ded1901bbbb926b649b9cba4341e0d582	supporting active wiki-based collaboration		Prior research has established that active participation and collaboration by students results in multiple benefits during wiki-based CSCL activities. However, achieving such behavior can be a challenge without external motivation. To increase active participation and collaboration by users, we developed an enhanced wiki called the Written Agora. Using popular Web 2.0 features, our wiki provides additional means of participation and aims to encourage direct communication and collaboration between users. Additionally, using intelligent features, we enable the wiki system itself to also participate during collaboration. In this paper, we analyze the results of a study using the Written Agora in a classroom for two semesters. We discover that simply including such features is not necessarily enough to cause their use or improve collaboration. However, encouraging the use of these features resulted in not only greater than expected use, but more diverse and higher quality collaboration by users.	agora;web 2.0;wiki	Adam Eck;Leen-Kiat Soh;Chad E.

There are several approaches that aim at personalizing e-learning environments. However, they focus mainly on technological and/or networking aspects without caring of contextual aspects. They consider only a limited version of context while providing personalization. In our work, the objective is to improve e-learning environment personalization making use of a better understanding and modeling of the user’s educational and technological context using ontologies.

However, an important problem of serious games is the difficulty for instructors to adapt the storyboard, the scripts and the game levels of the videogame to new pedagogical objectives once the game development is achieved. This paper presents SeGAE, an author-friendly environment that offers to instructors a set of editors in order to modify the game design by defining new characters, objectives, victory conditions, authorised actions among other objects in the serious games even after the development stage. Particularly, we apply our authoring approach on Blossom Flowers, a serious game developed by Ktm Advance.	authorization;cognitive science;data model;dropout (neural networks);graphical user interface;interoperability;software release life cycle;storyboard;video game development;xml	Amel Yessad;Jean-Marc Labat;François Kermorvant	2010	2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2010.153	game design;games;data modeling;xml;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;game mechanics;game art design;graphical user interface;database;game developer;multimedia;screening game;game design document;video game development;game testing;adaptation	Robotics	-82.14187514857544	-43.0645737342722	62991

267f9fc8aaa8ae62b87d7fa81b13b98e72dbb23e	learning path generation method based on migration between concepts		The learning strategies often have a direct impact on learning effects. Often, the learning guidance is provided by teachers or experts. With the speed of knowledge renewal going faster and faster, it has been completely unable to meet the needs of the learner due to the limitation of individual time and energy. In order to solve this problem, we propose a learning strategy generation method based on migration between concepts, in which the semantic similarity is creatively applied to measure the relevance of concepts. Moreover, the concept of jump steps is introduced in Wikipedia to measure the difficulty of different learning orders. Based on the hyperlinks in Wikipedia, we build a graph model for the target concepts, and achieve multi-target learning path generation based on the minimum spanning tree algorithm. The test datasets include the books about Computer Science in Wiley database and test sets provided by volunteers. Evaluated by expert scoring and path matching, experimental results show that more than 59% of the 860 single-target learning paths generated by our algorithm are highly recognized by teachers and students. More than 60% of the 500 multi-targets learning paths can match the standard path with 0.7 and above.

These days, collaboratively learning from and with others on the Web is taking on a very prominent position in this learning process. CROKODIL aims to provide support for collaborative learning based on web resources. In this paper, we introduce our learning scenario and an evaluation of our target group. We describe our pedagogical concepts, and present the results of an evaluation of these concepts. CROKODIL supports the semantic tagging of resources as well as the collaborative use of these resources and their information. Social networking functionalities are integrated in the platform to encourage and support collaborative learning. We also present some extensions to the base functionality of the platform, such as resource recommendations and interfaces for the integration in existing learning management systems.

Learning analytics measures the effectiveness and efficiency of learning environments, in order to understand the needs of learners and to improve the teaching process. The research presented in this paper uses Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) mechanism to analyze and predict a dynamic learning path for learners based on competence and meta-competence values observed in a learning environment. The proposed system is able to auto-configure and auto-customize itself to offer personalized and individualized instruction, and calculate an optimal learning pathway for learners. Furthermore, it provides on-demand and adaptive support for learners based on their needs.

In the UK it will be mandatory that all local planning authorities make much of their data available on-line within the next two or three years. A broader 'VR across the Web' based involvement in this activity has been advocated. Recent exploration of a web based application for collaborative work has enabled analysis of some of the necessary functions of a collaborative on-line repository for managing and maintaining large area urban modelling. Using this as a basis a prototype repository for such urban modelling tasks has been tested with on-line remote access. Interestingly the same web application framework is also proving effective in a broad range of web based collaborative activities from education and learning through to distributed research projects.

But a wider set of scenarios appear when generic services are considered. Integrating such services in a Unit of Learning is difficult due to the lack of a defined bi-directional protocol for information exchange. In this paper the Generic Service Integration paradigm is presented. It extends the Learning Design specification to use generic services, first at the design stage of a Unit of Learning, and then at the deployment and run times. The framework allows for bi-directional exchange of information between a Unit of Learning and a service. The consequences of the approach are that services can be configured to suit the needs of activities in a learning environment, and a Unit of Learning may adapt its behavior based on the events that took place in any of the used services.	information exchange;programming paradigm;software deployment	Luis de la Fuente Valentín;Yongwu Miao;Abelardo Pardo;Carlos Delgado Kloos	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87605-2_52	proactive learning;simulation;service;information exchange;blended learning;computer science;knowledge management;active learning;synchronous learning	AI	-80.47115224360313	-45.03678439142951	64444

Some extensions, refinements and adaptations necessary in order to be able to use the architecture to develop a system to teach legal reasoning to law students are described. The focus of the research on legal problem solving is on formulating hypotheses about modelling legal problem solving for educational purposes and testing these hypotheses in an experiment. The experiment is the development of an intelligent tutoring system to train law students to solve problems in administrative procedural law. 1. Motivation of the research The motivation for this research is twofold. The first motivation is to provide law students with an opportunity to learn how to solve legal problems, as well as to train their legal problem solving skills. The way in which legal problem solving is receiving attention at this moment in Dutch legal education is too restricted (Muntjewefff, 1994). Furthermore there is hardly time left in the official curriculum to spend on training. The training system under construction, ROSA, offers law students the opportunity to apply their support knowledge, provided by the teachers and acquired through studying texts, in solving 'real' legal problems. The second motivation for this research is to study artificial legal problem solving. To be able to construct artificial legal problem solvers, legal problem solving has to be studied and theories on artificial legal problem solving have to be constructed and tested. The research undertaken will be described in the next two paragraphs. The application under construction serves two purposes. One is to have an application with which law students can practice legal problem solving in administrative procedural law. The second is to develop an application as an experiment for testing the proposed theory on artificial legal reasoning. 2. An application for training legal problem solving The ROSA system is an application for training law students legal problem solving in the domain of administrative procedural law. The ROSA system is able to provide law students with a tool and environment with which they can solve 'real life' legal problems, problems that are not too tailor made and in which the law student is coached in the process of solving the problems. The idea behind ROSA is that law students need to have an opportunity to become more skilled problem solvers. Therefore they need training.

Therefore it becomes more and more important to be constantly aware of what education is currently demanded and what education is currently offered. The IT solution is vital to process various information sources, extract education information, and provide analysis mechanisms in automated manner. The education information extraction is detailed in this paper in the context of Education demand and offer information monitoring system by providing the workflow for semi-automatic skills extraction from the university course descriptions using developed term suggestion method.	information extraction;requirement;semiconductor industry	Peteris Rudzajs	2012	2012 Sixth International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS)	10.1109/RCIS.2012.6240464	knowledge economy;computer science;knowledge management;data science;data mining;information extraction;measurement	Robotics	-84.29237449030408	-46.90229816655116	67583

Building a PBL application to support various PBL forms directly is difficult because the scope of variability cannot be completely known and there is a high cost in terms of time and efforts incurred. Existing PBL applications are developed usually to support a specific form of PBL. In this paper we propose a model-driven approach (MDA) to the development of an adaptive PBL application. We apply model-driven principles to enable the teacher to represent a PBL script in a PBL scripting language as a formal model and then use the model at run-time for managing the executions of the adaptation at a high level. As a consequence, the functions and the user interfaces of the PBL application can be adjusted according to the role of the users, the phases and the activities of a PBL process. The users of the PBL application, especially those who have no comprehensive knowledge about PBL, can be guided and constrained to do right thing at right time following a well-known PBL model or a best practice.	best practice;high-level programming language;mathematical model;model-driven architecture;model-driven engineering;scripting language;spatial variability;user interface	Yongwu Miao;Disi Wang;Mbombui Nongho Fon-Pah;Mohammed Samaka;Heinz Ulrich Hoppe	2015	2015 IEEE 15th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2015.142	unified modeling language;the internet;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;multimedia;user interface;management;law;collaboration	SE	-81.50377831790055	-44.41516623124592	67733
5497af79bcf84f2c2aefc697b2443e4f6bb64fe3	predicting student dropout in higher education		Each year, roughly 30% of first-year students at US baccalaureate institutions do not return for their second year and over $9 billion is spent educating these students. Yet, little quantitative research has analyzed the causes and possible remedies for student attrition. Here, we describe initial efforts to model student dropout using the largest known dataset on higher education attrition, which tracks over 32,500 students’ demographics and transcript records at one of the nation’s largest public universities. Our results highlight several early indicators of student attrition and show that dropout can be accurately predicted even when predictions are based on a single term of academic transcript data. These results highlight the potential for machine learning to have an impact on student retention and success while pointing to several promising directions for future work.	attrition (website);dropout (neural networks);logistic regression;machine learning;marginal model;predictive modelling	Lovenoor S.

The ODIS framework was developed and tested to interlink applications written in different programming languages, using shared OWL models: Explor@Graph, a Computer Supported Experimentation System, a scenario Editor and a Learning Object Repository. Models and instances are stored in a Sesame RDF database, offering many services such as import, export and query. Ontologies are used to standardize representations and models, so information can be exchanged and also to organize feedback and help in the environment. We will present how ODIS uses ontologies to transpose learning scenarios representations, to enrich them with user models and to define help.	feedback;interaction;ontology (information science);programming language;resource description framework;sesame;triplestore;web ontology language	Aude Dufresne;Mohamed Rouatbi;Fethi Guerdelli	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-69132-7_58	user modeling;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;machine learning;e-learning;data mining;world wide web	HCI	-81.35136703984992	-45.474849589873116	67968

Specifically, this paper reviews the learning effect model LEM which drives adaptive instruction within GIFT-based tutors. The original LEM was developed in 2012 and has been enhanced over time to represent a full range of function encompassing both the learner's and the tutor's interactions and decisions. This paper proposes a set of 10 functions to enhance the scope and functionality of the LEM and to extend it to be a career-long model of adaptive instruction and competency.		Robert A.

We present a methodology for developing computational models of quality that can assist users in assessing Web resources. The methodology consists of four steps: 1) a meta-analysis of previous studies to decompose quality into high-level dimensions and low-level indicators, 2) an expert study to identify the key low-level indicators of quality in the target domain, 3) human annotation to provide a collection of example resources where the presence or absence of quality indicators has been tagged, and 4) training of a machine learning model to predict quality indicators based on content and link features of Web resources. We find that quality is a multifaceted construct, with different aspects that may be important to different users at different times. We show that machine learning models can predict this multifaceted nature of quality, both in the context of aiding curators as they evaluate resources submitted to digital libraries, and in the context of aiding teachers as they develop online educational resources. Finally, we demonstrate how computational models of quality can be provided as a service, and embedded into applications such as Web search.	computational model;digital library;embedded system;high- and low-level;library (computing);machine learning;mechatronics;web resource;web search engine	Philipp G.

However there has been concern regarding whether viable trace mental models of recursion show students' true understanding of recursion. We have conducted an investigation to further examine the understanding of recursion of students with viable trace mental models. The investigation looked at students' understanding of the termination of a recursive function, their descriptive mental models and their ability to generate a recursive function. This research provides evidence to show that trace methods are essentially mechanical processes that can allow students with little understanding of recursion to correctly evaluate a recursive function but that students do not fully understand recursion and in particular have difficulties with the passive flow. Based on the results of the study, this paper discusses possible changes that can be made to our teaching in order to more eectively teach recursion to first year students.	computable function;mental model;recursion (computer science)	Tamarisk Lurlyn Scholtz;Ian Douglas Sanders	2010		10.1145/1822090.1822120	recursion;computer science;theoretical computer science;programming language;algorithm	HCI	-81.97119002760414	-38.54061281141849	69555

Today, many distance learning standards such as SCORM, AICC CMI, IEEE LTSC learning object meta-data (LOM), and IMS learning resource metadata XML binding specification, use metadata to tag learning materials, shareable content objects, and learning resources. However, most metadata is used to define learning materials and test problems. Few metadata is dedicated for assessment in learning. We propose an assessment metadata model for e-learning operations. With the support from the assessment metadata, we can collect information at the question cognition level, item difficulty index, item discrimination index, questionnaire style, and question style. The assessment analysis model provides individual questions, summary of test results, and analytical suggestions. The suggestions and results can tell teachers why a question is not suitable and how to correct it. Teachers can see the analysis of test result and fix problematic questions. With the cognition level analysis, teachers can avoid missing items in teaching. The mechanism developed also suggests an e-learning system, with adaptive learning content and individualized tests, as well as good advice for the teachers.	akaike information criterion;algorithm;cognition;computer memories inc.;item response theory;markup language;qti;xml	Jason C.

Over the past five years, there have been a number of research articles regarding the value of PI in computer science. The present work adds to this body of knowledge by examining outcomes from seven introductory programming instructors: three novices to PI and four with a range of PI experience. Through common measurements of student perceptions, we provide evidence that introductory computing instructors can successfully implement PI in their classrooms. We find encouraging minimum (74%) and average (92%) levels of success as measured through student valuation of PI for their learning. This work also documents and hypothesizes reasons for comparatively poor survey results in one course, highlighting the importance of the choice of grading policy (participation vs. correctness) for new PI adopters.

The new application is enabled by innovations in trust-based security of data built upon emerging infrastructures to aid federated data access in the UK education sector. Within the proposed architecture, users and data providers (within Virtual Organisations formed for specific learning needs) collaborate in a more dynamic and flexible manner by defining their own data-object-based security policies. This is enabled using a Service Orientated Architecture (SOA) that presents trusted services to ensure that these policies are both applied and enforced. The work is significant because it presents a new level of both distributed and live data integration into the ePortfolio domain. New data objects can be integrated into the learning process from emerging areas like social networking, giving the learning processes more depth. For the learner this approach enhances the quality and range of data that they can use in the ePortfolio, and has the potential to enhance the self-organised learning process, which for society in general will enhance learning processes.	data access;object-based language;refinement (computing);self-organization;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented software engineering	Tom Kirkham;Sandra Winfield;Angela Smallwood;Kirstie Coolin;Stuart Wood;Louis Searchwell	2009	Educational Technology & Society			HCI	-81.9108062554541	-45.27638921201794	70314

The assessment includes results from more than 200 students who used test and control versions of each module during the 1996-1997 academic year. The goal of the assessment was to identify presentation formats and strategies for on-line engineering design problems that improved student performance on the design problem or on a short paper and pencil follow-up quiz taken immediately after module use. Students nearly unanimously preferred modules that incorporated animation and interactive design tools over those with static snapshots of the same material. Interactive design tools also improved performance on the design problems. However, performance on the follow-up quizzes did not vary among student cohorts regardless of presentation format. Similarly, although students generally enjoyed and valued group work activities, and although these experiences frequently increased students' confidence in their answers, follow-up quiz performance was not enhanced by group work activities. In an unanticipated result, students were twice as likely to sketch their answers when the module itself contained animated illustrations rather than static graphic material. This result suggests that computer-based learning tools can significantly affect the character and texture of students' representation of their own ideas in manners that do not emerge from traditional performance measures.	engineering design process;online and offline	Anthony A.

Most of the e-learning system mainly teaching material includes text, picture, video, but lacked for interaction between students and vivid materials. Online games are conducive to learning because online games have greatly interaction and competitiveness among players to enhance student motivation to learn. Therefore, this work developed a multiplayer online game-based learning system (MOGLS), which based on the ARCS motivation model. The MOGLS allows learners to acquire Enterprise Resource Planning knowledge. The MOGLS system provides learning record, rankings record, end-of-test feedback to motivate learners to learn. By competition among students, the MOGLS system would facilitate and enhance learning. Finally, we analyzed the system effectiveness and system satisfaction for MOGLS system. The empirical results show that multiplayer online gamebased learning system not only helps students to obtain the ERP certification, the system also get a good utility evaluation in system effectiveness and satisfaction.	arcs (computing);active learning (machine learning);digital media;e-material;erp;enterprise resource planning;fuzzy logic	Ming-Hsiung Ying;Kai-Ting Yang	2013	JSW		fuzzy logic;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;multimedia	AI	-77.88276731870144	-43.13636747196533	70748
84b002410dd40fd1abc7c4612185d8e98c40d4fe	a multi-layer map-oriented resource organization system for web-based self-directed learning combined with community-based learning	learning instruction;educational technology	The main issue addressed in this paper is how to improve the learning situation of self-directed learning in resource search and organization from the web. In this paper, we have firstly proposed a multi-layer map model that visualizes basic learning behaviors when using the web for locating and organizing learning resources. It provides learners with the structures of the found resources, the tools for their semantic management, and also a simplified method to share the resources via the map representation. A system based on the proposed model has also been developed, that enables individual learners to easily locate suitable learning resources from the web by referring resource maps and also to organize them as personal topic maps. As community-based learning, by referring to a community topic map which merges all the personal topic maps created by individual self-directed learners, the learners can share their own resources and select those of other learners into their learning topics. As a result, the learners re-organize their personal topic maps by taking the resources from the community topic maps and at the same time contribute to the community topic map through their personal topic maps. A case study conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the system showed several positive results which validated our proposal.

The research was conducted on three courses at the Department of Informatics, University of Rijeka, and included 1231 tests. In observed courses, online tests have largely replaced traditional paper-based tests in the last few years. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine whether the online testing results differ from the results of traditional paper-based tests. The research results showed that, for the observed courses, the median values of the results achieved during MudRi online tests and traditional paper based tests are not significantly different when online tests include certain percentage of subjective test questions.	artificial intelligence;cap gemini sdm;informatics;information system;software development process	Sanja Candrlic;Martina Asenbrener Katic;Martina Holenko Dlab	2014	2014 37th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859649	simulation;data science	AI	-80.24834693135841	-39.15450398461437	71393

Standards such as SCORM or LTSCLOM will yield benefits for content maintenance and exchange of learning objects between publishers, services providers, and technical platforms. Pedagogic questions, e.g., how standardized learning objects can be used to guide learners through a number of learning experiences towards enhanced levels of knowledge and competency, are neglected. Furthermore, there are competing standards and the complexity of processes, subsystems, and functions in learning systems will make the implementation of standards challenging. The paper outlines the present state of standardization efforts and confronts technical standards with the complexity of a learning model for adult learners. It is proposed to use a workflow/learn-flow engine as a core module of learning management systems together with different types of learning objects. Functions and processes of a learn-flow driven LMS are outlined.	experience;technical standard	Wolfgang F.

They are mainly designed for formal and instructivist transmission models of learning. We propose a design for a hybrid institutional learning platform that suitably supports the simultaneous coexistence of formal/informal and instructivist/self-regulated learning. The design relies on a social collaborative learning pattern, open group-sourcing, based on peer production and feedback. To match peers' interactions with learners' skills, we align the visitor/resident learner model with the weighted peer production model. In this paper, we describe the different concepts that motivate our model and how it is concretely realized as a learning platform. We finally illustrate the whole with some of experiments and tests.	align (company);coexist (image);experiment;feedback;interaction;management system;social media;the open group	Laurent Moccozet;Camille Tardy	2014	2014 Eighth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2014.70	educational technology;error-driven learning;simulation;engineering;knowledge management;experiential learning;multimedia;active learning;open learning	Robotics	-79.94735298591904	-43.28454907924228	71986

Rather then clicking links to launch tools or to view content, such learning environments encourage more of a monitoring mode of operation that is very difficult to sense and record by the software alone. In this paper we propose adoption of peer-assessment approach in order to overcome the obstacle as well as to make the overall solution scalable. We propose a novel method for students peer-assessment based on trust concept. The overall approach is presented and practical experiments are conducted using developed web service. The grade scores determined by the learning peers/students are statistically proven as highly correlated with those marked by the teachers, indicating that approach proposed in this paper may be adopted as a legitimate assessment method.

It proposes a three-phase reviewing system that involves self-reviewing of algorithms, self-reviewing of programs and staff reviewing. This is an improvement of our existing twophase reviewing system that only supports the latter two phases. In the additional phase for algorithmic checking, learners describe an algorithm graphically using PAD, compile it, and execute it to verify their algorithm first without being troubled by syntax of a programming language; this supplies effectiveness to the efficient self-reviewing system.	apl;algorithm;compiler;programming language	Tatsuhiro Konishi;Hiroyuki Suzuki;Tomohiro Haraikawa;Yukihiro Itoh	2006			three-phase;machine learning;speech recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science	PL	-84.62523347723501	-39.475638402146075	72305

Today, apart from providing an information repository or a place to search for resources, the new Web 2.0 allows us to find other people, exchange ideas and thoughts, demonstrate creativity and create new knowledge. Based on Web 2.0, e-learning 2.0 has evolved to provide a constructivist learning environment. In this paper, Web 2.0 applications, such as wikis, social bookmarking and podcasts, are reviewed on how they can provide a rich, interactive, user-friendly application platform effectively. The platform would allow teachers and trainers to empower learners and create exciting new learning opportunities. It is more desirable if Web 2.0 technologies can be well integrated into traditional e-learning platforms such as WebCT and blackboard.		Jane Yau;Jeanne Lam;Simon K. S.

The system inherently builds a knowledge base by ontology to store the relationship of subject knowledge points to learning resource and relationship between knowledge points , displays the reticulated structure of knowledge (navigation map) formed by visualizing knowledge base, and aggregates corresponding learning resource of knowledge point to enable learners practice their learning process according to the navigation map. The thesis build ontology for navigated learning to achieve pragmatic learning navigation, there are several advantages for this innovative research: the reticulated structure of knowledge in a certain subject could be displayed briefly and straightforward; the system could recommend related and further study materials for learners and intelligently discover the weak knowledge points of learners according to automated reasoning on knowledge base. The system also provides an interactive environment for both teachers to edit the knowledge structure and learners to study. As the most popular knowledge model, we mainly discusses the establishment of semantic knowledge web, model of the knowledge base, knowledge storage for knowledge points in junior and senior schools, and the realization and utilization of the ontology-based navigation map.	automated reasoning;knowledge base;knowledge representation and reasoning;nautical chart;semantic web	Tianying Chen;Hongguang Fu	2009	2009 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing	10.1109/DASC.2009.17	knowledge base;navigation;knowledge integration;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;data science;body of knowledge;mathematical knowledge management;knowledge-based systems;semantic web;rdf;open knowledge base connectivity;data mining;procedural knowledge;knowledge extraction;automated reasoning;personal knowledge management;commonsense knowledge;domain knowledge	AI	-83.08048009011769	-46.272897312676776	72491

An implemented example scenario that demonstrates how agents interact in generating meaningful context-aware student feedback is described.

Rather, we must focus on unders tanding and suppor t ing learning in entirely new ways, with vital attention to the skills of social inl:eraction and participation in new actMties that current ly constitute life-king learning in working and living communities. In contrast to learning-before-doing, which is the model of most educational settings, i would like to encourage attention to what I call learning-in-doing. Learningin-doing is a model in which learners are increasingly involved in the authentic practices of communit ies th rough leartfing conversations and activities involving exper t practit ioners, educators, and peers. A prototype example has been the National Geographic Society KidsNet Project, in which chi ldren in thousands of elementary school classrooms investigated acid rain in their communities, pooled their data over networks, and carried out inquiries about why regional differences occurred in their data [5]. The questions the students addressed were current concerns in scientific practice, and they learned scientific concepts, research strategies, data collection, and analysis techniques through the doing of science rather than being taught about science as observers. We thus see science learned by participation ra ther than preparation.. Learn ingin -do i ig requires interactions among groups that tradit ionally have been separated by the institutional boundar ies of work and school. Advances in h igh-per tor mance comput ing and communications [9] offer enurlnous potential fbr l inking these communit ies in ways meaningful for learning. By collapsing spat iotemporal barr iers through the construction of distributed inult imedia learning environments, we may enable greater intimacy and authenticity in the learning process. Such technologies can be used to t:acilitate the re turn of successful learning models that existed pr ior to formal schooling, such as apprent iceship and long-term mentoring. By fundamental ly relying on intormat ion networks and remote nmlt imedia services, distr ibuted multimedia learning environments, or DMLEs, extend teaching, learning, and material resources beyond the linfits of individual classrooms [10]. Network and mult imedia technologies o i l e r opportuni t ies to increase the in lormat ioual and interactional world of the learner through access to diverse databases, the possibility of collaborative projects with remote participants, and access to a wide group of experts and others with whom the learner can engage in conversation about a subject area, task, or project. While such expert ise is now geographically dispersed and isolated, an increasing interconnectedness of learning environments is inevitable.	chi;database;interaction;interconnectedness;prototype;tor messenger;xilinx ise	Roy D.

This paper proposes a framework to solve the problem of integrating knowledge resources on the Web based on Semantic Web languages. As a consequence, knowledge modules of an AL system can be shared and reused on the Internet, resulting a service-based approach to developing distributed AL systems. Based on this framework, a prototype AL system was implemented to demonstrate how the knowledge modules of an AL system can be developed and integrated. Finally, a preliminary prototype evaluation result shows that the performance of the service-based approach is acceptable under light to middle traffics of requests based on current web service implementations.	architecture description language;experiment;information management system (ims);internet;knowledge integration;national supercomputer centre in sweden;personalization;prototype;semantic web;web application;web service;world wide web	Feng-Hsu Wang;Dai-Yan Chen	2008	2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2008.217	web service;personalized learning;web modeling;data web;knowledge integration;web standards;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;knowledge engineering;ontology;social semantic web;semantic web stack;database;world wide web	Robotics	-82.08211509310777	-45.08114320767358	74241

Instead, it should be more like a classroom, where a teacher adapts some, but not all, elements of teaching for each learner individually. For this, interests of students must be identified. An online learning platform was enhanced through agents to derive keywords from the material contained and identify a sub-set of interesting ones for each learner based on his/her actions. These are then used for automatic notifications on interesting events. Key findings from the first course held with support of this system are presented in this paper and possibilities for further enhancements discussed.	display resolution;online machine learning;personalization;real-time transcription;software engineering;user profile	Michael Sonntag;Andreas Putzinger	2005	31st EUROMICRO Conference on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications	10.1109/EURMIC.2005.33	educational technology;error-driven learning;the internet;computer science;theoretical computer science;multimedia;active learning;world wide web;synchronous learning	SE	-78.81018223902561	-43.65661294182494	74954

In the fall semester students are required to be physically present in lecture. In the spring semester students are given the option of either being physically present, when the lecture is given, or viewing the recorded lecture. Attendance is recorded in the lecture with an iClicker™. Students, who choose to not attend lecture can access the recording on Blackboard™ during the same week the lecture is given. The study compares student performance on first semester midterm exam grades with student performance on second semester midterm exam grades. It is seen that students, as a group, tend to achieve the same midterm grade whether they attend the lecture, when it is given, or not. Lecture assignment completion rates are also compared to lecture attendance. Suggestions for further study are given.	blackboard system	Michael Elmore;Koenraad Gieskes	2011	2011 Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2011.6142771	mathematics education;engineering education;engineering;electrical engineering;student engagement;work in process;pedagogy	DB	-79.7442735743734	-38.47169784495254	76447
6eb30afb5c994e7ddef4591afcc2226962b25981	affordances of virtual and physical laboratory projects for instructional design: impacts on student engagement		Contribution: Student engagement and interest in engineering is compared between virtual and physical laboratory projects, designed to be realistic and replicate engineering practice. Reported motivation and engagement was greater in the virtual project than the physical projects. Results are interpreted in terms of the different affordances for instructional design using physical and virtual laboratories. Background: Interest is increasing in incorporating virtual laboratories in engineering curricula. Numerous studies report equal or greater gains in students’ conceptual understanding in a virtual laboratory than a corresponding physical laboratory, but many researchers question if virtual laboratories can stimulate the same level of excitement for engineering as physical laboratories. Research Questions: Do students’ self-reports of interest in engineering depend on the instructional design afforded by the laboratory mode? How do instructional designs of virtual and physical laboratory projects relate to students’ perceptions of engagement, their contribution to the team, and the transfer of prior coursework to meet project objectives? Method: In a within-subjects design, 118 students’ interest and engagement in two physical laboratory projects and one of two virtual laboratory projects in a senior-year capstone course is investigated. Separate principal components analyses were used to develop reliable scales for interest and for engagement. Findings: Students reported greater engagement, perceptions of contribution to their group’s learning, opportunities to transfer prior learning from coursework, and end-of-course interest in engineering problem solving in the virtual laboratory project rather than the physical laboratory projects. The positive outcomes are connected to instructional design through the affordances of the virtual laboratory.	capstone (cryptography);problem solving;self-replicating machine	Susan Bobbitt Nolen;Milo D.

This approach is especially well suited for the early stages of Engineering Education, due to the importance played by interactive simulations and the resolution of carefully-designed batteries of exercises in the acquisition of basic skills in engineering disciplines. According to this process model, instructors are equipped with: (i) an authoring tool, which helps them to provide and maintain the collections of exercises, (ii) a generator, able to automatically turn collections of exercises into executable interactive simulators, and (iii) an analytic tool that can be applied to the logs produced by such simulators in order to assess student performance. In addition, the model promotes the improvement of the resulting educational systems through an exhaustive and continuous evaluation process. Besides to detail the process model, this paper illustrates it with the development of Evaluators, an educational system for the generation of different kinds of interactive simulations in introductory Compiler Construction courses typically taught in Computer Science and Computer Engineering degrees.	computer engineering;computer science;executable;process modeling;simulation	Daniel Rodriguez-Cerezo;Mercedes Gómez-Albarrán;José Luis Sierra	2013		10.1145/2536536.2536552	simulation;computer science;multimedia	Web+IR	-84.65630165012294	-39.121643340461205	76919

Such collaboration is often easier said than done. Nonaka and Takeuchi’s SECI model provides a process-oriented view of knowledge creation. In this paper, we propose the use of a Web-based group problem-solving system called TeamSpirit to support knowledge externalization, knowledge combination, and knowledge internalization – three of the four major backbones of the SECI model. Once knowledge has been created, it is critical that there is an intention for knowledge sharing and a capacity for knowledge adoption to facilitate organizational learning. In an empirical study, we found that subjects using TeamSpirit achieved high degrees of knowledge externalization, combination, internalization, as well as a knowledge-sharing intention and knowledge adoption. Possible explanations of the findings are discussed.	knowledge management;problem solving	Wesley Shu;Chia-Sheng Lin	2014				AI	-77.93826247118876	-44.566747180393506	77042
0ca93704f23a29d5d6850ca032fa924103d165dc	checking for dimensional correctness in physics equations	constraint propagation;intelligent tutoring system;knowledge base	One of the key components of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) is the mechanism for reasoning about the student’s input. The impact of this component extends far beyond the presentation of the lesson material to the success of the system itself. It affects how precisely the system can pinpoint student errors and thus the subsequent help that the system provides. This paper describes an example of a class of physics problems whose answers are most naturally represented as systems of algebraic equations. Analyzing such input requires not only an understanding of algebra but also knowledge of physics concepts. This paper describes a technique for determining the dimensional consistencyof algebraic equations in physics using constraint propagation. Unlike other methods, it does not depend on the user defining the dimensions of each variable. Instead, it uses a knowledge base of well known physics variables combined with constraint propagation to determine both the dimensions of values (variables and constants) and also the dimensional consistency of an equation. The technique has been successfully tested on answers obtained from a class of college level introductory physics students.	algebraic equation;correctness (computer science);knowledge base;linear algebra;local consistency;software propagation	Chun Wai Liew;Donald E.

A taxonomy of the tutor domain was used to group existing knowledge elements into plausible, more general, concepts. Existing student models were then used to measure the validity of these new concepts, demonstrating that at least some of these concepts appear to be more effective at capturing what the students learned than the original knowledge elements. We then trialled an experimental ITS that gave feedback at a higher level. The results suggest that it is feasible to use this approach to determine how feedback might be fine-tuned to better suit student learning, and hence that learning curves are a useful tool for mining student models.	taxonomy (general)	Brent Martin;Antonija Mitrovic	2005		10.1007/11527886_12	simulation;systems modeling;computer science;artificial intelligence;learning curve;taxonomy	ML	-78.64658775213056	-49.04455573898664	77430

However, in informal Web-based learning this may not be the case. In this paper, we present a method for automatically calculating a tentative order in which objects should be learned based on the estimated complexity of their contents. Thus, the proposed method is based on a process that enriches textual objects with links to Wikipedia articles, which are used to calculate a complexity score for each object. We evaluated our method with two different datasets: Wikipedia articles and online learning courses. For Wikipedia data we achieved correlations between the ground truth and the predicted order of up to 0.57 while for subtopics inside the online learning courses we achieved correlations of 0.793.	experiment;ground truth;knowledge base;wikipedia	Patrick Siehndel;Ricardo Kawase;Bernardo Pereira Nunes;Eelco Herder	2014		10.5220/0004837602700277	ground truth;computer science;data mining;structure (mathematical logic)	AI	-79.11381210586231	-47.141824676530824	77996

There have been numerous investigations of the influence of various aspects of a program and the programming process on program comprehension. However, the many different measures of understanding used in these studies make any comparison or analysis difficult. Some of the different measures include time to find a bug, a comprehension quiz, ability to reproduce a functionally equivalent program without notes, time to perform a modification and Halstead's E. All of these have limitations such as inability to measure both low- and high-level understanding, difficulty of administering and objectively grading, or impractical for large or non-trivial programs. Of the measures, the comprehension quiz is probably the most commonly used and accepted measure of program understanding.#R##N##R##N#This paper reports on a controlled experiment that compared the “cloze” procedure and comprehension quiz as measuring program understanding. In a cloze procedure, the subjects are presented a program listing with some of the program tokens (operands, operators, reserved words, single parenthesis or brackets, etc.) replaced with blanks and are required to fill in the blanks.#R##N##R##N#Our experiment tested students in sophomore, junior and senior level computer science courses. These were assumed to correspond to three levels of programming experperience. Each subject was given one of two versions of a sorting program and either a cloze version of the program or a comprehension quiz over it. Results for the cloze procedure closely approximated those of the comprehension quizzes for both programs and each level of experience.#R##N##R##N#These results and the ease of administration and grading make the cloze procedure a potentially attractive means for measuring program understanding.	program comprehension	Curtis R.

PI's key classroom mechanism is the PI question: a formative multiple choice question on which students vote, then discuss, then vote again. While research indicates that PI questions lead to learning gains for students, relatively little is known about the questions themselves and how faculty employ them. Additionally, much of the work has examined PI data collected by researchers operating in a quasi-experimental setting. We examine data collected incidentally by multiple instructors using PI as a pedagogical technique in their classroom. We look at how many questions instructors use in their courses, the difficulty level of the questions, and normalized gain, a metric that looks at increases in student correctness between individual and group votes. We find normalized gain levels similar to those in existing literature, indicating that students are learning, and that most questions, even those developed by instructors new to PI, fall within recommended difficulty levels, indicating instructors can create good PI questions with little training. We also find that instructors add PI questions over the first several iterations of a new PI course, showing that they find PI questions valuable and suggesting that full development of PI materials for a course may take multiple semesters.	best practice;correctness (computer science);iteration;norsk data;structure of observed learning outcome	Cynthia Taylor;Jaime Spacco;David P.

While some virtual communities (e.g., Motley Fool) have flourished, many sites designed for online collaboration have failed to succeed as virtual communities, places for people to hang out and collaborate online. In order to design effective virtual communities, we need methods to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of collaborative environments, and the degree to which they function as virtual communities (VCs). Our concern in this paper is to explore, through the discussion of a pilot study of a research-purposed VC, how to evaluate a VC infrastructure.	interaction;usability;vc dimension;virtual community	Janet Ho;Monica M.

Many of these gains have been achieved for well-defined problems. However, solving ill-defined problems is important because it can enhance the cognitive, metacognitive and argumentation skills of a student. In this paper, we demonstrate how to apply the constraint-based modelling approach to describe the solution space of ill-defined problems in logic programming. This technology has been integrated into a web-based ITS (INCOM) and has been evaluated with student solutions from past examinations.	feasible region;logic programming;web application	Nguyen-Thinh Le;Wolfgang Menzel	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-78139-4_33	concurrent constraint logic programming;constraint programming;constraint satisfaction;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;inductive programming;logic programming;algorithm	AI	-78.41766556131995	-47.11945103919624	80288

On the other hand, the number of teachers in schools or universities is growing slowly. As a result, instructional problems have emerged due to lack of sufficient support to learners in their e-learning process. Collaborative learning is suggested as a solution to this problem. However, current collaborative learning has focused on teamwork or group discussion without sufficient support to each individual. This paper presents a new model for collaborative e-learning called Collaborative Cloud, in which knowledge modelling and market economic mechanism are utilized to optimize the collaborative use of e-learning resources including teachers, students, and artifacts in collaboration. To implement the approach, cloud computing and electronic commerce are applied to connect learners and coordinate the resources in e-learning in a more effective way.	accessibility;cloud computing;e-commerce payment system	Jian Liao;Minhong Wang	2011	2011 IEEE 8th International Conference on e-Business Engineering	10.1109/ICEBE.2011.14	e-commerce;collaborative learning;team learning;the internet;simulation;cloud computing;computer science;knowledge management;software engineering;database;multimedia;grid;world wide web	DB	-80.88252956288997	-43.11531866498026	80823

Normally, however, lessons prepare students for solving problems. In this paper, we present a method for systematically structuring an adaptive eLearning course containing test problems as well as lessons. This method is based on knowledge space theory extended by component-wise representation of problems and on applying demand analysis. A course developed with such a method can be fed into an adaptive tutoring system, realized, e.g., within the adaptive tutoring system RATH. Theoretical Background This paper is based on an application of the theory of knowledge spaces and its extensions to building an adaptive tutoring system (ATS). An ATS adapts the learning content to the individual learner, e.g. with respect to the learner’s current knowledge. The learner state is assessed through a test or questionnaire, and subsequently learning objects are selected or presented by adapting them to the current learner state which itself may be regularly updated during the learning process. The theory of knowledge spaces [2, 3] is a psychological model for structuring domains of knowledge based on prerequisite relationships. It was developed aiming at the adaptive assessment of knowledge [3, 4]. Later it was also applied to adaptive training in the ALEKS system [3; see also http://www.aleks.com]. However, ALEKS is limited in that it does not offer genuine teaching by presenting lessons but only explanations for training problems. Albert and Held applied methods of demand analysis to obtain knowledge spaces for given domains [1, 5]. In a first step, they searched for components of test problems in a certain area, and attributes for these components. Held, for example, found for elementary probability theory problems on drawing balls from an urn as one component the method of drawing with three attributes from (1) drawing one ball , to (3) drawing multiple balls without replacement [5]. In a second step, the demands (or skills) posed on the learn ers by the different attribute values were investigated. In the aforementioned example, Held identified four demands related to the attributes for the component way of drawing from (a) knowing the Laplace rule for computing probabilities, to (d) knowing that drawing without replacement reduces the number of balls in the urn. For the three attributes and the four demands specified in the example above, Held found the assignments shown in Table 1.

A collaborative environment, however, will demand a higher effort from the teacher, who will have to supervise all the discussions among the learners, so that they do not deviate from the intended topic for the lesson. Moreover, the information proceeding from the interactions among the students will provide to the teacher features that allow a individual evaluation of the students and his course. In this way, this paper describes a first experience using Multi-agent architecture able to monitor the communication tools in a distance learning group. This system analyzes the discussions taking place in these tools (discussion list, chat and newsgroups), showing to the teacher statistical information (percentile of participation and number of changed messages) and identifying possible associations in the interactions, such as, topics and subtopics that interest the students, groups of learners that interact intensively, etc.	agent architecture;interaction;software agent	Patrícia Augustin Jaques;Flávio Moreira de Oliveira;Rosa Maria Vicari	2002			collaborative learning;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;software agent;multimedia;communication;independent study;pedagogy	ML	-77.72687147481663	-43.995316997905206	81032

It requires the identification of players' profiles through the analysis of large volume of data including game data. This research study aims at identifying relevant data from an online serious game and the appropriate data mining methods for deduction of players' profiles. Multiple linear regression is applied to analyze the influence of player's characteristics on his performance. Moreover, clustering technique is used, in particular K-means, to extract players' clusters and to identify their common characteristics. The regression models showed that the number of access to the game, completed quests and advantages used contribute significantly to the scores and the gaming duration, while the clustering revealed three forms of players' participation: beginner, intermediate and advanced; who interact with the game according to their experiences.	cluster analysis;data mining;experience;k-means clustering;natural deduction;personalization	Souhila Benmakrelouf;Neila Mezghani;Nadjia Kara	2015	2015 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)	10.1145/2808797.2809429	simulation;computer science;linear regression;machine learning;data mining;mathematics;multimedia;statistics	ML	-77.88036391948937	-51.03410732185967	81255

However, a system is only useful if the learner remains active and motivated. It is well known that page turning or browsing does not ensure effective learning. Students must want to learn and should be involved. They need to be challenged to reason about the material presented. Flashy graphics and simulations are not enough; the experience has to be authentic and relevant to the learner’s life. have advocated active learning multimedia environments to enable students to make authentic choices that impact the environment. We continue this theme and assert that multimedia, when coupled with other improvements in educational software design, can support effective, quality instruction. We propose an instruction model that moves beyond the “Tyranny of the B u t t ~ n ” ~ and uses intelligent simulation, dynamic links (on-line generation of links based on student behavior), and multimedia composition and creation.

Assessing different levels of expertise in experimentation is a difficult task since these are not usually visible as part of a student's final design solution. The purpose of this research is to investigate and characterize students' experimentation strategies while working on a design challenge. We conducted a concurrent think-aloud to capture students' thinking while they were working on a design challenge using an educational computer-aided design (CAD) software. We showed how the design replays generated from the log files collected from the CAD software can be used to represent students' experimentation strategies and how these representations can be validated by the data collected from the think-aloud. Our preliminary results show that technology-based assessment by the educational CAD tool allows us to identify the differences between different experimentation strategies and that the result of this assessment is supported by the result obtained from the concurrent think-aloud. Implications of this work would be relevant to engineering educators and researchers who are interested in understanding and assessing students' experimentation strategies in engineering design.	computer-aided design;data logger;driven right leg circuit;engineering design process;experiment;homology (biology);ibm notes;iterative method;sampling (signal processing);vii	Ying Ying Seah;Camilo Vieira;Chandan Dasgupta;Alejandra J.

In the past five years, the average final grades of the students in a traditionally implemented computer networks and information security lecture course have been decreasing. An experiment on increasing student effort was made in a new information security course, relying on reducing the amount of lectures and moving a corresponding amount of course work into a computer-based learning environment to be performed independently and in a group. The results of the experiment were extremely promising, showing higher student effort and better grades. The experiment was repeated in another new course and the preliminary results also indicate a similar increase in student effort. The conclusion is that similar strategies should also be employed in existing courses and future new courses.

We present this method as one approach to addressing the often challenging problem of grading assignments in programming environments. A classic solution is creating unit-tests that the student-generated program must pass, but the rigid, structured nature of unit-tests is suboptimal for assessing more open-ended assignments. Furthermore, the creation of unit-tests requires predicting the various ways a student might correctly solve a problem – a challenging and time-intensive process. The current study proposes an alternative, semi-automated method for generating rubric parameters using low-level data from the Alice programming environment.		Nicholas Diana;Michael Eagle;John C.

How to give students learning sequence suggestions in the mobile learning environment is a big issue and is also the goal of this paper. This research uses knowledge map to store the characteristics of each learning object and designs a situated map to represent spatial knowledge in the mobile learning environment. By using these two knowledge structures, knowledge map and situated map, the system created by this research can generate various navigation sentences and ask students to observe the characteristics of learning objects. This research also takes information theory into consideration in order to decide which navigation sentence should deliver to the student first. The system calculates the entropy for each generated sentence and finds the most appropriate one to deliver to the student.

de29c2b974e0fc0f26740ebe2e61f7a83c0a3d02	self-efficacy and engagement as predictors of student programming performance		Programming is a core subject introduced in the first year of an Undergraduate Computer Science programme. Since programming is a core subject, it is a major concern that high attrition and failure rates continue to be reported in such courses. Evidence from the literature suggests that programming is cognitively demanding, and the solutions proposed have had minimal impact on students in introductory programming courses. However, in the literature on learning theory, there is evidence suggesting that the self-efficacy beliefs of students affect their engagement, and that their engagement affects their performance. In the literature on introductory programming courses, there is a lack of research examining the effect of self-efficacy on engagement, and the effect of engagement on the programming performance of students. This leaves a gap in programming research that this research seeks to fill. Based on student engagement frameworks in the literature on learning theory, a conceptual model was developed. To operationalise and validate the conceptual model within the context of learning programming, a study consisting of focus group interviews and a survey on students in introductory programming courses is proposed. The results of the survey will be analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques.	attrition (website);computer science;focus group;statistical learning theory;structural equation modeling	Geetha Kanaparan;Rowena Cullen;David D.

The PerspectivesX tool has been designed to promote learner knowledge construction and curation for a range of multi-perspective elaboration techniques (e.g., SWOT analysis and Six Thinking Hats). The PerspectivesX tool is designed to store learner submissions in a searchable knowledge base which is able to be persisted across course re-runs and promotes the use of natural language processing techniques to allow course moderators to provide scalable feedback. In this paper we outline the design principles that structured collaborative learning tools need to adhere to, design a prototype tool (PerspectivesX) and evaluate whether MOOC platform extension frameworks are able to support the implementation of	digital curation;knowledge base;massive open online course;natural language processing;open-source software;prototype;scalability	Aneesha Bakharia	2017			simulation;knowledge management;world wide web	HCI	-79.85879590767026	-43.99082623699873	84328

The analysis was conducted by studying the records of 75 students who have been in the Computer Science Ph.D. program of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Seventy-seven variables were extracted from each student's record, and the variables were correlated with whether the student did or did not successfully graduate from the program. A multivariate model was developed that predicts success with a high degree of accuracy. Importantly, the model relies on variables that can be determined reasonably early in a student's Ph.D. class work, enabling its use as a selection metric. Hypotheses about the composition of the model are also presented and discussed.	computer science	Glenn W. Cox;William E. Hughes;Letha H.

c63f1fd9eabcc6da5f0f6129376c598a8d85c5c4	improving the family orientation process in cuban special schools trough nearest prototype classification	tecnologias generalidades;tecnologias	-12Abstract — Cuban Schools for children with Affective – Behavioral Maladies (SABM) have as goal to accomplish a major change in children behavior, to insert them effectively into society. One of the key elements in this objective is to give an adequate orientation to the children’s families; due to the family is one of the most important educational contexts in which the children will develop their personality. The family orientation process in SABM involves clustering and classification of mixed type data with non-symmetric similarity functions. To improve this process, this paper includes some novel characteristics in clustering and prototype selection. The proposed approach uses a hierarchical clustering based on compact sets, making it suitable for dealing with non-symmetric similarity functions, as well as with mixed and incomplete data. The proposal obtains very good results on the SABM data, and over repository databases.	algorithm;cluster analysis;computer cluster;database;hierarchical clustering;prototype	Yenny Villuendas-Rey;Carmen Rey-Benguría;Yailé Caballero Mota;María Matilde García Lorenzo	2013	IJIMAI	10.9781/ijimai.2013.212	engineering;artificial intelligence;data mining;communication	DB	-77.87167219549869	-44.017070507590226	84819

Educators have been aware of this problem and have urged their students to prepare in different ways, such as by self-reparation, handing in a pre-laboratory assignment, or attending a pre-laboratory preparation session. Many studies report different approaches to laboratory preparation; however comparative investigations are scarce. This article reports on an empirical study that spanned over 3 years. Three preparation modes (PMs) are compared: (a) PM1—pre-laboratory home assignment with the laboratory manual and virtual laboratory software; (b) PM2—pre-laboratory session with a teaching assistant and preparation via the laboratory manual only; and (c) PM3—pre-laboratory session with a teaching assistant and preparation via the virtual laboratory and the laboratory manual. Measurements of the laboratory learning outcomes by means of preand post-laboratory tests and a comprehensive laboratory report indicate that PM3 is the most efficient approach. Discussions of the result in light of pedagogical and cognitive science theories are provided. 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We intend to promote e-learning technologies in medical, pharmaceutical and health care domains. Using Java and XML technologies, we build models for various categories of wounds, due to various etiologies. Based on color and texture analysis, we identify the main barriers to wound healing, such as tissue non-viable, infection, inflammation, moisture imbalance, or edge non-advancing. This framework provides the infrastructure for preparing e-learning scenarios based on practice and real world experiences. We make experiments for wound healing simulation using various treatments and compare the results with experimental observations. Our experiments are supported by XML based databases containing knowledge extracted from previous wound healing experiences and from medical experts' knowledge. Also, we rely on new paradigms of the Artificial Intelligence for creating e-learning scenarios to be used in a context of active learning, for wound image understanding. To implement the e-learning tools, we use Java technologies for dynamic processes and XML technologies for dynamic content. Our approach to e-learning is so called blended learning, which combines traditional face-to-face and Web-based on-line learning, with focus on principles of active learning.	artificial intelligence;color image;computer vision;database;dynamic web page;experience;experiment;image processing;java;online and offline;online machine learning;simulation;xml	Augustin Prodan;Remus Câmpean;Cornelia Revnic;Rodica Prodan	2009	2009 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications	10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069456	etiology;image texture;computer vision;the internet;xml;image analysis;simulation;blended learning;computer science;artificial intelligence;dynamic web page;machine learning;java collections framework;multimedia;active learning;skin;knowledge extraction;programming language;java;health care	Web+IR	-81.43660747178677	-43.3394331997611	85836

In our study, 17 Introduction to Computer Science labs were randomly assigned to play the learning game first and half to write a program first. Our results show that students playing the learning game first learn more, and that students prefer the game assignment to the traditional assignment. These results suggest that incorporation of game-based assignments is beneficial to student learning.	computer science;interactive visualization;randomness	Michael Eagle;Tiffany Barnes	2009		10.1145/1536513.1536533	game design;simulation;iteration;interactive visualization;nested loop join;computer science;theoretical computer science;game mechanics;multimedia	HCI	-81.27217773538514	-38.03245404085761	86505

The goal is to show the effectiveness of the remote laboratory on examination results. To provide an overview, the two applications of the remote laboratory are addressed: 1) the Stewart platform, and 2) the quadruple water tank system. Combining both applications allows a broad spectrum of practical examples featuring challenging control aspects such as multiple-input–multiple-output control, decoupling, non-minimum phase systems, open-loop unstable systems, and PID control design. The remote laboratory feedback study was performed using a five-point Likert-type scale survey to elicit the students’ level of satisfaction with the laboratory. Three years of student examination results were also studied to compare performance before and after integrating the remote laboratory. In the first of these years there was no use of the remote laboratory. In the second year, the remote laboratory was introduced on a voluntary basis, and in the third year the remote laboratory was obligatory. Student feedback indicates that the remote laboratory needs further development to counter its limitations. A major conclusion of the survey was that there is keen interest in the remote laboratory to provide practical experience in the training of a control engineer. It can be concluded that the remote laboratory has a positive effect on student examination results.	control engineering;control theory;coupling (computer programming);experiment;feedback;minimum phase;pid;quadruple-precision floating-point format;streaming media	Am&#x00E9;lie Chevalier;Cosmin Copot;Clara M.

While numerous studies have explored the influence of various variables on programming course participation and performance at a personal level, there have been few studies conducted at a policy level. This study examined the impact of the medium of instruction (MOI) on student learning of computer programming in Hong Kong. It also examined the effects of gender and prior academic ability on programming performance. No gender differences in programming performance were found in the sample after prior academic ability was controlled. Prior academic ability affected performance differentially. Chinese-medium instructed students tended to outperform their English-medium instructed counterparts and middle and low-ability students in English-medium schools were notably at-risk. In view of these results, we argue that the MOI issue is further complicated by student ability. This provides a new understanding of the impact of the MOI on student learning. At a policy level, the results offer empirical evidence for policy-makers to rethink the current MOI policy. At a school level, we propose some metacognitive and cognitive strategies to address the needs of those at-risk learners. Finally, we intend to raise a series of questions that warrant further discussion and investigation.	computer programming	Wilfred W. F.

The learner can be benefited by the useful guidance provided by the learning assistance tool. An effective learning assistance tool can reduce the teaching load of the teacher. However, it is rarely seen that a learning assistance tool employs machine learning techniques to provide appropriate diagnosis or feedback to learners or teachers in the literature. We thus propose a learning assistance tool that employs reinforcement learning technique to continuously interact with the environment in order to offer learners suitable and timely feedback, guide them through the difficulties. Our experimental results reveal that our learning assistance tool can effectively enhance the learners' ICT application ability and assist the learners in overcoming difficulties. The teaching load of the teacher is also significantly reduced.

There have been a vast amount of studies with a focus on identifying studentsu0027 difficulties, common errors and misconceptions in programming, and on the development and design of instructional techniques that could potentially help students overcome these difficulties. Nevertheless, there are few studies that explore studentsu0027 performance in programming under the prism of self-regulation theory. To this end, the current study considers girlsu0027 and boysu0027 calibration and how it is related with their performance in programming, self-evaluation, and self-efficacy in computer science. Calibration is a measure of the accuracy with which people assess their confidence in their own performance. The results of our study suggest that boys feel significantly more efficacious in computer science than girls, as well as make significantly more accurate predictions (better calibrated) of their programming performance than girls. The implications of these findings for the current education practices are outlined and discussed.	computer programming;computer science	Maria Kallia;Sue Sentance	2018		10.1145/3265757.3265773	mathematics education;pedagogy;self-efficacy;computer science;computer programming	HCI	-78.62559912708765	-39.444361270707496	88452

Probably the best known early test used to predict programming aptitude was the IBM Programmer Aptitude Test (PAT). The test consisted of three parts. The first part required the participant to figure out the next number in series, the second part to figure out analogies represented in figures, and the third part to solve arithmetic problems. The test was widely used in industry (in 1966, 349 American and Canadian companies used IBM-PAT to screen job candidates), but the relationship between the test and the actual job performance of programmers were often quite low (Mayer & Stalnaker, 1968).	programmer;series and parallel circuits;aptitude	Markku Tukiainen;Eero Mönkkönen	2002			aptitude;machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science	SE	-81.54091183135924	-39.094621646658375	91708

Art students are typically taught to think very openly and conceptually. While extremely beneficial, a problem arises when graduating artists have no developed means of analytical problem solving, putting them at a disadvantage when dealing with the technology they use to create their art. It is critical that computing courses that include programming be introduced early in an art student's career, exposing them to the knowledge of how their tools work. A solution to this is to use the open source 3D modeling and animation suite, Blender, and its integration with the Python scripting language as a means of teaching this valueable way of thinking to artists.	3d modeling;blender (software);mechatronics;open-source software;problem solving;python;scripting language	Jason van Gumster	2003		10.1145/965106.965135	distance education;computer vision;simulation;long-term potentiation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;scripting language;multimedia;robotics;computer graphics (images)	HCI	-84.32092917373087	-38.33558638051103	91816

Because of the one-size-fits-all user interface, most people in Web-based learning have to face lack of support on adaptive learning. Agents are autonomous and computational entities that can be viewed as perceiving and acting upon their environment. We make use of multi-agent system (MAS) technology in artificial intelligence to implement adaptivity to improve the users' study in quality dynamically. We start our work with a 4-key-component interaction model for adaptivity to construct special user models. On the basis of them an adaptive learning system is designed and implemented using MAS technology. Following that the architecture and working process of this system are presented. And then we introduce how to get learning resource adaptive to users; examples are also given to evaluate the adaptiveness.	artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;computation;entity;fits;human computer;human–computer interaction;multi-agent system;user experience;user interface;web application	Xiao Li;Zhong Xie;Yuhui Qiu	2004	IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, 2004.

On the basis of the credit system, students can select the courses freely and independently according to their academic plan. However, there are some problems about the credit system as following. How do the students select the courses in accordance of specialty knowledge? How do the students cultivate their own professional quality in accordance of social requirements? How do the students plan their academic path in accordance of talents training? Thence, the kernel key of the credit system is to cultivate the applicable and high-quality talents from colleges and universities. At the same time, the data mining is a kind of effective data analysis technologies. Because a group of big data would come exactly from the digital information of administration processing of colleges and universities, the application of data mining on it could solve these problems above and promote the implementation of the credit system in colleges and universities.	autonomous robot;big data;data mining;digital data;knowledge management;personalization;requirement	Jun Tao;Gui Wu	2015	2015 12th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)	10.1109/FSKD.2015.7382043	computer science;data science;data mining	ML	-84.40094774591681	-46.3720472469493	92087

Our work focuses on supporting cooperative problem solving in the context of high-functionality computer systems. We show how the conceptual framework behind a given system determines crucial aspects of the system's behavior. Several systems are described that attempted to address specific shortcomings of prevailing assumptions, resulting in a new conceptual framework. To further test this resulting framework, we conducted an empirical study of a success model of cooperative problem solving between people in a large hardware store. The conceptual framework is instantiated in a number of new system-building efforts, which are described and discussed.	conceptual schema;problem solving	Gerhard Fischer;Brent Reeves	1992	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/BF00122020	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;knowledge-based systems;conceptual framework;management science;empirical research	AI	-77.631678821446	-46.12938268960507	93051

Unlike previous surveys of ICAI, which have been organized around the seminal ICAI systems, this one concentrates on the contribution of each eeort to our understanding of the various components of ICAI systems. Along the way, comparisons are made between ICAI and CAI, although a CAI straw man is used due to the focus of the paper. Various learning scenarios are discussed, including computer coaches, gaming environments , mixed initiative dialog, Socratic tutors, articulate experts, interactive simulation, and discovery learning. Various forms of knowledge representation are discussed along with relevant issues and examples. Several techniques for student modeling and diagnosis are presented, as are their respective advantages and disadvantages. Pedagogical knowledge, its role in ICAI, and several examples are highlighted. The evolution of discourse management techniques for ICAI is outlined. Techniques for the automatic generation of problems from a general base of domain knowledge are presented. Finally, issues in the design of user interfaces for ICAI systems are brieey discussed. The purpose of this paper is to place previous ICAI research in a form which is appropriate for use by future designers of ICAI systems. Although computer-aided instruction (CAI) 1 has been around for some time now, there has been much discontent with the current state of educational software. Traditional \frame-oriented CAI"""" requires teachers to fully specify presentation text, all questions and their associated answers, and a strict ow of control through the course, allowing at best diierent branches to be taken based on the student's pre-enumerated possible responses. This style of teaching has often been referred to as \electronic page turning."""" A step in the right direction was made with generative CAI. In these systems, techniques such as textual templates, problem-generation grammars, and random numbers were used to generate problems for the student. Still, the systems lacked the ability to adapt to the student or relate his incorrect answers to the correct ones, and the problems were usually limited to simple drill-and-practice questions 40]. 1 Because this paper concentrates on ICAI, a CAI straw man is used for comparison. In fairness to CAI researchers, it should be noted that the problems with CAI were well known, and many practitioners developed ingenious solutions for them. Nevertheless, our characterization of CAI is adequate for the purposes of this paper."""	cognitive tutor;fairness measure;knowledge representation and reasoning;random number generation;simulation;user interface;dialog	Jeff Rickel	1989	IEEE Trans.

It is seen as an active learning scheme in which knowledge is built through the development of experimental and analytical activities. This paper presents the expansion of the SMILE project (Stanford Mobile Inquiry Based Learning Environment), whose goal is to allow students to create and share questions and answers using mobile devices. A variation of the original SMILE project is presented here, in which teachers propose a research topic based on a triggering text. A text mining tool is then used to extract relevant terms and keywords from the students' writings in order to search the web for related contents. The items returned are then filtered to be recommended to the students, making them aware of the availability of different material that may complement their investigation. Experiment results involving 34 graduate and undergraduate students showed that they had a positive perception of their use of the tool in the development of the activity. Students gave the tool an average score of 8.24 in a scale of 0 to 10, and a score of 8.03 to the inquiry-based learning activity.	google questions and answers;mobile device;text mining;web search engine	Otávio Costa Acosta;Patricia Alejandra Behar;Eliseo Reategui	2014	2014 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Proceedings	10.1109/FIE.2014.7044274	text mining;computer science;data mining;multimedia;world wide web	HCI	-78.42240269449323	-43.03158711969941	94522

The proposed system has the following features. (1) The language describing the QA cycle (EDML: Exercise Design Markup Language) is created. EDML is a language with the following functions. Various questions with the same difficulty and different content can be automatically generated. The answer evaluation environment and the selection of questions matched to the skill are described in a unified text for iterative learning matched to the learner's skill. (2) A method is established in which a learning system can easily be constructed by using an existing mail system. With the proposed approach, a remote learning system can be created without implementing functions for network security, generation of temporary logs, or program buffering in case of overload, which are essential elements of a remote learning system. This paper also describes the construction of a prototype of the proposed system. The proposed system was applied to a Pascal programming course for college freshman, and the results are described herein. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, web-based adaptive collaborative learning environment is composed of discussion forum and one-on-one peer help, user model, collaborative strategy model and adaptive component. It is able to reason and justify logistically, provide learners with appropriate companion list, and limit the number of help requirements that a student receives at one time. Therefore, it can get rid of the disadvantages of traditional open web-based collaborative learning environment, and improve the quality and efficiency of learning.

In this paper, we propose a schema-driven methodology to design a general learning management system supporting XML and Web-services technologies. This system is driven and controlled by schema processors, which provide the ability for users to freely generate and manage learning procedures such as replace learning activities. In addition, it can interact with legacy systems. We represent the procedures of controlling learning activities through schema management, such as dynamically establishing and allocating the main directories (e.g. the learning activity directory) from the central databases (e.g. the learning activity database) to a user in terms of his/her roles, sub-roles and requirements. This system can greatly improve the capabilities of existing learning management systems.	central processing unit;database;directory (computing);directory service;legacy system;requirement;xml	Lipeng Wen;Chris R.

Although this decision may have a big impact on students’ motivation and future achievements, usually no support is offered to contest this problem. The use of recommendation systems to suggest items to users has well-known success in several domains, and some of the most successful techniques use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to capture hidden latent factors in reduced dimensionality and produce high quality recommendations. In this paper, we propose to use SVD, with a contextual mapping to the educational paradigm, to capture relationships between courses grades and recommend masters’ courses that are suitable to students’ skills given their bachelor achievements. Our results show that using SVD to predict the masters’ courses marks has potential to serve as basis for the recommendation production.	display resolution;latent variable;programming paradigm;recommender system;singular value decomposition	Fábio Carballo;Cláudia Antunes	2014			computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;recommender system;management science;curse of dimensionality;bachelor;multimedia;contest;singular value decomposition	AI	-77.50615256243556	-39.02877966328779	97232

Creating an effective interface to present a learner model is an important part in open learner modeling. Usefulness of the learner model relies on using a clear and effective representation format to facilitate users' understanding of the information presented. In this paper, we propose a range of open learner model representation formats to display students' learning task status and achievement in terms of learning outcomes. We investigate different types of representation formats and data useful for users to inspect the learner model. An interface design prototype has been built to provide potential users with an evaluation platform that enables investigation of these aspects. The results obtained will allow us to develop a more effective new open learner model visualisation tool.	graphical user interface;information needs;prototype;visual artifact	Check Yee Law;John C.

Along the following eight years several pedagogical measures - mostly related with continous assessment - were introduced with the aim of increasing the pass rate of the course without lowering its high quality standards. This paper analyzes to what extent the added workload on faculty entailed by these measures affects the pass rate. We use  a  classical  marginal  cost-benefit  approach - from  Economics -  to compare  these  two  values  along  time.  This  process  allows  us  to  relate the evolution of the pass rate of students with the workload of the faculty through a productivity curve, as well as to assess the impact of each pedagogical measure. We conclude that, for this course, continuous assessment is expensive. In fact, abstracting from short term oscillations, the slope of the productivity curve is close to zero.		Maria J.

My personal experience shows the big part of the students until the present period do not have learned the teaching material week in week out and just have visited the presentations or simply stayed at home. The situation is unfortunately the same by other subjects too at the university and the colleagues have the same experience from other universities and colleges in Hungary. The learning habit of the undergraduate mechanical engineering students could be followed and analysed if we can see the details of the downloading of the teaching materials. The analysing of the data made possible to draw conclusions regarding the learning habits of undergraduate mechanical engineering students. I analysed the saved data of downloads in the last five years to see the changing of the learning habits of the students if is it recognisable. We can draw the inference on learning habits after analysing the distribution of downloads before the test. The result of the analysing shows the students downloaded the teaching material on the day of test or the previous day. It means these students did not have enough time to read, understand and learn the teaching material before the test and these habits do not have changed in the last five years. The earlier analysing showed the situation is the same in the first semester and the undergraduate mechanical engineering students did not recognise the advantage of the learning earlier before the test. I have found strong correlation between the days before the test and the number of downloads of teaching material. It needs a didactical method to motivate the students to download the teaching material earlier and read it to pass the tests in higher percentage because this learning habit has influence on the results of the successful exams too.	computer science;download	Gábor Kiss	2013	2013 12th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET)	10.1109/ITHET.2013.6671005	engineering education;computer science;electrical engineering;teaching method;multimedia;pedagogy	HCI	-77.87977448047982	-38.58217468657409	97828

Our system lets students collaborate among them in order to construct their knowledge as much as possible and to find solutions of many problems that occur during learning. In this paper, we focus on question and answer (adaptive evaluation: AE) as a collaboration tool for students based on Web technology, because AE has the characteristics that ensures and checks students' comprehension of material without any restriction of time and place. In our system students can act as questioners who ask some questions collaboratively to acquire additional knowledge, or act as respondents who answer questions from other students. Using this environment, the interactive learning of students can be achieved, and also the teacher's load can be decreased.

534a643c3d738e8ae55fa80bbfdeff773fc7087a	a nearest neighbors analysis of student academic performance in computer science (abstract only)	retention;interactive visualization;advising	Students increasingly decide to go to college in order to get better jobs and make more money. However, these advantages are typically thwarted if a student fails to graduate. Although much research has been aimed at predicting college performance using data collected before entering college, this preliminary work focuses on how college-level data could be used to inform student decision making. This work acquired historical class grades, test scores, and degree information for all students who have taken any computer science classes at Appalachian State University. This poster presents a web application that allows users to explore these data by selecting a target activity such as a class, and filtering students based on test scores, degrees, or how they have performed in other classes. The application displays overlaid histograms comparing how students in the subset perform relative to the class as a whole. For example, when a student considers retaking a course they may find it useful to know how other students with similar grades have performed in the major. For example, among the 29 attempts by 22 students with a 'C' in discrete math and CS 1, only 10 earned the required 'C' in CS 2 (35%) and 12 failed the course (41%). Three of these students went on to graduate with a degree in computer science (14%) and six in computer information systems (27%) while five did not graduate from Appalachian (23%).	computer science;content-control software;discrete mathematics;goto;job stream;management information system;money;web application	R.

Our work in this field develops the focuses on the use of the learner traces. When interacting with the platform, every learner leaves his/her traces on the machine. The traces are stored in database, this operation enriches collective past experiences. The traces left by the learner during the learning session evolve dynamically over time; the case-based reasoning must take into account this evolution in an incremental way. In other words, we do not consider each evolution of the traces as a new target, so the use of classical cycle Case Based reasoning in this case is insufficient and inadequate. In order to solve this problem, we propose a dynamic retrieving method based on a complementary similarity measure, named Inverse Longest Common Sub-Sequence (ILCSS). Through monitoring, comparing and analyzing these traces, the system keeps a constant intelligent watch on the platform, and therefore it detects the difficulties hindering progress, and it avoids possible dropping out. The system can support any learning subject. To help and guide the learner, the system is equipped with combined virtual and human tutors.	case-based reasoning;experience;interaction;jade;similarity measure;tracing (software)	Abdelhamid Zouhair;El Mokhtar En-Naimi;Benaissa Amami;Hadhoum Boukachour;Patrick Person;Cyrille Bertelle	2014	IJIMAI	10.9781/ijimai.2014.266	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;communication	Robotics	-79.6787720679769	-47.35043466321083	98162

Attendees to this demonstration session will be introduced to a new web-based version of EarSketch that integrates a code editor, digital audio workstation (DAW) music production interface, curriculum browser, and sharing service into a single integrated browser-based learning environment. This demo is of interest to secondary and early post secondary CS educators and to computing education researchers interested in STEAM and/or broadening participation.

That is why we propose the concept of Observing Strategy. In this paper, we present a concrete observation strategy formalization to illustrate our proposition. We also present two processes: the first one focuses on the specification of executable observation strategies by considering the elements of instructional scenario, the links between pedagogical indicators and observation means and the machine-readable format of all this information. The second one focuses on specifying an observation strategy by the user through the manipulation of dedicated tools.	executable;human-readable medium;pedagogical agent	Mohammed Assam Ouali;Sébastien Iksal;Pierre Laforcade	2014	2014 IEEE 14th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2014.110	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;dashboard	Robotics	-78.15006072290262	-45.32514362531282	98869

The paper focuses on an application example of the framework to a specific lab work related to Low Level Input/Output. Special emphasis is laid on the most complex aspects of such environments. The management framework provides specific tools for dealing with these issues: the management of student work delivery and evaluation results accessibility, automatic or semi-automatic assessment of student work, and detection of lab assignments that are highly suspect of having been copied. Additionally, the lab work framework represents a method through which a closer peer-to-peer or one-to-many communication with students can be attained. The lab work described in the paper is a small project based on a specification document. It is designed to get students to gain an in-depth knowledge of the computer Input/Output subsystem. While the framework has been in use for over 10 years, the specific Input/Output lab work has been managed by the framework tool-chain for the last 6 years, and used by over 2000 students. The lab work management framework is a step towards the feasibility of a closer-to-the-student higher education system, where the main interaction between students and teachers can be based on individual or on small group tutorials. Using the tool-chain, the academic load of teachers in mass course environments can be kept at acceptable levels, making for higher quality education.	input/output	Santiago Rodríguez;Juan Zamorano;Francisco Rosales;Antonio García Dopico;José Luis Pedraza	2007	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2004.12.003	psychology;input/output;educational technology;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;higher education;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-79.15863354255863	-40.1145022208424	99108

These separated systems are mainly based on information and service portals or e-learning environments and have typically independently grown over the years. Information systems in the field of higher education mostly support undergraduate students as well as graduate students during their studies. Apart from this there is no real support for special needs doctoral students demand for during their research work. An information system in the field of doctoral research should allow for collaborative work and should support different kinds of processes doctoral students participate in. Our approach is to develop an integrated information system for collaborative research and doctoral education based on a service oriented architecture (SOA)	information systems;information needs;information system;portals;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture	Stefan Klink;Andreas Oberweis;Daniel Ried;Ralf Trunko	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on e-Business Engineering (ICEBE'06)	10.1109/ICEBE.2006.11	human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;software engineering;information system	DB	-81.93944288683782	-42.4831006545001	99344

At first knowledge about individual learners was used to produce adaptive educational hypermedia. Then, the deployment of web based learning management systems put the need to exchange learner data between systems in the forefront. Nowadays, specifications for describing learner information in a standardized way are being developed. So far most existing systems have processed learner data. Yet the processed data are neither the same nor are they used for the same purposes, even if they are data about the learners. We argue that it is time to bridge the gap between the many sets of data about a learner processed within different learning environments. We propose a set of categories for describing learner information that goes beyond IMS LIP and could bring a link with ITS learner models.	triune continuum paradigm	Lahcen Oubahssi;Monique Grandbastien	2006		10.1007/11774303_29	simulation;systems modeling;language identification in the limit;hypertext;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;management system;database;multimedia	NLP	-79.52749894592823	-49.407471150689084	99556
dffd889cc95805a9efd0fe2a8d86c1e1db470e78	ide-based learning analytics for computing education: a process model, critical review, and research agenda		In recent years, learning process data have become increasingly easy to collect through computer-based learning environments. This has led to increased interest in the field of learning analytics, which is concerned with leveraging learning process data in order to better understand, and ultimately to improve, teaching and learning. In computing education, the logical place to collect learning process data is through integrated development environments (IDEs), where computing students typically spend large amounts of time working on programming assignments. While the primary purpose of IDEs is to support computer programming, they might also be used as a mechanism for delivering learning interventions designed to enhance student learning. The possibility of using IDEs both to collect learning process data, and to strategically intervene in the learning process, suggests an exciting design space for computing education research: that of IDE-based learning analytics. In order to facilitate the systematic exploration of this design space, we present an IDE-based data analytics process model with four primary activities: (1) Collect data, (2) Analyze data, (3) Design intervention, and (4) Deliver intervention. For each activity, we identify key design dimensions and review relevant computing education literature. To provide guidance on designing effective interventions, we describe four relevant learning theories, and consider their implications for design. Based on our review, we present a call-to-action for future research into IDE-based learning analytics.	computer programming;integrated development environment;process modeling;theory	Christopher David Hundhausen;Daniel M.

In this paper an architecture that allows the sharing and retrieving of educational resources is proposed. In contrast to similar past attempts, this is now done without the need of copying or storing metadata in a centralised dataset/repository. Linked Data principles were used for exploring the metadata, while collaborative techniques were used in the systems that take advance of this architecture in order to enhance the end user experience, thereby offering a contemporary way to achieve resource adaptation and personalisation.	centralisation;linked data;personalization;semantic web;user experience	Stathis Th.

Last year, a pilot experience was developed to test this environment for  undergraduate courses in a Computer Engineering degree. The current work describes an e-learning application of the Poliformat platform in an Operating Systems online course and how this experience has been evaluated using survey techniques that analyze  online learning issues and also technical aspects related to the Poliformat platform. Globally, the experience was rather positive although some problems were detected in the evaluation process that  revealed that e-learning methods and tools have to be improved.  	sakai project	Félix Buendía;Antonio Hervás Jorge	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-68262-2_25	educational technology;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data science;experiential learning;operating system;synchronous learning	SE	-79.7028945998447	-41.82812141205424	101542

5c0cb3b385517688d1d9ae3d6644051c6e40a2ae	applications of service oriented architecture for the integration of lms and m-learning applications	service oriented architecture	Mobile learning applications introduce a new degree of ubiquitousness in the learning process. There is a new generation of ICT-powered mobile learning experiences that exist in isolated contexts: experiences limited to small learning communities. These rising mobile learning experiences appear while web-based learning, especially Learning Management Systems, are consolidated and widely adopted by learning institutions, teachers and learners. The innovation techniques breeding in the experimental world of mobile learning need to be translated into the mainstream ecosystems. Mobile learning is not intended to replace elearning or web based learning, but to extend it. So, mobile learning applications need to be integrated somehow in the web-based LMS. To do so is needed to address interoperability issues on both ends: the LMS and the mobile application. Service Oriented Architecture offers a standardized and effective way to achieve interoperability between systems. This paper presents an architecture that allows a two-way interoperability between LMS and Mobile Applications: access LMS contents from the mobile device, and to be able to embed part of the mobile applications inside the LMS framework. This architecture incorporates elements from famous interoperability standards (IMS LTI and OKI) and has been validated with two projects related to the Open Source LMS Moodle.	concurrency control;cooperative breeding;ecosystem;experience;information systems;interoperability;linear algebra;management system;mobile app;mobile device;requirement;service-oriented architecture;universal product code;web application;webist	María José Casany Guerrero;Miguel Ángel Conde González;Marc Alier Forment;Francisco J.

However, currently available text books on the market are either very broad or highly specialized, making it hard to select appropriate books for specific software engineering courses. Moreover, due to the rapidly changing subject of software engineering, books tend to become obsolete, which make students hesitate to buy books even if they are part of the listed course literature. In this paper, we briefly explain and discuss an approach of using a web-based system for creating collaborative and peer-reviewed text books that can be customized individually for specific courses.

Pedagogical research results suggest that the use of active learning within a cooperative environment is the best way to obtain these skills. In this context, the use of the Internet for these educational purposes-a concept known as electronic learning-can eliminate the physical barriers to cooperative learning. However, the implementation of such an electronic learning environment is often attempted using ad-hoc strategies that considerably limit its final impact and applicability. This work demonstrates how to design cooperative learning activities on the Internet by using basic principles derived from contemporary pedagogical research results. These activities were successfully applied in the context of forums repeated twice in two years in an artificial neural networks laboratory belonging to an engineering program.	artificial neural network;hoc (programming language);programming paradigm	Sergio Bermejo	2005	IEEE Transactions on Education	10.1109/TE.2004.837045	robot learning;collaborative learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;the internet;simulation;index term;blended learning;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;instructional simulation;student engagement;learning sciences;teaching and learning center;multimedia;active learning;open learning;synchronous learning;artificial neural network	HCI	-80.2344264984306	-42.61426231846296	103828

The WATA system is a follow-on system, which applies the Triple-A Model (assembling, administering, and appraising). Its functions include (1) an engine for teachers to administer and manage testing, (2) an engine for students to apply tests, and (3) an engine for generating test results and analyses for teachers. Two studies were undertaken to assess the usefulness and potential benefits of the WATA system for teacher education. In the first study, 47 in-service teachers were asked to assess the functions of the WATA system. The results indicated that they were satisfied with the Triple-A Model of the WATA system. In the second study, 30 pre-service teachers were required to use the WATA system during the teacher-training program. After 4 months of experience in using the WATA system, the preservice teachers’ perspectives of assessment have been changed significantly. The findings of these two studies might provide some guidance to help those who are interested in the development of Web-based assessment and intend to infuse information technology into teacher education.	world wide web	Tzu-Hua Wang;Kuo-Hua Wang;Wei-Lung Wang;Shih-Chieh Huang;Sherry Y.

Being attacked by an attacker is not an option. They need to be creative and they may need to think like an attacker. That is why learning the art of penetration testing is crucial in education level. The basic fortress of security is to protect a network with firewall. To possess knowledge in security, early exposure must be nurtured from undergraduate level to ease the development of knowledge and learning process. Current scholars who are studying in security field seldom have the opportunity to exercise hands-on activity in class due to time constraint and lack of infrastructure in an educational organization. To support the initiative of providing exposure among the scholars and to overcome the aforementioned problems, an approach to develop a portable penetration testing and firewall configuration toolkit has been proposed as a learning aid for the students to perform simulation on conducting penetration testing and configuring firewall for beginners. From the proposed toolkit, scholars are able to execute basic penetration testing, network monitoring, port scanning, firewall configuration, and web and filtering at anywhere and anytime. By having this proposed toolkit, the teaching and learning process will be much easier, efficient and time saving compared to conventional methods of teaching. As a conclusion, the proposed plug-and-play toolkit implements benefit user in terms of time saving, early exposure and facilitate teaching and learning session effectively.	anytime algorithm;firewall (computing);fortress;hdmi;hands-on computing;penetration test;plug and play;port scanner;simulation;small form factor	Herny Ramadhani Mohd Husny Hamid;Megat Ahmad Izzat bin Megat Ahmad Kamil;Norhaiza Ya Abdullah	2015	2015 Fourth International Conference on Cyber Security, Cyber Warfare, and Digital Forensic (CyberSec)	10.1109/CyberSec.2015.26	application firewall;simulation;engineering;security testing;world wide web;computer security	SE	-87.22094058310547	-41.93219601712824	104686

For this we have developed the knowledge bases, with which we offer our students an effective education support system for economics word math problems. Solving a word math problem is nothing more or less than conducting a process of deductive reasoning to find the unknown of the problem. To construct the deductive reasoning process is to collect missing pieces of information from the knowledge bases, to bridge between the given data and the unknown of the problem. To promote students’ use of the formula and theory knowledge bases in our educational support system, we have visualized the reasoning processes as a solution plan graph and collected these charts to make a content center for teaching materials. The paper shows that a solution plan graph can play a role of a good user interface for accessing the knowledge bases. We illustrate a solution plan graph and its annotation technology for constructing the solution plan graph.

Specifically, our aim will be direct to theoretical learning models for Virtual Scientific Experiments to be implemented inside the platforms. Therefore, the result to be achieved comes from the interaction of two different “macro-environments”: the pedagogical-didactical world and the informatics world. The first one puts in evidence the methodological aspects and the fundamental importance of the didactical transposition (Chevallard, 1985, 1994; Cornu, Vergnioux, 1992) in order to structure in the best way the experiments foreseen by experts of the discipline. The second one, instead, will have the task of structuring and realizing the suitable virtual learning environments and the various phases of single experiments, taking into account the methodological indications arisen by the pedagogical world. Thus in the next future, our aim will be based on these considerations to obtain motivating Virtual Scientific Experiments effectively usable by the learner, allowing the dissemination of scientific knowledge through the Internet.	experiment;informatics;pedagogical agent;transposition table		2003				AI	-79.00220248639147	-44.386169613357005	105687

WBI has become popular in that it overcomes time and space limitation in traditional educational systems. But due to lack of face-to-face communication, it is crucial that WBI provide interactivity and motivation for students. This paper introduces a formal model that evaluates interactivity and motivation for courses based on WBI. The model is comprehensive and objective so that it can be used to evaluate any course. Based on the model, the paper selects some WBI courses and compares them for their interactivity and motivation.

Combining the features of the cloud, we have identified a learning flow based on Kolb team learning experience, executed by cloud-hosting learning management systems in conjunction with our newly designed system, 'Teamwork as a Service (TaaS)'. Each of TaaS's five web services aims to organize a certain type of learning activities, providing learners with an introduction, a 'jigsaw classroom', schedule planning, and mutual supervision during the whole collaborative learning process. In particular, enabling a rational group mechanism realized by the simulated annealing method, TaaS is able to allocate learners to their appropriate tasks in order to give their best performance. We also introduce details of the implementation of TaaS over the Amazon cloud.	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);amazon web services;mobile cloud computing;simulated annealing;web service	Geng Sun;Jun Shen	2013		10.1007/978-3-662-46315-4_11	teamwork;cloud computing;performance;computer science;operating system;mobile technology	AI	-79.27843085089654	-43.563248908304146	106302

We consider a second language MULL environment as a personalised, collaborative, situated and lifelong environment. The computational models for our proposal of MULL environments are addressed based on the idea that mobile learning objects are the basic elements for the representation of contents in the domain of second language learning. These models are a personalised model, a collaborative model and an interaction model. The models include a belief representation and management component for learner modelling and a content object reference model that inherits from SCORM a subset of the metadata categories, and extends it with two top level metadata categories.	computation;computational model;natural language processing	Gerardo Ayala;Rosa G.

Many research projects are conducted that investigate combinations of knowledge and skills that students might learn. Yet, it is also promising to analyze what students might fail to learn, which provides information about the absence of certain competencies. For this purpose, we are evaluating the outcomes of automatic assessment tools that provide automatic feedback to the participating students. In particular, we analyzed the errors of the students that participated in an introductory programming course. The 604 students participating in the course had to solve six tasks during the semester, resulting in a total of 12274 submissions. The error analysis is done by evaluating the data from the automatic assessment tool JACK, which provides automatic feedback on programming tasks. To derive information about prospective competencies, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the different errors the students made in their solutions. The results provide interesting insights into missing competencies. In further research our findings have to be validated by investigating the cognitive processes involved during programming.	big data;error analysis (mathematics);error message;feedback;jack audio connection kit;prospective search	Marc Berges;Michael Striewe;Philipp Shah;Michael Goedicke;Peter Hubwieser	2016	2016 International Conference on Learning and Teaching in Computing and Engineering (LaTICE)	10.1109/LaTiCE.2016.6	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia	HCI	-79.24627433273753	-39.689022491553274	106833

An authentic object-oriented model derives meaning from associations, not only attributes. Unfortunately, authentic object-oriented modeling is not employed early, if employed at all, perhaps because of limited language support for associations. The proposed curriculum and tool bring authentic object-oriented modeling and implementation to the front of the curriculum, often the first experience. By completion of the curricular unit, the student will have developed sophisticated applications with graphical user interfaces, and will come to value, be motivated toward, and have a context in which to place, subsequent object-oriented topics in a curriculum.	computer science;graphical user interface	Duane Buck;Ira Diethelm	2013		10.1145/2462476.2466532	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;programming language;world wide web;pedagogy	PL	-82.65205026630395	-38.37567082786336	107453

The intelligence of these systems is the ability to adapt to each student throughout his/her learning process. This paper presents an intelligent tutoring system, called EduTutor, created for the web-based Aulanet learning management system LMS.The system architecture and its main characteristics are described in detail. EduTutor focuses on subjects for the first cycle of studies of the Portuguese primary education system, between the first and the fourth year. Its purpose is to facilitate the perception of the learning process of each student, individually, in a virtual environment, and as a study guide. Furthermore, this intelligent tutor system was designed and its architecture was prepared for being easily integrated in higher levels of studies, different subjects, and different languages. EduTutor was validated with a large set of real cases and is being used, with success, in the Aulanet LMS platform.	management system	Joel Jos&#x00E9; P. C. Rodrigues;Pedro F. N.

After reviewing the currently predominant programming paradigms adopted in introductory programming courses and describing our approach based on decades of teaching practice, we present our recent experience in changing the first programming language from Modula-2 to Java. The question we focus on is whether there are any significant differences in student success between the most recent generation taught in Java, and previous Modula-2 generations. Statistical analysis of collected scores and grades can provide insight into the effects of the change of language since there were not many other factors distinguishing the generations. Comparisons involving two non-parametric statistical tests showed that there are no statistically significant differences between the considered generations with respect to success in passing the exam. This result suggests that the choice of the introductory programming language does not matter if we use students' performance as the criterion of suitability.	java;modula-2;programming language;programming paradigm	Mirjana Ivanovic;Zoran Budimac;Milos Radovanovic;Milos Savic	2015		10.1145/2812428.2812448	computer science;programming language	PL	-81.35518492332147	-38.57358465477644	107923

The University of Rijeka uses MudRi e-learning system, which is based on the Moodle open source software. This paper focuses on the Programming course, for which data over several years are available. The data can be interpreted and valuable knowledge can be obtained and used for improving the quality of lectures, as well as making the lectures more suitable for students based on the actions and material deemed the most popular. Since the MudRi database contains many facts that might affect each other (e.g. homework might affect the final grade), association rule mining, which discovers regularities in data, is the most suitable data mining method. Apriori algorithm for the discovery of association rules is used for finding connections between various actions and final grades. Many interesting rules and information are discovered, which lead to conclusions on actions that seem to be in relation with the course success.	affinity analysis;apriori algorithm;association rule learning;data mining;information;open-source software	M.

The target group of the learning platform is students of Higher Education Institutions in Greece. The purpose of this work is to use technology as a way to create an environment in which students can learn by doing, receiving feedback, continually refining their understanding and building knowledge. The learning environment is interactive and supports collaborative experiences. Evaluation constitutes a key element of the entire work, as a means to investigate, provide evidence and make judgements about the tool’s effectiveness and benefits. A series of features characterizing the learning platform have been considered in order to assess its function and potential usability. The scores achieved showed that the platform’s design and structure were quite satisfactory and indicated its potential use as a good learning tool for the distribution of knowledge in the field of remote sensing. 643 Copyright © 2010, IGI Global.

Constructive learning goes beyond learning by receiving knowledge, to learning by building systems, with immediate, visual feedback. Collaborative learning encourages students to interact with instructors and librarians, via both live links and remote-controlled """"show me"""" sessions or by reviewing a multimedia FAQ of recorded """"show me"""" sessions. Inquiry-based learning guides the student into pursuing exploratory research in a community of students and scholars. A reference librarian persona will suggest research topics, then help extract content from both traditional library resources as well as dynamically mined material, answer typical questions and help construct annotated bibliographies, reviews and research proposals. The framework will be an integrated, multi-track model, allowing students to select content according to their background, interests and course requirements. Within this general framework, we plan to develop content for three courses in the Computer Science curriculum, ranging from Introduction to Computing (CS1) at the freshman level to Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE) at the graduate level. We have gathered baseline evaluation data for the CSI and OOSE courses that is currently under analysis."""	baseline (configuration management);bibliographic index;computer science;librarian;mined;multimedia framework;remote control;requirement;software engineering	Glenn D.

EvoGrader’s web portal is powered by Amazon’s Elastic Cloud and run with LightSIDE Lab’s open-source machine-learning tools. The EvoGrader web portal allows biology instructors to upload a response file (.csv) containing unlimited numbers of evolutionary explanations written in response to 86 different ACORNS (Assessing COntextual Reasoning about Natural Selection) instrument items. The system automatically analyzes the responses and provides detailed information about the scientific and naive concepts contained within each student’s response, as well as overall student (and sample) reasoning model types. Graphs and visual models provided by EvoGrader summarize class-level responses; downloadable files of raw scores (in .csv format) are also provided for more detailed analyses. Although the computational machinery that EvoGrader employs is complex, using the system is easy. Users only need to know how to use spreadsheets to organize student responses, upload files to the web, and use a web browser. A series of experiments using new samples of 2,200 written evolutionary explanations demonstrate that EvoGrader scores are comparable to those of trained human raters, although EvoGrader scoring takes 99% less time and is free. EvoGrader will be of interest to biology instructors teaching large classes who seek to emphasize scientific practices such as generating scientific explanations, and to teach crosscutting ideas such as evolution and natural selection. The software architecture of EvoGrader is described as it may serve as a template for developing machine-learning portals for other core concepts within biology and across other disciplines.	experiment;machine learning;need to know;open-source software;portals;software architecture;spreadsheet;upload	Kayhan Moharreri;Minsu Ha;Ross H.

This system provides the total environment to enable automatic advice provision in real time, proper guidance by a teacher based on understanding of specific circumstances. We initially propose a mechanism for presenting the details of discussions to teachers so that they can easily understand each situation during an exercise. Our system records detailed conversations during discussions by each student group until the group's decision-making is completed. The system then presents the recorded conversations to teachers in an easily understandable manner. Moreover, our system is equipped with functions for commenting, question-and-answer sessions. These functions enable teachers to provide real-time guidance through careful monitoring of the exercise situations. Next, we carefully analyzed actual discussion data. On the basis of this analysis, we constructed a case-base for automatically generating advice, designed a way to present this advice to students. This paper also describes the development of a prototype system based on the above methods. The features of our system are discussed based on a practical experiment.	advice (programming);experiment;prototype;real-time computing;real-time web;simulation	Rumiko Kurita;Morigen Darai;Motoo Kusano;Masamitu Kiuchi;Cha Su Aie	2016	2016 Intl IEEE Conferences on Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced and Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing and Communications, Cloud and Big Data Computing, Internet of People, and Smart World Congress (UIC/ATC/ScalCom/CBDCom/IoP/SmartWorld)	10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP-SmartWorld.2016.0087	embedded system;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;speech;artificial intelligence;multimedia;computational model;computer security	Web+IR	-78.60501140048638	-44.78021029851622	109042

Personalized learning requires adaptive learning schemes since the student status and conditions inside an institution constantly change. In this paper, we present the EDUC8 (EDUCATE) system, which aims at providing a new approach concerning real-time personalization and adaptation of learning business processes. The EDUC8 system consists of a learning process execution engine supported by a semantic framework, which is based on an ontology enclosing the knowledge and the information and provides decisions and recommendations for the next steps of the learning process. Moreover, the results of the rule-set execution may create new objects that will be stored in the ontology as new knowledge1.	apache axis;business process;business rules engine;gene regulatory network;information technology architecture;learning pathway;personalization;real-time locating system;requirement;semantic web rule language;software development;software system;stress testing (software);usability	Omiros Iatrellis;Achilles Kameas;Panos Fitsilis	2017		10.1145/3139367.3139404	personalization;business process;world wide web;data mining;semantic web;ontology;adaptive learning;computer science;student status;information technology;personalized learning	AI	-80.20810815652757	-46.05536874300262	109632

Research efforts in the computer aided education field are represented by a broad spectrum of applications, from the virtual classroom to remote courses. In these environments, visualising the progress of students in a certain course is an important part of the learning process. At the Universidad Politecnica de Valencia we are experimenting with WWW based software tools and networks for computer aided learning. This research process has resulted in the development of a teacher’s authoring tool and an evaluation applications both developed using Java and based on Internet browsers. With this evaluation tool, teachers can easily create questions of different types – which are stored on a database. These questions can later be used to compose different exams or exercises for different students depending on the course and the objective of the examinations. The advantages include an improvement in the fulfillment of the teacher’s dutiess an increase in the responsiveness of the exam results to the level of student understandings and the potential for using the application in distance learning and training.	digital signature;e-commerce	C.

Introducing competition between students can enhance their motivation, but it can also generate negative emotions. This paper presents an empirical study of students in a telecommunications engineering degree; it measured their level of motivation, and their emotions about competition in education in general, and in particular about ISCARE (the Information System for Competition based on pRoblem solving in Education). ISCARE makes adaptive matches, pairing students who share a similar knowledge level. The study results show that students had moderate levels of motivation, and experienced no negative emotions while using ISCARE. Under certain circumstances, therefore, competition in education, using technology systems that provide competition, can produce motivation without generating negative emotions. Female students and students with low ISCARE scores were less motivated and experienced more negative emotions. In addition, motivation and emotions toward ISCARE were more positive than they had been toward competition in general.	electrical engineering;experience;information system;knowledge level;nist hash function competition;problem solving	Pedro J.

A role describes some stereotypic use of variables, and only ten roles are needed to cover 99% of all variables in novice-level programs. This paper presents the results from a protocol analysis of a program creation task in an experiment where roles were introduced to novices learning Pascal programming. Students were divided into three groups that were instructed differently: in the traditional way with no treatment of roles in lectures or program animation; using roles in lectures but not in animation; and using a role-based program animator in addition to using roles in lectures. The results suggest that the introduction of roles provides novices a new conceptual framework for better mental processing of program information and that the use of role-based program animation increases novices' ability to apply data-related programming plans in program construction.	expert system;mind;pascal;program animation	Pauli Byckling;Jorma Sajaniemi	2006		10.1145/1121341.1121470	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;software engineering;conceptual framework;multimedia;protocol analysis	AI	-82.17969819457424	-38.96902359137169	110251

Group A (GA) students were admitted in the years 2000-2005. Group B (GB) students were admitted in the years 2006-2011. The two groups differed in terms of their program-related admission and completion requirements, curriculum design and curriculum contents. Cumulative data until the academic year 2012-13 was analyzed. The total intake for GA was 2% more than that for GB. The student retention was 46% for GA and 71% for GB. This is a significant improvement in the retention of students for GB over GA. Further, from those students who aborted their programs, 53% of the total attrition for GA and 79% for GB occurred in the first year of admission. These patterns showed similarities when analyzed for the sub-group of women students only. The analysis suggests that the retention of undergraduate engineering students could be influenced by admission and program completion requirements as well as curriculum design and contents. Further, first year students require more attention.	attrition (website);electrical engineering;requirement;software release life cycle	A. Imran;M. Nasor;F.

The activity consisted in the creation of a wiki to collect errors made by students while they were coding programs in C language. The activity was framed in a collaborative learning strategy in which all the students had to collaborate and be responsible for the final result, but also in a competitive learning strategy, in which the groups had to compete to make original meaningful contributions to the wiki. The use of a wiki for learning computer programming was very satisfactory. A wiki allows to monitor con- tinuously the work of the students, who become publishers and evaluators of contents rather than mere consumers of information, in an active learning approach.	computer programming;wiki	David González Ortega;Francisco Javier Díaz Pernas;Mario Martínez-Zarzuela;Miriam Antón-Rodríguez;José Fernando Díez Higuera;Daniel Boto-Giralda;Isabel de la Torre Díez	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16318-0_41	collaborative learning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multimedia;active learning;competitive learning;world wide web;pedagogy	Theory	-78.61269017960821	-42.92915917585476	111933

In the same time the platforms used to deliver these courses are still in their fledgling stages. While course content and didactics of those massive courses are the primary key factors for the success of courses, still a smart platform may increase or decrease the learners experience and his learning outcome. The paper at hand proposes the usage of an A/B testing framework that is able to be used within an micro-service architecture to validate hypotheses about how learners use the platform and to enable data-driven decisions about new features and settings. To evaluate this framework three new features (Onboarding Tour, Reminder Mails and a Pinboard Digest) have been identified based on a user survey.

Educational material in hypermedia formed in a Web-based educational system makes learning a task-driven process, motivating learners to explore alternative navigational paths through the domain knowledge and from different resources around the globe. Many researchers have focused on developing e-learning systems with personalized learning mechanisms to assist on-line Web-based learning and to adaptively provide learning paths. Although most personalized systems consider learner preferences, interests and browsing behaviors when providing personalized curriculum sequencing services, these systems usually neglect to consider whether learner ability and the difficulty level of the recommended curriculums are matched to each other. Therefore, the authors proposed approach is based on an integer program IP to optimize user curriculum accompanying with fuzzy logic approach which analyze the effective criteria by linguistic variables in a knowledge based system. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is shown by numerical illustrations which are inferenced from the designed user interface.

As a lecturer, regular updates of contents for on-going courses are really important because contents should reflect the learners' attributes as well as for corrections and additions of contents. Although this kind of dynamics is preferred for actual situation, differential updates of contents suitable for distributed LMSs are not implemented on popular open source LMS, Moodle. This paper introduces the dynamic synchronization between distributed Moodle systems and reports the synchronization results between Moodle 2.0 series systems. The proposed method has been implemented on Moodle for versions 2.0 series up to 2.3 as the extension of the previously proposed method developed for Moodle 1.9.	bandlimiting;open-source software;synchronization (computer science)	Tsuyoshi Usagawa;Masahiro Yamaguchi;Yoshifumi Chisaki;Royyana Muslim Ijtihadie;Achmad Affandi	2013	2013 12th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET)	10.1109/ITHET.2013.6671058	synchronization;developing country;content management;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;multimedia;public domain software;world wide web	DB	-81.1251372612576	-42.62386192164388	113361

MOOCs support participants to be actively involved in collaborative learning and construct their own learning experience in a variety of domains. However, one of the biggest challenges facing MOOCs is how to assess the learners’ performance in a massive learning environment beyond traditional automated assessment methods. To address this challenge, peer assessment has been proposed as an effective assessment method in MOOCs. The problem is, however, how to ensure the quality of the peer assessment in terms of validity and reliability. Moreover, assessment in blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) introduces unique challenges regarding the best peer assessment model in a learning environment that brings together face-to-face interactions and online activities. This paper presents the details of a study conducted to investigate peer assessment in bMOOCs. The study results show that flexible rubrics have the potential to make the feedback process more accurate, credible, transparent, valid, and reliable, thus ensuring the quality of the peer assessment task.	blended threat;feedback;interaction;massive open online course;peer-to-peer	Ahmed Mohamed Fahmy Yousef;Usman Wahid;Mohamed Amine Chatti;Ulrik Schroeder;Marold Wosnitza	2015		10.5220/0005495501480159	collaborative learning;public records;rubric;knowledge management;multimedia;peer assessment;world wide web;pedagogy	HCI	-77.4858436863331	-42.390361724814575	114497

During the establishment of this work an attempt was made to manage the extracted information using mining techniques. These methods took place in order to get groups of students with similar characteristics. The application of classification, clustering and association rules mining algorithms on the data stored on the e-learning (Moodle system) database allowed to extract knowledges that help to understand students’ behaviors and patterns. Additionally, the development of a Web application for the educators is a tool to monitor their students learning behavior by monitoring the number of assignments taken, the number of quizzes taken, the number of forum post and read by students, etc. The knowledge obtained can help the instructors to make decision about their students’ interacting with the courses activities in Moodle system, and to create an efficient educational environment. In this research, a Data Mining tool called RapidMiner was used for mining the data from the Moodle system database, and a web application written in PHP was established to aid teachers with statistics.

Although most of them gather usage statistics, these are rarely used to improve the quality of education. In this paper, a data analysis methodology is proposed. This methodology facilitates a continuous improvement of the LMS, and includes an inferential analysis which relates usage statistics to educational innovation and quality. This makes it possible to predict the effect of strategic decisions on the different variables considered, assisting on decision making.	inferential programming;linear algebra	Paloma Moreno-Clari;Miguel Arevalillo-Herráez;Vicente Cerverón-Lleó	2009	IEEE-RITA		simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	AI	-85.825268466571	-43.29923062101064	114667

This paper describes a study which was first part of the Bologna Experts Team-Spain project and then developed as an independent study. It was carried out with the overall goal to gain experience in the assessment of learning outcomes. More specifically it aimed at 1) designing procedures for the assessment of learning outcomes related to these compulsory generic competences; 2) testing some basic psychometric features that an assessment device with some consequences for the subjects being evaluated needs to prove; 3) testing different procedures of standard setting, and 4) using assessment results as orienting feedback to students and their tutors. The process of development of tests to carry out the assessment of learning outcomes is described as well as some basic features regarding their reliability and validity. First conclusions on the comparison of the results achieved at two academic levels are also presented.	problem solving;tree accumulation	Carmen Vizcarro Guarch;Pilar Martín Espinosa;Ruth Cobos Pérez;Jorge E.

A study was conducted in the Schools of Medicine of Rennes and Rouen (France) with third-year medical students.   METHODS The """"PBL-in-MI"""" sessions included a first tutorial group meeting, then personal work, followed by a second tutorial group meeting. A problem that simulated practice and was focused on information technology was discussed. In Rouen, the students were familiar with PBL, and they enrolled on a voluntary basis, while in Rennes, the students were first-ever participants in PBL courses, and the program was mandatory. One hundred and seventy-seven students participated in the PBL-in-MI sessions and were given a questionnaire in order to evaluate qualitatively the sessions.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The response rate was 92.1%. The overall opinion of the students was good. 69.8% responded positively to the program. In Rouen, where the students participated in PBL-in-MI sessions on a voluntary basis, the students were significantly more enthusiastic about PBL-in-MI. Moreover, attitudes and opinions of students are plausibly related to differences in previous PBL skills. The fact that the naïve group had two tutors, one trained and one naïve as the students, has been investigated. Teacher naivety was an explanatory factor for the differences between Rennes and Rouen."""	arabic numeral 100;attitude;informatics (discipline);mandatory - hl7definedroseproperty;medical informatics;naivety;school;schools, medical;explanation	Anita Burgun-Parenthoine;Stéfan Jacques Darmoni;Franck Le Duff;Jacques Wéber	2006	International journal of medical informatics	10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.07.014	education;medical education;the internet;medicine;nursing;law	HCI	-78.18337501246948	-40.78092677194608	115016

In this article is described an adopted solution for managing a robotic appliance meant for e-learning and e-commerce application, the Robo-eLC. The designed tutoring interface constitutes a learning interface for nonexperts that need to re-design and control the robotic behaviors. By constructing the robotic learning elements, the non-experts acquire, step by step, a deep understanding of ICT means and e-learning contents, becoming in a short period experts of the learning systems they have to manage. The robot, capable of incentivizing customers' interaction via its multimodal interface, can help them in making thoughtful money operations (i.e. donations for chanty activities in the test cases of the ongoing research).	computer appliance;e-commerce;multimodal interaction;robot;test case	Gaetano La Russa;Viacheslav Shirikov;Erkki Sutinen	2005	Fifth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT'05)	10.1109/ICALT.2005.3	e-commerce;robot;robot learning;simulation;human–computer interaction;content management;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;robotic paradigms;database;multimedia;multidisciplinary approach;user interface;world wide web	Robotics	-80.93576635507168	-44.469644966103836	115211

Qualities provide the n-dimensions of this collaborative filter. Qualities and resources are generated collaboratively by the users of the system. CoFIND is designed to allow evolution to occur, which is discussed in the context of Darwinian theory and includes reference to current theories relating to the development of complex systems. The paper goes on to describe the implementation of the system and the results of an early pilot experiment involving a group of 42 students. It is concluded that, despite encouraging early results, some further work is needed to develop an effective interface and to embody the kind of complex interactions needed to generate spontaneous evolution.

This paper is based our Internet-based e-learning teaching experience which comes from one of the leading e-learning university, the University of Southern Queensland. The Internet-based e-learning system can effectively reach the expected achievement through a well-designed workflow mechanism. The whole e-learning environment is made of four sub-workflow systems, teaching, learning, administration and technology support. Through well-designed four sub-workflow systems, all key activities are identified from these sub-workflow systems.

Web-based educational systems collect vast amounts of data on user patterns, and data mining methods can be applied to these databases to discover interesting associations between student attributes, problem attributes, and solution strategies. In this paper, we propose a framework for the discovery of interesting association rules within a Web-based educational system. A hybrid measure of subjective and objective measure for rule interestingness is proposed which is called contrasting rules. Contrasting association rule is one in which a conjunction of attributes is compared for complementary subsections of a data set. We provide a new algorithm for mining contrasting rules that can improve these systems for both teachers and students - allowing for greater learner improvement and more effective evaluation of the learning process. A larger advantage of developing this approach is its wide application in any other data mining application.	association rule learning	Behrouz Minaei-Bidgoli;Gerd Kortemeyer;William F.

The problem aggravates when the student is learning in a virtual environment with no face-to-face interaction with the instructor. In this case, simulators or intelligent tutoring systems, such as Veril UOC [1], are used in order to acquire this skill. This paper describes several improvements introduced in the instructor view of this framework Veril UOC. The new information that can be extracted of the system can improve the personalized feedback that the instructor can perform to the students, and, at the same time, the real-time information gives insights related to the course's operation.	algorithm design;computation;computer science;digital electronics;electronic engineering;massive open online course;overhead (computing);personalization;programming language;real-time data;simulation;systems design;virtual reality	David Bañeres	2015	2015 Ninth International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems	10.1109/CISIS.2015.20	simulation;computer science;multimedia;computer engineering	Robotics	-82.0340212144336	-40.46815471353746	118297

While more and more learning resources are accessible via a mobile device, there is a challenge in providing access to appropriate personalized learning resources. This paper describes the PALLAS system which enables real life language learning scenarios by providing personalized and contextualized access to learning resources via a mobile device. The support provided to the learner includes tasks that are personalized and contextualized and tasks that are set by the teacher. Access to learning resources through integration with a Content Management System is also provided. An evaluation framework for mobile language learning systems and an evaluation of the system by three language teachers are included. The main contribution of this work is personalized and contextualized learning resources, where the resources are composed of a variety of sources. Some of the topics addressed in this paper focussed on personalization appears in (Petersen & Markiewicz, 2008).	cognitive walkthrough;content management system;julius petersen;microsoft windows;mobile device;mobile operating system;multidimensional sampling;pallas;personalization;prototype;real life;situated;usability;windows mobile	Sobah Abbas Petersen;Jan-Kristian Markiewicz;Sondre Skaug Bjørnebekk	2009	Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning	10.1142/S1793206809000635	robot learning;proactive learning;cooperative learning;personalized learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;blended learning;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;evaluation;personalization;multimedia;active learning;communication;world wide web;open learning;synchronous learning;pedagogy	HCI	-80.28601820053822	-45.34085333627365	118662

Experiments have been conducted in a UK school with a year cohort of students aged 13-14 and in a Mexican university with a cohort of novice computer scientists. In the school about a third of subjects appeared to use an algorithmic model, which we find surprisingly many; in the university there were around half in the same category, which is in line with university results in the UK. Operation of the online test and the analysis tool is described. Interviews with subjects in the school revealed some ways in which the algorithmic classification may be expanded. End-of-course results are not yet available for the test subjects, so statistical associations have not yet been explored.	algorithm;align (company);computer scientist;experiment;interviews;mental model;programmer;statistical classification;trinity	Richard Bornat;Saeed Dehnadi;David Barton	2012			computer science	SE	-81.02991501240705	-38.85992804519401	118773

Furthermore, the decision will become more complicated when various instructors hold conflicting views on the relationship among the involved concepts that may hinder any reasonable deduction. Therefore, we propose in this paper a complete system framework that can perform an explicit semantic analysis on the course materials, possibly aided by the relevant Wiki articles for any missing information about the involved concepts, to formulate the individual concepts, and followed by a heuristic-based concept clustering algorithm to group relevant concepts before finding their relationship measures. Lastly, an evolutionary optimizer will be used to return the optimal learning sequence after considering multiple experts' recommended learning sequences possibly containing conflicting views. To demonstrate the feasibility of our prototype, we implemented a prototype of the proposed e-learning system framework. Our empirical evaluation clearly revealed the possible advantages of our proposal with many possible directions for future investigation.	cluster analysis;evolutionary algorithm;explicit semantic analysis;heuristic;mathematical optimization;natural deduction;prototype;requirement;wiki	Vincent W.

Traditional testing techniques aren't fully adequate to examination administration in higher education contexts, as they generally require choosing the answer just in a narrow set of options. Adaptive testing permits an evaluation more suitable for the examinee but it is affected by limits related to the uniformity of the exams, to the range/width of the subjects and to the large amount of items to be inserted in the question databases. e-Xamina is a prototype of assessment platform aimed at combining the features of these two main kinds of CBA. e-Xamina model suggests a new performance based exam pattern and a score criterion based on standard examination practice. Finally, e-Xamina multi-user feature allows the teachers to cooperate in managing course database, with many different levels of competence and rights.	circuit complexity;database;management system;multi-user;prototype	Maria Rosaria Del Sorbo;Walter Balzano	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Technology for Education	10.1109/T4E.2011.47	simulation;computer science;multimedia;computer engineering	DB	-78.91249148144841	-44.10352073164248	118905

Ubiquitous learning is characterized by providing intuitive ways for identifying right learning collaborators, right learning contents and right learning services in the right place at the right time. Our context aware ubiquitous learning environment consists of three systems, namely peer-to-peer content access and adaptation system, personalized annotation management system, and multimedia real-time group discussion system. Since the effectiveness and efficiency of ubiquitous learning heavily relies on learners’ surrounding context, in this paper, we will address a context model and context acquisition mechanism for collecting contextual information at run time. We have built a context aware ubiquitous learning environment and in this paper we will address how this newly designed environment can fully support the needs of peer-to-peer collaborative learning.	interoperability;peer-to-peer;personalization;pervasive informatics;real-time transcription;run time (program lifecycle phase);seamless3d	Stephen J.

But achieving transfer among students in classrooms has proven to be quite difficult. Transfer is intimately linked to making connections analogically. Such analogical reasoning involves a variety of steps (Gentner, 1998; Kolodner, 1993) including retrieval, mapping, evaluation, re-representation, and application. Helping learners get to the point where they can transfer something learned in one situation to another is aided by helping students practice transferring (Bransford, Brown & Cocking, 1999). This paper addresses the application part of the transfer process. For novice problem solvers, application of what’s been learned can be a difficult task. Following the suggestions case-based reasoning reasoning (Hammond, 1989; Kolodner, 1993; Schank, 1982, 1999) makes about case application, we aid learners at that task by providing support as they attempt to apply an expert solution to their own challenge. We do it in t he context of a project-based inquiry approach to science education called Learning By Design (LBD ) (Kolodner et al., 1998; Hmelo et al., 2000). LBD builds on case-based reasoning and constructivist approaches to learning as well as classroom practices from problem-based learning (Barrows, 1985; Koschmann et al., 1993/4) and communities of learners (Campione et al., 1998), to support both collaborative learning and learning from hands-on activities. The software component to LBD, SMILE (Supportive Multi-User Interactive Learning Environment) (Nagel & Kolodner, 1999), was designed to promote the kinds of reflection that case-based reasoning suggests are needed to learn from experience. The first version of SMILE contained a Case Authoring Tool, whose role was to scaffold student’s reading of an expert case. But that tool did not complete the task of helping students apply what they learned from a case to their challenge. We report here on a new suite of tools that has been added to SMILE called the Case Application Suite (CAS). It supports three stages in using an old case to solve a new problem: case interpretation, case application, and solution assessment. It builds on the Case Authoring Tool as well as the experiences we‘ve had with the SMILE’s Design Discussion Area (Kolodner & Nagel, 1999). Here, we examine CAS with a focus on the ways it scaffolds case application and promotes collaboration.	case-based reasoning;component-based software engineering;hands-on computing;interactivity;multi-user;non-convexity (economics);rule 184	JaKita N.

As an example, we describe the consequences produced by a blood vessel endothelial dysfunction in a video. Our objective with this material is the assimilation of clinical knowledge quickly and effectively, encouraging active learning. The satisfaction survey revealed an excellent acceptance by students who highlighted the quality, content and length of the audiovisual teaching material presented. There is no doubt that the use of audiovisual material in university teaching, in addition to theoretical and practical classes, entails a new teaching style that promotes the teaching and learning process.	adobe flash player;adobe photoshop;audacity;autodesk maya;commercial software;data assimilation;debugging;image editing;plasma cleaning	Laura Cardeñosa Tejedor;Juan A.

This paper provides a overview-detail-context visual analytics system to solve this problem. First, users can overview all the data about course with a density display. Second, a bubble set map is provided to observe details about a student. Last, a context viewer like musical notation is built to help educators making some judgements for a student or for an exercise. After being used by educational experts, this visual analytics system can help educators to discovery many key problems in course. Addressing these problems could improve educational efficiency greatly.	site map;visual analytics	Xin Li;Xuehui Zhang;Xin Liu	2015	2015 9th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing	10.1109/IMIS.2015.10	analytics;visual analytics;big data;human–computer interaction;interactive visual analysis;computer science;data science;data mining;multimedia;cultural analytics;software analytics;semantic analytics	DB	-84.65657985611179	-45.3763573297306	120484

Students in the control group were asked to identify their demographic information before taking the test whereas students in the experimental group were asked to do so after completing the test. So, the control group was indirectly reminded of stereotypes before taking the test, when it could affect performance on the test, whereas the experimental group was reminded after the test when it could not affect test performance.  Tests on two different loops were used, along with a partial cross-over design: a random group of students served as the control group on one test, and the experimental group on the other and vice versa. Mixed factor ANOVA analysis of the data showed that all the students scored significantly higher when not reminded of stereotypes before the test regardless of sex or race. In addition, average/below-average students scored significantly higher when not reminded of stereotypes before the test, again, regardless of sex or race. So, on harder topics in Computer Science, stereotype threat affects all the students, and in particular, the less-prepared students. In light of this, some suggestions are offered for avoiding stereotype threat during tests.	computer science;experiment;stereotype (uml)	Amruth N.

Prior research has shown that spatial abilities can be trained; that's why in this work we propose several kinds of short duration trainings aimed to improve those abilities. We have established a ranking based on the improvement rate that the student may reach knowing his starting level before undertaking training. These trainings take place before starting the academic course so students don't receive theoretical or practical contents of Graphic Engineering during the week. Before training and after its completion, the level of spatial ability is measured through validated tools for this aim. We perform a statistical analysis obtaining the gains from higher to lower levels of spatial skills acquired through each training (videogame/ augmented reality/ sketching/ descriptive geometry). With data from all training, the curves have been set up by least squares (linear, exponential, algorithm, potential and polynomial). The most suitable predictive model for all cases is the linear one.	algorithm;augmented reality;computer engineering;least squares;linear model;polynomial;predictive modelling;time complexity	Jorge Martín-Gutiérrez;Manuel Contero	2012	2012 Frontiers in Education Conference Proceedings	10.1109/FIE.2012.6462349	mathematics education;simulation;computer science;multimedia	ML	-80.36575568736497	-39.338102908673285	120606

The common approach is based on domain analysis by experts, who characterize each content with skills involved and a difficulty level. In addition, Machine Learning based sequencers require a specific dataset collection to create users’ models and a sequencing policy, which needs to be tested online with strong ethical requirements and a high number of users. In this paper we design a simulated learning environment with customizable scenarios. We also show that a performance prediction method can be used to crate offline fully personalized students’ models and sequence contents without domain engineering/authoring effort. The performance prediction method is enhanced by a score-based policy inspired by Vygotsky’s concept of Zone of Proximal Development and shows promising results compared to curriculum based policies in the designed simulated environment.	domain analysis;domain engineering;feedback;hoare logic;machine learning;microsequencer;online and offline;performance prediction;personalization;requirement;simulation;virtual private server;virtual reality	Carlotta Schatten;Ruth Janning;Lars Schmidt-Thieme	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-25768-6_3	combinatorics;pure mathematics;mathematics	ML	-77.97664496927516	-42.71814560874442	121321

However, it is not clear which approach for on-line learning  individual or collaborative  is more effective for the students. This paper addresses a proposal to combine both approaches, taking in account that some advantages related to individual learning, such as self-pacing and establishment of learning goals by the learner, imply in difficulties to establish collaborative settings. This proposal is based upon the dynamic creation and management of study groups of distributed learners sharing on-line material. A model is proposed to set collaboration profiles that would enable to identify potential collaborators, and an agent-based infrastructure is presented to support this model in an on-line learning environment. Finally, an example of use of this infrastructure is presented using CALM, a learning environment developed on top of the Web architecture.	agent-based model;computer;online and offline;online machine learning	Carlos José M.

The project starts with the assumption that the faculty teaching with online labs and the faculty or academic departments that provide those labs are acting in two roles with different goals and concerns. The iLab architecture focuses on fast platform-independent lab development, scalable access for students, and efficient management for lab providers while preserving the autonomy of the faculty actually teaching the students. Over the past two years, the iLab architecture has been adopted by an increasing number of partner universities in Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and the United States. The iLab project has demonstrated that online laboratory use can scale to thousands of students dispersed on several continents.	confluence;consortium;distributed computing;ilabs;internet;middleware;proceedings of the ieee;scalability;web service	V.

Additionally, it can also be hard to figure out how the performance of one team member affects the performance of another. In this paper, we present a data-driven method for automatically discovering patterns in successful team members' character attribute development in team games. We first represent team members' character attribute development using time series of informative attributes. We then find the thresholds to separate fast and slow attribute growth rates using clustering and linear regression. We create a set of categorical attribute growth rates by comparing against the thresholds. If the growth rate is greater than the threshold it is categorized as fast growth rate; if the growth rate is less than the threshold it is categorized as slow growth rate. After obtaining the set of categorical attribute growth rates, we build a decision tree on the set. Finally, we characterize the patterns of team success in terms of rules which describe team members' character attribute growth rates. We present an evaluation of our methodology on three real games: DotA,1 Warcraft III,2 and Starcraft II.3 A standard machine-learning-style evaluation of the experimental results shows the discovered patterns are highly related to successful team strategies and achieve an average 86% prediction accuracy when testing on new game logs.	categorization;cluster analysis;decision tree model;information;knowledge engineering;knowledge-based systems;machine learning;starcraft;time series;world of warcraft	Pu Yang;David L.

Rather than offering the same contents for all students, we provide personalized contents according to the students' background and learning objectives. Although curriculum personalization can be faced in several ways, we focus on artificial intelligence (AI) planning as a very useful formalism for mapping actions, i.e. learning contents, in terms of preconditions (precedence relationships) and causal effects to find plans, i.e. learning paths that best fit the needs of each student. A key feature is that the learning path is generated and shown in Moodle in a seamless way for both the teacher and student, respectively. We also include some experimental results to demonstrate the scalability and viability of our approach. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This knowledge can be used to inform decisions related to course and tool design and pedagogy, and to further engage students and guide those at risk of failure. This working group report provides an overview of the body of knowledge regarding the use of educational data mining and learning analytics focused on the teaching and learning of programming. In a literature survey on mining students' programming processes for 2005-2015, we observe a significant increase in work related to the field. However, the majority of the studies focus on simplistic metric analysis and are conducted within a single institution and a single course. This indicates the existence of further avenues of research and a critical need for validation and replication to better understand the various contributing factors and the reasons why certain results occur. We introduce a novel taxonomy to analyse replicating studies and discuss the importance of replicating and reproducing previous work. We describe what is the state of the art in collecting and sharing programming data. To better understand the challenges involved in replicating or reproducing existing studies, we report our experiences from three case studies using programming data. Finally, we present a discussion of future directions for the education and research community.	bluej;capability maturity model;categorization;compiler;computer programming;computer science;data validation;debugging;divergence (computer science);educational data mining;error message;experience;item unique identification;item response theory;iterative method;java;literal (mathematical logic);massive open online course;parsing;pattern recognition;pointer (computer programming);problem solving;programmer;programming language;python;rewriting;semiconductor industry;simulation;small private online course;software developer;software development;software metric;software testing;sorting algorithm;source lines of code;syntax error;taxonomy (general);test-driven development;tracing (software)	Petri Ihantola;Arto Vihavainen;Alireza Ahadi;Matthew Butler;Jürgen Börstler;Stephen H.

On many occasions, instructors cannot devote sufficient energy nor time to develop more interesting flash or animations for their subjects. In this paper, we proposed a scenario building and execution tool that supports the learning and application of knowledge harnessing and sharing techniques for knowledge management subjects. This system takes a Web 2.0 approach which ultimately not only instructors but learners can also contribute to scenario building and executions.	error detection and correction;html;interaction;knowledge management;management system;portable document format;scenario analysis;usability;web 2.0	Teresa B.

With the development of E-Learning systems and the passing of time, courses and learning resources will update, develop, and change inevitably. Because, in a discipline, the knowledge body can be divided into a series of knowledge points, so we proposed and designed a discipline oriented common knowledge ontology base (KOB) to organize and store all the knowledge points and their relations in a discipline. On the basis of KOB, we proposed a knowledge point based course developing model and a learning object metadata model. Through KOB, the knowledge points can be reused in different courses, so to improve the efficiency in courses developing, course contents authoring and contents updating. Furthermore, when a new learning object is registered to an E-Learning system or a learning object updated, through knowledge points mapping between courses and learning objects, it will be automatically reflected in according courses that have the same knowledge points with the learning object. So, on the basis of KOB, the work of courses developing and learning resources management becomes easier and flexible.

424b0d99d71c803992f470e852994ffe1ef5003d	open educational resources platform based on collective intelligence		Open Educational Resources (OER) are educational resources openly available to be used by educators and students and are an important tool to support education. A considerable effort has been made to build repositories that allow the sharing and reuse of these OERs. However, many of these repositories offer unsatisfactory search engines, resulting in a frustrating experience for users. The problem of content search is partly explained by the lack of appropriate metadata on resources and the lack of ranking mechanisms, for instance based on user interaction over the educational objects. In this paper, we present the Plataforma Integrada do MEC (MEC's Integrated Platform), a novel Digital Educational Resources platform, which employs concepts of social networks to create a collective intelligence system to improve and refine search results. Platform users are able to evaluate the available resources and also publish new ones. A ranking is associated with these users and it is used to determine the relevance of their actions on the platform. High ranking users can publish new content that will be considered relevant in the platform, eliminating the need for resources to be evaluated by an expert. Unlike other repositories, where authorization must be given for content publication, on this platform the user has the opportunity to actively contribute with new content. A prototype of this platform was developed, and made available as free software. Preliminary results indicate viability of the proposal and that the system opens a path to effective knowledge diffusion.	authorization;collective intelligence;prototype;relevance;serial digital video out;social network;web search engine	Marcela Ribeiro de Oliveira;Israel Barreto Sant'Anna;Guilherme Scariot Ramos;Luis Carlos Erpen De Bona;Marcos A.

This paper therefore presents a controlled evaluation of this effect, conducted within the framework of self-determination theory. Students were tasked with removing redundant recursion in a multiple recursive algorithm. The experimental group (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${N}\,\,{=} \,\, 19$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) used the SRec program visualization system, while the control group (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${N}\,\, {=} \,\, 17$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) could use any programming tool in which they were proficient, such as BlueJ or Eclipse. The increase in motivation was measured by the difference between student scores in pre- and post-tests of their motivation. Statistically significant increases were observed for the two more determined forms of motivation, intrinsic motivation (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${p}\,\, {=} \,\, 0.01$ </tex-math></inline-formula>), and extrinsic motivation via identified regulation (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">${p}\,\, {=} \,\, 0.03$ </tex-math></inline-formula>). Student feedback about their subjective acceptance of SRec reinforced these results. These findings give experimental support to expectations for software visualization in terms of motivation. Several paths for future work are identified, in particular, the need for more experiments under various conditions to achieve deeper understanding of the motivational effect of program visualization."""	bluej;eclipse;experiment;java;programming tool;recursion (computer science);srec (file format);scientific visualization;self-replicating machine;semiconductor industry;software visualization;super-recursive algorithm	J. &#x00C1;ngel Vel&#x00E1;zquez-Iturbide;Isidoro Hern&#x00E1;n-Losada;Maximiliano Paredes-Velasco	2017	IEEE Transactions on Education	10.1109/TE.2017.2648781	discrete mathematics;data visualization;computer science;software visualization;computer engineering;recursion;visualization;theoretical computer science;recursion (computer science);srec	Visualization	-81.80560417808852	-38.06499816637386	124569
4350ba3ff22bb6becf0afc4563c336e34a5f1112	enabling educators to design serious games - a serious game logic and structure modeling language		Serious games are applications combining educational content with gameplay by integrating learning objectives into a game-like environment to keep up the player's motivation to continue playing, and hence learning. This characteristic is highly sought after in educational contexts, making serious games a big asset for didactics [1]. Offering new learning contents through a game not only induces higher motivation, employing serious games can also yield higher learning success than presenting material in a classical, non-computer based, way [2]. Only few people having the proper didactical background to tailor the learning objectives to the students' need also have the programming knowledge and game design skills allowing them to develop didactically and technically sound serious games [3, 4]. In this paper, we argue for an approach to enable didactical experts, i.e. educators, to develop serious games adapted to their own learning content. To address this problem we develop a tool allowing educators to visually design their serious games, which is based on model driven development techniques that allow the generation of software from visual models. We describe the first step towards this tool, the development of the underlying domain specific modeling language DSML.	modeling language	Niroshan Thillainathan;Holger Hoffmann;Eike M.

This study examines the value of analogies when used to introduce three introductory computing topics. The value of these analogies may be evident during the teaching process itself (short term), in subsequent exams (long term), or in students' ability to apply their understanding to related non-technical areas (transfer). Comparing results between an experimental group (analogy) and control group (no analogy), we find potential value for analogies in short term learning. However, no solid evidence was found to support analogies as valuable for students in the long term or for knowledge transfer.

Students use online course for a variety of reasons. However, their usage, as recapped in log, is worthy of further investigation. This article proposes an XML Web log data model to represent Web server log files in online courses. The implementation of the XML Web log data model and how it is used to reflect student usage are discussed. Using XML and its related technologies such as XSLT to represent and process log data is a flexible and extensible method to visualize and compare student usage. Student would be able to recap and compare his/her usage with others and improve in using the online courses.	blog;data logger;data model;refinement (computing);server (computing);server log;web application;web server;xml;xslt	Kai-On Chow;Alan Y.

Usually, these kind of lightweight ontologies are adopted in knowledge-based educational environments to enable semantic organization and search of resources and, in other cases, to support personalization and adaptation features for learning and teaching experiences. For this reason, applying effective management methodologies for Subject Ontologies is a crucial aspect in engineering the environments. In particular, this paper proposes an approach to use SKOS (a Semantic Web-based vocabulary providing a standard way to represent knowledge organization systems) for modelling subject ontologies. Moreover, the paper underlines the main benefits of SKOS. It focuses on alternative strategies for storing and accessing ontologies in order to support the knowledge sharing, knowledge reusing, planning, assessment, customization and adaptation processes related to learning scenarios. The results of an early experimentation allowed the authors defining a framework able to support, from both methodological and technological viewpoints, the use of Subject Ontologies in the context of a Semantic Web-based Educational System. The defined framework has high performances in terms of response and this may really improve the user experience. We defined a framework to use Subject Ontologies in Educational Systems.Subject Ontologies support learning scenarios by representing themes to treat.SKOS is a good technical approach to improve the learning experience of users.We identified a good strategy to treat Subject Ontologies and support SWBESs.The described approach may improve the performance of the learning processes.	experience;ontology (information science);simple knowledge organization system	Sergio Miranda;Francesco Orciuoli;Demetrios G.

The design of LeMill has tackled numerous challenges that hinder the authoring and sharing of educational resources by communities of teachers. This paper describes the research-based design process that was used to solve these challenges. The information architecture of LeMill scaffolds authors toward collaboration and sharing. The licensing scheme encourages reusing and remixing of educational content. In order to make LeMill easy to learn and use we have avoided technical terminology and complicated metadata forms in the user interface. As an open community we have also tackled multicultural and multilingual issues. In this paper, we present the information architecture and design of LeMill, including the technical solutions. We believe that our design solutions will contribute to the goal of creating an open educational resource ecosystem.	ecosystem;information architecture;jargon;user interface	Teemu Leinonen;Jukka Purma;Hans Poldoja;Tarmo Toikkanen	2010	IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies	10.1109/TLT.2010.2	human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;user interface;world wide web;pedagogy;social network	HCI	-82.9415306722466	-43.20633591482282	126209

Current challenges for research and development in this field concern, for example, the design of comprehensive data models for adaptive systems as well as the interoperability of systems and the reusability of learning material across different systems. In the present work we introduce an ontology model, basically developed in the context of immersive digital games, which attempts to provide a solution to existing problems in resource description. On the one hand, comprehensive data models for adaptive systems are supported by separating static information from adaptive systems as far as possible. On the other hand, the ontology model offers a potential solution to precise and, above all, learner-centered resource description by separating latent competencies from observable performance (in learning objects or test items).	adaptive system;data model;experience;interoperability;observable;personalization	Michael D.

It focuses on the proposal of processes, methods and tools that assist teachers and trainers, acting as educational designers, in the reuse and the capitalization of educational scenarios. The objective of the proposed approach named CAPtuRe (Context-based APproach to assist educational scenarios Reuse) is to model, evaluate and exploit the contextual information related to a scenario based on its effective observations and its assessment during past learning experiences with the aim to enhance reuse.

Indeed, there is a long list of ITSs that have been tested on humans and have proven to facilitate learning, among which we may find the well-tested and known tutors of algebra, geometry, and computer languages. These ITSs use a variety of computational paradigms, as production systems, Bayesian networks, schematemplates, theorem proving, and explanatory reasoning. The next generation of ITSs are expected to go one step further by adopting not only more intelligent interfaces but will focus on integration. This article will describe some particularities of a tutoring system that we are developing to simulate conversational dialogue in the area of Medicine, that enables the integration of highly heterogeneous sources of information into a coherent knowledge base, either from the tutor’s point of view or the development of the discipline in itself, i.e. the system’s content is created automatically by the physicians as their daily work goes on. This will encourage students to articulate lengthier answers that exhibit deep reasoning, rather than to deliver straight tips of shallow knowledge. The goal is to take advantage of the normal functioning of the health care units to build on the fly a knowledge base of cases and data for teaching and research purposes.	artificial intelligence;automated theorem proving;bayesian network;coherence (physics);computer language;knowledge base;multi-agent system;on the fly;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Victor Alves;José Neves;Luís Nelas;Filipe M.

We also present a description of three telematic educational applications based on the framework. These applications are currently being used in a real class environment and are allowing us to validate both the design and the usefulness of the framework.	social constructivism	César A.

But this is not always enough, as this route needs to be executed in a real learning management system where some discrepancies (between the real and expected situation) may appear. In this paper we focus on the generation of these routes from a planning perspective, but also on the monitoring and execution of the routes and, in case of significant discrepancies, provide a planning approach for adapting the route —rather than generating a new one from scratch. We demonstrate that this approach is very valuable to maximise the stability of the learning process, and also for the performance and quality of the learning routes.

Such transfer is in general difficult to achieve. Based on a model of IT use learning, two types of diagrams in documentation were compared in a field study; instructions showing the sequence of how to carry out an operation by means of screen shots and structural models showing data structures without user interface elements. Instructions were in general favoured. Even if the instructions only to a small extent were presented with projector during training, the trainees stated that they learnt a lot from these presentations. The learning outcome might have been the existence of an operation and where in the software to locate it. While primarily intended as help for understanding data structures, the trainees also used structural models as guides for carrying out operations. Instructions in particular, but also structural models were utilised by the trainees after the training sessions, hence helping transfer. Trainers should include both types of models in courses.	data structure;diagram;field research;screenshot;software documentation;user interface;video projector	Jens Kaasbøll	2014		10.1145/2618168.2618177	simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;conceptual model;machine learning;competence;database;multimedia;software documentation;management;world wide web	HCI	-78.74798693821153	-46.747943034535695	128420

The use of well-designed computer tools by its members can help increase its adaptability. The purpose of Adaptive Collaboration (AC) is to obtain the optimal group performance, e.g., the maximum sum of the individual performances of group members in their positions for a concerned period of time. AC is a natural extension of Role-Based Collaboration (RBC). Our early model E-CARGO (Environments - Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects) of RBC can become a fundamental model for AC. This paper points out the key issues facing AC researchers, analyzes the key factors related with adaptability, clarifies the AC process, and outlines some preliminary yet promising solutions to some issues.	performance;role-based collaboration	Haibin Zhu;Mengchu Zhou	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5641911	process performance index;simulation;human–computer interaction;computer science;knowledge management;software agent;role;computational model;collaboration	Robotics	-90.44767507266016	-38.187503644368206	129675

The use of electronic mail allows use of the Internet as a transport medium. A protocol has been devised for a loosely coupled, distributed, Computer Mediated Education system using electronic mail to transport course material (encapsulated as objects) from one workstation to another. Each workstation uses an object-oriented environment with the ability to dynamically incorporate new courseware objects at run time.

However, most of the accessibility standards and guidelines that have been proposed have been developed by adopting a domain independent and often ‘technical’ perspective. Such proposals are therefore often not sufficient to achieve accessibility goals in specific application areas such as eLearning. This paper presents a boosting approach/framework toward the development of more effective and usable accessibility indications for authors of didactic content, which are currently being fed and tested within the Italian context of the VICE project. This approach is intended to take into account the aforementioned issue and to make a step forward with respect to existing accessibility proposals and approaches in the eLearning domain. In particular, we discuss our design method for increasing the quality of eLearning materials for learners with special needs and an authoring tool, aLearning, to support eLearning content authors in their development of didactic material matching those needs.	accessibility;expect;refinement (computing);requirement;usability	Silvia Gabrielli;Valeria Mirabella;Stephen Kimani;Tiziana Catarci	2006	Educational Technology & Society		computer science;knowledge management;pedagogy;boosting (machine learning);the internet;usable;web accessibility;special needs	HCI	-82.99554406805694	-44.39200876880331	130652

A six cell design was used to control for gender and for three levels of prior achievement within a random sample of 36 students for each simulation. Pre and post-tests were administered. The results showed a significant, consistent cognitive gain for the physical simulation a surrogate exploration of how eIectricity is made in a power station. Results for the procedural and process simulations revealed a more complex and varied pattern of interaction between type of simulation and student characteristics which can be linked to specific design features. Background to the study Interactive multimedia technology is widely seen as having the potential to transform much traditional instruction and to realise, in courseware design, many of the tenets derived from learning theories. However, empirical studies to test the claims have been rare, and many of those which have been carried out have fallen foul of the cogent criticisms of the ‘comparative’ design in which a new medium is compared inappropriately with earlier technologies (Clark, 1983; Yildiz and Atkins, 1993). This study aimed to avoid the criticisms and produce results on the cognitive effectiveness of a particular example of multimedia courseware interactive video (IV) science simulations in relation to pupils prior achievement in science and their gender. There has been some research into IV simulations in education contexts. For example, Doulton (cited in Hosie, 1987) evaluated the use of IV in secondary school science lessons in the US by comparing normal classroom experiments with IV simulated experiments. Results indicated that when IV was integrated effectively, improved standards of laboratory work were evident as was a greater range of exploration by the The cognitive impact of multimedia simulations on 14 year old students 107 more talented students. An added bonus was the time saved in comparison with setting up normal experiments. In the tertiary sector Laurillard (1984) evaluated an IV disc on materials manufacture, known anecdotally as the Teddy Bears disc, developed for the UK Open University. She reported that the most educationally successful forms of interaction were information testing, hypothesis framing, and simulation. Smith, Jones, and Waugh (1986) designed and evaluated IV laboratory simulations for a general chemistry course which were largely tutorial in nature. The lessons were evaluated as pre laboratory instruction and as laboratory replacement for 47 students in a group of 103 students enrolled in a general chemistry course. It was found that student performance on laboratory reports and test scores was significantly better for students who used the videodisc for instruction as compared to those who did not. Most of these studies, and others like them, have however adopted the disputed media comparative approach and surprisingly few have controlled for the variables such as prior achievement and gender which are known to affect educational performance. There has been very little discussion of results in relation to the underlying learning theories implicit or explicit in the IV simulation studied, or to curriculum planning and instructional context of use. There has sometimes also been a confounding of the technology ‘platform’ with the specific courseware evaluated (Yildiz and Atkins, 1993). Accordingly, this investigation was designed to answer the following questions: was there a significant difference in the cognitive gain achieved with different types of multimedia simulation? To what extent was cognitive gain influenced by gender, by prior achievement or by the interaction of the two? Given the nature of these questions a design with multivariate analysis (MANOVA) supplemented by tests of Effect Size (ES) offered the most appropriate approach. The present investigation The IV Discs At the time of the study there were a number of Interactive Video packages available to schools. One package, on energy, contained three different types of simulation according to the Alessi and Trollip (1 98 5) classification, namely: physical, procedural, and process simulations. This categorisation is related directly to different types of mental processing and is particularly useful in studies of conceptual learning. A physical simulation requires the learner to construct a mental model of how a system functions based on causal relationships between entities that form part of that system. Free discovery or guided discovery methods may be embedded in this type of simulation. A procedural simulation is one designed to train the user to perform certain tasks in a systematic way, correcting anomalies, mistakes, or disturbances which may arise. Feedback on errors made, and the opportunity to repeat procedures many times, are characteristic features of this type of simulation. A process simulation tries to help the student to understand the progression of a dynamic system. Normally 108 British JournaI of Educational Technology Vol27 No 2 1996 it is run several times with different initial values for the parameters. Although the three simulations chosen had not been developed to teach exactly the same scientific topic, they were all related to the concept of energy, were part of the same learning package, and were targeted on the same age group (ie. 14 years). The simulation that was considered to fit the general characteristics of a physical simulation was called DRAX. It was designed to improve pupils’ understanding of how electricity is made in power stations by enabling them to obtain a surrogate experience of what a coal fired power station is like, what happens in each of the main buildings, and the process by which electricity is made. The moving and still pictures had been shot at DRAX power station, one of the largest in the UK. Users could take either an aerial tour of the site in a helicopter, or a walking tour on the ground. In each tour the pupils were invited to enter buildings they saw, pan round the building through sets of stills, and access text-based information about what was happening. In some buildings they could also examine a computer graphic which simulated the function of the building, and conduct on-screen experiments which linked what they were seeing in the power station to the relevant laboratory experiments performed in physics lessons in school. The buildings and machinery included the coal train depot, coal pulverisers and grinders, boilers, turbine hall, transformers, cooling towers and control room. A set of archive photographs and supporting text gave a short history of electricity generation in the UK and could be accessed from the opening menu bar. There was also an interactive game which used computer generated graphics and was designed to reinforce understanding of the sequence of energy transformations involved in the production of electricity. The simulation considered to contain the characteristics of a procedural simulation was called FLOWERS. Its objective was to illustrate the probabilistic nature of experimental results and to teach students scientific investigation methods. It included a wide range of statistical tools which could be called up as required by the user and were intended to improve students’ skills in constructing and interpreting graphs. Users were placed in the situation of conducting an experiment in growing flowers in which they had control over four key inter-related variables that affect growth: nitrogen, temperature, potash, and length of daylight. A11 other factors were held constant. The disc contained a series of photographs taken 3 times a week for twelve weeks (from which accurate on-screen measurements could be taken) of a tray of seedlings for each possible regime of treatment. Disc users could therefore see exactly what effect on plant growth their particular decisions about the four variables had had. They could alter the amount of any of the variables while holding the others constant, or vary two or more of the variables, etc., on repeat experiments, making and testing predictions as they went. Finally, the simulation that was considered to fit the characteristics of a process simulation was called LAB. Its objective was to enable students to understand the relationships between gravity, speed, height, time, etc., The LAB was a ‘room’ of on-screen experiments relating to energy. The experiment chosen for this study was The cognitive impact of multimedia simulations on 74 year old students 109 the Ticker Tape dynamics single trolley and double trolley. The single trolley experiments were carried out by measuring velocity as the trolley moved down an inclined plane. Users were able to measure the ‘steepness’ of the plane, the acceleration due to gravity along the plane, the force acting on the trolley, and the coefficient of friction. On-screen tools allowed the users to measure distance, time and velocity in several different ways. The two trolley experiment allowed users to set up, observe and measure the effects on momentum and kinetic energy of elastic and inelastic collisions. Schools and student sample Two schools, both in the North East of England, took part in the study. School A was a suburban coeducational comprehensive school. It catered for 108 9 students aged between 11 and 16 years. School B was an urban coeducational comprehensive school. It catered for 1207 students aged between 13 and 18 years. The public examination results at 16 + of the two schools were close to the national average as reported in school performance tables. Both schools met the national average for numbers of computers (85) as reported by the Department for Education, and there was no particular novelty for the students in learning from a computer-based application.

Unfortunately, they have not been used in depth with collaboration. We have developed a scalable data mining method, whose objective is to infer information on the collaboration during the collaboration process in a domain-independent way and to improve collaboration process management and learning in an open collaborative educational web environment. Thus, we used statistical indicators of learner’s interactions in forums as the data source and a clustering algorithm to classify the data according to learner’s collaboration. We showed the information on learner’s collaboration to the tutor and learners to help them with collaboration process management. The experimental results support this method.	algorithm;cluster analysis;data mining;interaction;open collaboration;scalability	Antonio R.

The present study aimed to validate the utilisation of online-based exercises for teaching to medical students. For this study, Socrative, a free online platform was used in teaching a physiology component of a second year module. Students’ performance and evaluation of this approach was investigated with regard to participation in the class, understanding of the concepts and performance in the final exam. The performance of the class in multiple choice questions (MCQs) related to Socrative daily activities at the end of module and final exams was greater by some 24% (P < 0.05) compared to performance in questions with no Socrative background exercise. Moreover, the exam performance of students in 2016 after the introduction of Socrative was higher by 14% (P > 0.05) compared to a previous year, 2014 where no Socrative activities were used. The students’ feedback regarding the utilisation of online-based exercises showed ~85% of respondents think that these activities were either ‘very important’ or ‘important’ to enhance their participation in the class and ~88% indicated that it is either ‘very useful’ or ‘useful’ to consolidate their understanding of this module’s material. The findings from this study indicate that the use of online-based exercises through Socrative was positively received by medical students as an interactive classroom activity that also enhanced performance.	emergence;final exam	Mohammed Hadi Abdulla	2018	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-018-9752-0	knowledge management;multiple choice;computer science;continuous assessment;physiology;activities of daily living;ease of access	HCI	-77.82839973433497	-40.92233911371974	131689

Moreover, when it is supported it is only used to improve the quality of results returned by search engines in LOR (learning object repositories) and LMS (Learning Management Systems). Within the framework of APOGE project, we want to demonstrate the usability of semantic metadata, when they are provided, during the authoring phase to assist authors to improve the consistency of new designed learning objects. The added value of our approach is maximized in the case of SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) like learning objects’ authoring. Indeed, when we have learning objects designed by reuse of existing ones there is risks to have weaknesses mainly due to a bad understanding of the true nature of the reused objects. To overcome those risks we have defined an automated authoring assistance approach. In this paper we put the emphasis on two semantic based methods used in our approach: semantic consistency checking and learning object’s semantic space analysis.	management system;quality of results;reference model;usability;web search engine	Ramzi Farhat;Bruno Defude;Mohamed Jemni	2010	2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2010.52	semantic grid;computer science;artificial intelligence;database;semantics;world wide web;information retrieval;search engine	Robotics	-83.70029362957024	-45.15483365192502	132855

9eb05b4ad3c415e2c7628e0ed7f0f8155086bc37	the pedagogical model of sial: an adaptive and open-ended intelligent tutoring system for first order logic		This paper describes the Pedagogical Model of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for learning Computational Logic: SIAL. This ITS teaches classical refutation by resolution concepts. SIAL is a Model-Based System as its Domain Model is an Automated Theorem Prover (ATP) for First Order Logic (FOL). This allows SIAL to perform an accurate error diagnosis process while, at the same time, accepting several equivalent valid solutions to the same problem. This feature adds a general open-ended solution capability to SIAL which facilitates the adaptation to the students' way of thinking and allows them to explore and take their own decisions (and make their own mistakes). The Pedagogical Model of SIAL takes advantage of the error diagnosis capabilities of the Domain Model to offer a learner-adaptive tutorial action, according to the user cognitive profile. An example of the knowledge involved in the assessment of the next tutorial action based on the student model, and how SIAL adapts its behaviour to the student's assessed cognitive capabilities, is included. Some data obtained after a period of use of SIAL is also presented.	algorithm;automated theorem proving;computational logic;domain model;expert system;first-order logic;high-level programming language;nonlinear gameplay;personalization;reinforcement learning;resolution (logic);spatial variability;unification (computer science)	José Alberto Maestro-Prieto;María Arancha Simón Hurtado	2018		10.1145/3197091.3197100	knowledge management;computer science;computational logic;domain model;first-order logic;sial;theoretical computer science;automated theorem proving;intelligent tutoring system;cognition	AI	-78.25936850479755	-46.80341022747669	132921

E-Business Application in higher education has already become an indispensable tool in both university staff and students’ daily life. A number of technological, educational and business models of e-Business application in higher education have been developed. However, the educational models of e-Business application in higher education mostly focus on blended learning, thereby they lack the blended educational process that comprises blended teaching, peer-learning and learning. These one-sided educational models do not contribute to the qualitative blended educational process for the improvement of students’ learning achievements. Aim of the present paper is to work out the educational model of e-Business application in higher education underpinning analysis of quality of the institutionalized blended educational process for the improvement of students’ learning achievements. The meaning of the key concepts e-Business application and blended learning is studied. Moreover, the logical chain of analysis is shown: e-Business → blended learning → a model of the blended educational process → empirical study within a multicultural environment. The results of the present research show that students’ learning achievements after having been implemented the blended educational process have been enhanced.

This paper proposes a model that captures M-learning non-functional requirements from three dimensions: pedagogical and educational, social and cultural, and business and economical. This model allows the assessment of the quality of M-learning applications. Four different M-learning applications Edmodo, Schoology, Moodle and Blackboard have therefore been used to discuss the model.

Due to the fact that nowadays there is an unmanageable universe of apps for mobile devices with education purposes, it is essential to establish criteria in order to select a proper one. Furthermore, a repository to compile apps and classify them is also needed so as to find apps with ease. Regarding the first need, the criteria required for a good educational app, a rubric to evaluate one type of app, is offered. This rubric was validated by experts judgments, to meet the minimum requirements of reliability and validity.

Useful data sets can often be obtained from faculty members in other departments on campus. Faculty members in other departments are likely to use other approaches (such as logistic regression) when analyzing their data, and some will welcome having a student try an entirely different approach to gain insight into the problem. The students, in turn, are able to see their computer science talents as useful relative to questions in another discipline. Another reason the course is attractive is that a teacher can give students the opportunity to use and modify large software systems. Several machine learning systems are available for downloading, for example, Students can be exposed to a culture where data sets and code are shared and can be expected to become oriented to a large system and make changes or extensions to a specific part of such a system. An undergraduate course in machine learning can be offered to a wide range of students, with minimal prerequisites, for example, to students who have completed a data structures course. Not even an artificial intelligence course need be a prerequisite; however, key topics such as search, heuristics, and representation must be introduced.

It is used, for example, in search engines, computer games, adaptive user interfaces, personalized assistants, Web bots, and scientific applications. However, few colleges and universities require a course in machine learning as part of an undergraduate major in computer science. It is time for us as computer science educators to recast an introduction to machine learning concepts as a staple of a computer science education.

The paper combines the course with experience, creatively develops an E-Learning system based on web, and puts the basic theories of E-Learning and technical development into practice synthetically. This paper practices this brand new mode, through the development of E-Learning instructional system, and along with the teaching experience.	theory	Huandong Chen;Chunhui Song;Shulei Wu;Haihua Xing;ZhanJi Gui;Xianchuan Yu;Ye Luo	2008	2008 International Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering	10.1109/CSSE.2008.317	the internet;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;modular programming;database;multimedia;server	SE	-81.38500394227876	-42.794957398363735	134842

These unsupervised methods are focused on the dissemination of the educational material and the evaluation of the users through tests and activities. The user behavior is not monitored and the performance of users cannot be reasoned in most cases. We strongly believe that the monitoring and analysis of the users’ behavior in a distance course may help on improving the course plan and the quality of the reading material. In this direction we define the framework for an unsupervised educational process that combines reading material and examinations and monitors the user performance throughout the educational process. We detail on how this framework can be implemented using web technologies, thus creating a web-based educational application. We additionally define the methodology and tools that can be employed for monitoring and processing users’ data.	internet;teaching method;unsupervised learning;web application	Iraklis Varlamis;Ioannis Apostolakis;Marianthi Karatza	2005		10.1007/11581116_13	web service;the internet;simulation;data processing;computer science;teaching method;multimedia;law;world wide web;information system;dissemination	HCI	-78.68382966385973	-49.669566363718594	134997

In this paper we consider the class of automated tests in which a driver tool simulates the input and responses of a human operator and sequentially checks the output generated by the application software. The driver tool commonly employs its own language to describe the tasks it can be required to perform, for example:• Issue a sequence of characters that simulate input from the keyboard.• Verify that a segment of the display buffer contains the expected bit pattern.Although these tasks are simply stated, the language to effect them in a test script can become complex and hard to maintain. Furthermore, reading the driver tool program is not an effective way to confirm that the test script performs its tasks to the test specification.XML (eXtensible Markup Language)[1)] scripts offer a rigorous intermediate description that can be readily translated into both the driver tool test script and a readable statement of the task the test performs. The advantages accruing from the use of XML are:• The XML scripts are easy to edit, simplifying basic script maintenance. New steps can be included for testing bug fixes.• Content review becomes much easier, as the relevant aspects of the script can be rendered in a readily readable form, such as HTML;• Global changes become feasible, as the structured nature of XML documents makes it possible to search for specific element content;• The structure of the XML document can itself be checked, for example using a validating editor such as Xeena [2)].In the next section we describe an example of automated testing using a driver tool, based on XML scripts. The application being tested is called Wired for Learning [3)] and provides the IT infrastructure for schools to:• Enhance communication between teachers, students and parents.• Enable teachers to plan and share ideas for lessons and activities, linking in with national standards.• Organize team projects involving teachers and students across classes and schools, with the option of inviting members of the community to provide additional information.• Provide an events calendar to keep everyone up to date with what is happening in the school.• Allow teachers easily to create their own home pages for information dissemination.	authentication;fault coverage;functional testing;human-readable medium;simulation;software testing;test automation;test script;xml	Colin Bird;Andrew Sermon	2001	ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes	10.1145/505776.505792	xml validation;xml;computer science;engineering;software engineering;data mining;database;programming language;management;world wide web	SE	-86.67809836173244	-39.538838601868775	135035
5a17f389936ebe0eafba1990cf26e01b31f582e3	a validation framework for formal models in adaptive work-integrated learning	domain model;formal model;work integrated learning;user model	The focus of my thesis is on the development of a multi-method framework for the validation of formal models (domain model, user model, and teaching model) for adaptive work-integrated learning. In order to test its general applicability, the framework will be applied in four different realistic work domains. In this article, specific challenges of traditional validating approaches in work-integrated learning are being discussed. Eventually, the core ideas and methods of the validation framework are outlined. Formal Models for Adaptive Work-Integrated Learning Formal models are used for realizing adaptivity in adaptive learning systems. These formal models together fulfill the functions of a domain model, a user model, and a teaching model [1]. The domain model contains the structured expert knowledge in the learning domain, i.e. those domain concepts which are relevant for learning. In many cases, the domain model also specifies relations among domain concepts. For example, statics, scale, or construction material might be relevant domain concepts in the domain of Architecture. Properties of the user (knowledge, or skills, but also preferences, misconceptions etc.) are represented in the user model. In other words, the user model contains any information that the system knows about the learner. The user model constitutes the rationale for individualized learning opportunities, and it is used throughout the interaction of the learner with the learning system, in order to adapt to the needs of that learner [2]. Following the example from above, an experienced architect might have high values, and thus “a high degree of knowledge” for all three domain concepts (statics, scale, construction material). Within this conception, the user model keeps track of how much the user knows about each of the concepts in the application domain. The teaching model designates the learning opportunities that are offered to the user in a certain situation, based on the actual learning need of a user. The actual learning need is derived from a discrepancy between situational requirements (e.g. a task at hand), and knowledge, skills and abilities of the user that are stored in the user model. Conceptually, the teaching model applies didactical strategies (realized as algorithms) for providing a user with accurate learning content. For instance, if the architect from the example above would	algorithm;application domain;design rationale;discrepancy function;domain model;requirement;user modeling	Barbara Kump	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-70987-9_65	simulation;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management	AI	-79.4780859725111	-45.76565097170628	135197

I surveyed their use of cell phones, electronic dictionaries, SMS, Email, Computers and the Internet, investigating their use of their target second language of English (L2), and questioning whether they used such resources for L2 learning, and to what extent they did so in the target L2 language of English. It is intended to refine and repeat this survey in forthcoming semesters.	dictionary;email;enlightenment foundation libraries;internet;mobile phone;ubiquitous computing	Robert C.

There is an enormous body of research on the specifics of this learning method. This article presents an instructionally oriented theory of example-based learning that integrates theoretical assumptions and findings from three research areas: learning from worked examples, observational learning, and analogical reasoning. This theory has descriptive and prescriptive elements. The descriptive subtheory deals with (a) the relevance and effectiveness of examples, (b) phases of skill acquisition, and (c) learning processes. The prescriptive subtheory proposes instructional principles that make full exploitation of the potential of example-based learning possible.	description;emoticon;relevance;theory (mathematical logic);observational learning	Alexander Renkl	2014	Cognitive science	10.1111/cogs.12086	psychology;observational learning;cooperative learning;logical reasoning;error-driven learning;algorithmic learning theory;sequence learning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;experiential learning;machine learning;learning theory;learning sciences;inductive transfer;active learning;action learning;dreyfus model of skill acquisition	AI	-77.58685033525437	-46.610360622055325	136598

This paper develops a model for selecting the most appropriate expert shell as an instructional tool for an ES course. The instructional objectives of incorporating expert shells in a learning environment are discussed and a set of evaluation criteria are developed. Then an evaluation model is presented; it is to be used to select the best shell under different class environments. An illustrative example is also presented.	expert system	Chung Sub Kim;Victoria Y.

An adaptive hypermedia methodology is applied in order to classify a Learning Object (LO) and, then, the obtained classification is inserted into the LO, so a Learning Management System can present the LOs that correspond with the students learning style preferences. At this current research stage, we are particular interested in developing a framework to build Adaptive Learning Objects, in which the LO and the students’ learning styles are manually classified. In the following stage, we will focus on classifying these elements in an automatic way, by means of machine learning techniques.	adaptive hypermedia;algorithm;least squares;machine learning;management system;prototype	Aremy Olaya Virrueta Gordillo;Rodolfo Ibarra-Orozco	2012	Research in Computing Science		robot learning;multi-task learning;instance-based learning;algorithmic learning theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;inductive transfer;multimedia;adaptive learning;active learning	ML	-79.50946766779002	-45.976605170517814	137034

E-portfolios become sources of evidence for claims about prior conceptual knowledge or skills. An experiment is designed for testing how accurate a model can be built and how beneficial this approach can be for reflective and personalized learning. Monitoring this process can also help tutorial developers and experts identify how initial learner models may automatically arise from e-portfolios.		Zinan Guo;Jim E.

The platform provides a set of tools that enable teachers to create and edit didactic materials, generate and manage different types of interactive exercises and create and manage teaching units. The main goal of these tools is to sidestep the problem of teachers having to understand various applications and languages in order to make dynamic and interactive didactic material. The system was set up with structures and transversal navigation which make learning easier and guide the student during its use. The student’s activities are collected in a personalized database, which enables teachers to follow his/her navigation and performance. This information may provide criteria for improving the didactic contents. We place special emphasis on the personalization of the system so that it can be adapted to the student’s preferences (presentation, languages, etc.), to his/her way of working and to his/her ability to understand the contents provided.	agi-plan;personalization;telematics;www	Ramón Fabregat;José-Luis Marzo;Clara Inés Peña de Carrillo	2000			personalization;multimedia;adaptability;telematics;distance education;computer science	HCI	-79.51662624155266	-44.07614392430688	137311

These students often lack the learning skills necessary to succeed in such courses, nor do the popular OCMS include the vigilance mechanisms to guide such students to successful course completion in the absence of face-to-face human instruction. This paper explores the literature relevant to design theory, learning theory, decision support, and vigilance, to extend information systems design theory to a design theory of vigilant online learning systems.

In this vein, some of them tried to completely do away with face-to-face instruction by replacing it with synchronous online lecturing tools in hybrid executive education programs. However, the end-results in terms of participant engagement and retention in many such instances were not encouraging, thus highlighting the significance of conventional face-to-face instruction in hybrid programs. This paper builds a case around how the inclusion of face-to-face instruction increases the success rate of executive education programs in terms of student retention proportional to its blending share by citing several on-ground comparable illustrations from a global executive education provider.

They support only a fixed or restricted view on the execution of learning processes. Furthermore, the adaptation and tailoring of learning environments by end-users is rarely supporting different learning scenarios and processes. Both, design and tailoring are usually supported as activities of individual users. In order to support collaborative design and tailoring, a collaborative process was developed and implemented prototypically in the collaborative learning platform CURE. The process supports collection and categorisation of existing designs as templates in a shared central repository, providing searching and rating mechanisms as well as awareness facilities to facilitate reuse of templates and to contribute to the extraction of best practices. First experiences show the advantages and expansion potentials of this approach. The applicability of the process and its portability to other platforms is discussed.

The MBIT categorises individuals on four pairs of personali~ characteristics: extraversiotiintroversion, sensingl intuition, thinkinglfeeling and judginglperceiving, giving stiteen possible personali~ types. The existing literature indicates that just two of these sixteen personali~ types account for more than a third of computing professionals. Consideration of the tasks of computing professionals today suggests that a much broader range of personali~ types is required. Preferred types are suggested for each of the major subtasks of system analysis, gstem design and programming. A study of 38 computing professionals tends to confirm that computing professionals with a preference for one of the subtasks do have characteristics suggested for that subtask. The implications of these findings for the recruitment and retewion of students are discussed.	computer science;system analysis;systems design	Joy Teague	1998		10.1145/289393.289416	psychology;simulation;social psychology;pedagogy	HCI	-78.27501278920714	-39.681854453556895	139009

Automatic assessment provides an effective method for giving immediate 24/7 feedback service for students of mass courses. A very important factor in the promoting of learning is the possibility to resubmit answers after receiving the feedback. However, our experience shows that the resubmission option is not the only key motivation factor. More important factors include the challenge of exercises and the grading scale or the course assignments. A successful combination of all of these can produce good learning results.	algorithm;data structure;effective method	Lauri Malmi;Ari Korhonen;Riku Saikkonen	2002		10.1145/544414.544433	simulation;data structure;computer science;data science;multimedia;programming language	HCI	-77.94757070782462	-41.838838329143194	139933

Since users of Multinet have to learn the transformation of natural language sentences in semantic networks as well as the reformulation of semantic networks in natural language two kinds of assessment are developed. In the first assessment learners build semantic networks in a graphical tool. The graphics are automatically analysed by comparison with a reference solution. In the second assessment the natural language reformulation is automatically transformed in Multinet and then compared to a reference answer. Depending on the analyses a detailed feedback is presented to the learner for the improvement of his solution.	feedback;graphical user interface;graphics;multinet;natural language;programming paradigm;semantic network	Rainer Lütticke	2006		10.1109/ICALT.2006.346		AI	-78.7495675418882	-46.869305822579456	140148

319443a43cd90517215021b1f17167908adb599a	can sq and eq values and their difference indicate programming aptitude to reduce dropout rate?		A crucial problem that we are currently facing at the Faculty of Computing of the University of Latvia is that during the first study semester on average 30% of the first-year students drop out, whereas after the first year of studies the number of dropouts increases up to nearly 50%. Thus, our overall goal is to determine in advance applicants that most likely will not finish the first study year successfully. A hypothesis formulated in another research study was that programming aptitude could be predicted based on the results of two personality self-report questionnaires − Systemizing Quotient (SQ) and Empathy Quotient (EQ) − taken by students. The difference between the SQ and EQ scores had a strong correlation with grades received for programming test. We reproduced the circumstances of mentioned empirical study with our first-year students using similar tests to calculate SQ and EQ, and semester grades in introductory programming course as a quantitative measure to evaluate programming ability. In this paper, we elaborate on the empirical setting, measures, and estimation methods of our study, which produced the results that made us call the stated hypothesis into question and disprove it.	dropout (neural networks);relational operator;sound quality;aptitude	Juris Borzovs;Natalija Kozmina;Laila Niedrite;Darja Solodovnikova;Uldis Straujums;Janis Zuters;Atis Klavins	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67162-8_28	data mining;computer science;statistics;aptitude;empirical research;empathy quotient;simulation;personality;quotient	ML	-78.04070225670652	-39.87158509825484	140834

The goal is to show an alarm manager to give more support to distance teaching, and help the teacher to have a thorough follow-up of distance students, thus minimizing the teacher’s task of looking for information in long reports or complex graphs. Besides, the alarm manager also helps students during their study sessions, sending extra material, help when it considers necessary. The alarm manager proposed here was incorporated into the distance-teaching environment known as Claroline. The propodsed solution is an approach to identify the necessary requirements for alarms integration with web-based distance teaching environments situations.	graph (discrete mathematics);internet;requirement;web application;web service	Daniela Leal Musa;Marcel Weschenfelder;José Palazzo Moreira de Oliveira	2005			web intelligence;web standards;web development;world wide web;web analytics;web service;web navigation;ws-policy;computer science;web application security	DB	-81.90463992396889	-48.61409000505795	140854

A role describes some stereotypic use of variables, and only ten roles are needed to cover 99 % of all variables in novice-level procedural programs. This paper presents the results from a protocol analysis of program creation tasks in an experiment where roles were introduced to novices learning Pascal programming. Students were divided into three groups that were instructed differently: in the traditional way with no treatment of roles; using roles throughout the course; and using a role-based program animator in addition to using roles in teaching. The results suggest that the use of the program animator increases novices’ ability to apply data-related programming plans in program construction and thus increases programming skill. Plan knowledge and use is analyzed using a new model that is based on Rist’s theory of schema expansion.	expert system;mental model;observable;pascal;program animation;program comprehension;psychology of programming	Pauli Byckling;Jorma Sajaniemi	2005			simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;multimedia	AI	-82.19729244459924	-39.040617731616116	141134
6efcd0530cfee650a5317a59608dcc30e9c8a16e	students' misconceptions and other difficulties in introductory programming: a literature review		Efforts to improve computer science education are underway, and teachers of computer science are challenged in introductory programming courses to help learners develop their understanding of programming and computer science. Identifying and addressing students’ misconceptions is a key part of a computer science teacher's competence. However, relevant research on this topic is not as fully developed in the computer science education field as it is in mathematics and science education. In this article, we first review relevant literature on general definitions of misconceptions and studies about students’ misconceptions and other difficulties in introductory programming. Next, we investigate the factors that contribute to the difficulties. Finally, strategies and tools to address difficulties including misconceptions are discussed.  Based on the review of literature, we found that students exhibit various misconceptions and other difficulties in syntactic knowledge, conceptual knowledge, and strategic knowledge. These difficulties experienced by students are related to many factors including unfamiliarity of syntax, natural language, math knowledge, inaccurate mental models, lack of strategies, programming environments, and teachers’ knowledge and instruction. However, many sources of students’ difficulties have connections with students’ prior knowledge. To better understand and address students’ misconceptions and other difficulties, various instructional approaches and tools have been developed. Nevertheless, the dissemination of these approaches and tools has been limited. Thus, first, we suggest enhancing the dissemination of existing tools and approaches and investigating their long-term effects. Second, we recommend that computing education research move beyond documenting misconceptions to address the development of students’ (mis)conceptions by integrating conceptual change theories. Third, we believe that developing and enhancing instructors’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), including their knowledge of students’ misconceptions and ability to apply effective instructional approaches and tools to address students’ difficulties, is vital to the success of teaching introductory programming.	bluej;computer science;context-sensitive language;debugging;interference (communication);java;knowledge acquisition;knowledge management;mental model;natural language;programming language;programming paradigm;programming tool;software documentation;theory;word lists by frequency	Yizhou Qian;James Lehman	2017	TOCE	10.1145/3077618	constructivism (philosophy of education);natural language;science education;syntax;scientific misconceptions;conceptual change;pedagogy;computer science	HCI	-81.87218398894443	-38.493629544687984	141590

Yet limitations in learning management systems (LMS) can be barriers to service-learning project success. In this paper, we present an experience report on the design and implementation of an interdisciplinary service-learning course for computer science. We also present on the design and implementation of specialized social networking software as a mechanism to support service-learning across interdisciplinary computer science courses. More specifically, this research introduces customized social software, consisting of blogging, wiki and discussion software as tools for facilitating the specialized needs of these courses. These needs range from the ability for project management and milestone tracking, which are supported through wiki technology and messaging, self-reflection, which is supported through blogging and information exchange and knowledge sharing, which are supported through online discussion boards, social bookmarking and file-sharing. Results were largely positive, with a majority of students indicating that the course learning environment supported learning, collaboration and course community.	blog;computer science;file sharing;information exchange;self-reflection;software design;wiki	Brian Thoms;Evren Eryilmaz	2018		10.1145/3159450.3159572	social software;knowledge management;service-learning;computer science;project management;learning environment;experiential learning;learning management;knowledge sharing;software	HCI	-79.11006813898938	-41.86388022868682	142663

The integration of learning styles into an intelligent system is a possible solution to the problems of “learning deviation” and “cognitive overload.” In this study, we propose a learning style prediction method based on a pattern recognition technique. The main contributions of this method are: (1) it is a form of middleware that can be applied to other intelligent tutoring systems, and (2) it can process topic-dependent data to make predictions and update learning style profiles in a recursive manner. Experimental evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of this prediction method.	adaptive hypermedia;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;autoencoder;cognitive science;computer science;deep learning;feature learning;mathematical model;middleware;open-source software;pattern recognition;personalization;recursion;statistical classification;web service	Peter Brusilovsky;Mike Sharples	2014	IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies	10.1109/TLT.2014.2329172	natural language processing;unsupervised learning;robot learning;instance-based learning;error-driven learning;algorithmic learning theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;learning classifier system;computational learning theory;active learning	AI	-81.267315115087	-48.945763826456734	143245

It is important that an annotation system for DLs should be easily integrated with existing DLs. This paper presents an annotation system, called DLNotes, which can be easily embedded in DLs in order to enable free-text and ontology-based annotations. DLNotes also supports supervised annotation activities and allows discussion threads to be associated with each annotation, what is particularly important for e-learning.	digital library;embedded system;java annotation;library (computing)	Tiago Rios da Rocha;Roberto Willrich;Renato Fileto;Saïd Tazi	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-03115-1_37	computer science;multimedia;world wide web;information retrieval	HCI	-80.0468332260379	-43.94053455348849	143495

We proposed an economic education support system, which helps users learn about economic dynamics based on qualitative simulation[3]. Our paper describes how our system should support end-users learning in the economic education. Existing study, such as [2], proposed the useful tools based on qualitative simulation for middle school students. The main aim of this paper is showing how students are intelligently supported based on their conditons. We show, in this paper, a method of supporting using an example of qualitative simulation in economic education. The advantages of qualitative reasoning in education are as follows. Student knowledge is formed and developed through learning conceptual foundations. If there are any mechanisms in the (dynamic) system, the user can understand these mechanisms using qualitative methods. Generally, students also understand dynamic systems through qualitative principles, rather than through mathematical formula. In our study, we developed our approach in least formula and took learning by non-specialist users into consideration. The feature of our study is that users can learn without teacher. Our goal is developing a system in which users can understanding economic dynamics through their selflearning. We consider an approach and system in which nonspecialist naive and novice users can use our system based on simple input. The contribution of our paper is the integration of theory and shows an approach to support method for qualitative simulation-based education system.	artificial intelligence;dynamical system;simulation	Tokuro Matsuo;Takayuki Ito;Toramatsu Shintani	2005			professional learning community;cooperative learning;educational technology;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;machine learning;learning sciences;management science;open learning	AI	-77.90384786099122	-46.5151589055325	144175

Several disciplines such as instructional design theories, software engineering principles, human-computer interaction and multimedia are involved. It is not always feasible for a novice to be familiar with such a range of expertise. A methodology integrating all of these various disciplines is urgently needed. The Courseware Engineering Methodology (CME) has been developed by the author to guide novices to design effective online courses, based on the integration of the various disciplines. CEM has been used successfully by over 70 students at a UK university to develop their online courses in the last few years. This paper describes the CEM development process. The CEM process consists of four models. The pedagogical model is concerned with the pedagogical aspects of the course; the conceptual model, dealing with the software engineering aspects of the design; the interface model relating to the interface of the course, and the Web modelling that deals with the Web useability and navigation issues of the course. Each of the nodels will be briefly reviewed. Design principles concerning both the pedagogical and interface models will be further discussed. The paper concludes by stating the benefits of using an engineering approach to online development and reuse.	human–computer interaction;software engineering;theory;usability;world wide web	Lorna Uden	2003	IJDET	10.4018/jdet.2003010104	distance education;personalized learning;educational technology;blended learning;computer science;knowledge management;machine learning;learning sciences;multimedia;world wide web;synchronous learning	SE	-81.39061332629157	-41.5294944568006	144246

Thinking of game design classes, one needs direction on what to focus on so that the students could benefit the most. In this paper, we present results of a survey on both the students’ and working professionals’ expectations from game design course and opinions on game designer job. Although sometimes consistent, the answers from the two groups often reveal significant discrepancies. We believe that the results presented in this paper can help improve the quality of computer game design courses and make their learning outcomes more compatible with the needs of the computer game industry.	pc game;video game design	Jakub Swacha;Adam Skrzyszewski;Wojciech A.

We found that the knowledge communication process involving a KBTS and a human student can be decomposed into a series of communication cycles, where each cycle concentrates on one topic and contains four major phases: planning, discussing, evaluating and remedying. The major contributions of this work are the development of a generic architecture for supporting the knowledge communication between a KBTS and a student, and a graphical notation and schema for supporting the curriculum knowledge representation and manipulation during the planning phase of a tutoring process. The curriculum knowledge about a course can help a tutoring system determine the sequences in which the topics will be discussed with the students effectively and diagnose the students’ mistakes. The curriculclm knowledge base contains the goal structure of the course, prerequisite relations, and multiple ways of organizing topics, among others. As an example, we have focused on developing SQL-TUTOR, a KBTS for the domain of SQL programming. This system has features such as efficient control mechanism, explicit curriculum knowledge representation, and individualized private tutoring. For allowing the students relative freedom to decide how to study the domain knowledge about a subject, the system provides the students with a group of operators to hand-tailor the learning schedules according to their special backgrounds, requests, and interests.

However, very often game content hardly fits to the curriculum content, players lack direct communication, and the focus is only on learning by playing. In this paper we argue that a more interesting approach for learning is to involve players in the design process of the game in a way in which the rules governing the game, the participating virtual entities and the design of the game environment are defined and created by the players themselves. In this respect, keeping in mind that learning environments need to be spaces for discussion, experimentation and reflection, we discuss in this paper one of the many issues that have to be addressed to provide tools for learners to create in a collaborative way their own games. Particularly, we discuss how reactive entities that respond to events that are defined during the creation process can be modeled in a collaborative way. We propose a conceptual model for supporting such a tool for the creation of interactive and reactive environments.

MM and other computer-aided tools have been tried in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) education since its early days. However, until detailed evaluations are conducted, many MM curriculum transformations may simply be seen as experiments in technological innovation rather than as mechanisms to improve learning. This paper describes the process undertaken and results obtained to evaluate a MM-based tool for self-learning GIS: GISWEB. GISWEB is introduced through a brief summary of its history and content. The paper also briefly summarises the agreement established between The University of Melbourne and other international education institutions where GISWEB is currently adopted. The core of the paper details the initiatives undertaken at The University of Melbourne and at the University of Alcalá de Henares for the evaluation of this new teaching and learning resource. The paper concludes with a discussion and some conclusions drawn from the evaluation results.	experiment;geographic information system	Francisco Escobar;Isaac Francés;Ian D.

Intelligent tutoring systems are needed to improve the cyberlearning quality. One of the major difficulties is knowledge representation. The current industry standard is to use Web Ontology Language (OWL) for representing knowledge structure. But OWL only supports one """"first-class"""" relation, """"is-a"""", between the concepts, and different knowledge areas usually need different custom relations to describe the relations among the concepts. For example """"part-of"""" and time dependency are important relations torepresent most engineering knowledge bodies. OWL has to use object properties to emulate such custom relations, leading to awkward knowledge representation hard for domain experts to code, validate and use such knowledge bases. This research uses Pace University's extension to OWL, named Knowledge Graph (KG), to support knowledge representation with custom relations. The instructors can use Pace University extended Protege IDE to declare and apply custom relations in a single document. The instructor teaching experience is also coded in the KG to better support custom learning order by students with different backgrounds. The prototype of a knowledge-driven tutoring system was designed and implemented to illustrate how the KG supports integrated assessments, using assessment results to custom student learning order or material, and let the students freely navigate in the knowledge space from general to specific or the opposite, and following various custom relations. A web technology tutorial is used to validate the design and effectiveness of this approach."""	is-a;kasparov's gambit;knowledge graph;knowledge representation and reasoning;knowledge space;ontology (information science);order by;prototype;protégé;technical standard;web ontology language	Maria Sette;Lixin Tao;Keke Gai;Ning Jiang	2016	2016 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing (CSCloud)	10.1109/CSCloud.2016.50	natural language processing;navigation;educational technology;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;semantics;adaptive learning	AI	-82.88231607571703	-46.248768686520556	146602

However, education on ECG has often been provided in a manner that can be described to be old-fashioned. The old-fashioned style involves the use of didactic teaching techniques as well as the incorpofiguration of ECG model strips available in the literature or textbooks. Nevertheless, the current explosion in the utilization of the Internet has made multimedia educational websites as well as knowledge sharing platforms popular. This paper proposes a novel cloud-based simulation tool that can help healthcare students to learn and interpret ECG signals as well as cases. This simulation tool works by constructing an interactive 2D simulator of ECG signals. Even though it is regarded to be a mere simulation tool, it has the capacity to provide teachers and students in the healthcare industry with the experiences derived from the real ECG signals. From this study, it is evident that the simulation tool enhances the educational process of ECG signals. The results and discussions in this study aim at complementing the traditional tools used in the learning process and deploying the new simulation tool in various educational organizations such as e-learning sites, medical colleges, and healthcare institutes.	cloud computing;experience;graphical user interface;internet;strips;web-based simulation	Mabrook Al-Rakhami;Ahmad Alhamed	2016		10.1145/2896387.2896410	embedded system;simulation;human–computer interaction;cloud computing;computer science;data science;operating system;multimedia;computer security	HCI	-78.73073534304199	-41.76311180046573	146888

It is aimed not only at assisting language learning focused on specific terminology but also at enhancing learner’s conceptual knowledge in the subject area. The system could be tuned to aid learning in different terminological areas and supports three styles of tutoring: System-Initiated, Collaborative , nd LearnerInitiated. Three agents take part in the instructional process supported by ITELS: the human teacher, the system, and the learner. Each of them is an active agent characterized by a set of specific roles with respect to the system functioning. In this paper we describe ITELS with emphasis on the roles of these agents. Introduction Learning subject area terminology is part of English instruction at Bulgarian universities. Experience shows that in the course of this instruction the students face difficulties not only with the foreign language but also with the concepts of the subject area. Since the English teachers who teach these courses are not usually specialists in the subject area (Computer Science, Economics, Chemistry, etc.) learning the required terminology is often not very successful. ITELS is an intelligent tutoring system that supports learning English focused on specific terminology as well as improving learner’s conceptual knowledge in the subject area. The system could be tuned to support learning in different terminological areas. Computer Science terminology was chosen as a testbed. ITELS is aimed at enhancing learners’ skills in reading and comprehending English terminological texts as well as in understanding and using correctly subject area’s terminology. Therefore, the system applies reading comprehension (Nuttal, 1982) and vocabulary learning (Carter and McCarthy, 1988) approaches to language instruction. Differently from most vocabulary learning systems which are built as learning environments (e.g. Ingraham et al., 1996; Swartz, 1992), ITELS supports three styles of tutoring: • System-Initiated: The system is in complete control of the teaching process. It decides which teaching activity is most appropriate in the current situation. • Collaborative: The system and the learner work in collaboration. A mixed-initiative approach is adopted where the system shares the instructional control with the learner. This allows the learner to insist on a preferred teaching activity or content.

Most tests are based on the classical test theory, which says that a student's score is the sum of the scores obtained in all questions plus some kind of error. The most relevant is that the student test result depends heavily on the individual's learning preferences or abilities and also on the actual test's format. According to this theory, tests aren't necessarily useful in intelligent educational systems, which require accurately obtaining the student's knowledge state to guide the learning process. Yet the Web has created a new generation of intelligent systems-adaptive hypermedia systems which offer new types of instructional interaction. Educational AHSs adapt the learning process on the basis of the student's learning preferences, knowledge, and availability. One such Web-based tool is Siette (the system of intelligent evaluation using rests), which infers student knowledge using adaptive testing.	adaptive hypermedia;world wide web	Eduardo Guzmán;Ricardo Conejo;José-Luis Pérez-de-la-Cruz	2007	IEEE Intelligent Systems	10.1109/MIS.2007.71	the internet;simulation;user modeling;self-assessment;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;adaptive system;multimedia;classical test theory;computerized adaptive testing;empirical research	AI	-79.12663210099446	-48.08147950602022	147823

Current e-learning video portals can not address this need, either to quickly dip into a shorter part focused on a specific topic of a longer lecture or to explore what is taught about a certain topic easily across collections. Through application of video analysis, semantic annotation and media fragment URIs, we have implemented a first demo of VideoLecturesMashup.	massive open online course;portals;video content analysis	Lyndon J.

Four curriculum components are represented separately: learning objectives, learning experiences, the organization of learning experiences and evaluation of learning outcomes. Learning objectives are formally represented using ontologies. Learning experiences consist of learning objects and achievements assessment instruments (tests) and they are specified using IMS Content Packaging standard. Learning experiences are mapped to the learning objectives ontology using XML. For describing instructional design, we proposed a special-purpose language implemented using XML notation. The achievement of a learning objective is assessed using test items linked to this particular objective. Such an approach allows more flexible management of the curriculum as a whole and easier modification of the particular components than in classical approach.	experience;knowledge representation and reasoning;mathematical optimization;ontology (information science);open-source software;xml	Milan Tima Segedinac;Goran Savic;Zora Konjovic	2010			emergent curriculum;knowledge management;body of knowledge;curriculum theory	AI	-80.8503177880145	-44.75706042981967	148158

However, it is difficult for teachers to retrieve education data from students or to obtain data from the student activities. Therefore, we have developed a problem solving environment (PSE) for the education and learning support: TSUNA-TASTE. The TSUNA-TASTE system collects the system-usage date, the information for softwares used and operation data of mouse and key board of all students. The data, which the system TSUNA-TASTE collects, are stored in a database on the TSUNA-TASTE system server.

These practical works allow learners to deepen knowledge in a particular area through the development of the Internet. In this paper, we present a computer-supported collaborative practical works system for the “computer science” specialty, called TPCOLinfo. The designed system allows students to carry out practical works in groups and at distance. These groups are constituted dynamically according to a new grouping method based on the results of pre-tests done by learners before doing a particular new practical work. TPCOLinfo allows to increase the skills of students in “computer science” because the proposed grouping method aiming at creating dynamically groups having a homogeneous level. In other words, the system allows students to work in groups formed for learners with additional cognitive profiles and better interact with each other to achieve collaborative tasks. This system has been tested by students of a computer science department where we achieved very good results.

Learning objects created according to e-learning standards such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) play a major role in order to produce quality contents for e-learning. A virtual learning environment (VLE) is normally used to support e-learning by providing online courses and other learning activities. Moodle is one of the most widely used VLEs. However, Moodle still does not support the SCORM 2004 Sequencing and Navigation. This article proposes a new technique to create an e-tutorial module, one of the main services in e-learning that supports a certain level of SCORM 2004 Sequencing and Navigation on Moodle version 1.9.2+.

One of the main challenges of these approaches is fully integrating the traditional brick-and-mortar classes with online learning environments in an efficient and flexible way. In this paper, we present a set of requirements to be met by a computer system in order to adequately support both students and teachers in a B-Learning context. Then, it defines a suitable conceptual architecture to meet the requirements, and the multi-agent implementation of the architecture. Next, it presents the evaluation of the functionality implemented. Finally some conclusions are drawn.

Although most Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS) offer a reporting tool, in general, these do not show a clear vision of each student's academic progression. In this work, we propose a decision making system which helps instructors to answer these and other questions using data mining techniques applied to data from LCMSs databases. The goal of this system is that instructors do not require data mining knowledge, they only need to request a pattern or model, interpret the result and take the educational actions which they consider necessary.	color gradient;content management system;data mining;database;decision support system;little cms	Marta E.

With an increasing number of students entering STEM disciplines, the question of how to effectively train students» spatial visualization skills has become very important. While a scalable existing solution is to implement online workshops for students, the problem of how to motivate students to participate in these online workshops remains unsolved. In this study, we studied gamification as a way to motivate first year engineering students to take part in an online workshop designed to train their spatial visualization skills. Our game contains eight modules, each designed to train a different component of spatial visualization. The game records players» in-game behavior with high granularity, which allows us to provide automated, scalable feedback on players» problem-solving strategies. Ten students with different levels of spatial ability played our game and expressed a strong interest in using the game to train their spatial visualization skills in the future. In addition, our analysis of players» in-game behaviors shows the potential benefits of implementing adaptive and personalized learning guidance.	gamification;personalization;problem solving;scalability;virtual world	Ziang Xiao;Helen Wauck;Zeya Peng;Hanfei Ren;Shiliang Zuo;Yuqi Yao;Wai-Tat Fu	2018		10.1145/3172944.3172954	multimedia;spatial ability;human–computer interaction;computer science;scalability;spatial visualization;personalized learning;learning analytics	HCI	-77.83005469980057	-42.418657844000876	149093
97c189367d8d8e6e82456a8f689e974bf6c15bed	a multi-constraint learning path recommendation algorithm based on knowledge map		Abstract It is difficult for e-learners to make decisions on how to learn when they are facing with a large amount of learning resources, especially when they have to balance available limited learning time and multiple learning objectives in various learning scenarios. This research presented in this paper addresses this challenge by proposing a new multi-constraint learning path recommendation algorithm based on knowledge map. The main contributions of the paper are as follows. Firstly, two hypotheses on e-learners’ different learning path preferences for four different learning scenarios (initial learning, usual review, pre-exam learning and pre-exam review) are verified through questionnaire-based statistical analysis. Secondly, according to learning behavior characteristics of four types of the learning scenarios, a multi-constraint learning path recommendation model is proposed, in which the variables and their weighted coefficients considers different learning path preferences of the learners in different learning scenarios as well as learning resource organization and fragmented time. Thirdly, based on the proposed model and knowledge map, the design and implementation of a multi-constraint learning path recommendation algorithm is described. Finally, it is shown that the questionnaire results from over 110 e-learners verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show the similarity between the learners’ self-organized learning paths and the recommended learning paths.	algorithm;constraint learning;knowledge management	Haiping Zhu;Feng Tian;Ke Wu;Nazaraf Shah;Yifu Ni;Xinhui Zhang;Kuo-Ming Chao;Qinghua Zheng	2018	Knowl.-Based Syst.	10.1016/j.knosys.2017.12.011	machine learning;data mining;artificial intelligence;computer science;algorithm;constraint learning	ML	-79.7147618373715	-46.009053909156385	149293

In the primary or instant cooling stage, fish are killed instantly by the shock of emersion in a rapid cooling fluid. This fluid subjects the surface layer of each fish to a temperature below that at which they will be stored. In the secondary or storage stage, individual fish are either passively cooled on the inside by their low temperature surface layer, or else they are cooled inside and out by external means. An apparatus is also provided for this method and is comprised of the following: a rapid cooling hopper to deliver fish into the system, a primary rapid cooling tank to instantly kill fish, and a device connected to the primary rapid cooling tank to discharge fish to the secondary stage cold storage tank. Live fish are introduced to the system through the rapid cooling hopper, killed by the shock of instant cooling in the primary rapid cooling tank, and subsequently delivered to the secondary stage cold storage tank by the discharge device.

This method is often used in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). ITS can adapt learning process to students' abilities, learning styles or preferences. Moreover, ITS allows to create collaborative learning groups of students. Such groups could be homogeneous or heterogeneous. It is often said that heterogeneity in groups improves learning effects (3,8). In this paper an original algorithm for creating heterogeneous groups is proposed. Results of heterogeneous and homogeneous groups were compared and research has shown that students working in heterogeneous groups achieved better results than students in homo- geneous groups. It points out that to suitable assign students to groups is a very important matter.

Pedagogically, these learning pathways may either be defined macroscopically, e.g. in terms of desired learning outcomes or competencies, or microscopically in terms of a didactical model for individual knowledge objects. In this contribution we consider such learning pathways from a pedagogical point of view and then establish a mathematical model for their traversal by a learner and for the analysis of his behavior. This model is implemented in a novel ALE provided by the EU FP7 project INTUITEL, introduced in its Moodle version as concrete example.	failure;gene regulatory network;geodetic datum;human–computer interaction;learning pathway;mathematical model;natural language;network theory;ontology (information science);phenomenological model;reasoning system;test-driven development;dialog	Peter A.

Based on the created educational models in Petri nets we are able to verify and simulate individual processes, which are carried out during the passage of student through the e-course in LMS. Universal model was gradually implemented at the Department of Informatics (Faculty of Natural Sciences, Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, Slovakia) from the academic year 2009/2010. The module is used in technically oriented subjects, specifically in the field of applied informatics. The results obtained from the use of the module are listed in the debate and point to the fact that in this way we can thus find certain rules of behavior of applicants in the e-course by means of the usage analysis and compare them with the process models created by us. By means of dry comparisons we shall be able to eliminate all interfering elements from process models of e-courses, thus making the other created e-courses more effective and more attractive. Universal Model of Educational Process with the Support of Petri Nets so contributes to the development of skills and abilities of students without they are aware of this fact at all.	informatics;petri net;simulation;usage analysis	Zoltán Balogh;Milan Turcáni;Martin Magdin	2013	2013 IEEE 14th International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration (IRI)	10.1109/IRI.2013.6642468	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;software engineering;machine learning;process architecture;petri net	SE	-83.445532831618	-41.132316643400316	150497

The goal of the 6.002x experiment was to explore ways to use computer assisted instruction to surpass the quality of traditional residential teaching. By providing superior on-line content delivery and assessment, we hope to both be able to educate people without access to education, and to improve residential education by allowing professors to focus on higher value tasks. We improved on the classroom experience in several ways. Students can actively monitor their current levels of mastery and to self-pace in response. They can identify and break through misconceptions before moving on to more advanced material. The massive scale of the classroom has participants on-line 24/7, allowing students to ask questions and receive peer answers in almost real-time. The platform allows for substantial data collection on testing, allowing us to incrementally and scientifically improve courses. Finally, the amount of effort that can be invested into a course is much greater when it can be amortized across tens of thousands. In order to achieve this, we had to overcome a number of challenges: finding mechanisms to allow automated grading, overcoming the lack of in-person interactions, and overcoming the lack of student access to laboratory equipment. The course was shown successful in both residential and mass-scale settings.	amortized analysis;digital distribution;electronic circuit;interaction;mitx;online and offline;real-time locating system	Piotr Mitros;Khurram K.

By identifying students’ working memory capacity (WMC), personalized scaffolding techniques can be used, either by teachers or adaptive systems to offer students individual recommendations of learning activities based on their individual cognitive load. WMC has been identified traditionally by dedicated tests. However, these tests have certain drawbacks (e.g., students have to spend additional time on them, etc.). Therefore, recent research aims at automatically detecting WMC from students’ behavior in learning systems. This paper introduces an automatic approach to identify WMC in learning systems using a genetic algorithm. An evaluation of this approach using data from 63 students shows it outperforms the existing leading approach with an accuracy of 85.1 %. By increasing the accuracy of automatic WMC identification, more accurate interventions can be made to better support students and ensure that their working memory is balanced properly while learning.	adaptive system;genetic algorithm;optimizing compiler;personalization;sensor;windows media center	Jason Bernard;Ting-Wen Chang;Elvira Popescu;Sabine Graf	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-39583-8_38	genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;working memory	AI	-77.43703027165512	-44.98931771967013	151071

646f0fef537ceba927b72fa3fba4c46d1b96212c	an ontology-enabled context-aware learning record store compatible with the experience api		In education, learners no longer perform learning activities in a well-defined and static environment like a physical classroom. Digital learning environments promote learners anytime, anywhere and anyhow learning. As such, the context in which learners undertake these learning activities can be very diverse. To optimize learning and the environment in which it occurs, learning analytics measure data about learners and their context. Unfortunately, current state of the art standards and systems are limited in capturing the context of the learner. In this paper we present a Learning Record Store (LRS), compatible with the Experience API, that is able to capture the learners’ context, more concretely his location and used device. We use ontologies to model the xAPI and context information. The data is stored in a RDF triple store to give access to different services. The services will show the advantages of capturing context information. We tested our system by sending statements from 100 learners completing 20 questions to the LRS.	anytime algorithm;application programming interface;backward compatibility;ontology (information science);recurrence relation;resource description framework;triplestore	Jonas Anseeuw;Stijn Verstichel;Femke Ongenae;Ruben Lagatie;Sylvie Venant;Filip De Turck	2016		10.5220/0006049000880095	computer science;database;internet privacy;world wide web	HCI	-80.69929705525912	-46.0879556460529	151560

The idea of continuously learning from the web brings concerns about reliability and accuracy, mainly when the learning process uses its own knowledge to improve its learning capabilities. Considering that the knowledge base keeps growing forever, such a system requires self-supervision as well as self-reflection. The increased use of the Internet, that allowed NELL creation, also brought a new source of information on-line. The social media becomes more popular everyday and the AI community can now develop research to take advantage of these information, aiming to turn it into knowledge. This work is following this lead and proposes a new machine learning approach, called Conversing Learning, to use collective knowledge from web community users to provide self-supervision and self-reflection to intelligent machines, thus, they can improve their learning task. The Conversing Learning approach explores concepts from Active Learning and Question Answering to achieve the goal of showing what can be done towards autonomous Human Computer Interaction to automatically improve machine learning tasks.	autonomous robot;c4.5 algorithm;experiment;human computer;human–computer interaction;id3 algorithm;information source;internet;knowledge base;machine learning;naive bayes classifier;never-ending language learning;online and offline;question answering;self-reflection;sentiment analysis;social media;the machine	Saulo D.

This paper begins by retrieving relevant blog articles, and then integrating a learning map as a dynamic social learning model. Because these retrieved blog articles pertain to course materials, they can be used to promote learner engagement in their interactions with a learning map and hence, achieve their goals more easily. An experimental course has been launched and the results show that learners do make use of the blog-based learning and can eventually cross the specified test thresholds. Lecturers using the proposed approach can apply the principles of dynamic learning in ways which not only reduce teacher workload, but also enhance student learning through the active construction of knowledge supported by alternative perspectives within meaningful blog contexts.	blog;cognitive map;entry point;fits;information retrieval;interaction;interactivity;peer-to-peer;problem solving	Kun-Te Wang;Yu-Lin Jeng;Yueh-Min Huang;Tzone-I Wang	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74472-6_93	robot learning;proactive learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;error-driven learning;social learning;computer science;knowledge management;experiential learning;multimedia;active learning;action learning;world wide web;open learning;active learning;synchronous learning	AI	-79.09359374324306	-43.89060797647951	152215

The paper starts from the emerging concept of learning designs (LDs) that are increasingly used to express teaching/learning scenarios that could be based on any pedagogical model (e.g. problem-based learning, role-playing etc). To address the identified research problem, the paper proposes to extend the existing model of LD lifecycle to capture various knowledge management processes necessary for sharing and reuse of innovative practices. To illustrate the proposed approach, the paper uses an example of problem-based learning. Finally the paper uses design research to set foundations for a new type of knowledge-management, educational technology that could be used to support knowledge sharing among teachers.	knowledge management	Olivera Marjanovic	2008	ITI 2008 - 30th International Conference on Information Technology Interfaces	10.1109/ITI.2008.4588467	process design;educational technology;design research;computer science;knowledge management;management science;management;collaboration	AI	-82.68388599809548	-42.447245017328676	152659

The teaching model suggested by the present paper advances a genuinely workable and interactive framework providing a commonly-shared environment for students and tutors. Within this highly interactive environment, students can explore examples of tutor-proposed algorithms run on a large number of images from different areas, while developing their own methods for image processing on their own initiative or by observing the tutor's requirements. Conversely, the tutor can assess students' work within the same environment. The suggested framework combines multiple programming technologies which include PHP, MySQL, Java, and HTML.	algorithm;html;image processing;interpolation;java;mysql;online machine learning;php;positive feedback;requirement;upward planar drawing	Muguras Mocofan;Delia Tanase	2012	Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)	10.1109/EDUCON.2012.6201055	computer science;theoretical computer science;database;multimedia	Visualization	-82.40118917425237	-40.76798146969566	152769

It describes a survey of the attitudes of students, faculty and professionals in computing towards the teaching and assessment of such values. The results show that these groups share a set of professional values, though students are less convinced of their importance in the work environment. There is broad consensus on the specific behaviors and attitudes reflective of these values to be developed in the curriculum. The groups differed in their opinions of whether these attitudes and behaviors could be workably assessed.

Of the 122 students who have enrolled in this graduate-level course for a grade over the three-year period analyzed, half have been nontraditional students who never set foot on campus. These remote students have a substantially higher drop-out rate than the traditional on-campus students, and frequently indicate a strong preference for face-to-face instruction in a traditional classroom setting. Nevertheless, due to significant differences in the characteristics of the two student groups, the remote students typically earn higher final course grades than the on-campus students. While there is a strong demand for delivery of this type of advanced course to remote students, more still needs to be done to effectively engage these students in the learning process.	profiling (computer programming)	David.

The conversational tutoring agent is composed of an animated tutor, a Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) module, a database with curriculum scripts, and a dialog manager. As in the case of human tutors, the meaning of learner's contributions in natural language are compared with the content of expected answers to questions or problems specified in curriculum scripts. LSA is used to evaluate the conceptual matches between learner input and tutor expectations, whereas the dialog manager determines how the tutor adaptively responds to the learner by selecting content from the curriculum script. The integration of available courseware with the tutorial dialog system guarantees the reusability of existing Web tutorials with minimal effort in the modification of the curriculum script and LSA module. This development thereby simplifies the change into more valuable Web based training courseware.	web application	Ki-Sang Song;Xiangen Hu;Andrew Olney;Arthur C.

The purpose of this research is to understand the impact on student learning and performance that including technology such as virtual reality in the classroom may have. To this end we have opted for the use of a quasi-experimental design by means of two groups: a first experimental group, that uses a virtual reality application, and a control group that receives a traditionally cut master class. After the quantitative and qualitative analysis carried out, the results show that there are statistically significant differences in the scores of the pretest and posttest tests in favor of the experimental group, that is, of the students who performed the activity with virtual reality. They improved their performance against the students that used the traditional master class methodology. In addition, the results of the user experience survey, passed after using the app, were positive. In most of the cases, the average is above 4 over 5 for the degree of overall satisfaction shown by the students. Being very high/excellent for 60% of students and high for 40%. Due to these factors, we can conclude that the impact of virtual reality activities in the classroom is beneficial for the learning and the academic results of the students, in addition to their motivation."""	design of experiments;experiment;user experience;virtual reality	Eva Jiménez;Gonzalo Mariscal;Manuela Heredia;Guillermo Castilla	2018		10.1145/3284179.3284276		Visualization	-77.52740732206654	-40.73621675356091	154789
cb18c140e9ebbdba5a6472bfff3879103fd2cb06	utilization of online educational resources in teaching: a moderated mediation perspective		The study builds on a newly modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to substantiate the motivation and operation of teachers’ utilization of online learning resources. A ‘Comprehensiveness’ construct is proposed in the modified TAM to reflect the breadth and depth of rich online knowledge. This new construct serves as the mediator between ‘Usefulness’ and ‘Behavioral Intention’ in the new TAM structure. In addition, the ‘Ease of Use’ factor in conventional TAM is proposed to moderate the mediation in the modified TAM. Survey data are collected from 301 teachers undertaking certified training in Macau and Structural Equation Model (SEM) technique is used to assess the model. Moderated mediation is evaluated using both multi-group bootstrapping method and moderated path analysis method. Both methods verify the presence of moderated mediation with partial mediation in high Ease of Use values and full mediation in low Ease of Use values. Theoretical implication of the current study extends the coverage of TAM applications and academic implication suggests the strengthening in teachers’ professional development and government sponsorship in building repositories of online resources.	bootstrapping (compilers);ibm tivoli access manager;moderated mediation;path analysis (statistics);structural equation modeling	Su Iong Kio;Meng Chan Virgina Lau	2016	Education and Information Technologies	10.1007/s10639-016-9495-8	simulation;knowledge management;social psychology;world wide web	HCI	-77.61396620252056	-39.44300569225889	155354

In order to gain a differentiated picture and to learn more about potential challenges that CS students face when studying ToC, we used an exploratory data analysis to examine student performance in an undergraduate ToC course. In particular, we used final exam results and homework assignment scores to explore our research field and to develop hypotheses about it comparable to qualitative approaches. Our results indicate that despite their finale grade all students were particularly challenged by formal proof assignments covering ToC concepts. These results bolster the evidence of a need for pedagogical approaches in ToC that address all students and are particularly focused on teaching them formal proof techniques within this domain.	computer science;final exam;formal proof;theory of computation	Christiane Frede;Maria Knobelsdorf	2018		10.1145/3230977.3230996	empirical research;knowledge management;exploratory data analysis;formal proof;computer science;theory of computation	ML	-77.97208548557295	-38.85017098390353	155431

Informal learning, a learning activity which occurs out of classroom gives learners more freedom to choose what to learn by means of tools for collaboration, coordination and communication. Appropriate applications based on mobile technologies are able to enhance and enrich informal learning. There has been increasing interest in design for informal learning about how to define informal learning content and how to design informal learning ways to form an interactive, flexible, collaborative and creative informal learning environment. Besides, evaluation for informal learning design is also of great importance in a whole design practice for informal learning. This paper concludes a design framework which consists of informal learning content pattern based on activity theory, informal learning design pattern and informal learning evaluation pattern on the basis of a practical design practice for informal learning design in zoo. This design framework is intended to serve as a general design pattern helping designers discover design chances and create appropriate design solutions for informal learning with the help of content pattern, design pattern and evaluation pattern.	definition;pattern language;software design pattern;web 2.0	Zhiyong Fu;Jia Lin;Yuyao Zhou	2018		10.1145/3202667.3202671	mobile technology;knowledge management;formal learning;design pattern;informal learning;information and communications technology;computer science	HCI	-79.80371172581071	-44.21523626030773	155439
871b1869f6272c6ac3e52e83ae4fabaae442a879	implementing flexible hybrid instruction in an electrical engineering course: the best of three worlds?	study effort;class attendance;motivation;electrical engineering;hybrid instruction	This study explored a modified version of hybrid instruction, referred to as the flexible hybrid format, in a lower division electrical engineering course offered at a large public university. The objective of the study is to use longitudinal data to investigate the impact of class attendance, out-of-class study time, and motivation on student exam performance. Generalized least squares and fixed effects models were used in the analyses. It was found that class attendance was indispensable; it was associated with exam performance even when all essential course material was made available online and students generally rated the online instruction component to be of higher quality. The benefit of class attendance was then explained by the ICAP hypothesis and spaced learning practice and it was suggested that online education might be more effective in teaching relatively simpler contents. Out-of-class effort significantly predicated performance in previous weeks, but not in the final period. The harmful effect of cramming was cited to explain this phenomenon. Hence, by implication, time management might be an issue in a flexible hybrid environment. Finally, motivation was found to be a robust predicator of performance and its effect was the strongest when the course was at its most challenging stage. Besides, the relationship between motivation and exam performance was likely to be bidirectional, as higher motivation resulted in better performance, which in turn further boosted motivation. Based on current findings, directions for future research were also suggested to verify our claims and improve our implementation. The study explores a hybrid format designed for more customized learning.Class attendance only predictes performance when course material is difficult.Time management is a serious issue when students are given too much liberty.Motivation predicates exam performance, especially when the content is challenging.The success of this hybrid format depends on student skills and course difficulty.	electrical engineering	Wenliang He;Daniel Gajski;George Farkas;Mark Warschauer	2015	Computers & Education	10.1016/j.compedu.2014.09.005	psychology;simulation;motivation;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication;social psychology;world wide web;pedagogy	Arch	-77.51488015054116	-40.78211504819826	155485

The presented Web application is flexible in operation; it allows designing the number of groups and PBL sessions. The user, apart from using the system during PBL sessions, can access it at any place and time to supplement and update the content. The materials collected during individual PBL sessions constitute sets of content unique for each group because the learning objectives are different for them. With this approach, students can study considerably larger batches of material than it would be possible during classes conducted with other methods.	archive;web application;world wide web	Tomasz Lipiak;Monika Piwowar;Michal Markiewicz;Michal Nowakowski	2015	Bio-Algorithms and Med-Systems	10.1515/bams-2014-0022	mathematics education;computer science;machine learning;pedagogy	HCI	-78.50951713705945	-41.3307923178077	155493

In literature, ways to measure or control programming experience vary. Often, researchers neglect it or do not specify how they controlled for it. We set out to find a well-defined understanding of programming experience and a way to measure it. From published comprehension experiments, we extracted questions that assess programming experience. In a controlled experiment, we compare the answers of computer-science students to these questions with their performance in solving program-comprehension tasks. We found that self estimation seems to be a reliable way to measure programming experience. Furthermore, we applied exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to extract and evaluate a model of programming experience. With our analysis, we initiate a path toward validly and reliably measuring and describing programming experience to better understand and control its influence in program-comprehension experiments.	computer science;experiment;exploratory factor analysis;holism;köppen climate classification;list comprehension;logic programming;program comprehension;programmer;prolog	Janet Siegmund;Christian Kästner;Jörg Liebig;Sven Apel;Stefan Hanenberg	2013	Empirical Software Engineering	10.1007/s10664-013-9286-4	questionnaire;simulation;computer science;management science;social psychology	SE	-82.29974278905506	-38.994980154268525	155845

After the candidate selects an area, the software produces a refined questionnaire, which leads to a list of recommended courses. In a third and final step of refinement, the software queries the candidate about their knowledge of each course and produces a detailed study plan.

With the proliferation of collaboration systems on the market and the wide range of features they offer, choosing an appropriate system can be an overwhelming task for college students. In this paper, the authors present an empirical study that aimed to help college instructors and students assess and select appropriate collaboration systems for their teamwork needs. They first identified and ranked the important features of collaboration systems for students through a web-based survey. Based on the survey results, the authors built an evaluation framework, in the form of weighted scoring tables, to help students systematically choose technologies that met their collaborative needs. They further demonstrated how to use those scoring tables for an undergraduate capstone class that had a term-long team project. The implications and future directions of the authors' study are also discussed.

ee00af2f7142664a774f74d6ee136a6fb0aea254	demonstrating the ability of elementary school students to reason about programs		Over the last decade, CS Education researchers have developed different curricula, resources, and strategies to foster computer science learning in K-12 education. However, there is a lack of research about how elementary school students develop the ability to reason about programs. Reasoning about programs consists of a studentu0027s ability to read, write, debug, trace, and predict program behavior. This paper presents results from a think-aloud study of fourth and fifth grade students learning to program in Kodu. The goal of this study was to track studentsu0027 understanding of how Kodu interprets and executes rules of a program. To understand studentsu0027 reasoning of program execution, we explicitly taught them the Laws of Kodu computation which govern the decision making and execution process of Kodu rules. We collected studentsu0027 responses on pre- and post-assessments, and we conducted think-aloud interviews with students where students explained their answers to assessment questions. We found that explicitly teaching students how Kodu rules are interpreted significantly improved their ability to understand the execution of programs and to explain program behavior. The results of this study provide insight into how elementary school students reason about simple programs, and how this ability can be scaffolded.	computation;computer science;debugging;kodu;microsoft research	Ashish Aggarwal;David S.

It concentrates on the design and implementation of a generic prototype of a template to be used to describe a session of practical work. For this purpose we should make sure that all functionalities, that respond to the needs of instructors who are responsible for the creation of pedagogical content (editing, updating) and learner’s access to this template to do his/her practical work, are supported. We used UML [5] (modeling language) as a design language. We are able to develop a satisfactory and working result: a generic model, portable which offers to the principal actors involved in the teaching and training process (teachers, learners), a set of objects, a set of actions, and facilities which make it possible for each one to achieve his/her role.	prototype	Djamila Mechta;Saad Harous;Mahieddine Djoudi;Amel Douar	2007			simulation;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management	HCI	-80.68848295064028	-44.3922497778506	157681

Annotations are thus stored when and where they become relevant. Thanks to an open and standardized architecture, these annotations can be widely shared and exploited in various contexts such as re-authoring, curriculum designs, or learning object retrieval. Indeed, annotations can represent a basis for a (personalized) quality-based sorting mechanism helping users to find and reuse learning resources that match with their preferences. An implementation focusing on Moodle and the Ariadne knowledge pool system validates our approach.	best practice;java annotation;personalization;sorting	Olivier Catteau;Philippe Vidal;Julien Broisin	2008	2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies	10.1109/ICALT.2008.192	computer science;sorting;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;technology management;service-oriented architecture;feedback;database;multimedia;software testing;programming language;management;metadata;least squares;world wide web	Robotics	-82.41992630717425	-44.35751912463105	157944

c575a7b98ecefce51c86ee487b62d12af9b9eca8	on the ability to reason about program behaviour: a think-aloud study		Abstraction is a core skill for both programming and problem solving, however it is also a challenge for many students to develop a correct understanding of abstract concepts, such as program behaviour, which causes them to struggle with both introductory and advanced programming courses. Thus, evaluating students' ability to reason about programs should be an important topic for CS education.  We use a think-aloud study to record and analyse the strategies students apply to reason about program behaviour within the context of reversibility. Reversibility is a property of a program or function that indicates it could be brought back to its original state. Reasoning about reversibility requires students to have a mental model of the state, thus they should reason about program behaviour as a whole, compared with reasoning about concrete cases using testing and tracing. We have identified four strategies used by students to complete the reversibility task, which we have named as algorithm decomposition, input analysis, abstraction and inductive testing. Although 70% of students successful identified reversibility in 2 of the 3 exercises, most students fail to correctly reason about reversibility in an exercise involving a seemingly simple conditional statement.	algorithm;computer program;computer programming;conditional (computer programming);mental model;problem solving;tracing (software)	Cruz Izu;Cheryl Pope;Amali Weerasinghe	2017		10.1145/3059009.3059036	knowledge management;computer science;management science;think aloud protocol;abstraction;artificial intelligence;tracing	SE	-81.82963727355704	-38.44790091306541	158971

A wide range of accessible information technology (IT) for educational purposes as well as the potential for new technologies allow people to learn throughout their lives. Accelerated IT development and short amount of time for learning activities emphasize the requirement for continuing education and the synergy between accessible technologies. Analysis of knowledge flow becomes important during the learning process within an educational information technology (IT) ecosystem. Learning objects within IT are the major medium that enables knowledge to pass between teacher and learner. The developer of an educational system can identify factors that may impact on the learning process more successfully by using enterprise modeling The objective of this article is to apply the enterprise modeling approach to the analysis of knowledge flow in continuing education. The proposed approach can be applied not only to educational institutions but also in business organizations.

To achieve this goal, we need to understand how educational technology can bring students' attention to, and promote these higher level skills. We first discuss the core skills that students need as they learn to learn together. We then present a platform and pedagogy to support the acquisition of the critical skills. Finally, we present an example use of our system based on results from pilot studies. This example demonstrates interaction with the platform to highlight potential benefits and limitations of our approach to promoting the associated skills.	experience;multi-task learning;subject matter expert turing test	Toby Dragon;Manolis Mavrikis;Bruce M.

e1f27c0fc93aecfae0ba177e65dc9b5c034b99cd	visual specifications for web-application programming assignments	software;visualization;programming profession;computer bugs;context	Programming assignment specifications are typically communicated to learners as text in a natural language. These specifications may be ambiguous, and the problem can be compounded in a linguistically diverse country when learners or instructors lack fluency in the language of communication. In this paper, we propose an alternate way for instructors to specify intent that is suitable for certain types of programming tasks. A visual specification is a recorded or live demonstration of the programmatic solution's functionality. We conducted a study of web-application programming assignments where learners were provided both visual and textual specifications. Based on the results of this study and the feedback obtained from learners, we conclude that visual specifications can help in two ways: (1) visual specifications seem to be clearer than textual specifications for these types of assignments, and (2) learners appear to solve problems more independently with visual specifications.	ambiguous grammar;natural language;web application	Vidhu Rojit;Sindhu R.

These features, along with its high portability, good flexibility, and, above all, low cost, make this approach appropriate for educational and training purposes, mainly concerning measurements on telecommunication systems, at universities and research centers, as well as enterprises. Moreover, the methodology can be employed for remote access to and sharing of costly measurement equipment in many different activities. The immersive characteristics of the framework are illustrated, along with performance measurements related to a specific application.

Major challenges of context awareness are to define the learning context, how to sense it, and how to react to changes. Our proposed system provides a general architecture that facilitates contextualization using current widely-used web standards. It provides a systematic approach to achieve contextualization defining major components and their functionalities without deepening into details. It uses web services to connect to resources making them reusable and distributable. In addition, all technologies and platforms proposed in our system are available under General Public License (GPL) hence facilitating immediate implementation.

The result is often lack of active participation by faculty and an increase in negative attitudes that tend to further erode assessment effectiveness. This is a serious problem at small schools that cannot afford the luxury of full time assessment personnel and are totally dependent on faculty for the assessment process. This paper presents five assessment methods that require a minimum of paper-work and faculty time but are nevertheless effective in presenting an accurate assessment of a program's objectives. The five methods presented are: 1. the Assessment Day concept; 2. personal class assessment; 3. sampled student work; 4. faculty interview groups; and 5. student focus groups.	common access card;focus group	Dick K.

Underlying computational models need to be addressed, and mathematical tools employed, to understand the quality criteria of theoretical computer science. Focus shifts from doing to proving. Over several years, we have tried to make this perspective transition smoother for the students of a third-year mandatory algorithms, data structures, and computational complexity course. The concepts receiving extra attention in this work are NP-completeness, one of the most central concepts in computer science, and dynamic programming, an algorithm construction method that is powerful but somewhat unintuitive for some students.  The major difficulties that we attribute to NP-completeness are that the tasks look similar but have a different purpose than in algorithm construction exercises. Students do not immediately see the usefulness of the concept, and hence motivation could be one issue. One line of attacking NP-completeness has been to emphasize its algorithmic aspects using typical tools for teaching algorithms.  Some potential difficulties associated with dynamic programming are that the method is based on a known difficult concept—recursion—and that there are many ingredients in a dynamic programming solution to a problem.  For both dynamic programming and NP-completeness, we have invented several new activities and structured the teaching differently, forcing students to think and adopt a standpoint, and practice the concepts in programming assignments. Student surveys show that these activities are appreciated by the students, and our evaluations indicate that they have positive effects on learning. We believe that these activities could be useful in any similar course.  The approach to improving the course is action research, and the evaluation has been done using course surveys, self-efficacy surveys, rubrics-like grading protocols, and grades. We have also interviewed teaching assistants about their experiences.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;computational model;computational problem;data structure;dynamic programming;experience;np-completeness;recursion;theoretical computer science;utility	Emma Enström;Viggo Kann	2017	TOCE	10.1145/3018109	simulation;computer science;theoretical computer science;algorithm	Theory	-82.24952633724531	-38.648473212684316	161650

However, many m-Learning systems that have been studied as of late have yet to support a mobile learning course in a seamless manner, thus failing to meet learner expectations. One of the problems of such m-Learning systems is their weakness in motivating learners, in particular, in the continuous feedback of the course. This paper proposes a mobile learning scheduling system that provides environment-related educational courses for learners. The proposed system monitors and evaluates the learning outcomes of learners on a continual basis, and calculates degrees of accomplishment in learning activities that will be applied to the agent's scheduling in order to provide learners with appropriate courses. Such courses enable learners to experience vigorous learning activities through repetitive programs, according to their ability.	failure;scheduling (computing);seamless3d	Keun-Wang Lee;Jong-Hee Lee	2005		10.1007/11424826_92	error-driven learning;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;machine learning;mobile agent;distributed computing;multimedia;mobile computing;scheduling;open learning	AI	-79.60633943466831	-48.60186456999947	162059

In recent years a new direction has been to extend these to support personal development planning (PDP) and student portfolio management. A major limitation of such approach is that the plans and portfolios are owned by the institution, and do not support learning across institutions or in the workplace. We describe the development of an interactive logbook (IL) which provides students with a suite of mobile tools for multimedia note-taking, knowledge sharing, learning management and personal development planning. The IL environment is designed to be owned by the student and offers interoperability with a wide range of existing software for learning and office work.	interoperability	Tony Chan;Dan Corlett;Mike Sharples;Jeffrey Ting;Oliver Westmancott	2005	IEEE International Workshop on Wireless and Mobile Technologies in Education (WMTE'05)	10.1109/WMTE.2005.16	educational technology;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;open learning;virtual learning environment	Robotics	-81.31074707778615	-42.07676334228109	162270

Students may be uneasy with the process due to a lack of communication and peer review skills or to their failure to see value in the process. We describe a communication exercise with peer review in an undergraduate veterinary radiology course. The computer code used to manage the course and deliver images online is reported, and we provide links to the executable files. We tested to see if undergraduate peer review of radiological reports has validity and describe student impressions of the learning process. Peer review scores for student-generated radiological reports were compared to scores obtained in the summative multiple choice (MCQ) examination for the course. Student satisfaction was measured using a bespoke questionnaire. There was a weak positive correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.32, p < 0.01) between peer review scores students received and the student scores obtained in the MCQ examination. The difference in peer review scores received by students grouped according to their level of course performance (high vs. low) was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No correlation was found between peer review scores awarded by the students and the scores they obtained in the MCQ examination (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.17, p = 0.14). In conclusion, we have created a realistic radiology imaging exercise with readily available software. The peer review scores are valid in that to a limited degree they reflect student future performance in an examination. Students valued the process of learning to communicate radiological findings but do not fully appreciated the value of peer review.	awards;bespoke;coefficient;pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome;peer review;radiology;impression (attitude)	Fintan J.

Towards this end, a Microsoft Excel based university-level environmental engineering module was taught in a high school classroom with students in grades 10 through 12. The module focused on understanding the current trends and challenges in environmental pollution management and policy. Students were required to procure, analyze, and visualize data in order to propose an environmental policy that was aimed at reducing pollution. Initial data collected from the assessment of the student work alludes to the fact that despite being taught the same material by the same professor and teaching assistant, the success of the students, as measured by their final grades, varies substantially with their academic year. The underclassmen in high school did not display the academic maturity and comprehension that was displayed by the high school seniors. On the other hand, seniors demonstrated a strong propensity to learn and perform well.	capability maturity model;procurement	Jamie Kennedy;Pramod Abichandani;Adam K.

Recently, a number of projects focused on students’ learning strategies, and initiated work on modeling students’ metacognitive skills, such as self-explanation and reflection. This paper focuses on self-assessment as an important metacognitive skill. We present results of an initial study carried out in the context of SQL-Tutor, a system that helps students to learn a database language. We found that not all students are good at evaluating their own knowledge, and that their knowledge level is an important factor. The study is an initial step towards incorporating the meta-level into the existing student model in SQL-Tutor.	knowledge level;query language;sql	Antonija Mitrovic	2001		10.1007/3-540-44566-8_35	meta-analysis;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;teaching method;database	ML	-78.80279542473768	-48.93043002431796	162973

We believe that more advanced students would like to learn and use these new features. Therefore we run educational research and tried to answer questions like “is it possible to teach basics of programming in object-oriented programming”, “are students of secondary school prepared and willing to learn object-oriented programming” or “can object-oriented programming be useful for them”?

Traditionally, an instructor, temporarily assuming the role of """"supreme arbiter of quality and judgment,"""" applies the mental image of """"excellent"""" as a touchstone, then assigns to each submission a letter grade that is calibrated from that standard. Students rarely understand the mental image. Nor do they regularly experience the contrasts between their own work, the work of peers, and their teacher's standard of judgment, all of which account for differences in perceived quality. What students can neither see nor understand, they rarely reach for or achieve. Other procedures may be used, however, to categorize the relative quality of creative work. Called Quality Evaluation, these operations involve students, as well as their instructors, in acts of contrastive perception and distributed judgment. QE assigns a quantitative measure to a group's conclusions about the relative quality of its member's work. Participating students learn to formulate and gradually to trust their own standards of quality. With increasing rigor and personal commitment, they apply these standards to their own future work.

Through this, it aims to improve the discoverability of learning objects in such LORs through a structured process that supports metadata creation. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents a proposed metadata quality assessment certification process for LORs. The process was designed as a generic approach that may be customized to fit various application domains. Findings – Initial results from the application of the process in the context of a specific LOR report an improvement of the quality of about 11,000 metadata records. More specifically, metadata completeness for all metadata elements used in the repository under examination was significantly improved from 30 percent to 85 percent. Research limitations/implications – The main limitation of the findings is that they come from the application of the proposed process on a relatively small repository, which does not allow safe generalizations without further experimental study in bigger ones where resources and requirements scale up. Practical implications – This paper addresses implications for the development of a repository in the educational domain, identifying issues related to the metadata application profile, the support to domain experts and the mechanisms that may be put in place to support metadata creation. Originality/value – The value and also the originality of the approach presented lies within the fact the proposed approach quantifies issues related to metadata creation and management by studying actions and perceptions of stakeholders who are involved in the repository lifecycle.	application domain;discoverability;experiment;requirement	Nikos Palavitsinis;Nikos Manouselis;Salvador Sánchez Alonso	2014	The Electronic Library	10.1108/EL-12-2011-0175	geospatial metadata;computer science;data mining;database;metadata;world wide web;data element;meta data services;information retrieval;resource;metadata repository	SE	-83.78273056623387	-44.829679048423564	164991

Over the course of several years, 13 modules of a digital libraries (DL) curriculum were developed and were ready for field testing. The modules were evaluated in DL courses in real classroom environments in 37 classes by 15 instructors and their students. Interviews with instructors and questionnaires completed by their students were used to collect evaluative feedback. Findings indicate that the modules have been well designed to educate students on important topics and issues in DLs, in general. Suggestions to improve the modules based on the interviews and questionnaires were discussed as well. After the field test, module development has been continued, not only for the DL community but also others associated with DLs, such as information retrieval, big data, and multimedia. Currently, 56 modules are readily available for use through the project website or the Wikiversity site.	big data;computer science;dls format;digital library;information retrieval;interviews;library (computing);library science;wikiversity	Sanghee Oh;Seungwon Yang;Jeffrey Pomerantz;Barbara M.

Now that video games are increasingly being used for training and learning purposes, stealth assessment could provide an excellent means of monitoring learning progress without the need for explicit testing. However, applying stealth assessment is a complex and laborious process. This paper analyses the limitations of stealth assessment and conceptualizes the requirements for developing a generic tool that could overcome its barriers and accommodate its practical application. Hence, a framework is presented describing its user and functional requirements. The proposed generic solution could open up the wider uptake of stealth assessment in serious games.	color gradient;data logger;functional requirement;machine learning;stealth;unobtrusive javascript	Konstantinos Georgiadis;Giel van Lankveld;Kiavash Bahreini;Wim Westera	2018	2018 10th International Conference on Virtual Worlds and Games for Serious Applications (VS-Games)	10.1109/VS-Games.2018.8493409	task analysis;management science;probabilistic logic;functional requirement;software;competence (human resources)	SE	-78.02328073896241	-45.338427034876325	165602

The hybrid course was structured to include bi-weekly online assignments and weekly meetings in the lecture hall focused on active-learning exercises. To evaluate the effectiveness of the web-based component of the hybrid course, we taught the hybrid course simultaneously with a traditional course in which we used passive lectures to cover material in the online assignments. Both courses received the same active-learning activities in class. Students in the hybrid course reported that the quality of interaction with the instructor was high, that they read the text more often and studied in groups more frequently. Performance on a post-course assessment test indicated that the hybrid course format was better or equivalent to the traditional course. Specifically, online assignments were equivalent to or better than passive lectures, and that active-learning exercises were more effective when coupled with online activities. Performance gains were greater for upperclassmen than for freshmen, indicating that hybrid course formats might be a superior option for upperclassmen when satisfying general science requirements. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Critical systems thinking and especially critical systems heuristics promote the involvement of those affected by an intervention, in the design of the intervention. In the development of a data warehousing module the students, who selected the module as part of their 4th year programme, are viewed as """"affected"""" by the design of the module. This paper reports from a critical systems heuristics point of view, on the perspectives of these students who selected the module. Interpretive data collection by means of written interviews were done. Data were analysed using content analysis. Critical systems heuristics differs from other critical systems methodologies in terms of the requirements of rational argumentation. This paper provides examples of polemical argumentation and how these non-rational arguments are the voices we as faculty members (course designers) should hear.

The laboratory contains an applet that allows students to select an algorithm with a type of data distribution and sample size and view the number of compares required to sort a particular instance of that selection. It provides worksheets for tabulating the results of a sequence of experiments and for entering qualitative and quantitative observations about the results. It also contains a second applet that directly measures the goodness of fit of recorded data with common functions such as cn and cn(lg(n)). The laboratory is intended to reinforce classroom learning activities and other homework assignments with a practical demonstration of the performance of a variety of sorting algorithms on different kinds of data sets. It is a singular on-line tool that complements other online learning tools such as animations of various sorting algorithms and visualizations of self-adjusting data structures. The laboratory has been used in algorithms courses taught by the author at Marist College and Vassar, and is available on-line for use by a more general audience.	analysis of algorithms;applet;carrier-to-noise ratio;data structure;experiment;online and offline;sorting algorithm	James TenEyck	2005			computer science;bioinformatics;machine learning	ML	-83.58324710296603	-38.27045186853065	166846

Less than a megabyte in size, the controlling program permits a teacher with no formal computer training to prepare and modify all elements of the module—topics, subject matter, sequencing and the availability of computer tools and devices. The program displays all materials immediately and permits spontaneous and continuous modification in creation mode where lessons can be linked to each other in larger units, run separately and linked to any executable, batch or graphics files to permit easy integration of other CAL and computer facilities. Users work within, and can be tested on, each MENU lesson and students can become participants in lesson creation and the preparation processes and of any text files within them. A “definition” option permits instructors to expand on and enrich terms within a file or globally throughout the lesson and to link ideas throughout the module. MENU is designed to run on very basic systems to support individuals in the preparation and learning of subject matter and to be integrated into large networks, with tutorial and mail facilities, for classes and students working on group projects. Hyperlinks permit connections among all levels of information and across topics. Help facilities are context-specific and can be created or modified by instructors at each point in the module. The creation elements include display screens, an ascii editor for both lesson creation and as the medium through which instructors and users prepare information within the lessons. Instructors can adapt, modify and expand existing materials and link these to larger modules and all movement within the lesson is accomplished by the cursor. ESC and Enter keys or a mouse. The .dat file within the MENU program permits instructors to make direct connections to display files as their familiarity the creation process increases. MENU permits instructors to create materials specific to their needs and teaching style, to integrate existing lessons, tools and subject matter into modules relevant to their courses and to quickly incorporate students in the preparation of both subject matter and the structuring of lessons for their own projects and to prepare materials for other classes.	batch processing;cal;computer monitor;cursor (databases);dos;executable;graphics;hyperlink;megabyte;spontaneous order;subject matter expert turing test	Paul Beam	1992		10.1145/147001.147027	simulation;computer science;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;operating system;machine learning;multimedia;programming language;world wide web	HCI	-86.59226676460892	-39.51843543042527	167729

To improve teachers' possibilities for intervention at the right time, Open Monitoring Environment allows the teacher to monitor and model the learning process based on the data rising from the current learning setting. Since the amount of data that can be extracted from the learning process is too large and complex for manual processing, there is a need for semi-automated tools to support the reasoning. Various data mining methods were tested with authentic data that was collected from a robotics class in a primary school. In the novel monitoring environment, initial rules produced by the classification algorithm are open for revision by the teacher. We present a proof of concept implementation for the data mining module in the Open Monitoring Environment. Results from the study indicate that decision trees are effective for classifying students' progress in the educational robotics setting, and that open data mining process produces useful and interpretable information about the students' progress with relatively small datasets.	abductive reasoning;algorithm;cluster analysis;data mining;decision tree;educational robotics;experiment;problem solving;semiconductor industry	Ilkka Jormanainen;Erkki Sutinen	2012	2012 IEEE Fourth International Conference On Digital Game And Intelligent Toy Enhanced Learning	10.1109/DIGITEL.2012.14	computer simulation;simulation;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;decision tree;data mining	ML	-77.79704200816604	-49.83479146800788	168028

These learners are motivated and self-aware enough to self-direct their learning, are presumed to be novices with respect to the needed knowledge and have a limited technological uptake. This paper will outline their main differences from regular learners, in particular, for the use of social media to improve learning skills. The reference pedagogical model is andragogy. A Service-Oriented Architecture, named Personal Knowledge Space (PKS), is proposed to support our lifelong learners in selecting, organizing, and retrieving information; in streamlining interaction processes among learners, services and resources and finally in empowering control and trust of personal relationships born during the learning processes. The PKS is mainly based on the exploitation of semantic tools (ontologies) and web services. Use cases describing the PKS architecture and one scenario of PKS use are presented.	knowledge space;ontology (information science);organizing (structure);self-awareness;service-oriented architecture;service-oriented device architecture;social media;web service	Flavio Manganello;Carla Falsetti;Luca Spalazzi;Tommaso Leo	2013	Educational Technology & Society		pedagogy;adult education;computer science;knowledge management;architecture;personal knowledge base;ontology (information science);formal learning;andragogy;lifelong learning;information science	AI	-81.39028184346105	-45.75441925637945	168525

Apart from learning individual DPs and the principles behind them, students should learn how to apply them in real-life situations. Therefore, to make the learning process of DPs effective, it is necessary to include a project component in which students, usually in small teams, develop a medium-sized software application. Furthermore, it is necessary to provide students with means for easy discovery of relevant learning resources and possible collaborators. In this paper, we propose an extensive project-based collaborative learning environment for learning software DPs that integrates several existing educational systems and tools based on the common ontological foundation. The learning process in the suggested environment is further facilitated and augmented by several context-aware educational services.	real life;software design pattern	Zoran Jeremic;Jelena Jovanovic;Dragan Gasevic;Marek Hatala	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04636-0_42	professional learning community;robot learning;proactive learning;collaborative learning;cooperative learning;educational technology;software design pattern;error-driven learning;team learning;blended learning;computer science;knowledge management;ontology;artificial intelligence;data science;experiential learning;semantic web;learning sciences;multimedia;active learning;action learning;open learning;synchronous learning;pedagogy	AI	-80.34293534252016	-45.0548830413016	168832
2562061cc67d6d5e219b0462478fb101fe72ac51	automated grading with a software-checking program in the system dynamics and control curriculum		Automated assessment tools offer benefits to instructors by freeing them from the burden of grading, while improving student self-learning by providing immediate feedback without the need for intervention by an instructor. The power of such tools has become all the more important as new technologies enabling the scaling of knowledge dissemination have arisen, such as with Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In this work, the authors provide guidelines for employing software-checking programs for the automated grading of assignments in the System Dynamics and Control curriculum that may not be immediately suited to such tools. Specifically, techniques are discussed for modifying problems that may involve symbolic or graphical solutions, or that may be more open-ended. The approaches proposed in this paper were piloted in two courses at the University of Detroit Mercy during the Fall of 2016 and the Winter of 2017. In these courses, students wrote their solutions as scripts in the MATLAB programming language within the Cody Coursework environment offered by the MathWorks. Overall, the authors found the use of the Cody tool helpful in the instruction of their courses. The student feedback offered via anonymous surveys was also generally positive regarding this approach. For example, in the absence of a person being available to grade their homework, the students appreciated the availability of the Cody tool (avg. score of 3.91/5). As a side benefit, the students also found that this approach to the course helped improve their general programming skills (avg. score = 3.96/5).	dynamical system;graphical user interface;image scaling;matlab;massive open online course;nonlinear gameplay;programming language;system dynamics;universal instantiation	R.

According to the proposed approach, incremental formalization can be achieved through the consideration of alternative projections of a collaborative workspace, as well as through mechanisms supporting the switching from one projection to another. Related features and functionalities are presented through an illustrative example.	web application;workspace	Nikos I.

How can we encourage them to study more? In this paper, we show that a lot depends on the grading policy. At first glance, the problem of grading may seem straightforward: since our objective is that the students gain the largest amount of knowledge and skills at the end of the class, the grade should describe this amount. We show, however, that it is exactly this seemingly straightforward grading policy that often leads to an unfortunate learning behavior. To improve the students' learning, it is therefore necessary to use a grading policy which goes beyond the straightforward approach. In this paper, we use fuzzy-motivated intuition to formulate selection of a grading policy as a precise optimization problem, and, in the first approximation, provide a solution to this optimization problem. This solution is in line with what experienced instructors are actually doing when grading the class.	mathematical optimization;optimization problem;order of approximation	Olga Kosheleva;Karen Villaverde	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2012.6251153	simulation;schedule;interpolation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;management science;fuzzy set	Robotics	-85.2858174854236	-39.66590782403254	169332

The mEducator EU project will face this lack by implementing and experimenting between two different sharing mechanisms, namely, one based one mashup technologies, and one based on semantic web services. In addition, the mEducator best practice network will critically evaluate existing standards and reference models in the field of e-learning in order to enable specialized stateof-the-art medical educational content to be discovered, retrieved, shared, repurposed and re-used across European higher academic institutions. Educational content included in mEducator covers and represents the whole range of medical educational content, from traditional instructional teaching to active learning and experiential teaching/studying approaches. It spans the whole range of types, from text to exam sheets, algorithms, teaching files, computer programs (simulators or games) and interactive objects (like virtual patients and electronically traced anatomies), while it covers a variety of topics. In this paper, apart from introducing the relevant project concepts and strategies, emphasis is also placed on the notion of (dynamic) user-generated content, its advantages and peculiarities, as well as, gaps in current research and technology practice upon its embedding into existing standards.	algorithm;best practice;computer program;experiment;mashup (web application hybrid);semantic web service;simulation;user-generated content	Panagiotis D.

8436c04d70cea58bc302754f36aa020fc1fe9d11	an enhanced semantic vle based on schema.org and social media		After the arrival of the web in the 1990s, educational institutions started to maintain their learning materials within Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), as the web is a significant source of material for many students and teachers. However, there has been less development in the current VLEs in the past few years, which remain heavily centred on single institutions even though the web has been developing (e.g., web 2.0, web 3.0). There is a clear need to integrate VLEs with the wider and social Web and maintain its learning contents freely open in order to support the sharing and reuse of learning resources. In this PhD project, we have prototyped a simple VLE that makes use of Version 7 of the Semantic Content Management System (SCMS) Drupal in order to provide a more open, social and semantically structured learning environment. Essentially, we aim to add semantic markup based on Schema.org vocabularies (the semantic markup that is supported by major search providers including Bing, Google, Yahoo! and Yandex), and integrate social networking and media to develop and enhance VLEs by improving sharing, discovering and reusing of learning contents. announced the new innovation of Schema.org. This PhD project focuses also on our proposal to Schema.org by proposing additional concepts to describe VLEs' content with rich semantic information due the limited support for describing educational resources in the current schema. This proposal aims to extend to the previous work that has been included in the schema by The Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI) in order to provide an enhanced approach to describe learning contents with rich semantic data in a VLE context. Through this thesis project, we will introduce, describe, evaluate and discuss the prototyped VLE in order to demonstrate the advantages of social and semantic web technologies for VLEs. We demonstrate how an advanced SCMS such as Drupal can offer advantages over existing VLE platforms in terms of: sharing of learning content with social networks; provision of advanced media features. We also demonstrate how Drupal's support for schema.org can be used to enhance the findability of on-line learning content, and propose enhancements to schema.org that will make it more relevant to the needs of learning platforms. This proposal has been evaluated by schema.org and LRMI and a working group set up to take the proposal forward.

The difficulty increases as you wish to attend to a greater number of traits in the trainees, for example, their predominant learning styles and their conditions of disability, to cite some cases. A valid alternative to include different profiles of students and to evaluate the type of materials available is to simulate students with different characteristics and evaluate the relevance of available educational resources. This article presents an interactive tool that supports the teacher in this task, simulating the behavior of students through agents, providing each one with different learning styles and special education needs related to any disability condition. The multi-agent system recommends learning objects (LO) stored in a repository, according to the preferences of agents, which were guide by rules defined according to their characteristics and associated with the metadata of the resources. The appropriate materials are chosen for all students selected by the teacher.		Luis Felipe Londoño;Néstor D.

Learning patterns enables students to quickly gain the intellectual and coding skills they will need to embrace the future of parallel and distributed computing (PDC). Exemplars consisting of representative and compelling applied problems, together with implementations in different parallel technologies, constitute a valuable resource for learning and teaching. Parallel programming patterns and exemplar applications naturally complement each other, and together provide a unified and practical strategy for PDC education at multiple course levels. We present two strategies we have used for incorporating patterns into undergraduate CS courses, examine the potential of exemplars, and indicate how patterns and exemplars reinforce each other.	best practice;diagram;distributed computing;parallel computing;programme delivery control;programmer;software design pattern	Joel C.

There are 2 other languages that need to be learned by Malaysian that is Mandarin and Tamil. Mandarin was chosen in this study because Chinese is the second largest ethnic group in Malaysia and most of the Asian countries. Learning Mandarin is becoming essential to secure more job opportunities as most of the employers emphasize Mandarin as one of the requirements in recruiting employees. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the issues concerning the learning Mandarin language for Malaysian children and to develop a learning model based on current instructional design model for teaching and learning of Mandarin language for children. The prototype computer game in learning Mandarin will validate and refine this model. For this study, questionnaires has been distributed to parents and children (4 to 8 years old) to evaluate the effectiveness of learning Mandarin by playing computer games for children who are not using Mandarin in daily basis. According to the survey, parents agreed that children learning Mandarin by playing computer games is a new way of teaching and learning. Learning using computer game found to be better and easier for young age children to understand Mandarin as it is more interesting compare to traditional learning. This prototype shows that the children could talk in basic Mandarin as daily language by studying through computer games. Therefore, this study will increase the learnability of Mandarin language for children by playing computer games.	learnability;pc game;prototype;requirement;super robot monkey team hyperforce go!

To help address those difficulties, we designed a tutorial worksheet similar to those published by the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington. In this activity, students were introduced to electric potential and compared and contrasted it to voltage. As electric potential and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law are closely related, we assumed learning about potential would help students gain a better qualitative understanding of voltage. Post-test and exam data from an introductory circuits course show that after the tutorial many students still had difficulties with voltage and potential. More than three quarters of the responses concerning voltage and potential were inconsistent. This suggests that most students were unable to link those two concepts. We therefore conclude that potential and voltage remain conceptually very different for students in their learning process. As tutorial worksheets have proved to be very effective in students overcoming conceptual difficulties, it is likely that there are specific difficulties with these concepts that have not yet been identified.	electrical engineering	Dion Timmermann;Christian H.

This work describes a web application interface (called SIMPEL), developed to integrate the MOODLE (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) with an academic information system. The SIMPEL benefit goes beyond the mere creating synchronization between academic data and teaching/learning resource. It improves several functionalities which are lacking in the MOODLE such as the capability to use the most of input from the academic information system, presenting the sequence of activities and providing the facility to design different activities to different group of students. In this work, Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) are combined as an approach to develop the SIMPEL. The implemented SIMPEL is analyzed in the teaching/learning activities at Department of Electrical Engineering University of Lampung (Unila) during the trial period and the result showed that SIMPEL can properly perform its functionalities to guide students and teachers in their activities.	bridging (networking);correctness (computer science);electrical engineering;information system;interoperability;model-driven architecture;requirement;service-oriented architecture;web application;web service	Mardiana Araki;Keijiro Araki	2012	2012 International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET)	10.1109/ITHET.2012.6246037	synchronization;innovation management;computer science;knowledge management;software engineering;service-oriented architecture;multimedia;law;world wide web	HCI	-81.68594602369114	-43.65072964007778	172042

Novel approaches and tools to support effective and efficient workplace learning in collaborative and engaging ways are needed. On the other hand, Business Process Management (BPM) is more and more employed to support and manage the complex processes carried out within organizations. We propose to use BPM also to drive workplace learning, with the advantage of aligning real tasks to training tasks. We introduce a specification of learning path that maps BPM tasks and activities into sequences of learning tasks that can be customized to learners competence. The learning path specification can be used to both drive learning sessions, and to inform a monitor that can assess learner’s progress. We describe a platform that is under development, and provide a simple motivational example to illustrate the approach. The goal is to combine work and learning in natural and effective way.	beam propagation method;business process model and notation;learning pathway;map;recommender system;simulation	Venkatapathy Subramanian;Antonia Bertolino	2016		10.5220/0005815301720180	proactive learning;error-driven learning;knowledge management;artifact-centric business process model;business process management;machine learning;business process model and notation;process management;business process;action learning;business process modeling;active learning	ML	-80.0357374580685	-45.97161559254848	172221

Justification for the project is given in terms of existing deficiencies with 'space-less' text-based synchronous communication methods and tools. Initial survey results of a large class of students who have used a variety of synchronous tools for small group learning are presented, these show a student preference for synchronous voice over text. It is argued that this preference will increase with increasing student familiarity with synchronous voice.

It is hard for learners to be aware of the knowledge incompleteness. Our approach to this problem is to enable them to publish their knowledge to get reviews from peers. However, it is not easy for the peers to review the published knowledge. This paper addresses the issue of how to help the peers review the published knowledge compared with their knowledge. Such comparative assessment could be driven with consciousness of the difference between the learners' knowledge and the peers' knowledge. This paper also describes a case study whose purpose was to ascertain whether the comparative assessment could be facilitated. The results suggest that peer review with consciousness of the knowledge difference produces more comments appropriate and effective for learners.	consciousness;knowledge management;norm (social);peer-to-peer	Akihiro Kashihara;Yasuhiro Kamoshita	2007	Seventh IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT 2007)	10.1109/ICALT.2007.147	knowledge survey;technical peer review;organizational learning;autodidacticism;peer review;knowledge integration;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;data science;body of knowledge;data mining;database;procedural knowledge;peer feedback;electronic publishing;personal knowledge management;world wide web;domain knowledge	Robotics	-79.54456974971188	-42.44960552192797	173111

7be29d9ba04b00f30c81f9ae1b3bd5a08611dbd0	inspecting quality of games designed for learning programming		Educational games are specific piece of slow technology that enables students to enhance their competences through fun and play. Taking into account their features, games are widely used in diverse educational settings, including programming. This paper discusses findings of the empirical study that was carried out with an objective to examine quality of two educational games meant for learning programming concepts. Participants in the study were students from two Croatian higher education institutions. Subjective data was collected with pre- and post-use online questionnaires whereas objective data was gathered with reports in the form of in-game progress screenshots. The analysis of collected data uncovered: (1) to what extent students with different background knowledge differ in their perception of programming and attitudes towards using games for educational purposes, and (2) which pragmatic and hedonic facets of quality are relevant for the assessment of games designed for learning programming.

Users who access and use OERs could be classified into one of these three groups: instructor, student and self-learner. To provide personalized lists of OERs according to the user profile and personal preferences, the user should be characterized by an open and scalable model. In this paper, an open linked vocabulary is proposed to describe user profiles of the open educational resources, which take into account the challenges and opportunities that an open and extensible platform as the Web can provide to learn about the OER users, and from this knowledge, offer the most appropriate resources.	best practice;knowledge-based recommender system;open content;personalization;requirement;scalability;user profile;vocabulary;world wide web	Janneth Chicaiza;Nelson Piedra;Jorge López-Vargas;Edmundo Tovar Caro	2015	2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2015.7344314	computer science;knowledge management;multimedia;world wide web;open learning	Web+IR	-81.96151618429022	-45.72583453811624	174760

The process differential is the addition of ‘how to use’ the available knowledge of its authors (who), localisation (where), and content (what), that are commonly used. The hypothesis is that the apprentice will achieve a reduction in the time dedicated to studying a specific subject, as well as obtain more comprehensive knowledge of the subject studied. The experimental use of the prototype developed showed evidence that the hypothesis can be confirmed. In the attempt to evaluate both the impact of the use of KC in the learning of the community members, and the feasibility of the proposed system, a prototype was developed, and experiments were carried out with a group of graduate students at PESC/COPPE-UFRJ.

Therefore, the correspondence between education demand and offer should be a subject of continuous monitoring, especially in current highly dynamic work environment of age of knowledge economy. Monitoring in different systems is used with the purpose to achieve their effective functioning with respect to the goals of these systems. The monitoring in educational domain is challenged by qualitative nature and diversity of information that should be analyzed to obtain the meaningful monitoring results. The paper proposes architecture of education demand and offer monitoring information system, which encompasses services for handling diverse textual information from various sources at different levels of automation.

Here we present a model to represent competence structures in a flexible conceptual model called CSP (Core, Setting, Personal), which in fact is a meta-model of competence models. The main concepts are flexibility, domain-independency and traceability in creating individual competence-profiles for practical usage. The model has been exemplified by populating it with mathematical competencies about linear and exponential growth as a specific domain. This domain has been used in an e-assessment and the results have been analyzed by basic IRT statistics. The correlation between the CSP-assessment and a classical assessment has been calculated. Some first individual competence profiles have been created semi-automatically and seem to be promising to provide fast and precise feedback to students and teachers.	item response theory;metamodeling;metaobject;population;semiconductor industry;time complexity;traceability	John-Harry Wieken;Peter Forbrig	2014		10.1145/2637248.2637275	simulation;knowledge management;competence	AI	-79.72270779025062	-45.924789829198836	175915

E-mail tandem exchanges have allowed learners to engage in active communicative contact with native speakers of their target language, but research around these exchanges has suered due to diculties with data collection. This paper describes a web-based tandem language learning environment the authors have developed which eliminates these diculties. In particular, the paper discusses the pedagogical advantages of the speci®cally designed web-based environment over traditional e-mail tandem exchanges. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The BASICS Study (Barriers and Supports to Implementing Computer Science) brings rigor to this issue by building on instruments developed to measure implementation and factors affecting implementation of math and science programs, and customizing them for use with Exploring Computer Science (ECS). One goal of the 2-½ year BASICS Study is to provide the computer science education community with tools to systematically and rigorously measure computer science program implementation components, like student engagement. Aligning efforts in computer science around data collection and description can support the collective effort to grow and sustain computing education.  This poster reports on BASICS Study Year 1 findings about factors related to student engagement in ECS classes. The sample includes 232 students from eight public high schools in Chicago and Washington, DC. Student questionnaire data collected focused on: 1) Student engagement, 2) Teacher instruction, 3) Student attitudes, and 4) Other student characteristics, such as grade, gender, race/ethnicity, and previous computing experience. Analyses included multi-factor confirmatory factor analysis to examine the validity of the measures, and multiple linear regression analysis to estimate the effects of teacher instruction and student attitudes on engagement. Results indicate teacher instruction significantly positively affects student engagement in ECS classes. Some student attitude variables are also significantly related to student engagement, but there was no significant variation in engagement across gender or race/ethnicity categories.	computer science;confirmatory factor analysis;race condition	Sarah J.

A significant problem with the Web as a learning environment is that it does not adapt to the needs of the individual learner. VALIENT is an attempt to add a degree of adaptability to the Web. VALIENT combines conventional Web-based delivery with what are termed Intelligent Learning Environments – virtual learning spaces for experiential learning. The intelligence in these environments is provided by a set of intelligent agents which monitor learner performance. By communicating with a custom servlet running on the Web server, these intelligent agents can cause web-based material to be presented to the learner that are adapted to that learner’s current learning requirements.	intelligent agent;requirement;server (computing);web application;web server;world wide web	Lynne E.

Visuohaptic simulations of point charges and their interactions were developed. Thirty-eight undergraduate students from a physics lab course were recruited to participate in an educational study. Half of the students were assigned to a visuohaptic (VH) group where they could see as well as feel interaction forces rendered with a Falcon force-feedback device. The other half of the students were assigned to a visual (V) group where they could interact with the same simulation via a computer mouse but did not feel any forces. Results from a 10-question content test showed that both groups benefited from the computer simulation. There were no statistical differences between the VH and V groups, presumably due to the relatively small number of participants who completed quantitative assessments. However, qualitative results from observations and interviews indicated that students in the VH groups were more motivated and engaged in the lab activities, reported more positive attitude towards learning, and felt more confident about their understanding and retention of knowledge. Our findings have been used to design a larger-scale study that will further investigate the use of visuohaptic technology in nanotechnology education.	computer mouse;computer simulation;falcon;haptic technology;interaction	Jaeyoung Park;Kwangtaek Kim;Hong Z.

The Learning Management Systems (LMS) are technological platforms that allow the realization of these spaces in a cooperative cloud of e-learning. In the present paper it is highlighted that despite the fact that organizations agree to cooperate with each other, to develop virtual learning communities, the generation of these spaces are not common, for this reason the paper raises the Ho hypothesis: The LMS present inability to cooperating to generate virtual learning communities that are developed among multiple organizations. The main objective in the present work is to corroborate the hypothesis raised, for which the problem is described and also to review the state of the art is made, noticing that it appears recurrently. Besides, the degree of fitness in current LMS is valued, verifying if they possess functionalities in their architectures to enable communities in a cooperative cloud of e-learning. This paper is useful for organizations that want to develop cooperative learning tasks for their members (students, teachers, directors) given that it identifies functional requirements that LMS must attend in order to make such communities possible. In this paper the problem is divided in variables that facilitate its comprehension and allow validating the hypothesis raised.	cooperative multitasking;functional requirement;management system;verification and validation	Julio César Rodríguez Ribón;L.

Pedagogically, these activities should be connected and well-integrated in a coherent environment. Faced with the increasing demand of medical school faculty and for online delivery of course materials, we designed an integrated and generic lesson model. This was implemented in an original virtual-learning environment. The platform was programmed within an object-oriented content management system embedding a workflow engine. This paper provides a description of the lesson model and the comparative evaluation of its usage by students of two medical curricula. Web usage mining techniques were applied to identify navigation patterns. The monitoring of student behavior in terms of usage is discussed to help student follow-up and optimize tutoring arrangements.	coherence (physics);content management system;data mining;educational curriculum;embedding;follow-up report;generic drugs;schools, medical;web mining;workflow engine	Pascal Staccini;Michel Joubert;Marius Fieschi	2006	AMIA ...

To tackle this problem, plagiarism detection tools are especially useful, not only in popular thinking as a deterrent for students, but also as an educational tool to raise students' awareness of the offence and to improve their academic skills. Commercial text matching tools (e.g. Turnitin) are at a high level of maturity. These tools offer the ability to interact with students, making them suitable for an educational objective. Additionally, they can be readily integrated into learning environments enabling uniform application at an institutional level. On the other hand, computer source code matching tools, despite their successful detection performance, are mostly used as standalone tools that are difficult to adopt at an institutional level. The research presented in this paper describes the trial and evaluation of a tool that is seamlessly integrated into the Moodle virtual learning environment. The tool provides code similarity scanning capability within Moodle so that institutions using this learning environment could apply this tool easily at an enterprise level. Additionally, the educational aspects available in text matching tools have been added into the tool capability. The tool relies on two popular code matching services, MOSS and JPlag, as underlying engines to provide good code similarity scanning performance. The evaluation of the tool from both academics' and students' perspectives indicates a considerable level of interest in using the tool, and supports the suitability of this tool for wider institutional adoption in the computing education community.	capability maturity model;computer programming;feedback;high-level programming language;map overlay and statistical system;overhead (computing);plug-in (computing);prototype;usability	Tri Le;Angela Carbone;Judithe Sheard;Margot Schuhmacher;Michael de Raath;Chris W.

Authoring tools and test banks for E-tests are becoming an integral and indispensable part of E-learning platforms and with the implementation of E-learning standards, such as IMS QTI, E-testing material can be easily shared and reused across various platforms. With the knowledge available for re-use and exam automation comes a new challenge: making sure that created exams are free of conflicts. A Conflict exists in an exam if at least two questions within that exam are redundant in content, and/or if at least one question reveals the answer to another question within the same exam. In this paper we propose using Information Retrieval techniques to detect conflicts within an exam. Our solution, ICE (Identification of Conflicts in Exams), is based on the vector space model relying on tfidf weighing and the cosine function to calculate similarity. ICE also combines the hybrid recommendation techniques of the EQRS (Exam Question Recommender System) in order to propose replacements for conflicting questions.	file synchronization;information retrieval;java;qti;randomness;recommender system;redundancy (engineering);tf–idf	Hicham Hage;Esma Aïmeur	2006	IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, 2006.	10.1109/AICCSA.2006.205207	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;automation;software engineering;machine learning;database;multimedia;vector space model;computer security;recommender system	DB	-84.85654642087509	-44.98354941235017	177407

This paper investigates question authoring, where students create practice questions as a preparation activity prior to an exam, in an introductory programming context. The key contribution of this study as compared to previous work is an improvement to the design of the experiment. Students were randomly assigned the topics that their questions should target, removing a selection bias that has been a limitation of earlier work. We conduct a large-scale between-subjects experiment (n = 700) and find that students exhibit superior performance on exam questions that relate to the topics they were assigned when compared to those students preparing questions on other assigned topics.	randomness;selection bias	Paul Denny;Ewan D.

151bbe24edfa5fd01cc7974e10975f6a07f06915	david — a model of data visualization for the instructional design		The quality of distance learning courses is determined by the proper organization of the teaching material and methodology. However, it should be taken into account, among other factors, the history of successes and failures of previous achievements of a course, as well as the profile of the new classes of students. This work proposes a data visualization model based on the Learning Analytics of a course, that allows the teacher to incorporate improvements in new editions of the course based on previous editions of the same. The model also applies to the monitoring the progress of the students at runtime of a course and identify possible problems in the instruction design, witch can be adapted dynamically.	data visualization;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Douglas Afonso Tenorio de Menezes;Diogo Lima Florencio;Renato Ely Domingues Silva;Isabel Dillmann Nunes;Ulrich Schiel;Marcus Salerno de Aquino	2017	2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)	10.1109/ICALT.2017.97	data visualization;distance education;data modeling;learning analytics;instructional design;data science;computer science	Visualization	-80.23728475322713	-39.48695061996263	177553

OOPS is a problem-solving environment in which students can resolve Object Oriented Programming exercises. The system applies an assessment for learning strategy where students are formatively assessed, i.e. OOPS diagnoses their knowledge level but also generates feedback and hints to help students to understand and overcome their misconceptions and to reinforce correctly learnt concepts. In conjunction with OOPS, we have used SIETTE, a web-based assessment system in which students can take tests and teachers can construct them Subsequently, we have explored whether or not the use of OOPS contributes to improve the students’ knowledge about Object Oriented Programming. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As a solution, Connectivism states the finding of nodes, for example other people having specific knowledge, in order to share required information. Based on mathematical models, this contribution presents a generic solution to support these processes. So-called Co3 channels automatically connect people within communication channels according thematic relation (For example, does the user has general or specific interest about the topic?) and thematic competence (Does the user has any experiences and achievements in this area?), tutor competence (How active is the user within the system and has he ever helped other people?), and seeker relation (Does the user fit seeker’s preferences according social connection, communication type, and others?). The practical realization of the concept is shown by means of a live chat tool that is embedded into a learning environment.	algorithm	Ingolf Waßmann;Ebram Sherif	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-58509-3_32	connectivism;mathematical model;machine learning;thematic relation;artificial intelligence;learning environment;information technology;information overload;tutor;computer science;communication channel	ML	-78.8499204346372	-43.915284385184734	177779

A valid, wieldy and reliable evaluating strategy is very important. We describe an evaluating strategy for student's assessment based on his portfolios, learning objects' hierarchy and his learning procedure in e-learning. In addition, we analyse the scoring patterns varying as a function of the pragmatic import of student's score and alternative assessment techniques. Subsequently, we define two functions as marks of student assessment by applying the usage model of Markov, learning objects' technology and alternative assessment techniques, which is on the basis of learning objects' hierarchy and learning process. We also discuss the procedure of establishing evaluating model. At last, we probe into the new strategy's application and evaluate its performance by comparing with the experimental results. We also analyse the problem of the evaluating strategy for student assessment.

These benefits should be extended to systems that work in ill-defined domains, especially in simulation environments. This paper presents ideas for understanding how ill-defined domains change the tutoring dynamic in simulated environments and proposes some initial extensions to GIFT that accommodate these challenges.	computer simulation;gift	James Thomas;Ajay Divakaran;Saad M.

After attending the e-learning course, students assessed the e-learning course through an anonymous questionnaire. The study results present the positive attitude of the students towards the e-learning course in Health Informatics. The current e-learning course is easy to use, and it is preferred on the same extent as the hybrid one (e-learning and in-class learning combination). The majority of the participants believed that the e-learning method is at least the same or more efficient compared to the traditional learning approach. Based on the study findings, it seems that this e-learning course could offer important advantages on the learning process as long as it helps students learn in a more effective manner than traditional learning.	health occupations;informatics (discipline);optimism	Spyros Zogas;Konstantinos Birbas;Gregory Chondrocoukis;John Mantas	2018	Studies in health technology and informatics	10.3233/978-1-61499-880-8-317	medical education;health informatics;medicine	HCI	-78.28245538594892	-40.48942537647425	178629

The subjects for the main study were 209 voluntary graduate students at the National Institution of Development Administration, Bangkok, Thailand. Two forms of CB TEC (Form A and Form B), with the only difference in Section II, were used with 105 participants taking Form A and 104 participants taking Form B. The participants also completed a questionnaire to assess face validity of the CB TEC and took the TOEFL ITP. The reliability coefficient, facility index, discrimination index of CB TEC were performed on the data. Pearson's correlation and regression analysis were employed. The results indicated that both forms of CB TEC had high reliability, high criterion-related validity, and high face validity. A concordance chart of the CB TEC scores and the TOEFL scores was presented.	coefficient;concordance (publishing);enlightenment foundation libraries;test case	Somsak Boonsathorn	2016	2016 15th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET)	10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760716	face;simulation;artificial intelligence;mathematical model;reliability;software testing;statistics	SE	-86.0319405833345	-40.71934572857965	179036

Since all these domains are well structured, the instructional material to self-explain can be clearly defined. We are interested in investigating whether self-explanation can be used in an open-ended domain. For this purpose, we enhanced KERMIT, an intelligent tutoring system that teaches conceptual database design. The resulting system, KERMIT-SE, supports self-explanation by engaging students in tutorial dialogues when their solutions are erroneous. We plan to conduct an evaluation in July 2002, to test the hypothesis that students will learn better with KERMIT-SE than without self-explanation.	database design;deep learning;kermit (protocol);nonlinear gameplay	Amali Weerasinghe;Antonija Mitrovic	2002		10.1109/CIE.2002.1185914	computer science;knowledge management;deep learning;multimedia;database design	AI	-80.97866074858841	-39.82944781801247	179375

Students were divided into two groups that were differently instructed. The control group was instructed in the traditional way while the experiment group was instructed with the aid of RAM diagrams employed throughout the course. Examination results from the two groups were compared. Statistical analysis was done and the Z value was calculated. The results suggest that the use of RAM diagrams improves programming comprehension and programming skills.	diagram;list comprehension;random access;random-access memory;statistical model	Leonard J.

Aiming at improving users' conceptual understanding of course material, a navigation structure was built among concepts, and each concept is presumed to have at least one concept instance which is provided by a Web answer system based on natural language which was integrated in this system. Then users would browse through the linked resources under those particular concepts as well as related concepts and get a better understanding of the material in the course. The kernel of such function was a domain knowledge base which was composed of concepts and relationship between them. Ontology was introduced as a mechanism to guide the establishment of this base. At last, a method of extracting concepts and relationship between them by using machine learning algorithms were presented.	algorithm;browsing;concept map;experiment;knowledge base;machine learning;natural language;ontology (information science);supervised learning;text mining	Qinghua Zheng;Yanye Wang;Zhibin Huang;Feng Tian	2008	2008 12th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design	10.1109/CSCWD.2008.4537127	natural language processing;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;machine learning;database;natural language	AI	-82.97256588433876	-46.3263966273923	181011

As compared with conventional CAI systems, web-based learning environments are able to accumulate a huge amount of learning data. As a result, there is an urgent need for analyzing methods of discovering useful information from the huge log database for improving instructional effectiveness. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the historical browsing data to reconstruct a browsing model that enables teachers to identify some interesting or unexpected browsing patterns in student’s learning process, and therefore might provide knowledge for teachers to reorganize their web structure for effectiveness. For this purpose, we had developed an analysis tool based on data mining technique. The constructed browsing model includes a set of document clusters and sequence rules among those clusters. Finally, an application of the analysis is conducted on a real database collected from three web-based courses in Ming Chuan University, Taiwan. Through this case study, we investigate the effectiveness of the analysis tool, and some revelations are presented and discussed.

The study is validated by collecting data from two consecutive editions of the course, one in which the MOOC was used and other in which it was not. Additionally, a comparison of the students' satisfaction and involvement is also made including the on-line learners. The grades, based on a research project presentation and report, are significantly higher for the face-to-face students when using the on-line material (MOOC). In terms of perception through a SEEQ questionnaire, the students with access to the MOOC had statistically significant difference regarding class rhythm and number of practical cases conducted during the course, in comparison with the face-to-face students without access to the MOOC.	finite element method;massive open online course;online and offline	Ricardo Castedo;Anastasio P.

It is not only an important concept but also one that is difficult to master. This paper focuses on the problems that novices experience when they first encounter this concept. Three assignments from introductory courses are analyzed, to understand why abstraction is difficult for novices. This analysis leads to a number of guidelines that can be used by instructors to support novices learning abstraction.	computer science	Herman Koppelman;Betsy van Dijk	2010		10.1145/1822090.1822140	recursion;computer science;theoretical computer science;abstraction;multimedia;programming language;pedagogy	AI	-82.41567638339325	-38.0650240525823	182378

There is significant tension between students learning mathematics for understanding and students learning to drill a set of algorithms to solve standard ODE exercises. This paper presents the Framework for Relational Understanding of Procedures, a categorization of assessable conceptual knowledge. Example conceptual knowledge we examine in this project include relating a graphical representation of an ODE to a symbolic one, checking a result, and knowing why a particular solution method might be applicable. We applied this framework to three techniques taught in Ordinary Differential Equations: separation of variables, solving a first order linear ordinary differential equation, and Euler's method and developed a set of assessment items. These assessment questions were then transformed into knowledge pieces and moved into an online platform and elaborated. Thus, the assessment can be administered either in traditional pencil-and-paper form or through a learn-as-you-assess online web site.	algorithm;categorization;euler method;open dynamics engine	Karen Allen Keene;Michael Glass;Jung Hee Kim	2011	2011 Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	10.1109/FIE.2011.6143074	computer science;knowledge management;machine learning;online assessment;mathematics;world wide web;differential equation	AI	-78.46720798462502	-46.59391465401769	183628

Decentralisation, direct and interactive communication, personalization and context are among the features of P2P systems that could be beneficial to groupware systems. In particular, such features can support monitoring, awareness, social networking and scaffolding in group collaboration. In this work we present an analysis of advantages in using P2P networks to better support group collaborative processes. In our analysis, P2P groupware systems are conceived as a convergence of several views: contextual computing, social media and semantic web. The contextual computing is an important ingredient to capture the context of the collaboration in a multi-dimension way, including workspace context, documents and information context, time and location contexts, etc. The social media is also considered important for an effective collaboration of peer group, to support members with efficient and scalable communication techniques in social interaction among members. The semantic web concepts and use of languages such as RDF/S enable the representation and reasoning with the diverse range of information required by the P2P middleware and the awareness services. We focus in particular how to achieve event-based awareness in P2P groupware systems that includes different forms of awareness. The user and technical requirements are first derived with reference to Project-Based Learning in P2P learning environments, which is the learning setting that we consider in our work. We then present our computational model for supporting group awareness in such environments and discuss how it meets the identified user and technical requirements.	awareness;collaborative software;computation;computational model;middleware;peer-to-peer;personalization;requirement;scaffold (programming);scalability;semantic web;social media;triplestore;ubiquitous computing;web application;workspace	Fatos Xhafa;Alexandra Poulovassilis	2011	2011 International Conference on Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies	10.1109/EIDWT.2011.42	computer science;knowledge management;spatial contextual awareness;computer-supported cooperative work;social semantic web;multimedia;world wide web	Web+IR	-80.52377401653996	-44.14255191554938	184528

In this way, painful constructions of ITSs, which are not reusable, may be avoided. However, the construction of an authoring tool is associated with many problems, such as the generality of the techniques incorporated, domain-independence, effectiveness for the prospective authors (instructors), and effectiveness for the students who will use the resulting ITSs. In this paper we will report on an empirical study that we conducted in order to design and develop WEAR, an ITS authoring tool for Algebra-related domains. In the study we investigated several aspects concerning the attitude and behaviour of both students and instructors. The study revealed important issues and was then used for the specification of the design of WEAR. A brief description of the developed system is also included in the paper so that the way that the design specifications were put into practice may be shown. However, a lot of the authoring tool’s requirements that came to light could be applicable to other authoring tools as well. The most important requirement of this kind was the need for an instructor corresponding author	knowledge acquisition;programming paradigm;prospective search;requirement;requirements analysis;software development process;tree accumulation;world wide web	Maria Moundridou;Maria Virvou	2003	Computers & Education	10.1016/S0360-1315(02)00119-7	psychology;social science;simulation;human–computer interaction;g factor;multimedia;sociology;empirical research;world wide web	HCI	-83.6417605054776	-40.205058985765	185185

Prior research has focused upon using a set of tests to assess the use of a student's demographic, psychological and cognitive traits as predictors of performance. But these traits are static in nature, and therefore fail to encapsulate changes in a student's learning progress over the duration of a course. In this paper we present a new approach for predicting a student's performance in a programming course, based upon analyzing directly logged data, describing various aspects of their ordinary programming behavior. An evaluation using data logged from a sample of 45 programming students at our University, showed that our approach was an excellent early predictor of performance, explaining 42.49% of the variance in coursework marks - double the explanatory power when compared to the closest related technique in the literature.

Such a model is a framework containing important concepts, processes and relations. Several models have been published but their development, which we call educational modelling, still is a tedious process. We lack clear guidelines or a methodology. In this article we present a case study in which we take first steps towards the development of a methodology for educational modelling. We do so by analysing our current practice that we typify as expert-driven, modelcentred and consensus-based. We explicate the assumptions under this approach and investigate whether these assumptions are explicit and confirmed by our case study. The results give rise to a number of guidelines that can be used by future projects and that provide a first step towards a more systematic approach to educational modelling.	process (computing);relation (database)	Bas Giesbers;Jan van Bruggen;Henry Hermans;Desirée Joosten-ten Brinke;Jan Burgers;Rob Koper;Ignace Latour	2007	Educational Technology & Society		psychology;educational technology;computer science;systems engineering;knowledge management;evaluation;instructional design;management science;educational evaluation;information technology;cooperation;educational assessment;statistics;pedagogy;preprint	SE	-83.59271966911055	-42.67803241448783	185939

In particular, it provides a flexible approach to represent, process, and transact complex multimedia objects which are referred to as Digital Items (DIs). DIs can be quite generic, independent of the application domain, and can encompass a diversity of media resources and metadata. This flexibility has an impact on the level of interoperability between systems and applications, since not all the functionality needs to be implemented. Furthermore, additional semantic rules may be implemented through the processing of the Digital Item which is possibly driven by proprietary metadata. This jeopardizes interoperability and consequently raises barriers to the successful achievement of augmented and transparent use of multimedia resources. In this context, we have investigated and evaluated the interoperability at the semantic level of Digital Items throughout the automated production, delivery and consumption of complex multimedia resources in heterogeneous environments. This paper describes the studies conducted, the experiments performed, and the conclusions reached towards that goal.	application domain;digital item;experiment;interoperability;mpeg-21;multimedia framework	Christian Timmerer;Maria T.

Integrating this type of software in learning process is a problem that we are solving by suggesting a new way to describe this software and introduce a framework that helps to form learning resource from it. We propose the concept of creating new advanced type of generative learning objects (GLOs) that changes not only structure of content presentation for different purposes (described by the contexts' parameters) but also it changes the way of learning and evaluating. The object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm is used for combining concepts of GLO and learning objects (LO) based on information object to formulate our proposed approach. In this article we describe the principles of generating the interdisciplinary learning resource for a master program's learning course. Also we provide example of scientific software (transport schedule optimization) and show how it should be described for being used in learning process.	ivo lola ribar institute;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;problem domain;programming paradigm;simulation	Maria Karpova;Vadim Shmelev;Alexey V.

In this paper, we report the results of an exploratory pilot study conducted to assess the effectiveness of Case-Based Learning (CBL) methodology in facilitating the learning of several RE concepts. The evaluation was made on the basis of graduate studentsu0027 responses to a set of questions representing various key learning principles, collected after the execution of two CBL sessions at DA-IICT, Gandhinagar (India). We investigate the perceived effectiveness of CBL in studentsu0027 learning of various RE concepts, based on factors like case difference, gender diversity, and team size. Additionally, we collect and analyse the Teaching Assistantsu0027 (TAs) opinions about the conducted CBL sessions. The outcome of this CBL exercise was positive as maximum students were able to achieve all the five stated learning objectives. The authors also report various challenges, recommendations, and lessons learned while experiencing CBL sessions.	cbl index;composite blocking list;organizing (structure);requirements engineering;software engineering	Saurabh Tiwari;Deepti Ameta;Paramvir Singh;Ashish Sureka	2018	2018 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Software Engineering Education for Millennials (SEEM)	10.1145/3194779.3194791	knowledge management;curriculum;requirements engineering;principles of learning;software;computer science;teaching method;gender diversity	SE	-78.19072550204245	-38.99086608367239	187095

Recent standardization efforts in e-learning concentrate on the reuse of learning material, but not on the reuse of application or system functionalities. The LearnServe system under development at the University of Muenster builds on the assumption that a typical learning system is a collection of activities or processes that interact with learners and suitably chosen content, the latter in the form of Learning Objects. This enables us to divide the main functionality of an e-learning system into a number of stand-alone applications or services. The realization of these applications based on the emerging technical paradigm of Web services then renders a wide reuse of functionality possible, thereby giving learners a higher flexibility of choosing content and functionalities to be included in their learning environment. In such a scenario, it must, however, be possible to maintain user identity and data across service and server boundaries. This paper presents an architecture for implementing user authentication and the manipulation of user data across several Web services.

However, laboratory applications have generally been neglected in recent educational environments for a variety of reasons. In order to address this gap, this study examined the effect of a virtual chemistry laboratory (VCL) on student achievement among 90 students from three different ninth-grade classrooms (an experimental group and two control groups). Study data were gathered with pre and post chemical-changes unit achievement (CCUA) Test, laboratory equipment test (LET), and unstructured observations. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS (version 16.0). Comparisons were made within and between groups. It was concluded that the developed virtual chemistry laboratory software is at least as effective as the real laboratory, both in terms of student achievement in the unit and students’ ability to recognize laboratory equipment.	experiment;spss;visual component library (vcl)	Zeynep Tatli;Alipasa Ayas	2013	Educational Technology & Society		mathematics education;qualitative comparative analysis;educational technology;social science;semi-structured interview;computer science;engineering physics;observation;statistics;pedagogy	Visualization	-79.20090811075318	-39.4330451067053	188423
d7acb86c444cc65818df6392b18893692de93157	an ontology-driven approach for developing learning object repository for construction using semantic web.		The arrival of new technologies makes learning content out of date and thus often leads to #R##N#reinventing the wheel.  The  concept of learning objects  is the  basis  of a  new instructional #R##N#design paradigm for  e-learning that  puts the  emphasis  on reuse  as  a key  characteristic of #R##N#learning  activities.  In  the  last  decade,  several  efforts  towards  the  standardisation  of #R##N#learning technology have resulted in the emergence of specific terminologies that are used #R##N#to  name  and classify  learning elements. Most of these  efforts underline the importance of #R##N#providing  metadata  information for  content  in  a standardised  format  as  a  crucial  step  to #R##N#reusability.  Most  of the  current  learning  object  repositories  provide  room  for  metadata, #R##N#but lack a semantic model that clearly establishes what a learning object is  and what their #R##N#associated  metadata  such  as  pedagogy  should  be.  The  lack  of semantics  in  learning #R##N#objects  also  affects  the  interoperability, sharability  and  reusability.  Semantic Web  based #R##N#solution facilitates the easy integration and identification of meaningful interrelationships, #R##N#represents  and  uniquely  identifies  the  digital  resources,  and  improves  the  search #R##N#precision. However,  Semantic Web has not fully applied to e-learning and particularly for #R##N#developing  and  delivering  reusable  learning  objects.  Therefore  this  research  brings #R##N#novelty  by  developing  an  ontology  for  construction  domain  in  order  to  share  and  reuse #R##N#construction learning objects.  Furthermore, it develops an ontology-driven Semantic Web #R##N#based  learning  object  repository  for  construction  by  integrating  pedagogical  concepts #R##N#within  the  construction  education  ontology.  The  thesis  presents  the  design  and #R##N#implementation issues of the core functions of the repository. Results from the evaluation #R##N#indicated that  acceptance rate  of the  repository  is  low in  the  academic setting.  Therefore #R##N#strategies for the acceptance of innovation by the potential users and communities have to #R##N#be developed in order to improve the acceptability of the learning object repository	semantic web	Pathmeswaran Raju	2009			computer science;knowledge management;data mining;world wide web;synchronous learning	AI	-82.96288094363508	-44.53148988537876	188816

The high level of drop out percentage has been a problem at Helsinki University of Technology for many years. This course has yearly enrolment of 500-600 students and the drop out percentage has varied from 30-50 percents.Since we did not have clear picture of drop out reasons we conducted a qualitative interview research in which 18 dropouts from the CS1 course were interviewed. The reasons of drop out were categorized and, in addition, each case was investigated individually. This procedure enabled us to both list the reasons and to reveal the cumulative nature of drop out reasons.The results indicate that several reasons affect students' decision to quit the CS1 course. The most frequent reasons were the lack of time and the lack of motivation. However, both of these reasons were in turn affected by factors, such as the perceived difficulty of the course, general difficulties with time managing and planning studies, or the decision to prefer something else. Furthermore, low comfort level and plagiarism played a role in drop out. In addition, drop out reasons cumulated.This study shows that the complexity and large variety of factors involved in students' decision to drop the course. This indicates that simple actions to improve teaching or organization on a CS1 course to reduce drop out may be ineffective. Efficient intervention to the problem apparently requires a combination of many different actions that take into consideration the versatile nature of reasons involved in drop out.	categorization;high-level programming language	Päivi Kinnunen;Lauri Malmi	2006		10.1145/1151588.1151604	simulation;time management;operations management;management;social psychology;statistics;cumulant	ML	-77.67662563437457	-39.29861473103973	189599

Multiple parameter cluster analysis is conducted by the k-means clustering algorithm which takes as input seven important users' characteristics in order to initialize the process. The clustering is conducted by k-means clustering algorithm, which takes as input multiple user characteristics. The incorporation of k-means clustering is used to address several barriers posed by the heterogeneous learning audience of educational systems. After determining in which cluster each new student belongs, the system can reason about this specific student, adapting its behavior to the student's needs, performance and preferences.	algorithm;cluster analysis;emergence;k-means clustering;machine learning;natural language processing	Christos Troussas;Maria Virvou;Efthymios Alepis	2013	IISA 2013	10.1109/IISA.2013.6623714	natural language processing;algorithmic learning theory;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;consensus clustering;cluster analysis;stability;brown clustering;active learning;generalization error;conceptual clustering	AI	-80.56188584300934	-47.95558909052224	190796

The OCA pattern provides ways to capture the dynamics of entrepreneurial work-relations in the emerging 'work-portfolio society', increase the transparency of the entire value chain of economic activities, and create prosumer value loops that can support multi-dimensional bartering and increase the opportunities for marginalized groups of people to create value together. The paper ends by demonstrating how to use the OCA pattern to transform a traditional educational institution into an Opportunistic Learning Activity Broker that could help to bridge the gap between formal and informal learning.	knowledge society	Ambjörn Naeve	2010	IJMBL	10.4018/jmbl.2010100103	psychology;social science;telecommunications;information science;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;semantic web;sociology;world wide web;pedagogy	AI	-82.19121076152706	-42.59125108541988	191611

However, these selected learning objects in many cases are not adequate to student’s profiles. Hence, the construction of adaptive e-learning recommender systems considering student cognitive characteristics requires customized searches to support teaching-learning processes. The use of intelligent agents is useful in order to get better results when learning objects are stored in large volume of repository federations. Thus, this paper proposes a model for learning object searching retrieving, recommendation, and evaluation modeled through the paradigm of multi-agent systems, called BROA. Finally, some results obtained from the BROA system are presented and discussed.		Paula Rodríguez;Valentina Tabares Morales;Néstor D.

219f9750b24b05e781acefb324e5431b6b6161e1	adaptive content sequencing for e-learning courses using ant colony optimization		Learners often get overwhelmed by the availability of large volumes of learning content in web-based educational systems. This content is presented to the learners either statically or with numerous hyper-links for navigation. The choice of content varies according to the requirements. Hence a static sequence of contents cannot satiate different learners enrolled in a course. Sequencing content according to the learners’ needs is the objective of designing adaptive systems. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is an evolutionary technique that takes into account the dynamic nature of the problem and employs collective intelligence to provide optimized solutions. An ACO based algorithm Adaptive Content Sequencing in eLearning (ACSeL) is proposed in this paper that evaluates the level of a learner and recommends appropriate concepts to him/her. It is sensitive to the changes in learning behaviours of each learner and fine-tunes its strategies to recommend the next concept accordingly. The behaviours of past learners are captured and utilized to recommend content to prospective learners.	adaptive system;algorithm;ant colony optimization algorithms;categorization;collective intelligence;prospective search;real life;requirement;web application	Richa Sharma;Hema Banati;Punam Bedi	2011		10.1007/978-81-322-0491-6_53	ant colony optimization algorithms;machine learning;adaptive system;collective intelligence;artificial intelligence;computer science	Web+IR	-80.98464617992366	-45.66001044399031	192524

The context considered is Computer Based Human Learning Environnement (CBHLE) in a self-learning by doing mode. This approach, that we put in work and test in the setting of a self-learning system for an algorithmic language, is founded on the representation of the teaching domain as domain ontology on the one hand and on errors classification and detection on the other hand. The evaluation process that we recommend is structured in four stages, starting from the learner solution form analysis (that consists at this step of our research to a lexico-syntactic analysis) and finish with the update of the learner model, while passing by a semantic analysis and a marking process.  After a brief introduction of the main aspects raising of the CBHLE domain to which we refer here, we develop our approach of the learners evaluation problem, while especially insisting on its independence of the teaching domain and on the possibility to take in account answers to open questions, freely built by the learner. We also present, at the end, the results of the algorithmic self-learning system development, where the main stages of our evaluation approach are implemented.	algol;item unique identification;lexico;ontology (information science);parsing	Farida Bouarab-Dahmani;Malik Si-Mohammed;Catherine Comparot;Pierre-Jean Charrel	2009		10.1145/1529282.1529303	natural language processing;computer science;artificial intelligence;evaluation;machine learning;parsing;programming language;world wide web	NLP	-78.62366161002218	-47.67440202233616	192693

Although the students as a whole had positive attitudes, the results were not consistent between instructors; in particular, the students in one of the courses were significantly less positive about pair programming. The implications of instructor-based differences in attitude are discussed.This paper also examines the relationship between student confidence and attitudes toward pair programming. The most confident students liked pairing the most, while the least confident students liked it the least. This finding contradicts results that have been reported elsewhere.	pair programming	Brian Hanks	2006		10.1145/1140124.1140156	simulation;pair programming;computer science;software engineering	HCI	-78.15197622388955	-39.88465049517982	193159

We conclude that online education in general-and asynchronous online education in particular-is comparable to face-to-face education but different in many respects. The differences represent both hazards for teachers to avoid (and to help students to avoid) and opportunities for learning. This paper suggests ways to make the best of these differences, discusses the effects of the flexible schedule afforded by asynchronous instruction, explains the need to anticipate different student expectations, offers advice on time management and participation for both teachers and students, and discusses the value of archived class discussions.	archive;dos;exception handling;fingerprint	Keith Grant-Davie;Dave Hailey	2014	2014 IEEE International Professional Communication Conference (IPCC)	10.1109/IPCC.2014.7020340	educational technology;simulation;technical communication;computer science;multimedia;management;world wide web;synchronous learning;online participation	Visualization	-77.49024225695148	-38.60697418589249	193274

The platforms are designed and developed to encourage the nontextbook learning of EC concepts through active learning in role-playing games. We describe the overall design and development of some EC platforms used for undergraduate business and management students at PolyU. Our experiences indicate that students like the practical components of the course and are interested in a nontextbook approach to learning by playing games. We believe that other business colleges with EC curricula will benefit from this approach.	e-commerce payment system;prospective search	Eric W. T.

78d09792eae60e5a9a301d211a2580fb87327fa9	improving world wide web educational uses promoting hypertext and standard general markup language content-based features	distance education;pedagogy;distance learning;internet;cognition;standard generalized markup language;world wide web;language;educational application;markup language	Behind the characteristics that make use of the WWW easy and attractive lie the hypertext and standard markup languages (HTML--SGML), metalanguages for defining the syntax of markup languages. The fundamental principle that makes it possible to share information through the WWW with independence of environment, is based on the standard encoding of documents. Most current educational applications do not fully exploit the flexibility offered by what lies at the core of the WWW, the language HTML. A discussion of different taxonomies of educational uses of the WWW is followed by the presentation of an alternative taxonomy that aims to reflect the contribution of HTML. This is a double classification that distinguishes between the educational context, where the innovation brought by the WWW is mainly technological, and new contexts promoted by the WWW that could not exist without it. From this it is possible to envisage two lines of future work. First to analyse the educational possibilities offered by the current definition of HTML and to propose ways to use them in particular applications. Second, to provide the specifications and requirements to develop instructional tools to make use of the educational possibilities of the language. An example of the latter is provided by the developmental work being undertaken to provide language support as part of a Socrates--Lingua project. This has led to the conclusion that the present definition of HTML is insufficient for the organization of all the data required in educational applications. Instead an extended markup using SGML is recommended as the way forward for designers	add-ons for firefox;data dictionary;galatea;html element;hypertext;internet;memory segmentation;parsing;requirement;standard generalized markup language;usability;www;world wide web	Baltasar Fernández-Manjón;Alfredo Fernández-Valmayor	1997	Education and Information Technologies	10.1023/A:1018613330173	ruleml;distance education;xhtml;synchronized multimedia integration language;html;html5;collaborative application markup language;computer science;database;multimedia;wireless markup language;world wide web	Web+IR	-83.38887553414223	-44.35723135848791	193449

The course consists of three modules delivered online and two classroom seminars; the syllabus includes scholarly information resources, ways to obtain literature, and criteria to evaluate publications. For evaluation purposes, a multimethod approach was used: The students completed an information literacy knowledge test and three standardized information search tasks (ordered by ascending difficulty) before and after taking the course. A sample of N = 67 undergraduate Psychology students (n = 37 experimental group, n = 30 waiting control group) participated in the course. As it was expected, students’ knowledge test scores as well as performance in the search tasks improved markedly during the course. Results are discussed with regard to the soundness of the evaluation criteria used and to further development of the course.	experiment;information literacy;multiple dispatch	Nikolas Leichner;Johannes Peter;Anne-Kathrin Mayer;Günter Krampen	2014		10.5220/0004795103530359	psychology;mathematics education;distance education;blended learning;information literacy;multimedia;pedagogy	NLP	-77.6339681823533	-41.1459919561647	193489

However, better findability is still expected for open educational resources and open courseware, so online guidance and services that support users to locate the appropriate such resources are most welcome. Recommender systems have a very valuable role in this direction. We propose here a hybrid architecture that combines enhanced casebased recommending (driven by a quality model tenet) with (collaborative) feedback from users to recommend open courseware and educational resources.	computer science;federated search;findability;opencourseware;prototype;recommender system;taxonomy (general)	Monica Vladoiu;Zoran Constantinescu;Gabriela Moise	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40495-5_68	case-based reasoning;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;multimedia;world wide web;recommender system	Web+IR	-83.43162027697302	-41.26388462647121	194136

Findings show that ALN-mediated groups had broader discussions and submitted more complete reports than their manual counterparts. There was no difference in the ability to transfer information from the discussion to the report, in both conditions about 15% of issues mentioned in the discussion were omitted from the final group report. In terms of coordination, face-to-face teams covered the case study questions sequentially and efficiently, like items on a meeting agenda. Asynchronous groups were more focused on solving their general disagreements than on the worksheet questions and adopted parallel and pooled coordination strategies to put together the report.	asynchronous i/o	Raquel Benbunan-Fich;Starr Roxanne Hiltz;Murray Turoff	2001		10.1109/HICSS.2001.926189	educational technology;the internet;simulation;field experiment;content analysis;computer science;knowledge management;artificial intelligence;database;multimedia;management;law;world wide web	HCI	-78.45125047520649	-41.180890691077856	194588

But the substantial impediment to its promotion as effective e-learning facility lies in the continuously increasing postings but with discrete and incoherent structure as well as the loosely-tied learners with response-freeness. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to automatically discover special interest groups within discussion forums. Once a learner becomes a member of a special interest group, he will be informed of other learning companions to enhance their in-depth communication and learning, and the newly-emerged related information will be proactively pushed to him as well. Furthermore, by identifying the posting themes and types, this paper presents a semantic search to assist learners navigating through well-structured and coherent postings to meet their learning demands. The proposed approach has been integrated into a discussion forum, and the experimental results show that the approach is feasible and efficient, enabling the effective discovering of interest groups and proper demand-driven navigational guidance.	coherence (physics);semantic search;workspace	Yanyan Li;Mingkai Dong;Ronghuai Huang	2008	2008 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence)	10.1109/IJCNN.2008.4634359	navigation;special interest group;information exchange;computer science;knowledge management;machine learning;multimedia;world wide web;artificial neural network	Robotics	-83.38136746827325	-46.3717791438962	194645

In implementation, accorded with the sharable content object reference model (SCORM) standard, constructs the manifest and metadata via component concept. Besides, the resource list using application data objects (ADO) technology can communicate between the authoring tool and the learning object repository for previewing and downloading learning objects from the remote learning object repository. Here, we develop a SCORM - compliant learning object authoring tool, including the friendly user interface. We can download learning resources from the remote learning object repository and we can add in manifest, on the other hand, we can describe learning content at the same time.

Thus we are developing and implementing a methodology that considers the main agents in this architecture. The BDI architecture applied in this study was based on Jadex. In addition this platform is standalone and goal oriented thus facilitating the implementation of the proposal. The results of the message exchange between agents and the goals to adapt the interface of the AVA according to the identified profile are presented in this article.	ava radio company;agent architecture;belief–desire–intention software model;multi-agent system	Gustavo Pereira Mateus;Beatriz Wilges;Luiz Claudio Duarte Dalmolin;Silvia M.

Recently, game design and development for education has moved into different fields of science, including biology. Several multi-media interactive products have been developed to simulate biological mechanisms and can be used by undergraduate students. However these approaches focus on students as game users and, not as game developers. Here, we propose an innovative approach to involve game design and development into undergraduate biology classroom. The approach assumes no additional background, and aims to increase engagement in the complexities of the course material through the process of game design and development. We initialized a case study that systematically combines a game application-driven project into genetics teaching. In the pedagogical experiment, undergraduate biology and computer science students designed educational games to enhance the speed and depth of comprehension of both biological and software engineering concepts. The result of this study shows that the reinforcement effects of biological education games apply differently on students with or without biology backgrounds.	computer science;simulation;software engineering;video game design;video game developer	Yunkai Liu;Mary Vagula;Stephen T.

While a number of rubrics exist to benchmark best practices in online teaching, advances in learning management technology are expanding opportunities for utilizing data analytics to effectively and efficiently monitor instructional quality. At present, learning management systems can track logins, activity patterns and time-on-task, but this represents only a fraction the possibilities. Predictive modeling may soon allow for more integrated analytics that can quickly and easily inform evaluations of online teaching.	benchmark (computing);best practice;login;online machine learning;predictive modelling	B.

Capturing these patterns of influence may enable an educator to ameliorate some of these factors, or for governments to adjust social policy accordingly. In order to understand these factors, we have undertaken the exercise of predicting student performance, using a cohort of approximately 8,000 South African college students. They all took a number of tests in English and Maths. We show that it is possible to predict English comprehension test results from (1) other test results; (2) from covariates about self-efficacy, social economic status, and specific learning difficulties there are 100 survey questions altogether; (3) from other test results + covariates (combination of (1) and (2)); and from (4) a more advanced model similar to (3) except that the covariates are subject to dimensionality reduction (via PCA). Models 1-4 can predict student performance up to a standard error of 13-15%. In comparison, a random guess would have a standard error of 17%. In short, it is possible to conditionally predict student performance based on self-efficacy, socio-economic background, learning difficulties, and related academic test results.	dimensionality reduction	Norman Poh;Ian Smythe	2014	2014 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining (CIDM)	10.1109/CIDM.2014.7008698	mathematics education;field-effect transistor;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;predictive modelling;computational model;statistics	ML	-85.72619492037369	-41.61550652671603	197582

They need to maintain certain competence levels related to physical, mental, and firefighting and rescue skills in order to provide the public with a high level of emergency service. Fire and Rescue Services need to maintain an overview of the current competences of their personnel and to react when there is a competence gap. This poster presents our approach to using competence modelling, learner models, learning analytics, and visualisations in order provide insight into competence status and development on the individual, team, and organisation level, and to provide early-alerts and automated messages to instructors responsible for planning training activities, as well as to team leaders responsible for making decisions about teams in high stakes situations.	high-level programming language	Cecilie Johanne Slokvik Hansen;Barbara Wasson;Hans Skretting;Grete Netteland;Marina Hirnstein	2017		10.1145/3027385.3029461	simulation;engineering;knowledge management;multimedia	AI	-77.77139023317604	-45.395929340292376	197788

For these problems, learners build up their own understanding of a target area and plan to solve problems based on their own understanding. We call this type of learning Problem-Solving Oriented Learning (PSOL). We develop a system for supporting those processes. The fundamental philosophy of our approach is to encourage learners' awareness and reflection of their work, especially his/her errors or mistakes, to allow development of strong problem-solving and learning skills. This paper addresses fundamental issues of reflection in PSOL. In this paper, we first describe our basic philosophy to achieve the goals. Then, we analyze the characteristics of problem-solving oriented learning and describe our open learner modeling environment based on the analysis. Lastly, we describe the systemization of principle knowledge (called reflection task ontology) for reflection support and illustrate interactive processes between the learner and system based on the ontology.

To get students to understand the relationships that appear in a given mathematical problem, it is necessary to explain the meanings of a set of equations using various methods: visual explanations using 2D and 3D graphs, economical explanations using words, and mathematical explanations using math expressions. In mathematical explanations, both concrete example values and calculations in variable symbols are used, depending on the situation. To make it possible to generate such a variety of explanations, we introduce the idea of mathematical concepts and apply it in our proposed method. Our proposed semantic explanation and symbolic computation approach has enabled us to automate various versions of the explanation from many angles.	apply;symbolic computation	Yukari Shirota	2005	Third International Conference on Creating, Connecting and Collaborating through Computing (C5'05)	10.1109/C5.2005.4	symbolic computation;xml;simultaneous equations;xslt;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;semantic web;database;virtual reality;programming language;world wide web	Robotics	-85.7018375214666	-38.473669865372365	199931
