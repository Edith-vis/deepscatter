Tuning the tabla is a difficult task and it takes several minutes for an expert to tune the tabla, so that each part sounds effectively. For an untrained musician, it may take several hours for tuning the tabla, and sometimes effective tuning is not possible. For effective tuning of the tabla, a piezoelectric sensor is placed at various points near the rim of the tabla. The piezoelectric sensor measures the variation of strain on the membrane of the tabla. The voltages measured at the various points near the rim of the tabla are sent to an ADC which is interfaced to a microcontroller. The set of readings at various tap points are made under tuned condition, and they are used for reference. By comparing these stored reference values and those obtained from similar tap points in an untuned tabla, the closest match is made and the best tuning achieved.	microcontroller;performance tuning;piezoelectricity	S.

d9fc33c5874da0fb79072f422dadeab038a67bf3	multistage and multilevel power electronic converter-based power supply for plasma dbd devices		This paper presents the development and performance evaluation of a compact-converter-based power supply for plasma dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) devices. The developed power supply is designed to meet weight and size requirements for applications in aeronautical systems. Multistage and multilevel switch-mode converters are employed to construct the power supply. The multistage part of the power supply is constructed from multiple dc–dc boost converters that have their inputs fed by rechargeable batteries. The outputs of the dc–dc converters are used to feed different levels of a single phase cascaded $H$ -bridge (CHB) multilevel dc–ac converter. The switching signals for the CHB dc–ac converter are generated to facilitate the adjustments of the magnitude and/or frequency of the output voltage. Such adjustments are set to allow manipulating the generated plasma body force. A prototype for the multistage multilevel power supply is constructed for performance evaluation using a fiberglass DBD device. Performance results show an effective generation and control of plasma body force, which can be achieved by a modular, lightweight, and compact size power supply.	ac adapter;boost converter;computers in human behavior;defective by design;discharger;multistage amplifier;performance evaluation;plasma active;power electronics;power supply;prototype;rechargeable battery;requirement	Saleh S.

Initially, the generated transporter can be formed by a dark soliton. It can be tuned and attenuated to a single photon by bright soliton control and transmitted into an optical link. The molecule transportation states can be identified by using a single photon state of the transporter, which can be formed in the transmission line. The proposed device can be fabricated using  InGaAsP/InP , and can provide the required output signals. The design system consists of a nonlinear microring/nanoring resonator system incorporating an add/drop filter and a quantum signal processor. In applications, the proposed system incorporating a quantum processor can perform secure molecular communication as part of a molecular communication based data network.	transmission line	Muhammad Arif Jalil;Bunjong Piyatamrong;Somsak Mitatha;Jalil Ali;Preecha P.

Although in literature some algorithms aimed at determining the best configuration to be settled for a given shadowing pattern have been presented, no indications about the electrical conditions that can trigger the reconfiguration procedure have been discussed. In this paper some criteria for understanding if the photovoltaic array working conditions have changed, so that a new electrical connection among the modules can increase the produced power, are discussed. Moreover, some conditions revealing that the reconfiguration process can be delayed are analyzed as well. Simulation results are used for achieving the results shown in the paper and give some indications for improving the criteria formulated herein.	algorithm;electrical connection;shading;simulation;vii	Pietro Luigi Carotenuto;Patrizio Manganiello;Giovanni Petrone;Giovanni Spagnuolo	2014	2014 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2014.6865008	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Arch	65.5070976042581	41.68807911633472	76420

However, the frequencies typically present are <;5 Hz, hence requiring physically large devices. A promising solution utilizes a magnetic spring, but these exhibit a non-linear relationship between force (and hence resonant frequency) and displacement. This paper describes a design for implementing a linearized magnetic spring. Finite element analysis is used to model this device and compare against those reported in the literature. Simulation results indicate that, compared to the state-of-the-art, this design exhibits improved linearity (2%) across a wider displacement range (±25 mm). A prototype has been fabricated, and the simulation results experimentally validated.	bioinformatic harvester;displacement mapping;experiment;federal enterprise architecture;finite element method;nonlinear system;potential method;prototype;resonance;sensor;simulation	Hui Huang;Geoff V.

The load supplied is based on the photovoltaic panel and wind turbine, while the fuel cells are back-up for compensating possible power load shortage. The surplus of power produced will be stored in a hydrogen tank by an electrolyzer system when the PV panel and wind turbine produce more power than required. The capacitor banks are used in parallel with other sources in order to reduce DC bus variation. Matlab software is chosen for the hybrid system simulation.	backup;cell (microprocessor);hybrid system;hydrogen;matlab;simulation	Omid Palizban;M. A.

Distributed maximum power point tracking (DMPPT) is a very promising technique that allows the increase of efficiency and reliability of such systems. Modeling and designing a PV system with DMPPT is remarkably more complex than implementing a standard MPPT technique. In this paper, a DMPPT system for PV arrays is proposed and analyzed. A dc and small-signal ac model is derived to analyze steady-state behavior, as well as dynamics and stability, of the whole system. Finally, simulation results are reported and discussed.	maximum power transfer theorem;shading;simulation;small-signal model;steady state;system analysis	Nicola Femia;Gianpaolo Lisi;Giovanni Petrone;Giovanni Spagnuolo;Massimo Vitelli	2008	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.924035	control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;engineering;electrical engineering;photovoltaic system;control theory;physics	EDA	64.82092478107629	38.13142423144135	76853

Safety, in terms of stimulators' electrical performances, can be related mainly to two factors; the zero-net charge transfer to tissue and the heat generated by power dissipation at tissue. This paper presents a safety ensuring neuro-stimulator for retinal vision prostheses, featuring precise charge balancing capability and low power consumption, using a 0.35 μm HV (high voltage) CMOS process. Also, the required matching accuracy of the biphasic current pulse for safe stimulation is mathematically derived. Accurate charge balance is achieved by employing a dynamic current mirror at the output of a stimulator. In experiments, using a simple electrode model (a resistor (R) and a capacitor (C) in parallel), the proposed stimulator ensures less than 30 nA DC current flowing into tissue over all stimulation current ranges (32 μA-1 mA), without shorting. With shorting enabled, further reduction is achieved down to 1.5 nA. Low power consumption was achieved by utilising small bias current, sharing of key biasing blocks, and utilising a short duty cycle for stimulation. Less than 30 μW was consumed during stand-by mode, mostly by bias circuitry.	arabic numeral 0;biasing;blocking (computing);cmos;capacitor device component;current mirror;duty cycle;electronic circuit;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;equilibrium;experiment;flow;interface device component;matching;performance;resistor device component;retina;retinal implant;retinaldehyde;sleep mode;sodium;visual prosthesis;voltage	Hosung Chun;Yuanyuan Yang;Torsten Lehmann	2014	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TBCAS.2013.2257171	embedded system;vision;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;biological engineering	EDA	57.08305998057183	45.495261395288736	76886

The environment, however, is a rich source of energy that, when harnessed, can replenish the otherwise exhausted battery. The problem is harvesters generate low power levels and the electronics required to transfer the energy to charge a battery can easily demand more than the power produced. This paper presents how a 1 × 1 mm2 0.7-μm BiCMOS vibration-supplied electrostatic energy-harvesting system IC produces usable energy. The IC charges and holds the voltage across a vibration-driven variable capacitor CVAR so that ambient kinetic energy can induce CVAR to generate current into the battery when capacitance decreases, as the plates separate. The precharger, harvester, monitoring, and control microelectronics draw enough power to operate, yet allow the system to yield (experimentally) 1.27, 2.14, and 2.87 nJ per vibration cycle for battery voltages at 2.7, 3.5, and 4.2 V, which at 30 Hz produce 38.1, 64.2, and 86.1 nW. Experiments further show that the harvester system prototype charges 1 μF (emulating a small thin-film Li Ion) from 3.5 to 3.81 V in 35 s.	bicmos;bioinformatic harvester;cvar;duty cycle;emulator;energy drift;experiment;microelectromechanical systems;prototype;sensor;system time	Erick O.

The energy conservation requirement leads to symmetrical transcapacitances in contradiction to the commonly accepted approaches. The transcapacitance symmetry is completely independent of device symmetry. The resulting small-signal capacitances are reciprocal. Reciprocal capacitances are often considered charge nonconservative because they do not contain transcapacitances, but in this approach reciprocity is the result of transcapacitance symmetry and the charge conservation problem is avoided since the charge-based model includes the transcapacitances. A method for dividing the MESFET gate charge into gate-drain and gate-source portions based on the energy conservation rule is developed, and the method is applied to the well-known Statz gate charge as an example.

We prove that the swing dynamics and the branch power flows, coupled with frequency-based load control, serve as a distributed primal-dual algorithm to solve OLC. We establish the global asymptotic stability of a multimachine network under such type of load-side primary frequency control. These results imply that the local frequency deviations on each bus convey exactly the right information about the global power imbalance for the loads to make individual decisions that turn out to be globally optimal. Simulations confirm that the proposed algorithm can rebalance power and resynchronize bus frequencies after a disturbance with significantly improved transient performance.	aggregate data;computer simulation;diffusing update algorithm;ibm power systems;load management;maxima and minima;multimachine;operating point;self-balancing binary search tree	Changhong Zhao;Ufuk Topcu;Na Li;Steven H.

Traditional droop control enables the decentralized regulation of the local voltage and frequency of the microgrid by the inverters. The droop method also enables the inverters to share the real and reactive power required by the loads. This paper focuses on some of the limitations of parallel islanded single phase inverters using droop control. Algorithms with the aim to address the following limitations in islanded operation were proposed: reactive power sharing and reduction of the voltage harmonic distortion at the point of common coupling (PCC). Experimental results were then presented to show the suitability of the proposed algorithms in achieving reactive power sharing and in improving the voltage harmonic distortion at the PCC.	algorithm;approximation;characteristic impedance;circuit restoration;control flow;control system;experiment;inverter (logic gate);microgrid;nonlinear system;portable c compiler;power inverter;steady state;total hi def;total harmonic distortion	Alexander Micallef;Maurice Apap;Cyril Spiteri Staines;Josep M.

The fault-tolerant topology consists of a five-leg converter, with a shared leg connected to a generator phase and to its corresponding grid phase. The main contribution of this paper consists on the development of an alternative vector-control-based pulse-width-modulation (PWM) control scheme for both machine-side converter (MSC) and grid-side converter (GSC), allowing to reduce the dc-bus voltage ratings. Moreover, a reliable fault diagnosis algorithm is also integrated, providing the information required to instantaneously trigger fault-tolerant remedial strategies, without any additional sensors. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant PMSG drive.		Imed Jlassi;Fernando Bento;António J.

The 12-pulse topology is known to be more expensive, but produce the least input current harmonics. However, the latter statement is completely true under balanced line conditions. In practice, the lines are inherently unbalanced. Hence, the question of whether the 12-pulse rectifier will indeed perform better in terms of the harmonics injected to the line is still under on-going discussions. This paper presents the modeling and simulation of both rectifier topologies to compare their input current harmonics. The rectifiers are modeled using OrCAD Pspice and several common cases of line conditions will be simulated to compare their harmonic levels. Results of the simulations pertaining to their Total Harmonic Distortions for each case will be explored.	balanced line;distortion;rectifier;simulation;unbalanced circuit;unbalanced line	Arief Hernadi;Taufik;Makbul Anwari	2008	2008 Second Asia International Conference on Modelling &#x00026; Simulation (AMS)	10.1109/AMS.2008.88	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;harmonics	EDA	64.00459215192612	41.599279260097944	78098

The non linear load is a diode rectifier feeding a (R, C) parallel load. The proposed method is based on two self tuning filters placed in both feedback and feedforward loops dedicated to eliminate the 5th and the 7th harmonics frequency. The feedforward loop consists in two branches, one to remove the 5th harmonic and the other one to remove the 7th harmonic frequency. The use of self tuning filters simplifies the control scheme by reducing the number of extraction filters used in classical feedback and feedforward loops.

The system is power electronic based, with converters being used to interface both the sources and loads to the system. The nanogrid is controlled using dc-bus signaling (DBS), a distributed control strategy in which the control nodes, the source/storage interface converters, induce voltage-level changes to communicate with the other control nodes. This paper explains the control structure required for the converters to permit the use of DBS, and explains a procedure for implementing a system-wide control law through independent control of the source/storage interface converters.

Lithium batteries in 3C products or electric vehicles must rapidly charge and discharge. Thus, the inner temperature increases rapidly, which is a safety issue. Conversely, over charging results in unstable voltage and current. Hence, timely monitoring and safety management of data for temperature and voltage inside a lithium battery have become a popular issue. In this work, flexible micro temperature and voltage sensors were integrated in a coin cell using the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) process for in situ monitoring of temperature and voltage.	control theory;discharger;laptop;microelectromechanical systems;mobile phone;personal digital assistant;sensor	Chi-Yuan Lee;Shuo-Jen Lee;Chien-Te Hsieh;Ming-Shao Tang;Jia-Yi Lin;Yi-Man Lo;Pei-Chi Chen;Dar-Yuan Chang;Ruey-Shin Juang	2011	2011 6th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems	10.1109/NEMS.2011.6017338	lithium;nanotechnology;microelectromechanical systems;forensic engineering;physics	Robotics	57.17239168159304	42.87519305802526	78400

The worsening switching noise caused by parasitic resistance and inductance due to high-switching operation can also be alleviated by the proposed ac ripple detector. Furthermore, the dual modulation method can speed up the load transient response since the switching frequency can increase to 5 MHz during the transient period. At very light loads, the switching frequency is always kept higher than the acoustic frequency to avoid noisy sound. Experiment results show that the converter operates at 5 MHz using a small inductor of 1 μH. The load transient response time is shorter than 3 μs when load current changes from 150 to 450 mA or vice versa. Power efficiency is kept higher than 85% over a wide load current range. Specifically, light efficiency can be raised to about 45% above that of the conventional design.	acoustic cryptanalysis;clock rate;electric power conversion;modulation;parasitic element (electrical networks);performance per watt;response time (technology);ripple effect;system on a chip	Jen-Chieh Tsai;Tsung-Ying Huang;Wang-Wei Lai;Ke-Horng Chen	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537750	control engineering;electronic engineering;buck converter;computer science;electrical engineering;control theory;switched-mode power supply;energy conversion efficiency	Visualization	62.21325308133315	44.81901580090476	78736

The ability of modern variable-speed wind turbines to rapidly modify its active and reactive power is exploited in order to provide additional support to the power grid and enhance the overall stability of the system. A set of control loops are incorporated to the wind farm in order to achieve three supporting tasks: short-term frequency regulation, oscillation damping and voltage regulation. The analysis contemplates the effects of different loading conditions, measurement/communication time delays and control loop gains. Bifurcation diagrams, eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear time-domain simulations are used to assess the power system dynamics. The main contribution of this work is the assessment of wind farm ancillary services on the bifurcation structure of the power system.	bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;control system;nonlinear system;simulation;system dynamics;tf–idf;voltage regulation	Gustavo Revel;Andrés E.

The proposed modified current source inverter (MCSI) can operate with most pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques and with a variable mod­ ulation index, since the dc link inductor current freewheels on itself and not through the CSI. The use of variable modulation index control results in faster response times with no penalty on input power factor as compared to other variable modulation index schemes. This paper confirms this by investigating the input characteristics of the MCSI as seen from the ac mains. The quality of the input ac line currents is examined, and a design procedure for the input filters is given. Power factor and efficiency are discussed. Results are compared to those of other current source iuvester topologies. Experimental results obtained from a 5 kVA converter confirm the theoretical considerations.	clock rate;current source;displacement mapping;distortion;inverter (logic gate);power inverter;pulse-width modulation;rectifier;steady state	Gerry Moschopoulos;Geza Joos;Phoivos D.

Morales-Acevedo for maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The maximum power point is searched by means of an adaptive correction of the DC-DC converter duty cycle which is determined by the sum of the incremental and the instantaneous conductance at a given time. The operating principle is first presented and then the performance evaluation is made using a MATLAB/SEVIULINK model of a photovoltaic system to be connected to the grid. This new algorithm helps in reducing possible power over-impulses during solar radiation transient periods. In addition, it has a good behavior under steady state conditions because oscillations around the maximum power point are reduced. The IAIC algorithm is also better than the conventional adaptive incremental conductance (AIC) algorithm since the MPPT tracking efficiency is higher for the former than for the latter. The IAIC algorithm is highly efficient (above 99.6%), it is simpler than the AIC algorithm and it can be implemented easily using a low cost micro-controller.	algorithm;conductance (graph);duty cycle;matlab;maximum power transfer theorem;microcontroller;performance evaluation;steady state	Arturo Morales-Acevedo;Jose Luis Diaz-Bernabe;Rubén Garrido-Moctezuma	2014	IECON 2014 - 40th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2014.7049347	control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;computer science;control theory;power optimizer	Robotics	67.3970171623462	38.10270418946689	78939

a97bb015a8e07b969525d577b71dc176d7f67b22	nonaveraged control-oriented modeling and relative stability analysis of dc-dc switching converters		SummaryrnThis paper presents a unified and exact nonaveraged approach to derive a frequency-domain control-oriented model for accurate prediction of the fast timescale dynamics and performances of switching converters with fixed frequency naturally sampled pulse width modulation and integrating feedback loop. Because the approach avoids averaging and approximations related to this process, a very good accuracy of the derived model is obtained. The main difference between the presented approach and the existing methodology for accurately predicting the behavior of switching converters is that, here, we break the feedback loop and we focus on analyzing the open-loop gain and the effect of the system parameters on relative stability. This results in an approach much similar to control systems techniques rather than nonlinear dynamical system approaches. Consequently, the relative stability is tackled easily in the frequency domain. In particular, by treating the modulator as a gain depending on the operating point, the new model is formulated in such a way that standard control-oriented tools such as Bode diagrams and root-loci can be easily used. Therefore, the proposed approach gives some important issues like gain and phase margins that are highly useful in controller design. It is noticed that the crossover frequency, gain, and phase margins predicted by using the averaged model may deviate significantly from the actual values given by the proposed approach. The paper points out the sources of discrepancies and the theoretical results are validated by simulations using a circuit-level switched model.	dc-to-dc converter	Yusuf Al-Turki;Abdelali El Aroudi;Kuntal Mandal;Damian Giaouris;Abdullah M.

The new method, which we term the multi-harmonic probe (MHP) technique, generalizes the well-known technique of augmenting harmonic balance (HB) for oscillators using an external probe. By using non-sinusoidal periodic probes, MHP enhances the applicability of the standard probe method (which uses purely sinusoidal probes) to broader classes of oscillators. We thus obtain a general and robust method for the periodic steady state of any kind of oscillator. Results on LC and ring oscillator circuits are presented that testify to the efficacy of our approach.	harmonic balance;ring oscillator;steady state;whole earth 'lectronic link	Kapil D.

The system becomes unstable after the clearance of a fault if the pre fault power transfer or the fault clearance time is high. Conversion of the line for simultaneous ac-dc power flow may keep the system stable with high values of pre fault power and fault clearance time. During the transient period after the clearance of the fault, ac power flow is switched off and the dc power flow is augmented to produce a retarding torque to bring back the generator to its normal speed. Fast control of dc current regulator may be used for this purpose. The circuit breakers are then reclosed and the ac power flow is resumed at its pre fault value without any oscillation. The power swing is low and the system is optimally damped at the end of first swing.		K. P. Basu;M. H.

471434323d4e628d7fa28696c3d26eb0a6b756c1	a sliding-mode controller for a multilevel dc-dc boost converter		A multilevel DC-DC boost converter was proposed recently. It is able to provide very high voltage gain with small duty-ratio, low switch component stress and many other merits. However, few controllers have been proposed for this converter. In this paper, a sliding-mode controller for regulating this dc-dc multilevel boost converter is proposed. The sliding surface is constructed using the inductor current error and the integral of the output voltage error. Based on a general reduced-order state-space model of this converter, the controller design and the stability analysis of the sliding-mode controlled converter system are carried out. Experimental results for a 3× dc-dc multilevel boost converter show the validity and feasibility of the proposed sliding-mode controller under various converter operation conditions.	boost converter;dc-to-dc converter;duty cycle;state space	Wentao Jiang;Chok You Chan	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793969	forward converter;control engineering;electronic engineering;flyback converter;buck converter;engineering;ćuk converter;control theory;integrating adc;buck–boost converter;boost converter	EDA	65.7143794874718	39.210251851408124	79730

The proposed inverters attain self-inductive-current-balancing per switching cycle at their dc front ends without having to include additional balancing hardware or complex control manipulation. The inverters can conveniently be controlled by using the well-established phase-shifted carrier modulation scheme with only two additional linear references and a mapping logic table needed. Existing modulators can therefore be conveniently retrofitted for controlling the presented inverters. By appropriately coordinating the inverter gating signals, their implementations can be realized by using the least number of components without degrading performance. These enhanced features of the inverters have already been verified in simulation and experimentally using a scaled-down laboratory platform.	boost;clock gating;current source;experiment;inductive reasoning;inverter (logic gate);modulation;norm (social);power inverter;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Feng Gao;Poh Chiang Loh;Frede Blaabjerg;D.

This torque control is performed by a magnetic flux compensation control loop and a current distortion correction control loop so that the motor can automatically generate the toque corresponding to the load torque. The magnetic flux compensation control loop operates to suppress the magnetic flux reduction generated when the load torque and the inverter angular frequency are varied. TBis magnetic flux reduction is calculated using both inverter angular frequency and slip angular frequency, which are determined on the basis of the load torque deduced from the detected torque and magnetizing currents. The current distortion due to the dead time of the PWM signals is suppressed by correcting their pulse widths on the basis of errors generated between the reference of the PWM signala and the inverter output vdtage. In experiments with the suggested torque control, it was con6rmed that an induction motor could generate motor torqne of more than 150% of the rated torque. The current distortion factor was less than 10% over a wide frequency range, even when the motors was driven by the PWM inverter with a high switching frequency.	angularjs;clock rate;control system;current source;distortion;experiment;flux qubit;frequency band;power inverter;pulse-width modulation	Nobuyoshi Mutoh;Kenji Nandoh;Akiteru Ueda	1992	IEEE Trans.

Previously we considered molecular neural networks on the base of the functional porous silica thin films. But, for the successful molecular neural network design, we need efficient connections among them.

The proposed topology is based on pulsewidth-modulation buck rectifier (current source inverter topology) and is capable of rectification and stepping down of single-phase ac supply, in a single stage. A new control scheme is proposed to achieve constant dc output voltage and sinusoidal source current, irrespective of large ripples in the dc inductor current. The proposed scheme is configured in single-loop voltage control mode. The relevant small-signal model is derived from the large-signal model using multiorder decomposition. An elaborate procedure of dc filter design is discussed, for circuit operation with minimum energy storage. All analytical results are validated by numerical simulation for sinusoidal and distorted source voltage. Experimental verification is achieved through a 1.2-kW grid-connected laboratory prototype.	computer simulation;current source;filter design;large-signal model;power inverter;prototype;pulse-width modulation;rectifier;singular value decomposition;small-signal model;stepping level;traction teampage	Poonam Chaudhary;Parthasarathi Sensarma	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2012.2217724	control engineering;traction;voltage regulator;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	EDA	65.24585635689787	42.86821221632444	80599

The dead-time can cause problems such as voltage loss, increasing the value of total harmonic distortion of the current waveform (THDI) as well as output current distortion at the zero-crossing. To solve these problems, many studies have been made to deal with the dead-time issues. This paper presents a novel dead-time effect elimination method for H-bridge inverters based on three-level PWM strategy. In this paper, a new current polarity detection circuit has been used to remove dead-time between signals. This detection circuit is based on the conduction states of two low antiparallel diodes in IGBT modules. Here, only one power supply is needed for the diode states conduction detection. In this paper, the principle of the proposed method is detailed. Moreover, simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.	antiparallel (electronics);diode;h bridge;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;inverter (logic gate);power inverter;power supply;pulse-width modulation;short circuit;simulation;total harmonic distortion;waveform;zero crossing	Hadi Alawieh;Lea Riachy;K.

The continuity of the electricity distribution service is therefore a key topic. Network automation is aimed at improving service continuity. Among the several possible automation schemes, logic selectivity of protection relays is one of the most effective approach because it allows minimizing the extent of the area affected by the fault with a short clearing time. IEC 61850 provides a standard way to implement automation. This paper describes a laboratory setup where the logic selectivity-based on the IEC 61850 standard-was tested before moving protection relays to a real operating environment for field demonstration. An analysis of system configuration and performance is reported when phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase faults were tested. Failure of the communication infrastructure enabling the coordination among relays and a failure of the breaker were also simulated to determine how the system was fault tolerant. The results show that the logic implemented is fast enough to send the trip command to the breaker in less than 170 ms in the case of phase-to-ground fault and in less than 130 ms in the case of phase-to-phase fault, even considering the time needed for the coordination of relays.	automation;fault tolerance;operating environment;relay;requirement;scott continuity;selectivity (electronic);system configuration	Davide Della Giustina;Alessio Dede;Giuliana Invernizzi;David Pozo Valle;Faustino Franzoni;Andrea Pegoiani;Lucio Cremaschini	2015	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2015.2415131	local area network;embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;automation;protective relay;circuit breaker;power-system protection	Embedded	61.42076581344687	37.493458371793864	81143

The fuel cell is modeled as a nonlinear current-dependent voltage source meanwhile, the supercapacitor is represented as an ideal capacitor. The power converters are modeled using a average model techniques. Furthermore, the proposed nonlinear state feedback control method is based on backstepping techniques and Lyapunov stability analysis to ensure that error signals converge to zero. A load estimator is designed using Immersion-Invariance (I&I) theory to track load changes through available measurements. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed control scheme stabilizes the system when step changes are applied to the load.		Yuz A. Zuniga-Ventura;Jesus Leyva-Ramos;Luis H.

2600e54936af7e0c32d2801b1d2b626157f67a3e	an efficient and robust hybrid damper for  $lcl$- or  $llcl$-based grid-tied inverter with strong grid-side harmonic voltage effect rejection	impedance;grid impedance variation;notch filter;inverters;lcl filter;power harmonic filters;llcl filter;harmonic rejection ability;bandwidth;robustness;inductance;single loop;rc parallel damper;background harmonic voltage bhv;delays;harmonic analysis	A high-order (LCL or LLCL) power filter with a small grid-side inductor is becoming more preferred for a grid-tied inverter due to less total inductance and reduced costs. In a microgrid, the background harmonic voltage (BHV) may distort the injected currents of the grid-tied inverters. In order to resist the effect of the BHV, a feedforward voltage compensator and a proportional resonant regulator with harmonic compensation are often adopted. However, they still have their own limitations, particularly when there are higher order BHVs at the point of common coupling and when the equivalent grid impedance widely varies due to the different numbers of grid-tied inverters in parallel. Thus, an extra damper should be inserted to keep the system stable. In this paper, the control bandwidth limitation of a multiloop control active damping (AD) method is analyzed and illustrated by the capacitor-current-feedback AD. Based on this, a single-loop current control with a hybrid damper is proposed for a single-phase LCLor LLCL-filter-based grid-tied inverter. A step-by-step design of the controller method is also introduced in detail. Experiments on a 2-kW prototype fully demonstrate the strong robustness of the stability and the high harmonic rejection ability of the inverter using the proposed control method.	characteristic impedance;coefficient;distortion;feedforward neural network;inverter (logic gate);mesh analysis;microgrid;power inverter;prototype;rejection sampling	Yuan Liu;Weimin Wu;Yuanbin He;Zhe Lin;Frede Blaabjerg;Henry Shu-hung Chung	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2478738	control engineering;electronic engineering;inductance;engineering;electrical engineering;electrical impedance;harmonic analysis;control theory;band-stop filter;bandwidth;robustness	Robotics	65.87458853606073	40.324995758706905	81713

9be6c81b325b10c96c58a0434dbbcba8fa37f66e	carrier signal injection based sensorless control of permanent magnet brushless ac machines		This thesis is focused on the carrier signal injection based sensorless control of Permanent Magnet (PM) Brushless AC (BLAC) machines.rnBased on the machine saliency property, carrier signal injection based sensorless techniques have been well developed in the past decade. In order to provide the insight into machine saliency information, a simplified experimental procedure is presented to obtain the machine saliency distribution in the dq plane, including magnetic saturation and cross-saturation effects. Based on the measured machine saliency information, Sensorless Safety Operation Area (SSOA), which accounts for quantization errors in the Analog to Digital (AD) conversion, is proposed to investigate the effectiveness of sensorless operation for practical applications. The SSOA defines a working area in dq plane, in which the machine can work in sensorless mode with guaranteed steady state performance for either pulsating or rotating carrier signal injection based methods.rnThe non-ideal characteristics of machines and drives introduce additional carrier current disturbances in carrier signal injection based sensorless control, which eventually results in the deterioration of the position estimation accuracy, the degradation of dynamic performance and even stability problems. This thesis investigates the influence of inverter nonlinearity effects on rotating carrier signal injection based methods. With the aid of theoretical analysis and experimental measurement, it is proven that the positive sequence carrier current distortion resulting from inverter nonlinearity effects can be used to compensate the influence of inverter nonlinearity on negative sequence carrier current. Hence, a new online post-compensation scheme is developed in this thesis by utilizing the measured distortion of positive sequence carrier current.rnIn sensorless control, great efforts are required to compensate for nonlinear effects in order to improve the accuracy of the estimated position information. Alternatively, the optimal efficiency of machines, instead of accurate position estimation, can be taken as the sensorless operation objective. In this way, the sensorless operation performance is improved by the proposed online optimal efficiency tracking without any compensation for nonlinear effects.rnIn addition, a robust magnetic polarity identification scheme is developed in this thesis based on d-axis magnetic saturation effect. The proposed scheme can be seamlessly integrated into conventional carrier signal injection based sensorless control algorithm.	lisp machine	Liming Gong	2012			control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Theory	67.54530644420251	39.39201722670546	82089

Battery models play an important role in battery design and safe operation. However, an accurate, intuitive, and efficient model is not available easily, because it is highly complex, nonlinear and uncertain. Battery models are divided into electrochemical model, thermal model, stochastic model, neural network model, and equivalent circuit model (ECiBaM) [1]. ECiBaMs use different physical components, such as voltage source, resister and capacitor to simulate the battery I-V characteristics. Due to the intuitive simulation and electrical design, ECiBaMs have been widely used, such as Thevenin, PNGV, and n-order RC. However, the traditional ECiBaMs did not take into account the battery nonlinear capacity. Thus, it is difficult to describe the battery run time accurately [2].	artificial neural network;equivalent circuit;network model;nonlinear system;relevance;run time (program lifecycle phase);simulation;voltage source	Qi Zhang;Naxin Cui;Guojing Xing;Chenghui Zhang	2017	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-017-9364-2	battery (electricity);control theory;mathematics;electric vehicle;equivalent circuit	EDA	62.02670548832334	34.96056122356797	82485

A special step-up case of transformer coupling to a millimetre-sized receiver coil by a comparatively larger transmitter coil is examined. This paper is expected to increase research efforts to develop the battery-less IMD’s with reduced size, low power, high efficiency, and improved reliability and feasibility. Based on our work, we believe that the inductive coupling link with low loss ferrite material is the suitable method to be used to power the batteryless devices. The converter produces the targeted output power of more than 400  $\mu \text{W}$  with 1 mm3 size of the coil at 2 MHz.	dennō coil;electric power conversion;ferrite (magnet);inductive coupling;transformer;transmitter;usc interactive media & games division	Vikram V.

The proposed system includes 3 main parts: the 5-Phase laboratory made AC AFPM, full bridge rectifier and an IGBT full bridge inverter. A current control technique based on fixed hysteresis band is used. All control algorithms are implemented on dsPIC30F4011 Digital Signal Controller (DSC).

Two topologies of the AC–DC converter are designed, namely, Bias-Flip rectifier and Voltage Doubler. The design is part of a piezo electric energy harvesting system targeting wearable electronics. Voltage doubler and full-bridge rectifier are fabricated to support a start-up mechanism while the bias-flip rectifier supports higher efficiency for the normal operation mode. Using a piezo electric energy harvester mounted on a shaker and operated at 4.5 Hz, the maximum extracted power from the voltage doubler is measured as 79.8 nW at 0.21 g. In addition, the maximum extracted power from the fullbridge rectifier is measured as 22.2 nW. As such, voltage doubler is more efficient than full-bridge rectifier by 71%. The experiment uses MIDE V22BL piezo electric harvester with 25 Hz resonance frequency. However, the harvester was used at 4.5 Hz (human frequency) which degrade the energy extracted from the harvester. If another harvester was designed to tune to lower frequency, higher energy level can be extracted. Another contribution in this paper is to compare the on-chip voltage doubler to board level with discrete components. Our experimental results show 11% improvement in efficiency for the on-chip design compared to off-chip for the same input power. The combined bias-flip rectifier and voltage doubler support energy autonomous systems where no start-up power is needed. & 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This case is known in the literature as multiterminal connection. The proposed studies are going to present three strategies in order to connect one offshore wind farm and two AC grids with different power ratings. The first strategy shows the easier case when one onshore station defines the power transmission and it is followed by the situation when droop control is applied. The final scheme is focused on the technique which a central power control is able to manage the onshore stations. The results are compared using EMTDC-PSCAD platform.	ibm power systems;multiseat configuration;shadow copy	Rodrigo da Silva;Remus Teodorescu;Pedro Rodríguez	2010	2010 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT Europe)	10.1109/ISGTEUROPE.2010.5638985	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;electric power system	Mobile	62.67721464486713	37.52651155249603	83136
1ffbfa8af1e815409095db91cc90bd9d4813edf3	a batteryless thermoelectric energy-harvesting interface circuit with 35mv startup voltage	article	Energy harvesting is an emerging technology with applications to handheld, portable and implantable electronics. Harvesting ambient heat energy using thermoelectric generators (TEG's) [1] is a convenient means to supply power to body-worn electronics and industrial sensors. Using TEG's for body-wearable applications limits the output voltage to 50mV for temperature differences of 1–2K usually found between the body and ambience. Several existing systems [2, 3] use a battery or an initial high voltage energy input to kick-start operation of the system from this low voltage. Further, changing external conditions cause the voltage and power generated by the TEG to vary, necessitating efficient control circuits that can adapt and extract the maximum possible power out of these systems. In this paper, a battery-less thermoelectric energy harvesting interface circuit which uses a mechanically assisted startup circuit to operate from 35mV input is presented. An efficient control circuit that performs maximal end-to-end transfer of the extracted energy to a storage capacitor and regulates the output voltage at 1.8V is demonstrated.	end-to-end principle;handheld game console;maximal set;sensor;wearable computer;wearable technology	Yogesh K.

These strategies are, respectively, based on reactive power control actions, generating nodes voltage–magnitude control actions and load curtailment actions.#R##N##R##N#After decomposing the power system into an appropriate number of areas, for each area a feed-forward neural network is trained to give as output to a defined set of inputs an area-based voltage-stability index. The voltage stability of the whole power system is characterised by the minimum value among the area indices. Thus, for a given operating condition, the most critical area is identified and remedial measures are considered only for a restricted region of the system. Since each net receives `internal' inputs and inputs from the remaining areas, it is shown that using the resulting neural network architecture appropriate algorithms can be developed to carry out on-line a preventive control strategy based on the above-mentioned types of control actions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 118-busbar, 19-machine power system.	artificial neural network;ibm power systems	Annalisa Maiorano;Michele Trovato	1998	Neurocomputing	10.1016/S0925-2312(98)00080-0	feedforward neural network;computer science;machine learning;operant conditioning;control theory;electric power system;artificial neural network	EDA	63.93345651981526	33.981310539499376	83369

In large power system, it is costly to place too many PMUs to achieve real time global observability. In fact, system state can be well estimated by optimally placed limited PMUs' synchronous measurements. Based on the method of voltage control area division, a spectral clustering approach is proposed to divide the network into several zones. Probabilistic Load Flow (PLF) is implemented in the meantime to consider many uncertain scenarios of system operation. In this way, the voltage variation of buses in the same zone can possess close coherency under various operation conditions. Consequently, placing PMUs on the best voltage representative locations, namely central buses of each zone in spectral clustering can improve the voltage observability and controllability while effectively reducing the number of PMUs. Case studies on IEEE 14 bus and 39 bus system are presented.	cluster analysis;phasor;power management unit;spectral clustering	Chunxue Zhang;Youwei Jia;Zhao Xu	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778851	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	EDA	64.87441431210041	32.585720625880874	84397

In the latest effort for the reduction of the power consumption by address driver circuits, the power-efficient operation mode is selected by controlling the voltage of the capacitor that affects the LC resonance. This paper presents an analysis of power consumption by the address circuits and observes that the operation mode change in a previous work is too slow to achieve an efficient power reduction when the number of data switchings of each scan line changes abruptly in the input image. This paper proposes a new power reduction method with a fast selection of the operation mode based on the analysis of the power consumption by each address operation mode. The fast mode selection enables rapid change of the address operation mode and consequently leads to a reduction of power consumption by 22.2% when compared with the previous method.	integrated circuit;lc circuit;plasma display;pre-boot authentication;programmed data processor;resonance;scan line	Jin-Sung Kim;Jae-Yeon Won;Hyuk-Jae Lee	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2026373	image quality;energy recovery;electricity generation;embedded system;electronic engineering;electrical efficiency;resonance;adaptive control;engineering;electrical engineering;lc circuit;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	61.98454703697673	44.96835366913965	84876

In this paper, an efficient RF energy harvester for wireless sensor networks is presented. The circuit is based on a multi-stage rectifier that exploit threshold self-compensation together with transistor gate and bulk stimulus. The input is matched to 50Ω through a matching network that provides voltage boosting to the rectifiers input terminal. According to the desired performance, a 910MHz harvester with matched input comprising a 10-Stage rectifier has been designed in an 130-nm CMOS process. Considering a -20dB input power signal the circuit can supply a 1MΩ load with 1V/1μW output voltage and power with an PCE of 10%. The circuit exhibits a maximum PCE of 27% at -16dBm with 0.8V/6.4μW output voltage and power. The achieved results exceed the performance of previous work in terms of energy efficiency at input power lower than -15dBm.	cmos;impedance matching;radio frequency;rectifier;transistor	Hugo B.

After considering first the nature of microgrids and the control of stand-alone inverters, a model of a microgrid supplied by one single inverter-interfaced source is simulated in PSCAD for two different faults conditions. Simplifications to the inverter model which captures its behaviour under fault conditions are then proposed. Finally the effectiveness of the simplified model is demonstrated using a sequence-component-based fault analysis of the microgrid test network.	component-based software engineering;computer simulation;fault detection and isolation;inverter (logic gate);microgrid;numerical analysis;power inverter	Maria Brucoli;Timothy C.

Then we classify basic phenomena in a bifurcation diagram.

Incorporating the agent-based autonomous feature to the intelligence of the remote terminal units, the present power system control structure can be used to help in preventing system voltage collapse during catastrophic disturbances. The control algorithm is based on a decentralized architecture of intelligent agents and the determination of a local zone that can carry out quick countermeasures in a decentralized manner as a multiagent system (MAS) during an emergency situation. An adaptive determination of the local zones undergoing voltage collapse has been developed based on the electrical distances among the generators and loads. Once assigned, the elements of the Jacobian matrix can be used to determine the optimum actions that need to be carried out at each power system element (such as increasing the voltages of generators and load shedding) within the assigned local zone. The contract net protocol is used for agent interactions. Simulation results using the IEEE-57 bus system show that the proposed method can act quickly to respond to emergency conditions to ensure that voltage collapse can be avoided.	agent-based model;algorithm;autonomous robot;contract net protocol;control flow;control theory;countermeasure (computer);distributed control system;intelligent agent;interaction;jacobian matrix and determinant;load shedding;multi-agent system;simulation	Sk Razibul Islam;Danny Sutanto;Kashem M.

This paper presents a novel zero-voltage transition (ZVT) concept for the full-bridge transformerless PV grid-connected inverter topologies. The zero-voltage turn-on and turnoff of the high-frequency main switches and the zero-current turn-on of the auxiliary switches, as well as the zero-voltage turn-on and turnoff of the antiparallel diodes of the line-frequency switches, are realized by introducing two resonant tanks. Take ZVT-H6-I for example. The operation principle, soft-switching conditions, duty cycle restriction, and parameter design rule of the resonant tank are analyzed in detail. Finally, the validity of the ZVT concept is verified by a ZVT-H6-I prototype rated at 100 kHz and 1 kW.	antiparallel (electronics);diode;duty cycle;network switch;power inverter;prototype;spectral leakage;transformer	Huafeng Xiao;Xi P.

Using dynamic and hardware-in-the-loop (realtime) simulations, the provision of such a dynamic frequency control support by distributed energy storage systems has been studied in the case of the French island of Guadeloupe. Dedicated control algorithms have been developed and tested on a small-scale ultracapacitor storage unit.

It is shown that oversampling ratios of 8 and smaller bring about very large disturbances in the control loop, even if a Sinc3 digital filter is used. Acceptable results can be obtained by using oversampling ratios of 16 and higher along with the Sinc3 filter.

Unlike existing voltage ripple reduction methods, the proposed device can be attached to the dc link of a hybrid ac–dc power system without modifying the host system itself. In particular, a local bus-voltage control scheme is employed to achieve the plug-and-play operation. With the requirement of the dc-link voltage measurement only, this device can be operated as a standalone module. Theoretical analysis and experimental work on a boost-type power factor correction rectification system have been successfully performed to validate the effectiveness of the ripple-mitigating function, the hot-swap operation and the nonintrusive property of the RM. Practical results obtained from a 110-W miniature hybrid ac–dc power system comprising an ac/dc converter and two resistive loads are included to demonstrate some of the functions of the RM.	hot swapping;local bus;paging;plug and play;rectifier;resistive touchscreen;ripple effect;war of currents	Sinan Li;Albert Ting Leung Lee;Siew-Chong Tan;Shu Yuen (Ron) Hui	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2708030	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory	Mobile	64.22918016117873	39.44542828782897	85812
e6812b2a77ec8ae3c81c65752d4b8ebfb36ae285	hardware implementation and real-time evaluation of an ann-based algorithm for anti-islanding protection of distributed generators		Recently, it has been verified by simulation results that the ability of recognizing and classifying patterns by artificial neural network can be successfully used for anti-islanding protection of distributed synchronous generators. However, since this type of protection differs from the available commercial relays, it is important to test the algorithm performance implemented in hardware. So, this paper presents a performance evaluation of the hardware implementation of an ANN-based algorithm for anti-islanding protection of distributed generators. For the evaluation process, a complete digital relay architecture is developed in LabVIEW, thus allowing its implementation in the commercial real-time platform cRIO-9025/cRIO-9018. The proposed scheme is tested under real conditions by means of the CMC-256-plus test set, as performed for conventional intelligent electronic devices. The proposed algorithm implemented in hardware shows high effectiveness, detecting all islanding conditions within 1 s, sharing the same good performance verified by computational simulations. The algorithm implementation shows robustness, as it remains blocked for other power grid disturbances, such as frequency variation in the grid utility, massive connection or load relief.	algorithm;artificial neural network;computation;computer simulation;labview;performance evaluation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;relay;sensor;test set	Nolman Barroso Hartmann;Ricardo Caneloi dos Santos;Ahda Pionkoski Grilo;Jos&#x00E9; Carlos Melo Vieira	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2767524	control engineering;distributed algorithm;robustness (computer science);computer hardware;grid;artificial neural network;architecture;islanding;engineering;real-time computing;algorithm;digital protective relay;test set	HPC	67.82590310140512	35.65883944130507	85839

In the last decade, EH has matured as a technology and found use in many application scenarios, such as smart grid and wireless sensor networks. Recently, advances have been made in miniaturizing EH devices to supply wearable devices by exploiting ambient energy in the form of motion, thermal gradients, light and electromagnetic radiation. However, harvesting energy from the body for powering wearable devices is more challenging due to strict constraints in terms of size, weight and cost. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of technologies, architectures and design trade-offs for efficient EH systems suitable for wearable devices. Additionally, we provide implementation details, including the conversion stages for kinetic and thermal EH, optimized for the human body. We quantify the energy that it is possible to harvest in real application scenarios, which is in the range of 200–700 mJ per day, depending the source, and result in up to 1.5 J per day if coupled. The design guidelines and experimental evaluations we present, with in-field measurement, will be of benefit to designers of future EH wearable systems.	exception handling;exponential hierarchy;gradient;taxonomy (general);wearable computer;wearable technology	Michele Magno;David Boyle	2017	2017 12th International Conference on Design & Technology of Integrated Systems In Nanoscale Era (DTIS)	10.1109/DTIS.2017.7930169	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	57.93963088690192	44.09207058936236	86057

The proposed energy control is an adaptive current-voltage control (ACVC) scheme based on the moving average measurement technique and an adaptive proportional compensator. Unlike conventional energy control methods, the proposed ACVC approach has the advantages of controlling both voltage and current of the system while it keep the output current of the power converter at a relatively constant value. For this study, a laboratory scale hybrid dc microgrid is developed to evaluate the performance of the ACVC strategy and to compare its performance with the other conventional energy control methods. Using experimental test results, it is shown that the proposed strategy highly improves the dynamic performance of the hybrid dc microgrid. Although the ACVC technique causes slightly more bus voltage variation, it effectively eliminates the high current and power pulsation of the power converters. The experimental test results for different pulse duty ratios demonstrated a significant improvement achieved by the developed ACVC scheme in enhancing the system efficiency, reducing the ac grid voltage drop and the frequency fluctuations.	electric power conversion;microgrid;scheme	Mustafa Farhadi;Osama A.

Under this situation, a network topology change via line switching can increase the SSSM. In this paper, an online line switching method for maximizing the SSSM is presented, taking into account both the solution quality and the required computational speed. To balance the tradeoff between speed and solution quality, the line switching method presented in this paper is composed of three stages: 1) screening; 2) ranking; and 3) detailed evaluation. The effectiveness of the presented three-stage method is evaluated on IEEE standard power systems with promising results.	computation;ibm power systems;mathematical optimization;network topology;numerical analysis;numerical method;operating point;phase margin;recursion;small-signal model;topology optimization;transmission line	Chongtao Li;H.

This study presents a thin-film, array-based TEH with a surface area of 0.83 cm2. The TEH autonomously supplies a power management IC fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology. The IC utilizes a single-inductor topology with integrated analog maximum power point tracking (MPPT), resulting in a 68% peak end-to-end efficiency (92% converter efficiency) and less than 20-ms MPPT. In an in-vivo test, a 645-μW regulated output power (effective 3.5 K of temperature gradient) was harvested from a rat implanted with our TEH, demonstrating true energy independence in a real environment while showing a 7.9 × improvement in regulated power density compared to the state-of-the-art.

At last, the results verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The induction motor responded quickly and torque ripple smaller, with which the neutral-point voltage unbalance is restrained.	algorithm;basic;clock rate;control system;distortion;mathematical induction;power inverter;quantum fluctuation;ripple effect;simulation;threaded code;yang	Feng Pan;Yang Li;Geng-long Yan	2016	2016 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)	10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7860907	stall torque;control theory;induction motor;torque;vector control;electric potential;torque motor;direct torque control;modulation	Robotics	66.51131435344122	38.89535776824163	86438

This paper explores new solutions to address the fluctuations by integrating a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) and exploring coordinated power management. A propeller and ship dynamic model, which captures the underlying physical behavior, is established to support the control development and system optimization. Given the fact that both high and low frequency contents exist in the power fluctuations, a combination of battery pack and ultracapacitor bank is proposed, coordinated control is developed, and performance is evaluated in different sea conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed HESS with model predictive control provides substantial benefits in terms of reducing fluctuation and sustaining self-operation, compared to other solutions that involve batteries or ultracapacitors alone. Moreover, our analysis shows that the benefits of HESS are achievable only through both effective power management and device coordination.	computer data storage;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;power management;program optimization;quantum fluctuation;simulation;uninterruptible power supply	Jun Hou;Jing Sun;Heath F.

A divide-by-difference filter (DDF) has been used for accurate estimation of the rotor angle of the generator. The proposed rotor angle estimator utilizes the measurements of the terminal voltage, active power output, and field voltage of the generator. These measured quantities and the reference mechanical torque are utilized by the nonlinear state estimator to estimate the generator rotor angle. The measurement update for the DDF has been carried out every 20 ms. The measurement error used in the design and implementation of the filter is assumed to be white Gaussian noise. The effectiveness of the method has been tested on a single machine infinite bus system, a nine-bus system, and a 68-bus New England-New York interconnected system. The simulation results show that the proposed method provides more accurate estimation of the rotor angle of a generator.	algorithm;disk data format;distribution frame;gaussian elimination;ibm power systems;interference (communication);multimachine;nonlinear system;phasor;power management unit;r.o.t.o.r.;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	P.

01502bc3b553f3376c79326c0455925e3b19486d	an auxiliary flyback circuit with output voltage ripple suppression for single-phase isolated full-bridge boost pfc converter		An effective auxiliary flyback circuit to suppress voltage ripple is proposed and investigated in a single-phase isolated full-bridge boost power factor correction (PFC) converter, by which the output voltage ripple can be suppressed obviously. The output voltage ripple can be reduced by adding the auxiliary link using the absorbed energy from the voltage spike. The energy is controlled to be transferred to the output side through a flyback converter parallel with the clamp branch capacitor. The output voltage ripple was estimated by the second order harmonic extraction link in which notch filter is used to extract the second order harmonic from the output voltage. With the help of the added energy path, the lower output voltage ripple can be achieved. Experimental results show that this auxiliary flyback circuit has a good effect on reducing the output voltage ripple on a laboratory-made prototype.	cfp gene;capacitor device component;clamping (graphics);converter device component;f factor;flyback converter;powerbuilder foundation classes;prototype;ripple effect;voltage spike;zero suppression	Xuesong Wang;Hongqi Ben;Tao Meng	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216763	control theory;engineering;flyback converter;power factor;voltage spike;ripple;voltage;capacitor;flyback transformer;inductor	EDA	64.48624475798631	42.31538579409327	87754

At high switching rates, the overlap between the high peak reserve-recovery current and the high peak voltage overshoot contributes to significant switching energy. The peak reverse-recovery current depends on the temperature and switching rate, whereas the peak diode voltage overshoot depends additionally on the stray inductance. Furthermore, the slope of the diode turn-off current is constant at high insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) switching rates and varies for low IGBT switching rates. In this paper, an analytical model for calculating PiN diode switching energy at different switching rates and temperatures is presented and validated by ultrafast and standard recovery diodes with different current ratings. Measurements of current commutation in IGBT/PiN diode pairs have been made at different switching rates and temperatures and used to validate the model. It is shown here that there is an optimal switching rate to minimize switching energy. The model is able to correctly predict the switching rate and temperature dependence of the PiN diode switching energies for different devices.	emulator;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;nonlinear system;overshoot (signal);pin diode	Saeed Jahdi;Olayiwola Alatise;Li Ran;Phil Mawby	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2347936	electronic engineering;logic gate;network switch;temperature measurement;current injection technique;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;optoelectronics;physics	HPC	63.433398658354506	44.31175239759427	87796

Two synchronous reference frames, the positive and the negative, are introduced for applying a vector control scheme to separately control two sequences arising from the unbalanced voltage. Different control strategies are discussed for reducing the consequent oscillations. It is demonstrated that the proposed controller shows a significant performance improvement over the conventional controller and is effective to cope with potentially unbalanced conditions.	cpu cache;code;experiment;learning to rank;unbalanced circuit;unbalanced line	Shiyi Shao;Teng Long;Ehsan Abdi-Jalebi;Richard A.

Two qubit quantum logic gates such as controlled-NOT operations are performed using topolog-ical effects. Single-anyon operations such as hopping from site to site on a lattice suffice to perform all quantum logic operations. Quantum computation using abelian anyons shares some but not all of the robustness of quantum computation using non-abelian anyons. A wide variety of methods can be used to construct quantum computers in principle (1-18). Essentially any interaction between two quantum degrees of freedom suffices to construct universal quantum logic gates (10-11). In particular, Kitaev (12) has shown that quantum computation can be effected using non-abelian anyons. The resulting quantum computation is intrinsically fault-tolerant. This paper shows that universal quantum computation can be effected using abelian anyons: two-qubit quantum logic gates, such as the controlled-NOT gate, are enacted topologically via the phase factor of e iφ that occurs when one anyon is moved around another. Quantum computation using abelian anyons shares some but not all of the robustness of quantum computation using non-abelian anyons. Possible realizations in terms of solid-state systems and interferometers are discussed, and issues of noise and decoherence are investigated. A quantum logic gate is an operation that transforms quantum-information bearing degrees of freedom. A set of quantum logic gates is universal if arbitrary quantum computations can be built up by repeatedly applying gates from the set to different qubits. To prove that abelian anyons are capable of universal quantum computation, we will show 1 that single anyon quantum logic gates such as those that move an anyon from one site to another form a universal set: universal quantum computation can be effected simply by moving fermions around a lattice or network. Consider the case of anyons moving on a two-dimensional lattice. Each site j of the lattice corresponds to a local mode that can be either occupied by an anyon, |+ j , or unoccupied |− j. For example, the anyons could be quantum-Hall effect excitations on a two-dimensional spatial lattice. Now consider operations that can be performed on anyons. Let b j , b † j be the annihilation and creation operators for the j th mode. First, applying the Hamiltonian A j = b † j b j leaves |− j unchanged and multiplies the state |+ j by a phase. Second, if j and k are two adjacent sites or modes, …	computation;computer;controlled not gate;creation and annihilation operators;fault tolerance;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);logic gate;phase factor;quantum hall effect;quantum turing machine;quantum computing;quantum decoherence;quantum gate;quantum information;quantum logic;qubit;ical	Seth Lloyd	2002	Quantum Information Processing	10.1023/A:1019649101654	quantum simulator;quantum operation;fault tolerance;quantum information;quantum network;quantum discord;quantum capacity;quantum technology;open quantum system;quantum dissipation;quantum sensor;qubit;topological quantum computer;quantum electrodynamics;quantum computer;condensed matter physics;quantum process;quantum dynamics;quantum algorithm;physics;one-way quantum computer;quantum mechanics;quantum phase estimation algorithm;quantum error correction	Theory	56.52478732002717	34.42004921897779	88136
08d7b52b938709b449e40ce44a7e6ddd6473fe0a	performance comparison of model predictive control methods for active front end rectifiers		Active front-end rectifiers are tasked with generating high-quality, low-distortion sinusoidal line currents in the presence of adverse circuit conditions. When suitable control methods are applied to such rectifiers, significant performance improvements can be realized, especially under abnormal utility conditions. Although several control methods based on model predictive control platforms have been recently developed, there is a lack of comparative studies of these methods in the literature. In this paper, the details and theoretical background of four model predictive control methods, namely, current control, virtual flux control, direct power control, and virtual flux direct power control, are presented. Then, the performance of these methods was compared by the way of experiments to determine the respective quality of the line current under various conditions, such as unbalanced input voltages, input voltage distortion, uncertainty in the parameters, and dc voltage fluctuation. In summary, based on the results of the experiments, the virtual flux control scheme was found to be distinctly superior to the other three schemes for distorted and unbalanced line voltages.

The following were analysed: motor current rise time, power grid THD, spectrum and power consumption of both devices. Quasi Z-Source Direct Matrix Converter turned out to have higher torque control loop dynamics and lower values of the current control error integral but at the cost of an increase of power consumption and THD.	algorithm;boost converter;control system;festival of code;maximal set;pid;resonance;rise time;simulation;simulink;the matrix;total harmonic distortion;ver (command)	Przemyslaw Siwek;Konrad Urbanski	2018	2018 23rd International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2018.8486123	total harmonic distortion;computer science;control engineering;control theory;rise time;torque;boost converter;voltage;inductance;control system;vector control	Robotics	66.79785821131698	39.00929328675054	88397

Tap changing is achieved under natural commutation of semiconductors during the zero crossing of current, so that the response time exceeds the half cycle of the mains. High-power transistors and gate turn-off thyristor switches make new and faster tap commutation techniques possible to achieve several tap changes in one half cycle. This paper analyzes and synthesizes a dual-tap chopping stabilizer with a compensating transformer, with a pulsewidth-modulation frequency of about 5 kHz and a new soft-switching technique achieved by two auxiliary small-power branches. Unlike other supercyclic ac soft-switching solutions, the new commutating method allows zero current turn-off, several times in a half cycle, for any sign combination of voltage and current, thus reducing the electrical stress in the switches and the electromagnetic emission. Zero-crossing current detection is not needed. A technical study and an evaluation of the power of the required components are done on the commutation techniques that extend the application field of tap changers to the reduction of the fast perturbations of the mains as flicker, voltage harmonics, voltage oscillations, etc. Experimental results with insulated-gate bipolar transistor switches are obtained in a 1 kVA prototype.	and gate;flicker (screen);insulated-gate bipolar transistor;network switch;prototype;pulse-width modulation;response time (technology);semiconductor;silicon controlled rectifier;thyristor;transformer;zero crossing	Juan Carlos C.

In order to provide accurate stator resistance monitoring at medium and high speeds, the dc signal injection-based method is selected. The main property of the scheme is that small regulated dc current is periodically injected in the stator windings without interrupting the flux and torque control loops. In the proposed scheme, inverter nonlinearities are properly compensated and accurate resistance estimation is achieved with minimal level of injected dc current. This results in consistent and controllable torque ripple, which is minimal and constant for any actual stator resistance value. Estimated stator resistance can be also used for control algorithm tuning. The method is implemented in a fixed-point microprocessor and tested on a low-cost shaft-sensorless IM drive under various operation modes.	algorithm;fixed-point arithmetic;interrupt;microprocessor;power inverter;r.o.t.o.r.;ripple effect;thermal resistance	Petar R.

7940297fd949912a0e3eeaa50e605ba94e55282e	a modified pwm scheme to reduce switching stress in a current-fed switched inverter		Current fed switched inverter (CFSI) is mainly used for higher DC gain and inherent shoot through protection. However, due to limitation on modulation index, the AC gain is limited. Therefore, a very high DC gain is required to compensate for the limited modulation index for a specific AC output voltage. This results in higher stress on the semiconductor devices. In comparison to boost-VSI, the voltage stress across switches is less for same AC output. But boost-VSI is not operated at higher duty cycle, as this result in a steep (high di/dt) diode current. Apart from that it also has shoot through problem. In this paper, a new PWM scheme is proposed for CFSI, which accomplishes the advantages of conventional CFSI and Boost-VSI. The proposed scheme produces same AC output at a much lower switch stress. To verify this, a 500 W prototype of CFSI is designed. To get 110 V AC output, in case of conventional PWM, 330 V DC-link voltage was required. With the proposed scheme, DC-link voltage requirement reduces to 230 V, and 110 V AC is obtained at a duty ratio of 0.71.	boost;diode;duty cycle;network switch;power inverter;prototype;pulse-width modulation;semiconductor device	Anil Gambhir;Santanu Mishra	2017	2017 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting	10.1109/IAS.2017.8101791	duty cycle;diode;voltage;semiconductor device;modulation index;inverter;control theory;pulse-width modulation;engineering;electronic engineering	Mobile	64.26596643937924	42.2489549893038	89404
c498d2718bb6d92f5b105f02b635851f75c2d838	a novel ultra-low-power low-voltage femto-ampère current mirror		A novel femto-ampère current mirror/negative impedance converter (FACMNIC) is proposed in this paper. It is shown that extremely large output impedance approaching infinite value and also negative impedances of different values can be remarkably obtained just by adjusting the built-in positive feedback loop gain. Operation of this circuit is based on two approaches called here as source voltage shifting and channel conduction manipulation. Although those two techniques are briefly explained in this paper but due to their strong action worth extensively studying and exercising. Deliberately having been composed of both current mirror and negative impedance converter capabilities in the same structure causes the proposed circuit to have a simple structure prohibiting large chip area consumption while favorably preserves following unique features. At 0.9 volt power supply it produces very small currents down to 4.6 fA and consumes an ultra-low power of 86 nW, thus it is the best choice for Ultra-Low-Power Low-Voltage (ULPLV) applications. It also exhibits the outstanding high output impedance of 400 G when it is optimized for best performance operation, otherwise it can be adjusted so as to produce very high output impedances (approaching infinite values). Due to the inclusion of positive feedback, Monte Carlo analyses are performed to ensure the stability and robustness of the circuit’s operation in the presence of the PVT (process, voltage and temperature) variations.

64c22fc50c4834a222dcc394a6b443e357df275f	modeling energy demand dependency in smart multi-energy systems		Smart local energy networks provide an opportunity for more penetration of distributed energy resources. However, these resources cause an extra dependency in both time and carrier domains that should be considered through a comprehensive model. Hence, this paper introduces a new concept for internal and external dependencies in Smart Multi-Energy Systems (SMES). Internal dependencies are caused by converters and storages existing in operation centers and modeled by coupling matrix. On the other hand, external dependencies are defined as the behavior of multi-energy demand in shifting among carriers or time periods. In this paper, system dependency is modeled based on energy hub approach through adding virtual ports and making new coupling matrix. Being achieved by SMESs, the dependencies release demandside flexibility and subsequently enhance system efficiency. Moreover, a test SMES that includes several elements and multi-energy demand in output is applied to show the effectiveness of the model.	numerical analysis;usb hub	Nilufar Neyestani;Maziar Yazdani Damavandi;Miadreza Shafie-khah;João P.

6ef9c4ca0ce179acea29a1121ddeae88c52d9101	energy management and control of secs and bess integrated ac microgrid		An AC microgrid connected to a solar energy conversion system (SECS) and a battery energy storage system (BESS) with a novel energy management and control strategy is being presented in this paper. This configuration aims at feeding fixed power to the grid, thus reducing the extra burden on the grid created by local loads. The first stage boosts the PV voltage and harvests maximum power (Pmax) from the SPV array; the second stage aids in feeding the power to the utility/grid. The electricity extracted from the solar cells is converted into appropriate levels of voltage and current by the SECS. A boost DC-DC converter, bridging the SECS and the voltage source converter (VSC), steps up the SPV voltage and extracts the maximum power by employing perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm. The proposed configuration makes use of the BESS and SECS for active power sharing with the help of VSC. Apart from the SECS, the system consists of a boost converter, BESS, VSC, filters for ripple reduction and the grid having linear or nonlinear loads. The design, modeling and simulation of the proposed system have been implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK.	algorithm;boost converter;bridging (networking);computer data storage;control theory;dc-to-dc converter;decstation;matlab;maximum power transfer theorem;microgrid;nonlinear system;ripple effect;shadow copy;simulation;simulink;solar cell;voltage source	M.

The JE is brought to an initial speed by the motoring operation of the IM. Later, the IM is taken into generating mode and the turbine is applied to its excitation. The turbine catches up and starts to drive the induction generator (IG). The generated power is converted to a three-phase, 400 Hz voltage-regulated bus via a double stage power conversion utilizing a 20 kHz parallel resonant high frequency AC link and pulse density modulated converter technology. Independent of the engine speed, a constant amplitude and constant frequency three-phase voltage-regulated AC bus is formed and maintained by the proper control of the power converters. The feasibility of operation of such a system has been demonstrated in software where the JE turbine is modeled and replaced by a DC machine. An introduction, background, operation principles of the overall system, and the related software simulations are presented and discussed.		Irfan Alan;Thomas A. Lipo	2000	IEEE Trans.

However, they can lead to zero-sequence currents and common mode voltages (CMV). A solution for the aforementioned problems is to control the inverters with only odd or even space vectors (SVs). Nonetheless, during dead-times the actual SVs of the inverters vary with the polarity of the load currents which can lead to short pulses in the CMV. First, this paper discusses an approach for determining the actual SVs of the inverters during the dead-times. Based on this, a strategy for selecting the sequence of SVs as a function of the load current polarities for eliminating the spikes in the CMV is proposed. The impact of the proposed strategy on the load voltage and current harmonics as well as on the switch power losses is investigated. The findings of this work are supported by simulation results.	distortion;extended validation certificate;inverter (logic gate);power inverter;project xanadu;simulation;systemverilog	Nazli Kalantari;Luiz A.

Harvesting ambient energy circumvents this limitation because the environment is a virtually boundless reservoir of energy. Of available sources, solar light produces the highest power density, and although artificial lighting is not as rich, thermal and magnetic sources produce even lower power densities and mechanical and chemical transducers are difficult to integrate. The problem is microscale photovoltaic (PV) cells only produce 1 and 100 µW/mm2 for artificial and solar lighting, so the act of conditioning and transferring power can dissipate most, if not all, of the power available. The focus of this paper is to introduce and discuss the design challenges associated with harvesting circuits when harnessing, conditioning, and transferring power from tiny PV cells that only generate 1 – 100 µW.	solar cell;transducer	Rajiv Damodaran Prabha;Gabriel A.

The proposed technique makes use of the inductor response to a voltage change due to the flip in the TEG polarity. The inductor voltage provides two distinguishable states which correspond to the normal and the reversed TEG polarity. A switch matrix circuit is then used to correct the polarity by physically reversing the TEG connection. The detection circuit along with the switch matrix provide a positive input voltage from the TEG to the inductor-based converter. The proposed technique is an efficient polarity detection with all-digital implementation, fully integrated, small area and power overhead. The prototype chip is fabricated in 65-nm CMOS and occupies an area of 0.09 mm2. Measurement results confirm a maximum efficiency of 70% at 50 mV TEG voltage and  $40~\mu \text {A}$  output current. The proposed technique is part of an autonomous thermal energy harvesting system that detects and corrects the TEG polarity.	autonomous robot;bioinformatic harvester;cmos;effective method;overhead (computing);prototype;reversing: secrets of reverse engineering;sensor	Mohammad Alhawari;Baker Mohammad;Hani H.

The algorithm is based on a model of the system. From that model, the behavior of the system is predicted for each possible switching state of the inverter. The state that minimizes a given quality function is selected to be applied during the next sampling interval. Several compositions of are proposed, including terms dedicated to achieve reference tracking, balance in the dc link, and reduction of the switching frequency. In comparison to an established control method, the strategy presents a remarkable performance. The proposed method achieves comparable reference tracking with lower switching frequency per semiconductor and similar transient behavior. The main advantage of the method is that it does not require any kind of linear controller or modulation technique, achieving a different approach to control a power converter.	algorithm;clock rate;electric power conversion;game controller;modulation;power inverter;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor	René Vargas;Patricio Cortes;Ulrich Ammann;José R.

To achieve wearable and smart device power sharing, we propose using the garments we wear as a power distribution backbone. To allow non-contact power transfer between garments, bi-directional inductive power transfer is used. We demonstrate a novel coil topology called Feed Coils constructed from flexible materials to aid garment integration and user comfort. Our system complies with international guidelines on time-varying magnetic field exposure to human tissue, allowing the system to be operated in close proximity to the body.

2c4b656603565dff469692c90615a6b19626f78b	transformerless line-interactive ups with low ground leakage current		This paper proposes a transformerless line-interactive uninterruptible power supply (UPS) with low ground leakage current. A high-efficiency bidirectional inverter is suggested, which performs the line-interactive UPS functions with low ground leakage current. It has a full-bridge inverter and a bidirectional switch, which operate with the unipolar pulsewidth modulation. Because the bidirectional switch operates at the line-frequency, switching losses can be lower than the previous transformerless inverters. As the inverter operates, the parasitic capacitance between the inverter and the ac voltage ground is clamped to zero voltage for a positive line cycle and to the ac voltage for a negative line cycle, respectively. Thus, the parasitic capacitance can be prevented from being charged or discharged, which ensures the absence of the ground leakage current. The operation modes of the proposed system are described. The control schemes are presented to design the proposed inverter for the line-interactive UPS. Experimental results for a 2.0 kW prototype are discussed to verify the performance of the proposed system.	inverter (logic gate);power inverter;prototype;pulse-width modulation;spectral leakage;uninterruptible power supply	Woo-Young Choi;Min-Kwon Yang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2018.2815948	voltage;modulation;control theory;engineering;leakage (electronics);inverter;parasitic capacitance;pulse-width modulation	EDA	63.09086691351512	42.99747351649462	93399

dd62d3165aa2f23076a34ce873faf63226b5b332	investigation of wireless power transfer for smart grid on-line monitoring devices under hv condition		Magnetically coupled resonant wireless power transfer (WPT) has been employed in many applications, such as wireless charging of portable electronic devices and electric vehicles. This technology can also provide solutions for power transfer in complex environment and special scenario with mid-range transfer distance and acceptable transfer efficiency. In this paper, a mid-range WPT system is designed to provide an effective solution for power supply to smart grid on-line monitoring devices in high voltage (HV) on-site condition. Both the model, design, and experimental implementation of a two-coil system are represented. To find out the transfer characteristic of the proposed mid-range WPT system, the circuit model exciting frequency coupling output power and transfer efficiency are analyzed based on the circuit and magnetic principles. Some key points about the optimal working area for the mid-range WPT system are demonstrated. Finally, a prototype system with transfer distance 1.1 meter for 110 kV HV power cables is built to verify the effectiveness of the regular law of system. By carefully tuning the circuit parameters, the prototype is able to deliver 20W power through 1.1 meter distance with 20.23% efficiency. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Spiral transmitting PCB inductor 100$\times$100 mm and toroidal receiving PCB inductor 30$\times$20 mm are used. The charging current distribution at various relative positions of the transmitting and receiving inductors is explored. Analytically calculated values are compared to the bench test results in the air and imitation environments. The maximum charging current was achieved in the receiving inductor location area, which is determined by the equipotential value zone of the inductor coupling coefficient, which ensures the load matching in a system. With a coaxial arrangement of the inductors, the maximum was reached at a distance of 35 mm between them.

The main characteristic of a CPL is that its current decreases when its voltage increases and vice versa. Therefore, in small signal analysis a CPL behaves as a negative impedance, and as a consequence it can impact the system stability. The aim of this work is to establish how it is possible to stabilize the system by acting on the filter parameters and the control strategy. A distributed power generating systems supplied by a ST has been considered as case study. The analysis and the simulation results show that it is not possible to stabilize the system by using standard controllers without an appropriate selection of the output filter components.	cpl;characteristic impedance;control theory;information engineering;signal processing;simulation;small-signal model;transformer	M.

The proposed scheme that is based on adaptive generalized predictive control (AGPC) effectively handles the operational constraints of the SCESS while generating an appropriate power reference for the primary (inner) control loop of SCESS. The primary control loop in turn reacts by forcing the SCESS to follow the power command received from the supervisory (outer) control loop in response to a load perturbation. The conventional tracking controller associated with the inner control loop is tuned offline by employing a genetic algorithm. The overall primary control loop is designed to behave similar to a reference system whose model is utilized for calculating dynamic inequality constraints in the optimization process of AGPC. Various modeling and design aspects are addressed, and simulation experiments are finally carried out on a multiarea power system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	computer data storage;experiment;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;online and offline;simulation;social inequality	M.

The proposed solutions include (i) a quasi soft-start technique using over-current protection (OCP) circuits and limited duty cycle control and (ii) a technique to drive a floating load-side switch that suppresses the effect of bond-wire bouncing on its gate-source voltage. The first technique avoids the conventional, overhead start-up circuits and significantly reduces the converter startup time. The second technique gains importance primarily from device reliability viewpoint in high-voltage (HV) conditions.

Design-for-test methodologies have enabled considerable reduction in test time and improvement in defect isolation. Defects which impede correct operation of scan chains are a significant fraction of yield loss. Isolating these defects is an important but underserved activity. Image-based technologies examining an extended area of die are popular diagnostics techniques because they provide intuitive and useful results. Emission based microscopy and laser fault isolation techniques, both static and dynamic, are readily available. However, neither technique provides insight to specific timing characteristics of the IC. Photoemission microscopy suffers from decreasing signal strength at lower voltages, and laser techniques can be difficult to perform with production test setups, requiring involved test pattern and setup adaptation. In this paper, we describe two scan chain defect localization case studies using Laser Voltage Imaging [1] on 40 nm bulk CMOS technology operating at 0.9 V. Results are also compared to other diagnostics techniques, including software-based shift analysis and photoemission microscopy. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

db0bf7d6dd94e1c8b6ead9e78311cf2a4cf49721	decentralized controller design for microgrids in islanded and grid-connected modes		Microgrids are key elements for integrating renewable resources as well as distributed energy storage systems as green sources of electricity. However, the presence of controllers is indispensable in confronting the intermittency and variable operation of renewable resources. This paper explores the control of active and reactive power flow through two modes of microgrid operations, namely islanded and grid-connected modes. A distributed primary-secondary controller was proposed to dynamically share power between parallel distributed energy resources (DERs). Additionally, a tertiary controller was implemented to make full use of renewable generation and optimal power flow inside the microgrid. The studies were conducted in the time-domain, using the DIgSILENT PowerFactory software environment. The study results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach for sharing loads inside a microgrid.	autonomous robot;coefficient;control theory;mg (editor);microgrid;simulation;steady state;voltage regulation	Elham Foruzan;Marcelo C.

This resonant gate driver contains four N-MOSFETs, a resonant inductor, and a capacitor. The proposed gate driver recycles the energy which is stored in the gate capacitor of the SiC MOSFET. The gate drive losses of the resonant gate driver are reduced greatly, and the switching frequency can reach MHz. The design and the loss analysis are introduced in this paper. Finally, the simulation model and the experimental platform of the resonant gate driver are built to validate the theoretical analysis.

Of particular importance is operational transconductance amplifier (OTA), where the crucial analog figures of merit (FOM) such as differential mode gain (ADM), common mode gain (ACM) and common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) decide the suitability of its use at nanometer regime. In the present work, we have studied the analog performance variation of low-k (dual-k) underlap FinFET based single stage OTA with spatial variation in Tox and Xj of S/D profile. Enhanced and variation less threshold voltage and mobility of dual-k underlap FinFET due to of better screening of longitudinal field and pronounced volume inversion effect, are studied in detail. It is observed that at 16 nm gate length the best case ADM, ACM and CMRR of low-k (dualk) FinFET based OTA are 34.2 dB (42.3 dB), 26 dB m (18 dB m), 68.2 dB (84.2 dB) respectively. Subsequently, the spatial variation of Tox and Xj leads to worst case change in ADM and ACM of low-k (dual-k) FinFET based OTA by 6.8 dB ( 2.2 dB) and þ28.2 dB m (þ31.3 dB m) respectively. The negligible deterioration in ACM of dual-k FinFET OTA transforms into CMRR improvements of 37% at this worst case condition as compared to CMRR of low-k FinFET OTA. Furthermore, with gate length scaling, the FOM and their percentage change with Tox and Xj of dual-k FinFET OTA are much better than that of low-k FinFET OTA. & 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This method increases the impedance and reduces the secondary current between 40 and 90 percent of the rated lamp current. While the absolute value of the illuminous intensity is lowered by the reduction in the secondary current, the lamp maintains a uniform brightness of illumination. This method decreases the distortion in the primary wave form which decreases the distortion effect on sensitive electronic systems which may be connected to the same electrical power source or may be in the area near the stabilizer.	geodetic datum	Rowena B Lohman	2009		10.1007/978-0-387-30440-3_109	electric power;transformer;harmonics;optics;brightness;distortion;electrical impedance;materials science;absolute value;fluorescent lamp	Vision	62.84667164988011	43.439936588204155	94933

Since almost all real clocks exhibit drifts, this applies in particular to networks composed of several individual units, each of which being operated with its individual clock. In the present paper, we demonstrate via extensive experiments on a microgrid in the megawatt range that clock drifts may impair frequency synchronization in low-inertia power systems. The experiments also show that—in the absence of a common clock—the standard model of an inverter as an ideal voltage source does not capture this phenomenon. As a consequence, we derive a suitably modified model of an inverter-interfaced unit that incorporates the phenomenon of clock drifts. By using the derived model, we investigate the effects of clock drifts on the performance of droop-controlled grid-forming inverters with regard to frequency synchronization and active power sharing. The modeling and analysis is validated via extensive experiments on a microgrid in the megawatt range.	clock drift;clock signal;clock synchronization;constant-voltage speaker system;control theory;experiment;ibm power systems;inverter (logic gate);mg (editor);microgrid;microwave;norm (social);power inverter;relevance;voltage source;waveform;whole earth 'lectronic link	Johannes Schiffer;Christian A.

Two series-connected SiC MOSFETs with the proposed circuit only require a single standard gate driver to achieve the gate control and voltage balancing during both steady-state and switching transition. Moreover, the proposed circuit is only composed of ten passive components. Therefore, the proposed circuit provides a low-cost and highly reliable method to increase the blocking voltage of the SiC MOSFET. The operation principles of the proposed circuit are theoretically analyzed. In addition, the high-blocking-voltage device is not only required in switching-mode power supply (SMPS) but also in dc-breaker applications. The proposed circuit is then modified to make it suitable to the dc-breaker applications. The simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed circuit in both SMPS and dc-breaker applications.	blocking (computing);gate driver;power mosfet;semiconductor;simulation;steady state;switched-mode power supply;transistor;wafer (electronics)	Yu Ren;Xu Yang;Fan Zhang;Kangping Wang;Wenjie Chen;Laili Wang;Yunqing Pei	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2711579	electronic engineering	EDA	62.96755359409032	42.56200700451544	95264
49a24258ac3674c2d3ed02d8ce51dd1657e16c68	long-distance quantum communication with neutral atoms	long distance;quantum communication	In this thesis, we develop quantitative performance analyses for a variety of quantum communication/computation systems that have the common feature of employing neutral atoms for storage/processing and photons for qubit transmission. For most of these systems, there is a lack of a precise performance analysis to enable a comparison between different scenarios from a top-level system standpoint. One main goal of this thesis is to fill that gap, thus providing quantum system designers with realistic estimates of system performance that can guide and inform the design process. For many applications in quantum communication and distributed quantum processing, we need to share, in advance, an entangled state between two parties. Thus, entanglement distribution is at the core of long-distance quantum communication systems. It not only includes generation and transmission of entangled states, but it also requires storing them for further processing purposes. Whereas the photons are the prime candidate for the former task, they are not appropriate for long-time storage and processing. Metastable levels in some alkali atoms, e.g., rubidium, are attractive venues for quantum storage. In this thesis, we study several basic quantum memory modules-all based on single trapped atoms in high-finesse optical cavities-and analytically evaluate how efficiently they can be loaded with (entangled) quantum states. We propose a non-adiabatic mechanism for driving offresonant Raman transitions that can be used in loading trapped-atom quantum memories. Our method is more flexible than its adiabatic counterpart in that it allows use of larger cavities and a larger class of driving sources. We also describe two proposed implementations for long-distance quantum communication-one that uses trapped atoms as quantum memories and another that employs atomic ensembles for quantum storage. We provide, for the first time, a detailed quantitative performance analysis of the latter system, which enables us to compare these two systems in terms of the fidelity and the throughput that they achieve for entanglement distribution, repeater operation, and quantum teleportation. Finally, we study quantum computing systems that use the cross-Kerr nonlinearity between single-photon qubits and a coherent mode of light. The coherent beam serves a mediating role in coupling two weak single-photon beams. We analytically study this structure using a continuous-time formalism for the cross-Kerr effect in optical fibers. Our results establish stringent conditions that must be fulfilled for the system's proper operation. Thesis Supervisor: Jeffrey H. Shapiro Title: Julius A.

The disadvantages of the classic control scheme of the stabilized loop about the disturbance and resonance suppression are analyzed. In order to damp the torsional vibration effectively, two kinds of additional feedbacks based on the inner motor speed loop are used. The control parameters are given by analytical equations; the disturbance and resonance suppression performance of the stabilized loop with additional feedbacks are comparatively analyzed. Finally, experimental verification is performed on the proposed control algorithms, and the additional feedback signal which is added on the feedback channel of the inner motor speed loop exhibits its superiority in the resonance and disturbance suppression.	resonance;zero suppression	Hongbo Liao;Dapeng Fan	2016	J.

In addition, such applications have high demand for braking at the full rated power. In ordinary drives, the braking energy, which represents 30%-50% of the consumed energy, is dissipated on a brake resistor. Apart from this “energetic” issue, power supply interruption and the input current quality are two additional issues to be solved. A novel regenerative controlled electric drive based on an ultracapacitor as energy storage is presented in this paper. The ultracapacitor with an interface dc-dc converter is used to store and recover the braking energy. In addition, the dc-dc converter controls the rectifier current and reduces the drive input current total-harmonic-distortion factor down to 30%. Moreover, the dc bus voltage is boosted and controlled to be constant and ripple free regardless of the load and the mains voltage variation. In comparison to state-of-the-art solutions, the new solution has better performance regarding size, cost, and efficiency. The presented solution is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified. The results are presented and discussed.	dc-to-dc converter;experiment;interrupt;power supply;powerbuilder foundation classes;rectifier;ripple effect;total harmonic distortion	Petar J.

032487c102aa3b2da0066acd88b98c99d190268b	stability analysis for weak meshed networks with power electronics-based distributed generation		An increased deployment of distributed generation in recent years has contributed to creation of meshed power networks usually seen as a way to improve power flow management capability. Also, power electronics converters have been commonly used to interface distributed resources to the grid, yet their impact on the network stability has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper the stability of meshed weak power networks with high penetration of power electronics converters is studied. For that purpose a small-signal state-space model of the complete power network has been developed by introducing linearized state-space models for each system component including power converters and their control systems, lines, loads and the grid connection. Both eigenvalue and maximum singular value analyses have been then used for the stability assessment. The variation of three typical parameters was studied and their impact on the stability evaluated: 1) PLLs bandwidth, 2) radial grid line inductance value and 3) cross-feeder line inductance value. The principal findings include a positive impact on the stability from the increase of the PLLs bandwidth and a potential compromise of the system safe operation from the increase of the grid inductances.	control system;deploy;eigenvalue;feeder line (network);interface device component;power electronics;radial (radio);singular;small-signal model;state space;switched-mode power supply	Alberto Rodr&#x00ED;guez-Cabero;Milan Prodanovic	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216266	power electronics;grid;control engineering;distributed generation;engineering;grid connection;inductance;bandwidth (signal processing);compromise;control system	HPC	63.99102203675383	37.83264011549806	95659

Currently now, this generator is more and more considered in the technical literature, as an alternative to the synchronous generator. In the case of nonconventional generator systems, especially in the case of wind systems, the dynamic regimes of electrical generators show interest due to the random character of the torque produced by the wind turbine. This paper presents, based on the virtual orthogonal model, the simulation results of the considered generator in a specific wind generator regime, at a pulse variation of the wind turbine torque, that is similar to the one caused by gust changes of the wind speed. Based on the shown simulation results can be noticed the important variations of the machine current and torque at sharp change in the mechanical torque.	simulation	Radu Boraci;Marius Babescu;Nicolae Budisan;A.

In this contribution, we present a passive RF-DC converter for energy harvesting at ultra-low input power at 868 MHz. The novel converter consists of a reactive matching circuit and a combined voltage multiplier and rectifier. The stored energy in the input inductor and capacitance, during the negative wave, is conveyed to the output capacitance during the positive one. Although Dickson and Villard topologies have principally comparable efficiency for multi-stage voltage multipliers, the Dickson topology reaches a better efficiency within the novel ultra-low input power converter concept. At the output stage, a low-pass filter is introduced to reduce ripple at high frequencies in order to realize a stable DC signal. The proposed rectifier enables harvesting energy at even a low input power from -40 dBm for a resistive load of 50 kΩ. It realizes a significant improvement in comparison with state of the art solutions.	anatomy, regional;circuit design;converter device component;display resolution;distance;electric capacitance;electric power conversion;inductor device component;low-pass filter;low-power broadcasting;matching;maximal set;megahertz;numerous;parasites;passive optical network;polychlorinated biphenyls;rf modulator;radio frequency;rectifier device component;ripple effect;sensor;series and parallel circuits;solutions;vergence;voltage multiplier	Issam Chaour;Ahmed Fakhfakh;Olfa Kanoun	2017		10.3390/s17030546	control engineering;electronic engineering;electrical efficiency;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;rectifier;voltage multiplier;physics;quantum mechanics;boost converter	Mobile	60.29694292753755	44.92193945099071	96568

The commonly employed passive solutions are bulky and do not provide output voltage stabilization. Active solutions, based on power-factor correctors with high-frequency switching, provide compactness and regulation capability, but are generally expensive due to the need for fast-recovery diodes and complex EMI filters. This paper presents a high-power-factor rectifier, based on a modified conventional rectifier with passive L–C filter, which improves both the harmonic content of the input current and the power factor, by means of a low-frequency-commutated switch and a small line-frequency transformer, and allows compliance with IEC 1000-3-2 standard with reduced overall inductive components’ volume.	diode;emi;power supply;rectifier;transformer	Simone Buso;Giorgio Spiazzi	2000	IEEE Trans.

Contributions are made in several aspects of the whole system, including converter design, system simulation, controller programming, and experimental setup. The resultant system is capable of tracking MPPs accurately and rapidly without steady-state oscillation, and also, its dynamic performance is satisfactory. The IncCond algorithm is used to track MPPs because it performs precise control under rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. MATLAB and Simulink were employed for simulation studies, and Code Composer Studio v3.1 was used to program a TMS320F2812 digital signal processor.

The WECS is based on a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and transmits its electrical power to an AC grid through an IGBT pulse-width modulation (PWM) converter. The power converter controls the torque of the PMSG according to the torque command, which is determined by using the fuzzy logic. The inputs of the fuzzy logic are the predicted wind speed and the difference between the wind turbine torque and the generator torque. By means of the proposed method, the generator torque is smoothed and the kinetic energy stored by the inertia of the wind turbine can be utilized to smooth the output power fluctuations of the PMSG. In addition, the wind turbine's shaft stress is mitigated compared to a conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations.	computer simulation;electric power conversion;fuzzy logic;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;maximum power transfer theorem;numerical analysis;pulse-width modulation;smoothing	Yuya Izumi;Alok Pratap;Yoshihisa Kinjyo;Aki Uehara;Atsushi Yona;Tomonobu Senjyu;Toshihisa Funabashi;Endusa Billy Muhando	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2011)	10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007368	computer simulation;electric power;control theory;power optimizer;direct torque control	Robotics	66.22853632525288	37.29638553624892	96995

High-voltage high-speed level-shift and gate drivers are developed to achieve nanosecond propagation delay with small solution size. Without external power supply and off-chip components, the proposed gate driver possesses strong driving capability for both low side and high side power MOSFETs. By removing capacitors on power rail and floating power rail, the chip and solution size are minimized. The scheme is implemented in a 0.35 μm high voltage bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process.

a4de1380dcc3939751f4566668609ac66fc990c7	high-precision differential-input buffered and external transconductance amplifier for low-voltage low-power applications		Recently, the demand for low-voltage low-power integrated circuits design has grown dramatically. For battery-operated devices both the supply voltage and the power consumption have to be lowered in order to prolong the battery life. This paper presents an attractive approach to designing a low-voltage low-power high-precision differential-input buffered and external transconductance amplifier, DBeTA, based on the bulk-driven technique. The proposed DBeTA possesses rail-to-rail voltage swing capability at a low supply voltage of ±400 mV and consumes merely 62 μW. The proposed circuit is a universal active element that offers more freedom during the design of current-, voltage-, or mixed-mode applications. The proposed circuit is particularly interesting for biomedical applications requiring low-voltage low-power operation capability where the processing signal frequency is limited to a few kilohertz. An oscillator circuit employing a minimum number of active and passive components has been described in this paper as one of many possible applications. The circuit contains only a single active element DBeTA, two capacitors, and one resistor, which is very attractive for integrated circuit implementation. PSpice simulation results using the 0.18 μm CMOS technology from TSMC are included to prove the unique results. F. Khateb ( ) · N.

We first derive a differentialalgebraic model of a power system network consisting of synchronous generators, loads and a wind power plant modeled by wind turbines and doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG). The models of these three components are coupled via nonlinear power flow equations. In contrast to the traditional approach for solving the power flows via iterative methods that often lead to a local solution, we apply a recently developed parameterhomotopy based numerical continuation algorithm to compute all possible solutions. The method obtains all the solutions of the power flow equations over multiple values of the wind penetration. We observe that depending on the penetration limit and the setpoint value for the magnitude of the wind bus voltage, the system may exhibit several undesired or even unstable equilibria. We illustrate these results through a detailed simulation of a 5-machine power system model with wind injection, and highlight how the solutions may be helpful for small-signal stability assessment.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;control theory;dynamic dispatch;ibm power systems;iterative method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical continuation;setpoint (control system);simulation;small-signal model;sysop	Souvik Chandra;Dhagash Mehta;Aranya Chakrabortty	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7172011	wind power;control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;computational model;statistics;power optimizer	EDA	65.69385211375234	34.851939020430194	98045

The paper uses a linear analysis to evaluate the stability of the interaction between the gate and the open-channels. The pools are modelled with linearized Saint-Venant equations in the frequency domain. The general case is first studied numerically, and closed-form analytical conditions are developed for specific cases. Such conditions could be used for the design of the gates to be installed in an open-channel.	autonomous robot;computer simulation;domain analysis;frequency response;interaction;linear algebra;numerical analysis;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem	Xavier Litrico;Gilles Belaud;Vincent Fromion	2007	2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2007.4434423	control engineering;engineering;control theory;mathematics;frequency domain	Robotics	67.99822175608611	44.48523389432741	98048

This mode of operation occurs not only at high input voltage in conjunction with low load currents but even at medium loading in the vicinity of mains voltage zero crossings. When this circuit is operated in DCM, additional measures are required for improved behavior to avoid conflicts with requirements on total harmonic distortion and regulations as well as safe operation in terms of voltage balancing and overvoltage protection. A detailed analysis of DCM and associated states is performed enabling determination and location of error voltages. Basic rules for the location of error voltages can be found. This leads to a novel optimized modulation and control scheme, facilitating designs without additional inductance. Selected simulation and measurement results prove the enhanced modulation scheme.	block cipher mode of operation;dicom;modulation;requirement;simulation;the legend of zelda: a link to the past;total harmonic distortion;vienna rectifier;virtual 8086 mode	Peter Ide;Frank Schafmeister;Norbert Fröhleke;Horst Grotstollen	2004	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2005.843959	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;total harmonic distortion	EDA	64.82039089668285	41.52237865122234	98554

This paper presents a simple and yet powerful type of attacks, referred to as resonance attacks, on LFC power generation systems. Specifically, in a resonance attack, an adversary craftily modifies the input of a power plant according to a resonance source (e.g., rate of change of frequency) to produce a feedback on LFC power generation system, such that the state of the power plant quickly becomes instable. Extensive computer simulations on popular LFC power generation system models which consist of linear, non-linear, and/or high-order items clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks. As the attack has very low computational cost and communication overhead, it is easy to launch in resource-limited devices such as intelligent electronic devices. In our simulations, the attacker keeps modified input within the normal operating range so as to invade plausibility and consistency based attack detection methods and yet the modifications can quickly drive the system beyond the admissible boundary. Another interesting finding is that by maliciously modifying the input such as power load and tie-line signal over multi-area interconnection channels, a multi-area LFC power generation system could become unreliable more quickly than a single-area system. Finally, we propose countermeasures on the proposed attacks.	adversary (cryptography);algorithmic efficiency;computer simulation;countermeasure (computer);cyber-physical system;interconnection;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);plausibility structure;resonance	Yongdong Wu;Zhuo Wei;Jian Weng;Xin Li;Robert H.

055274e429cef9b449887155a5dc41942c1ac5e0	automatic generation of optimal phase currents for five-phase pmsg control under open phase condition		This paper deals with fault tolerant control of a sinusoidal EMF five-phase permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) connected to an AC-DC converter without neutral connection. Under one open phase condition, the proposed global method is based on an original approach optimization problem minimizing copper losses and cancelling torque ripples. The used optimization algorithm is based to a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. The main idea is to generate automatically the best waveform of the phase currents. Two strategies are investigated; both are minimizing the copper losses. In the first approach, the four phases are unbalanced. In the second case, the first approach is improved by adding criteria leading to balanced currents. The obtained currents phase shift and magnitude are analyzed and the performances of the system are discussed.	algorithm;converter device component;dental permanent fillings;electromagnetic fields;fault tolerance;magnet <device>;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;performance;pregnant mare serum gonadotropins;unbalanced circuit;waveform;negative regulation of copper ion transmembrane transport	Alioune Seck;Luc Moreau;Mohamed-Fouad Benkhoris;Mohamed Machmoum	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216657	electromagnetic coil;phase (waves);control engineering;engineering;control theory;permanent magnet synchronous generator;torque;linear programming;waveform;particle swarm optimization;optimization problem	EDA	65.35207853035631	40.49831055381624	98733

The proposed LDO-controlled current sensor controls the feedback loop of the SWR, rather than the traditional current sensing technique, in the case of fast envelope tracking. The LDO regulator behaves as the master to rapidly trigger the SWR as a slave energy provider to rapidly deliver the average energy to the RF PA for high efficiency. The experimental results show that the test chip fabricated in 0.18μm CMOS process can accurately track the RF envelope signal, and the peak efficiency is 86.7% when the power is 0.95W.	amplifier;cmos;dropout (neural networks);feedback;low-dropout regulator;modulation;radio frequency;sensor;voltage regulator	Wei-Ting Lin;Zong-Yi Lin;Chia-Hao Liu;Ke-Horng Chen;Ying-Hsi Lin;Jian-Ru Lin;Tsung-Yen Tsai	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351132	current sensor;electronic engineering;low-dropout regulator;radio frequency;modulation;radio frequency power transmission;amplifier;rf power amplifier;computer science;cmos	Arch	60.615150591017205	46.09955308674058	99677
3b241d673f1ba35a65d532ebc401beba0c0e8ffe	simple constant-temperature oven and control system	control system	An ideal oven from the point of view of temperature control is one in which the controlling thermostat can immediately act to correct any deviation of heat input or loss from the values required to maintain a predetermined temperature. In practice this ideal is most closely approached with a thermostat which has a small dead space and a small heat capacity and which is in very close thermal contact with the heated region. An oven constructed in principle like an oven for a frequency-standard crystalmeets these requirements by completely surrounding the experimental space with a stable region of small thermal inertia whose temperature can easily be controlled. This region is thermally lagged from the rest of the oven to enable it to make small temperature excursions independently of the rest of the system. Since the thermostat is usually localized, this region must respond over its whole extent equally and in phase with changes of power. Abstract: A number of laboratory measurements require a constant and uniform ambient temperature. A thermocouple-monitored system consisting of an oven, a stable reference source and a chopper-amplifier controller unit has been developed. This system provides a stable and uniform temperature, ±0.1°C from 200° to 1050°C in a cylindrical region 5 em in diameter and 12 em long. Each of the parts of the system is discussed and their operation as an integrated whole considered.	amplifier;chopper (electronics);control system;dvd region code;in-phase and quadrature components;internationalization and localization;point of view (computer hardware company);requirement	G.

Distributed control architectures however require an implicit trust between participating agents, in that each must faithfully communicate the appropriate control variables to neighboring agents. Here we study the case where some agents attempt to “cheat the system” by adding a bias to the averaging controller in order to lower their generation cost. We quantify the effect of this dishonesty on the resource allocation problem and introduce a “cost graph” whose weights measure the effect of the bias on the optimal equilibrium. Moreover, we propose an “honesty-enforcing” controller which counteracts the dishonest agents, and restores the optimal setpoint of the network.	concurrency control;distributed control system;maxima and minima;operating point;setpoint (control system)	Nima Monshizadeh;Claudio De Persis;John W.

138955b1c9f25e7d05f20968edec8d9fae58b796	analytical modeling and implementation of a coaxially wound transformer with integrated filter inductance for isolated soft-switching dc–dc converters		In this paper, we propose an approach for integrating a series filter inductance in a coaxially wound transformer (CWT) as a potential alternative to conventional solenoidally wound transformers (SWT) for high-power isolated soft-switching dc–dc converters. The critical elements that determine the size and the performance of soft-switching dc–dc converters are the isolation transformer and the filter elements. While conventional SWTs using a stray magnetic field as a filter inductance often suffer from a considerably increased loss, heat congestion, and electromagnetic interference, a CWT is rarely affected by high frequency and fringing effects. The desired properties are still valid while the required filter inductance is fully integrated with an isolation transformer using the proposed method. In addition, the evenly distributed magnetic fields in a concentric geometry enable accurate electrical and mechanical analysis and a specific application-oriented design. In this paper, the operating principles, design procedure, and loss modeling of a CWT with an integrated filter inductance are introduced. Its functionality and suitability for high-frequency applications were proven by theoretical analysis and experiments. A prototype transformer with an integrated inductance 4 mH was facilitated and evaluated in a 15 kV-SiC  mosfet-based 6 k–400 Vdc stage for a solid-state transformer of up to 6.5 kW at a switching frequency of 20 kHz.	clock rate;complex wavelet transform;dc-to-dc converter;experiment;interference (communication);isolation transformer;network congestion;prototype;standard widget toolkit;transformers	Seunghun Baek;Subhashish Bhattacharya	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2740855	leakage inductance;control engineering;engineering;isolation transformer;delta-wye transformer;energy efficient transformer;equivalent series inductance;transformer types;electronic engineering;rotary variable differential transformer;flyback transformer	EDA	64.01074234520689	42.86892013423729	101213

fca0c63ede8c8755548f600f7ac94ab5662f3e21	study of reactive power compensation capabilities and lc filter design for a multilevel three-phase current-source d-statcom		This work shows the use of the operating region of a D-STATCOM based on multilevel current-source inverters to define its operating point and its LC filter. A multilevel current-source D-STATCOM model is defined to compute its operating region and obtain a relation between reactive power compensation and the device power losses. Using this relationship the losses costs of the reactive power compensation is computed and used to define a methodology to get an operating point and design the LC as a function of the desired cost for nominal power compensation. The methodology is tested in the design of a 125kVA/380V distribution grid, where simulation results corroborate the analysis, including changes from one operating point to another, in open loop, to show the compensation capabilities, the power topology effort and the grid mains variables with compensation.

These amplifiers are classified here as Class-E 3  F and transmission-line (TL) Class-E  3 F  2 . The proposed circuits offer means to alleviate some of the major issues faced by existing topologies such as substantial power losses due to the parasitic resistance of the large inductor in the Class-EF load network and deviation from ideal Class-EF operation due to the effect of device output inductance at high frequencies. Both lumped-element and transmission-line load networks for the Class-E  3 F PA are described. The load networks of the Class-E 3  F and TL Class-E 3  F 2  amplifier topologies developed in this paper simultaneously satisfy the Class-EF optimum impedance requirements at fundamental frequency, second, and third harmonics as well as simultaneously providing matching to the circuit optimum load resistance for any prescribed system load resistance. Optimum circuit component values are analytically derived and validated by harmonic balance simulations. Trade-offs between circuit figures of merit and component values with some practical limitations being considered are discussed.	amplifier;transmission line	Mury Thian;Vincent F.

The output power conversion of a PV array depends on atmospheric conditions, such as the solar radiation and ambient temperature, and its conversion efficiency is low. Therefore, a MPPT controller is necessary for a PV conversion system, in order to improve the output power. A PV cell is a p-n semiconductor junction. Photon motion, temperature, or electricity conduction cause anomalous diffusion phenomena in inhomogeneous media. In order to describe nonlinear-characteristics, fractional-order calculus can be used to express the dynamic behaviors using fractional-order incremental conductance and to adjust the terminal voltage to the maximum power point. Inspired by the synchronization of Sprott system, a voltage detector is formulated to trace the desired voltage and to control the duty cycle of a boost converter. For a small photovoltaic system, the numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the tracking time and can improve the conversion efficiency.	algorithm;battery charger;boost converter;cell (microprocessor);conductance (graph);controller (computing);duty cycle;electric power conversion;electrical junction;electronic circuit;embedded system;experiment;maximum power transfer theorem;microcontroller;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;operating point;page view;perturbation theory;power supply;p–n junction;semiconductor	Chao-Lin Kuo;Chia-Hung Lin;Her-Terng Yau;Jian-Liung Chen	2013	IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems	10.1109/JETCAS.2013.2272839	control engineering;synchronization;nominal power;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;telecommunications;solar cell efficiency;computer science;engineering;photovoltaic system;control theory;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;power optimizer	EDA	66.13540183565061	37.91968054761413	102870

c5fbb6e7e1afdacc360128eb181aa25c724c372f	synchronous rectifier for high-power wireless transfer applications		The appliance of wireless power transfer based on inductive coupling, nowadays, is a state-of-the-art approach and widely used in the industry. Different kinds of standards have been established in the past years, e.g. Qi or WPC (Wireless Power Consortium)to name but a few. Regardless of the development, the rectification of the alternative current (AC)itself is, in general, not part of the standard. Up to now, low-cost devices such as smartphone chargers use standard half- or full-wave passive rectifiers. This might give acceptable results for low-power and/or low-cost devices but the achievable efficiency is limited by this approach. The dissipated heat itself is for low-power devices, in most cases, neglectable as the charger itself is mostly connected to the power grid. In this paper, a straightforward solution is proposed which has been successfully implemented for < 600 W wireless-power application. The solution is not limited to sinusoidal waveforms and prohibits reverse-current flow automatically. The approach automatically switches to passive rectification, when running idle or if a low-load is present, to maximize the efficiency without the requirement to know the waveform for adjustment in advance.

The frequency response due to a unit force, for the full model as well as the reduced unsorted and sorted models was studied. Dc gain is used as the criterion for sorting. Simple reductions as well as ‘modred’ option of MATLAB were used for model reduction. In this paper a method of reducing modes, ‘balanced reduction’ will also be introduced. The method will be compared with dc and peak gain ranking methods using a smart plate model. The step and impulse responses for all the models were also studied. The model with minimum number of modes retained, and with minimum deviation from full model characteristics was identified analytically. It is proposed to use this model subsequently for vibration control applications.	addressing mode;balanced ternary;frequency band;frequency response;matlab;soft-in soft-out decoder;sorting;state-space representation;truncation	G.

4896bf1edf12013e41f7923878c87f13df179ad2	exploration of robustness limits and esd emi impact in a protection device for advanced cmos technology		Article history: Received 16 May 2017 Accepted 27 June 2017 Available online xxxx The electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection is pivotal for advanced CMOS technologymanufacturing. Today, several robust solutions are available on the market with sufficient robustness and compliance with the ESD window. In the context of solution optimization and exploration of the initial performance limits it is interesting to investigate a protection beyond its initial feature specification (the usual target is: 1 kV HBM, 250 V CDM). This analysis contributes to a better understanding of the internal behaviour and allows us to push the final performance limits of the device. This study is based on a single SCR/diode device where ESD and EMI in the device are extracted to localize the possible weak spots. 3D simulation approach allocates the potential damage locations that are confirmed by failures analysis. The results are useful for improving the device robustness against ESD events and lead tomore competitive design.Moreover, it iswell known that the failmechanism involves several physical, electrical and layout parameters with their variabilities.We conclude that additional information of magnetic field intensities and current densities are useful to enhance the understanding of the failure events. © 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	cmos;diode;discharger;emi;electrostatic loudspeaker;high bandwidth memory;mathematical optimization;simulation;trionic	Philippe Galy;Wim Schoenmaker	2017	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2017.06.073	engineering;electronic engineering;robustness (computer science);diode;electrostatic discharge;cmos;emi	Metrics	55.95130663287236	42.38584488967215	103413
54c98b8e55ce7549bb59466bc2bf6588e9b77392	a current-reference-based selective harmonic current mitigation pwm technique to improve the performance of cascaded h-bridge multilevel active rectifiers	power quality grid tied multilevel rectifier selective harmonic current mitigation pwm voltage harmonics;harmonic analysis power harmonic filters rectifiers inductance switching frequency voltage control pulse width modulation	In this paper, a selective harmonic current mitigation pulsewidth modulation (SHCM-PWM) technique with low switching frequencies is proposed for grid-connected cascaded H-bridge multilevel rectifiers to fully meet harmonic requirements within extended harmonic spectrum. In the proposed technique, instead of using the voltage references to calculate switching angles for the rectifier as in conventional selective harmonic elimination-PWM (SHE-PWM) or selective harmonic mitigation-PWM (SHM-PWM), current references are used to compensate the current harmonics due to both grid voltage harmonics and rectifier input voltage harmonics so as to meet the current harmonic requirements and total demand distortion within the whole harmonic spectrum. Furthermore, the techniques to design the critical parameters including switching frequency, the highest harmonic order that can be mitigated using the proposed current-reference-based technique, and the coupling inductance that can attenuate the current harmonic orders above the highest order are investigated. With the same switching frequency, the proposed SHCM-PWM technique uses smaller coupling inductance to meet higher orders of current harmonic requirements than the conventional SHE-PWM technique. Finally, simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the proposed technique.	clock rate;distortion;experiment;h bridge;harmonic spectrum;pulse-width modulation;rectifier;requirement;simulation	Amirhossein Moeini;Hui Zhao;Shuo Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2630664	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;harmonics	EDA	65.30475960872103	40.94085816095695	103867
995506d9cca1b568871dba15e709e1f4024aab46	a compact integrated charger with disturbance reduced induction motor drive for plug-in electric vehicles (pevs)		The most dominant part of a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is its charger and propulsion system. These two parts are collectively referred as power electronic interface (PEI) of PEV. This paper proposes an onboard integrated charger with single-stage converter, coupled with feed-forward field-oriented controlled (FFOC) induction motor drive in the propulsion system. An improved control strategy to operate this PEI is also developed. Single-stage DC/DC converter utilized in PEI contains the least number of components compared to other existing converters. It can perform buck/boost operation in all the three modes of operation, i.e. plug-in charging, propulsion and regenerative braking. Propulsion drive in the PEI is composed of PWM converter fed three-phase induction motor drive. When a drive is operated in a closed loop, variation in load torque hinders the speed of the motor, consequently affecting the system performance. To avoid this, field-oriented controlled induction motor drive presented in this paper uses an additional feed-forward loop for the resilient speed control under input load disturbances.	battery charger;block cipher mode of operation;boost;control theory;plug-in (computing);pulse-width modulation	K.

2ab0b175dc3e4a78460053bd3b054357c2bd74d3	γ-z-source dc circuit breaker operation with variable coupling coefficient k		Coupled inductors Γ-Z-source DC circuit breakers are designed to be an automatic, fast, and reliable breaker for many medium DC voltage power systems operating with renewable energy sources. The aim of this work is to analyze and evaluate the performance of the Γ-Z-source DC breaker under different conditions of coupling. In that aspect, the voltage, current and impedance transfer functions are derived in terms of the coupling coefficient between the two inductances in the circuit. The frequency response is also analyzed under different values of coupling coefficient. Results verify that coupling coefficient need to be higher than a void value for the circuit breaker to interrupt current due to a faulty situation but need not be a perfect unity. Also, the void value of coupling coefficient can be changed by varying the turn ratio of the coupled coils in the circuit breaker. Simulation results confirm that as the turn ratio increases the required coupling coefficient drops allowing designers more flexibility in selecting the coupling degree.	characteristic impedance;coefficient;coupling constant;frequency response;ibm power systems;loose coupling;simulation;the void (virtual reality)	Haider Al-khafaf;Johnson A.

The accompanying “loss of inertia” and fluctuations by renewable sources jeopardize the system stability, as testified by the ever-growing number of frequency incidents. As a remedy, numerous studies demonstrate how virtual inertia can be emulated through various devices, but few of them address the question of “where” to place this inertia. A recent case study demonstrates that the placement of virtual inertia hugely impacts system efficiency. In this article, we carry out a comprehensive analysis in an attempt to address the optimal inertia placement problem. We consider a linear network-reduced power system model along with an ℋ2 performance metric accounting for the network coherency. The optimal inertia placement problem turns out to be highly non-convex, yet we provide a set of closed-form global optimality results for particular problem instances as well as a computational approach resulting in locally optimal solutions, that outperform placement heuristics.	computation;convex optimization;emulator;gradient;h2 database engine;heuristic (computer science);local optimum;mathematical optimization;mihajlo d. mesarovic;simulation	Bala Kameshwar Poolla;Saverio Bolognani;Florian Dörfler	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525263	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;resource management;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;measurement;statistics	EDA	63.59846788054656	32.807796401745506	104206

However, line-commutated converters (LCC) are by far the most recognized and widespread HVDC technology. This article investigates the feasibility of a hybrid configuration that combines an LCC with the VSC for the integration of OWF. A hybrid HVDC, with an offshore VSC and onshore LCC, is implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC. The OWF is composed of variable speed wind turbines driving permanent magnet synchronous generators. This paper mainly focuses on the control strategy for overall system. The proposed control strategy is verified through simulation under various conditions, including wind speed variations and onshore faults.	control theory;one-way function;open web foundation;shadow copy;simulation;voltage source	Raymundo E.

20d252b871b9c8c55abae2c87fff111b37e35fed	a simple control technique for distributed generations in grid-connected and islanded modes		This paper presents a control technique for the seamless transfer of AC microgrid between grid-connected and islanded modes of operation. When a fault occurs in the utility grid, microgrid should be disconnected from the utility grid to protect its components and continuously supply the local loads in the microgrid. In the opposite case, if the utility grid is in normal condition, the microgrid should be connected to the utility grid. To fulfilling these control objectives, the proposed control technique handles two transfer modes: grid-connected to islanded mode and vice versa. Each distributed generation (DG) unit is controlled by the voltage control technique in islanded mode whereas the DG is controlled by feed-forward based control technique in grid-connected mode so as to ensure the seamless transition. Furthermore, parallel converters have been controlled by droop control technique in order to deliver desired power to the local loads in the islanded mode. The general operation principle is analyzed and demonstrated by means of simulation.	block cipher mode of operation;discontinuous galerkin method;mg (editor);microgrid;portable c compiler;seamless3d;simulation	Sertac Bayhan;Haithem Abu-Rub	2018	2018 IEEE 27th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2018.8433858	control engineering;control theory;voltage;grid;engineering;distributed generation;voltage droop;ac power;automatic frequency control;microgrid	Robotics	64.01730534971924	36.97558152453152	104851

Both generators and controllable loads are utilized to achieve frequency stability while minimizing regulation cost. In contrast to recent results, the design is completely decentralized and does not require communication between areas. Our control enforces operational constraints not only in equilibrium but also during transient. Moreover, our control is capable of adapting to unknown load disturbance. We show that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and converges to an equilibrium that minimizes the regulation cost.

Design criteria for dimensioning the primary control parameters, including voltage limits, are offered by analyzing the transients appearing in the system. The proposed secondary control is centralized and regulates the operating point (OP) of the network so that optimal power flow (OPF) is achieved. Compared to previous works, this paper further elaborates, both analytically and through simulations, on the coordination between the primary and secondary control layers. This includes how local primary controllers have to be driven by the centralized controller in order to ensure a smooth transition to the optimal OP.	centralized computing;hierarchical control system;loss function;mathematical optimization;multiseat configuration;operating point;optimization problem;simulation	Catalin Gavriluta;Ignacio Candela;Alvaro Luna;Antonio Gómez Expósito;Pedro Rodríguez	2015	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2014.2365854	control engineering;electronic engineering;power control;engineering;control theory	Arch	64.28275175885796	37.004855054484935	105147

In either case are additional means required for balancing the current or voltage stress of the devices. The three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter topology offers an inherent means to ensure dynamic voltage balancing of a maximum of two series-connected devices. Higher operating voltages can be achieved by series connection of entire inverter topologies. Two circuit topologies that behave as five-level units are considered. Synchronous optimal PWM is applied for their control. This permits reducing the switching frequency to the 100-Hz region without sacrificing on harmonic distortion.	clock rate;distortion;inverter (logic gate);optimal control;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;semiconductor device;series and parallel circuits	Joachim Holtz;Nikolaos Oikonomou	2008	IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications	10.1109/08IAS.2008.304	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory	Arch	64.39031863875829	40.66448826957314	105304

If the machine is supplied by voltage inverters, in the wave of the voltage entering the motor, the superior time harmonics, of the order v = jmf ± k, j = 1, 2, …; k∊Z, occur. They are even, providing j is odd, and odd, providing j is even. The presence of the time harmonics in the supplying voltage determines, among others, an intensification of the skin effect at the start of the motor, comparing to the situation of sinusoidal supplying. The present study is focused on the skin effect which occurs in the deep bars of the rotors of the three-phase induction motors, where they are supplied by voltage-source-invertors. In this work is being treated the problem of the theoretic determination of the equivalent modification factors of the rotor parameters, while the cage induction motors are being supplied by inverters. The determination of these two factors is being globally made.	faraday cage;inverter (logic gate);mathematical induction;power supply;pulse-width modulation;r.o.t.o.r.;theory;voltage source	Sorin Musuroi;Marcus Svoboda;Ciprian Sorandaru;Thomaq Koblara;Nicola-Valeriu Olarescu	2011	2011 IEEE EUROCON - International Conference on Computer as a Tool	10.1109/EUROCON.2011.5929282	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;harmonic analysis;induction motor	Vision	66.14014885952366	42.730747358809026	105610

How to improve the stability and efficiency of the wind power conversion system is particularly important. A maximum power point tracking algorithm is proposed based on the experiment data: the open-jet & return-flow wind tunnel is used to simulate the natural wind and the curve of the optimal rotate speed versus the optimal power has been calculated. The rotate speed of wind turbine can be controlled according to the curve and the goal of real-time controlling the output power has been achieved consequently. The analytical procedure by using proposed algorithm can be well applied to the vertical axis wind turbines, and the stability and the efficiency of the wind power conversion system have been increased effectively.	algorithm;apache axis;electric power conversion;maximum power transfer theorem;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation	Yue-Ping Zhu;Zong-Xiao Yang;Ai-Qi Si;Lei Song	2014	Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control	10.1109/ICNSC.2014.6819694	control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;base load power plant;wind profile power law;engineering;control theory;power optimizer	Robotics	66.48299788571286	37.21955510396911	105836

Therefore, it is essential that both the traction motor and the associated drive operate at their optimal efficiencies throughout the driving schedule. In typical HEV propulsion applications, the traction motor and the drive are used over the entire torque/speed operational range. In view of this fact, this paper aims at modeling the inverter and motor losses/efficiencies over typical city and highway driving schedules. The noteworthy losses within a typical three-phase dc/ac traction inverter, such as the switching and conduction losses for both the insulated-gate bipolar transistors and the antiparallel diodes, are modeled and simulated over the city and highway driving patterns. An induction motor (IM) is used for a medium-sized sport utility vehicle, which was modeled in the advanced vehicle simulator (ADVISOR) software. The significant IM losses that were considered in the study include the stator copper losses, rotor copper losses, and core losses. Thus, the average efficiencies of both the inverter drive and the induction traction motor are evaluated and summarized under city as well as highway driving conditions. Finally, based on the individual-model-based efficiency analysis, the overall traction motor drive system efficiency is estimated.	antiparallel (electronics);diode;hybrid fibre-coaxial;inductive reasoning;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;power inverter;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;traction teampage	Sheldon S.

The strategy of this algorithm considers the value of short circuit current to generate the current at the maximum power. In this work, the current reference is generated by genetic algorithm (GA). In this way, short-circuit current measurements are not necessary, thus overcoming the reduction in output that result. A robust control law using Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) tools is developed to track the current reference at the optimum operating point of the PV-panel, in the sense of the MPPT algorithm. The performances of the proposed approach are ensured in simulation, using real profiles of irradiance and temperature measured on platform.	genetic algorithm;linear matrix inequality;maximum power transfer theorem;operating point;optimal control;performance;robust control;short circuit;simulation;solar cell	M.

Each phase of the converter is composed of four three-state converters, all of them connected to the same capacitor dc link voltage and their output connected in series through output transformers. The main advantages of this kind of converter are the negligible harmonic distortion obtained and the very low switching frequency operation. The single-phase equivalent circuit is analyzed and their governing equations derived. The dc link voltage control, based on manipulating the converter's voltage phase, is analyzed together with the circuit's characteristics that determine the capability to draw or deliver active and reactive current. Simulation results for this application are compared with conventional pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) converters, showing that this filter can compensate load current harmonics, keeping better-quality sinusoidal currents from the source. The simulated configuration uses a 1-F ultracapacitor in the dc link, making it possible to store energy and deliver it during short voltage dips. This is achieved by applying a modulation control to maintain a stable ac voltage during dc voltage drops. A prototype of the filter was implemented and tested, and the obtained current waveforms showed to be as good as expected.	clock rate;distortion;equivalent circuit;prototype;pulse-width modulation;series and parallel circuits;simulation;three-state logic;transformers;voltage source	Micah Ortuzar;Rodrigo Carmi;Juan Dixon;Luis Moran	2006	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2006.870656	equivalent circuit;forward converter;control engineering;electronic engineering;charge pump;flyback converter;engineering;ćuk converter;control theory;buck–boost converter;low-dropout regulator;active filter;physics;quantum mechanics;boost converter;negative impedance converter	Mobile	64.81935119464119	42.34764955236894	107381

Special importance is given to the treatment of the necessary geometrical operations. In the first part, we introduce a new representation class for convex polyhedra, the symbolic orthogonal projections (sops). A sop encodes a polyhedron as an orthogonal projection of a higher-dimensional polyhedron. This representation is treated purely symbolically, in the sense that the actual computation of the projection is avoided. We show that fundamental geometrical operations, like affine transformations, intersections, Minkowski sums, and convex hulls, can be performed by block matrix operations on the representation. Compared to traditional representations, like half-space representations, vertex representations, or representations by support functions, this is a unique feature of sops. Linear programming helps us to evaluate sops. In the second part, we investigate the application of sops in reachability analysis of hybrid systems. It turns out that sops are well-suited for the discrete computations. Thereupon, we demonstrate also the applicability of sops for the continuous computation of reachability analysis. By a subtle parallel computation of a precise sop-based representation and a simplified representation, we tackle the problem of monotonic growing sizes of the sops. Additionally, we present experimental results which also show that sops allow an efficient and accurate computation of the reachable states.	computation;hybrid system;linear programming;parallel computing;polyhedron;reachability	Willem Hagemann	2015			computer science;calculus;algorithm	Logic	53.829478477004336	34.455510973101276	108053

The concept of middle-vectors is proposed and applied to restrain the neutral point (NP) voltage variations. By using the synthesized middle-vector method, the average current across the NP can be controlled to almost zero, while the neutral point voltage is not affected at every sampling instant. Moreover, the variation of neutral point voltage due to unbalanced capacitor voltages can be adjusted by controlling the proposed middle-vectors. The effectiveness of compensation for departure of NP potential during the system dynamic processes is guaranteed by distributing the active time of middle voltage vectors to the corresponding small voltage vectors. Detailed mathematical analysis is presented to illustrate the proposed middle vector synthesizing method.

The control scheme selects the switching state that minimizes the reactive power and the error in the output currents according to their reference values. This is accomplished by using a prediction horizon of one sample time and a very intuitive control law. Experimental results with a 6.8-kVA indirect matrix converter prototype are provided in order to validate the proposed control scheme. The converter uses standard digital signal processor operating at a sampling frequency of 20 mus. It is shown that the idea of controlling this converter topology with a predictive approach can be implemented simply and input currents with unity power factor and a total harmonic distortion lower than 5% can be obtained.	ac/ac converter;digital signal processor;optimal control;prototype;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;total harmonic distortion	Pablo Correa;José R.

66380b7cb7df0bf3a4b8e0ddaa0e1f60dfe501e0	current-fed isolated lcc-t resonant converter with zcs and improved transformer utilization		Resonant converters with capacitive output filters are quite popular for their higher voltage gain and compact designs. But majority of these converters underutilize the transformer as they are subjected to discontinuous currents. This discontinuous currents possess huge current ripples which produce huge core losses and aggravates the temperature raise of the transformer. This paper presents a LCC-T resonant DC/DC converter with capacitive output filter operating all switches in ZCS switching mode and whose transformer current is a continuous with minimum stress on resonant tank components. This is achieved by bringing transformer in series to inductor. This theory is supported with simulation results.	appendix;constant current;converter device component;inductor device component;leukoencephalopathy, brain calcifications, and cysts;liver carcinoma;network switch;resonance;series and parallel circuits;simulation;switch device component;switched-mode power supply;transformer;density;septation initiation signaling;voltage	Venkata R.

The two-step commutation is adopted in the transition interval, and outside of which the one-step commutation is adopted, and it can effectively avoid inaccurate voltage sector judgment when input voltages are similar. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of proposed commutation strategy is verified by simulation and experiment, whose results show that the voltage sector can be accurately determined by proposed method and input current will be improved.

The controller consists of integrator and some filters, instead of the common but complicated demodulation and remodulation modules. Compared with using no oscillation suppression scheme, the proposed simplified oscillation suppression control scheme can achieve an improvement of the sense mode of the MCVG. The inband spectrum ripple of the angular rate output are improved from 51.4 dB to 4.23 × 10-4 dB. Correspondingly, these two performance parameters are improved by 370.4 and 186.2 times, which are higher than two orders of magnitude, respectively. Bias stability is improved from 9.72 deg/h to 2.5 deg/h.

The topology is capable of driving an even number of lamps with identical current without additional balancing circuits, thereby significantly reducing the display's size, weight, and cost. Aiming at alleviating the influence of parasitic capacitance and thus balancing the lamp currents and light output, the proposed topology comprises series CCFLs and the secondary sides of transformers, takes the leakage inductances of the transformer and the parasitic capacitances of the metal back-plank as a resonance tank, and provides both ends of lamps the voltages of equal magnitude and opposite phase. A prototype of the multi-CCFLs driver is designed and built for a backlight module with 14 lamps in a 32-in LCD.

e2f866144393c38322c451e9441bd02fec48f553	advances in esd protection for ics		Welcome to the world of Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Reliability, represented in this special issue with seven research papers from different areas of this exciting research and applications field! Starting from the ancient Greeks, who first discovered static electricity and were describing its effects based on the Greek word for amber – g9kejsqom (ēlektron) – meaning ‘‘shining, bright, radiant’’, till today, ESD plays a major role in our ‘technological’ life. Nowadays, the ESD problems provoke wide range of scientific and engineering studies, which continuously face new challenges with the introduction of new semiconductor technologies and developing of new products and applications. The first three papers in our special ESD issue of Microelectronics Reliability focus on advanced studies related to developing new and improved ESD characterization techniques. The first paper in the series, by Maloney, describes an accurate analytical modeling approach for the Human Body Model ESD stress and tester waveforms, important for understanding the reaction and modeling the impact of the HBM stress mode on the functionality of the modern Integrated Circuits (IC’s). Complimentary, the paper by Smedes et al. studies some subtle effects related to the other major ESD stress mode – the Charged Device Model (CDM), and pinpoints some important improvements of the CDM testing affecting the IC product reliability qualification. The last paper in this ‘ESD characterization’ series, by Zhou et al., is focused on developing new characterization procedures allowing to achieve improved correlation between two measurement techniques for the ESD performance – the very fast Transmission Line Pulse (vf-TLP) and the CDM testing of IC’s. Once the ESD characterization methodologies are being reliably established, it comes the time for research in the area of improving the ESD reliability of different classes IC’s, as covered in the following three papers in our special issue.

Medium-voltage (MV) microgrids can be subjected to a high penetration level of dynamic loads [e.g., induction motor (IM) loads]. The highly nonlinear IM dynamics that couple active power, reactive power, voltage, and supply frequency dynamics challenge the stability of MV droop-controlled microgrids. However, detailed analysis and, more importantly, stabilization of MV microgrids with IM loads, are not reported in current literature. To fill in this gap, this paper presents integrated modeling, analysis, and stabilization of MV droop-controlled microgrids with IM load. A detailed small-signal model of a typical MV droop-controlled microgrid system, which is based on the IEEE Standard 399, with both dynamic and static loads is developed. The proposed model accounts for the impact of supply frequency dynamics associated with the droop-control scheme to accurately link the microgrid frequency dynamics to the motor dynamics. To stabilize the microgrid system in the presence of IM loads, a 2-degree-of-freedom active damping controller is proposed to stabilize the newly introduced oscillatory dynamics. The proposed supplementary active damping controller does not interfere with the steady-state performance, and yields robust control performance under a wide range of droop parameters and robust damping performance at small- and large-signal disturbances. A theoretical analysis, simulation, and experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.	discontinuous galerkin method;factor analysis;inductive reasoning;large-signal model;microgrid;microwave;model–view–adapter;noise shaping;nonlinear system;r.o.t.o.r.;robust control;simulation;small-signal model;steady state;transform, clipping, and lighting;voltage converter	Alireza Kahrobaeian;Yasser Abdel-Rady I.

However, the preconception of resonant-operating results in a fact that most previous works pay little attention to the optimization of the compensate capacitors; these design methods cannot meet the newly arisen challenges when designing a high-power wireless charging system (WCS) for electric vehicles (EVs). This paper presents a design method featuring compensate capacitor optimizing for better design of practical kilowatt-level WCS. Comparison with conventional frequency tuning method is made based on equivalent circuit model analysis. Compensating characteristics of a typical WCS are studied to find out how the compensate capacitors affect the systemic performance. Furthermore, considering peculiar constraints and requirements of EV-oriented WCS, we present detailed optimizing procedure and adjustment criterion. Finally, correctness and effectiveness of the proposed optimizing method are verified by a 3.3-kW wireless charging prototype. A transfer efficiency value of 92% over 21 cm and 88.5% over 36 cm is achieved; voltages of the transmit and receive coils are simultaneously minimized and balanced for security.	acoustic coupler;algorithm;british informatics olympiad;correctness (computer science);electronic circuit simulation;equivalent circuit;extended validation certificate;mathematical optimization;polynomial;power inverter;prototype;requirement;web coverage service	Qingwei Zhu;Lifang Wang;Chenglin Liao	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2321349	control engineering;electronic engineering;resonant inductive coupling;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	66.0623042980047	44.81202070183419	110105

The second stage is composed by a capacitor used as energy storage element, which consists in the component used to link both batteries. The switch network control and its interaction with the energy storage element is performed by a digital controller.

5f295ebc9f6c4926d594be7f17019fd6c1bcd73d	a low — voltage hysteresis comparator for low power applications		A Hysteresis comparator with low supply voltage is proposed. The comparator has PMOS input stage, NMOS current mirror, and PMOS load stage using positive feedback. The signal of the PMOS input stage is sent to the PMOS load stage via the NMOS current mirror. Positive feedback of the PMOS load stage introduces bistable characteristics to the comparator. The hysteresis comparator with low voltage operation is required for low power applications using under noisy environment. With bistable characteristics, the comparator has two different trip point voltages when input signal crosses reference signals to upper side or crosses to lower side. The hysteresis comparator can compare input signal and reference signal correctly under noisy environment. To achieve low power system, decreasing supply voltage is widely used. Conventional hysteresis comparator doesnu0027t suite for low power applications because it is difficult to operate transistors in comparator in saturation region. In this paper, we proposed the hysteresis comparator operating in low supply voltage. Proposed comparator operates in 0.8V supply voltage. The area of the proposed comparator is 203.5μm 2 , power consumption is 0.24μW. To achieve the low voltage operation, the proposed hysteresis comparatoru0027s input differential pair is connected to lord stage with positive feedback via the NMOS current mirror. In the load stage with positive feedback, PMOS tail transistor is used to decrease the static power consumption. The proposed comparator is suitable for low power analog — digital converters and sensor applications for battery operation applications which are used in noisy environments.	comparator;current mirror;differential signaling;flip-flop (electronics);hysteresis;nmos logic;pmos logic;positive feedback;transistor;transistor–transistor logic	Takumi Saito;Satoshi Komatsu	2017	2017 24th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems (ICECS)	10.1109/ICECS.2017.8292002	comparator;electronic engineering;nmos logic;electric power system;pmos logic;current mirror;positive feedback;voltage;computer science;low voltage	EDA	61.424013602093105	45.84194702112865	110949

Causal analysis, based on the fundamental properties of the load, is used to justify the choice of this topology. In order to correctly control the lamp power, the operating mode selected for this converter combines discontinuous current-mode and soft-commutation (ZCS), obtaining as well low electromagnetic emissions, and reducing switching losses. The model of the lamp is briefly presented and it allows a simple state plane analysis to calculate all the electric variables involved in the converter and consequently to select the components of the supply. The mathematical relationships obtained from this process are validated with simulations and experimental results.

Attention was drawn to the issue of converter reliability due to the large number of power devices used in CHMC applications. This paper proposed an effective fault-tolerant strategy by using H-bridge building block (HBBB) redundancy in CHMC-based STATCOM. The operating principle and the control strategy of the fault tolerance are proposed and discussed. The controller design consideration for the fault-tolerant STATCOM is presented. The proposed fault-tolerant control strategy is implemented on a seven-level CHMC-based STATCOM simulation platform and a five-level CHMC-based STATCOM hardware prototype.

The primary side of the converter is composed of FB insulated-gate bipolar transistors, which are driven by phase-shift control. The secondary side is composed of a resonant tank and a half-wave rectifier. Without an auxiliary circuit, zero-voltage switching (for leading-leg switches) and zero-current switching (for lagging-leg switches) are achieved in the entire operating range. To implement the converter without an additional inductor, the leakage inductance of the transformer is utilized as the resonant inductor. Due to its many advantages, including high efficiency, minimum number of devices, and low cost, this converter is attractive for high-voltage and high-power applications. The analysis and design considerations of the converter are presented. A prototype was implemented for an application requiring a 5-kW output power, an input-voltage range varying from 250 to 350 V, and a 350-V output voltage.

In a Hybrid Power System (HPS), an appropriate power split strategy is important to distribute the requested power such that overall energy consumption is minimised. This paper presents the analysis and design procedure of a power split strategy of a HPS with a capacitive Energy Buffer (EB). The discussion starts with the description of properties of different components in a HPS. Then, analysis is performed to show the critical factor to design an optimal power split strategy for the HPS in which the Fuel Converter (FC) has faster dynamic response than the power request profile. Next, a power split strategy for the HPS with slow FC dynamic is developed using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. A numerical solver is used to obtain the solution of boundary value problem of the non-linear ordinary differential equations derived from MP. The optimisation objective is to find the tradeoff between fuel consumption and performance requirements.		Wenguang Yan;Vadim I.

However, under intermittent environmental power, low-power harvesting systems designed for stable conditions suffer reduced effectiveness or fail entirely. This work aims to improve a harvester's capability to extract useful power from low and intermittent vibration sources, by addressing the power-conditioning interface circuitry between the harvester and load. In view of this, two specific challenges are analyzed. The first challenge is that of start-up, where the goal is to make as short as possible the transition from completely depleted energy storage to the first powering-up of a load. The second challenge is to improve the energy transmission to a load after its first powering-up, under intermittent excitation. The investigation uses an ultra-low-power and fully-autonomous kinetic energy harvesting system under intermittent excitation. A number of solutions are presented. Decoupling filters between parallel converters and the harvester are used to demonstrate the importance of maintaining the optimal harvester loading, even during short transients. Input-power-dependent power gating of the power conditioning is also demonstrated. Both methods demonstrated experimentally using discrete circuit implementations, and shown to successfully increase the start-up speed and operational frequency of the load. The achieved reduction in start-up time is ~ 67% at a maximum harvestable power of 135 μW, under a predefined profile of pulsed excitation at 3 m·s-2. The experimental results provide insight into complex transient interactions of the harvester and power conditioning.	autonomous robot;bioinformatic harvester;continuous operation;coupling (computer programming);duty cycle;electric power conversion;electronic circuit;experiment;hysteresis;interaction;low-power broadcasting;power gating;sensor;undervoltage-lockout;uninterruptible power supply;uptime	Guang Yang;Bernard H.

The power available from renewable energy assets and storage elements on the microgrids is utilized to maintain system voltage stability. The system under study consists of two DC microgrids coupled to a multi-bus AC system. The supervisory controller of each of the two microgrids continuously communicates with the main controller of the AC grid, sending the available amount of apparent power and receiving power commands. The AC grid is monitored and controlled using a wide area measurement system in which measurements of the different nodes in the system are synchronized to a unified pulse signal. In case of voltage violation at any of the buses, the minimum reactive power needed from each of the micrgrids in order to restore the voltage magnitude to a value that is between the permissible limits is determined in real time by solving an optimization problem. Simulation, as well as experimental, results are included to verify the validity of the proposed wide area control technique.	ac (complexity);mathematical optimization;microgrid;optimization problem;simulation;system of measurement	Ahmed Mohamed;Ahmed Ghareeb;Tarek A.

a8fe4d188706ba234c11aedcd93d101bf66aefdb	boost-cascaded-by-buck power factor correction converter for universal on-board battery charger in electric transportation		A two-stage battery charger in battery operated electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with wide output voltage range of 100–500 V is most suitable for all vehicle architectures. Existing battery chargers have a different limited range of output voltages of 36–48 V, 72–150 V and 200–450 V is achieved by varying the output voltage of DC/DC converters keeping a fixed voltage at DC link. A universal charger, which can address this wide range of battery pack voltages is suitable for all vehicle architectures. The most feasible way to meet this requirement of wide output voltage range is to vary the voltage at DC link with a fixed conversion voltage ratio at DC/DC converter. In this paper, we propose the use of cascaded converter in power factor correction (PFC) converters to achieve the wide DC link voltages for battery chargers. The primary focus of the paper is on the analysis and operation of boost-cascaded by buck (BoCBB) converter. The control implementation presented in the paper achieves a high input power quality, wide DC link voltages with universal input voltage ranges of 85–265 V. It also provides the degree of control freedom to operate even if the VNm (output voltage to the peak of Input) < 0.5. Simulations of the proposed converter with 1 kW power rating are carried out in PSIM 11.0 software and the results with wide DC link voltage of 150–400 V are presented in the paper.		A. V. J. S.

Specifically, each of these networks contains significantly more energy storage elements than the McMillan degree of its impedance, and possesses a nonminimal state-space representation whose states correspond to the inductor currents and capacitor voltages. Despite this apparent nonminimality, there have been no improved algorithms since the 1950s, with the concurrent discovery by Reza, Pantell, Fialkow, and Gerst of a class of networks (the RPFG networks), which are a slight simplification of the Bott–Duffin networks. Each RPFG network contains more than twice as many energy storage elements as the McMillan degree of its impedance, yet it has never been established if all of these energy storage elements are necessary. In this paper, we present some newly discovered alternatives to the RPFG networks. We then prove that the RPFG networks, and these newly discovered networks, contain the least possible number of energy storage elements for realizing certain positive-real functions. In other words, all RLC networks that realize certain impedances contain more than twice the expected number (McMillan degree) of energy storage elements.	algorithm;apollonian network;characteristic impedance;level of detail;linear system;positive-real function;rlc circuit;reza iravani;semantic network;state-space representation;systems theory	Timothy H.

In order to avoid the use of dedicated wiring for communicating with these BMS, a power line communication (PLC) solution is proposed to communicate through the dc power line inherent in these systems. This solution is also designed to be directly compatible with the existing controller area network controllers integrated in a large number of commercially available microcontrollers. It uses a single carrier generator in order to generate a shared carrier signal on the bus. Each modem can modulate this common carrier signal by switching the impedance it presents on the bus. In a first part, this paper proposes an overview of the industrial context of this PLC solution, including simulation results and discussion of the theoretical limits of the system. Then, the digitization stage interfacing the controller to the power line is described and a first prototype is validated through discussion of experimental results obtained within an actual industrial environment.	autonomous robot;battery management system;can bus;carrier wave;characteristic impedance;differential signaling;digital rights management;microcontroller;modem;modulation;power-line communication;prototype;simulation;transmission line;wiring	Jeremie Jousse;Nicolas Ginot;Christophe Batard;Elisabeth Lemaire	2017	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2517129	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering	EDA	62.21930963948837	40.033967262122204	112679
382992963ffaa06436a7852e167ddd0d667c0595	evaluation on high-efficiency thermoelectric generation systems based on differential power processing		Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) convert thermal energy directly into electrical energy using thermoelectric materials, with attractive advantages such as a lack of noise and pollution, considerable reliability, and a long lifetime. Because of the low output power and low output voltage of each TEG module, conventional thermoelectric generation systems are constituted by a centralized converter with series-connected multiple TEG modules. Power mismatch usually occurs in this system configuration due to the unbalanced temperature difference distribution, which results in lower conversion efficiency. In this paper, two solutions based on differential power processing (DPP) have been proposed to enhance the output power and conversion efficiency of the TEG system: the centralized-distributed hybrid structure and the cascaded power transfer structure, both of which realize the maximum power point tracking of each TEG module. The circuit designs and control strategies of the two proposed systems are here presented. Experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of these two solutions; they have higher output power and better efficiency than the conventional TEG system. Each of these two solutions exhibits its own features and has suitable application situations. If the temperature difference distribution of all TEG modules has significant variations, the centralized-distributed hybrid structure outperforms the cascaded power transfer structure on the output power. While the temperature difference distribution is comparatively stable, the cascaded power transfer structure is superior to the centralized-distributed hybrid structure. With detailed evaluation and comparison between the two structures, the overall design for DPP-based TEG systems with different connection types has been proposed in this paper, which is the reference for the future implementation of practical TEG applications.	centralized computing;digital photo professional (dpp);event generator;maximum power transfer theorem;multiple encryption;system configuration;unbalanced circuit	Kai Sun;Zhaoxin Qiu;Hongfei Wu;Yan Xing	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2696505	control engineering;engineering;thermoelectric generator;thermal energy;voltage;energy conversion efficiency;thermoelectric materials;electric potential energy;maximum power point tracking;maximum power transfer theorem	Arch	63.53118470838304	40.73359355936472	112682

The prediction of this phenomenon is accomplished accurately by combining analytical expressions and computational procedures to determine the switching instants and the corresponding periodic orbits. Different approximate closed-form expressions for the stability boundary are derived revealing the effect of the parameters of the system on its dynamical behavior and showing that the stability boundary is different from the ones corresponding to single edge modulation strategies such as trailing edge and leading edge modulations. The theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations using a system-level switched model. Also, a prototype is implemented to validate he theoretical derivations and the numerical simulations getting a good matching.	approximation algorithm;clock rate;coefficient;computer simulation;electric power quality;h bridge;inverter (logic gate);lc circuit;modulation;numerical analysis;physical security information management;power inverter;prototype;pulse-width modulation;sandy bridge;sensor	Abdelali El Aroudi;Mohammed S.

Generally the shunt capacitors of class DE inverter are equally given to the two switching devices. The input current from the dc power source flows into the upper shunt capacitor during the dead time. Therefore, the minimization of the upper shunt capacitor leads to the reduction of ac components of the input current, which reduces the reverse power flow and the power loss occurring in the internal resistance of the dc power source and line impedance. In this paper, a circuit model of class DE inverter with considering each equivalent series resistance (ESR) is given. Based on the circuit model, the circuit equations are built, and the state equations are drawn in each state. The power loss caused by the input current is numerically calculated from the state equations. The waveforms and power conversion efficiencies are confirmed in circuit experiments.

As control using three-phase triangular-wave carriers automatically generates the voltage of the carrier frequency component and induces the current of the same frequency, it is possible to realize sensorless vector control in the low-speed range without applying high-frequency voltage and to estimate the magnetic pole position from the current. This control method corresponds to not only the low-speed range but also the full-speed range. However, injection of a high-frequency voltage signal causes acoustic noise of the same frequency. To remove acoustic noise, the injecting voltage frequency is increased above the audible range. Moreover, as the current used for estimating the magnetic pole position is a high-frequency current and its values are small, it is considerably affected by the dead time and delay of switching devices. Therefore, by considering these two parameters and measuring the high-frequency current at the ideal point, the position estimation error was reduced. Experiments confirm the validity of the proposed method.

2e3f5001e9846f8a636a76099c0f45ccec220cb2	soft-switching technique applicable to capacitive load for resonant inverter of plasma generator		Recently, resonant inverters have been employed to generate high voltage high frequency AC power for plasma generator of the semiconductor processing equipment. This inverter is beneficial in low switching loss owing to its natural soft-switching capability under inductive load impedance. Generally, the resonant inverter for plasma generator is designed to have inductive load using an impedance matching circuit that interfaces the inverter and the plasma reactor. However, the load impedance often fluctuates according to the state of the plasma, momentarily causing the capacitive load impedance. In this case, the inverter is generally controlled to restrict the output power for circuit protection from excessive switching loss, although this will result in unstable plasma, deteriorating the quality of the semiconductor processing. This paper addressed this difficulty by applying a soft-switching technique to the resonant inverter. This soft-switching technique can be utilized regardless to the capacitive or inductive load. Experiment was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. As a result, the effective reduction of the switching loss was successfully verified even under the capacitive load impedance.	characteristic impedance;control theory;digital image processing equipment;experiment;hearing loss, high-frequency;impedance matching;input impedance;inverter (logic gate);inverter device component;plasma active;power inverter;quantitative impedance;reactor (software);reactor device component;resonant inverter;semiconductor;uninterruptible power supply;unstable medical device problem;hearing impairment;voltage	Koji Itakura;Hiroaki Kakemizu;Hiroki Nakaido;Kazuhiro Umetani;Eiji Hiraki;Tatsuya Ikenari;Shingo Kawano	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216264	resonant inverter;engineering;power factor;capacitive sensing;control theory;input impedance;electrical impedance;impedance matching;inverter;electrical engineering;inductor	EDA	64.19373678860151	42.60325306357254	113897

5fcd15d79141a7c9a4bf5631e2feedb44c25e074	the challenges of designing an inductively coupled power link for μm-sized on-chip coils		This paper highlights the challenges which exist in realizing miniaturized inductively powered devices that integrate μm-sized coils. As the amount of energy harvested is directly proportional to the effective area of the receiver coil, ultra-small coils receive very limited power and thus need to be carefully optimized for a particular application. Apart from the geometric design of the coil, there are also many other factors that impact the maximum amount of energy that can be harvested on a μm-sized coil. These unique challenges are discussed and addressed in this work using a fully integrated wireless power receiver fabricated in GF 130 nm CMOS 8RF technology. The entire system measures 300 × 300 μm2and is wirelessly powered at 1.18 GHz.

It uses a trapezoidal modulator wave and a sinusoidal carrier signal with variable frequency. The instantaneous frequency of the carrier wave is proportional to the slope of the modulator signal, and only two parameters (the slope of the trapezoidal edges and the proportionality constant of the carrier wave frequency) allow one to control the output voltage level and the number of commutation per cycle in real time. The proposed technique generates high-quality voltages with very few commutations per cycle, and it is particularly appropriate for reducing commutation loss. Results are checked experimentally and compared to other PWM techniques, yielding better signal quality with an important reduction in the number of commutations.	carrier wave;experiment;instantaneous phase;pulse-width modulation;rf modulator	Francisco Vargas-Merino;Mario J.

f410272266bd6e7f984415de0fddbdd8b49725c6	periodically swapping modulation (psm) strategy for three-level (tl) dc/dc converters with balanced switch currents		The asymmetrical modulation strategy is widely used in various types of three-level (TL) dc/dc converters, while the current imbalance among the power switches is one of the important issues. In this paper, a novel periodically swapping modulation (PSM) strategy is proposed for balancing the power switches’ currents in various types of TL dc/dc converters. In the proposed PSM strategy, the driving signals of the switch pairs are swapped periodically, which guarantees that the currents through the power switches are kept balanced in every two switching periods. Therefore, the proposed PSM strategy can effectively improve the reliability of the converter by balancing the power losses and thermal stresses among the power switches. The operation principle and performances of the proposed PSM strategy are analyzed in detail. Finally, the simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the proposed modulation strategy.	hot swapping;network switch;paging;performance;simulation;single-sideband modulation;transform, clipping, and lighting	Dong Liu;Fujin Deng;Qi Zhang;Zhe Chen	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2714125	modulation;capacitor;engineering;control engineering;converters;swap (computer programming);electronic engineering	EDA	63.730584518620724	41.798319580219136	114943

The designs of the LCL filter parameters and the discrete controller are addressed systematically, and suitable design guidelines are provided. The controller design is developed in the Z-domain, with capacitor-voltage-based active damping used as a degree of freedom to compensate for system delay effects. The role of resistive components in the circuit, which have inherent dissipative properties, is also discussed. As an outcome of the design, a passive input-admittance shaping is obtained. The theoretical development is further verified in a low-scale prototype supplied from a controllable grid simulator. For the sake of generality, different combinations of resonant to sampling frequency are tested. Experimental results fully prove the input-admittance passivity compliance.

However, harmonics distortion problem may occur in such drive systems. This paper proposes to use an active damping control method to suppress the harmonic distortion with the benefit of low cost and also low loss. A new analysis method, based on the frequency domain impedance model, is presented to explore the mechanism of harmonics suppression. Also, a general method is presented to build the impedance model of a PMSM drive system using Field Oriented Control (FOC) method. Some design issues, including power levels, current control bandwidth and harmonic interaction, are discussed when the drive system is fed by a weak grid. Case studies on a two-drive system composed by two slim dc-link drive units are provided to verify the proposed analysis method.	characteristic impedance;distortion;festival of code;portable c compiler;simulation;usb flash drive;zero suppression	Yang Feng;Laszlo Mathe;Kaiyuan Lu;Frede Blaabjerg;Xiongfei Wang;Pooya Davari	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793063	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.76149236929527	39.519504372110354	115272

Its main idea is to recover the energy stored in the PDP or to inject the input source energy to the PDP by using the current source built-up in the energy recovery inductor. This method provides zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) of all main power switches, the reduction of EMI, and more improved operational voltage margins with the aid of the discharge current compensation. In addition, since the current flowing through the energy recovery inductor can compensate the plasma discharge current flowing through the conducting power switches, the current stress through all main power switches can be considerably reduced. Furthermore, it features a low conduction loss and fast transient time. Operations, features and design considerations are presented and verified experimentally on a 1020×106mm sized PDP, 50kHz-switching frequency, and sustaining voltage 140V based prototype.	clock rate;computer cooling;current source;discharger;emi;experiment;network switch;plasma active;plasma display;prototype;switched-mode power supply	Sang-Kyoo Han;Gun-Woo Moon;Myung-Joong Youn	2005	IEEE Trans.

Dr. Spiazzi visit to the University of Campinas was supported by FAPESP. Abstract The effects of a non negligible source impedance, due to the presence of an input EMI filter, on the stability of Power Factor Preregulators with average current control are analyzed by using a State Space Averaged model. The modeling allows to derive a simple expression for the loop gain in terms of the converter current loop gain. The overall system stability is studied for boost, Cuk and SEPIC PFP topologies. Based on this model, a simple modification of the standard current control loop is proposed which increases the converter robustness. Comparison between model forecasts and experimental measurements is carried out using two prototypes: one based on the boost topology and the other based on the SEPIC topology both rated at 600W. Finally, the model accuracy is investigated with measurements at different current loop bandwidths.	characteristic impedance;control system;current loop;emi;monomial;output impedance;single-ended primary-inductor converter;state space	Giorgio Spiazzi;José Antenor Pomilio	1999	IEEE Trans.

The proposed model takes into account the influence of power losses in the ferromagnetic core on frequency and temperature. The considered model includes parameters, values of which are estimated on the basis of the catalog data of the inductor components—the core and the winding. To prove the usefulness of the average electrothermal model of the inductor, calculations of the characteristics of the boost converter are performed. The results of calculations are compared with the results of measurements and the good agreement between these results is achieved for two types of ferromagnetic cores made of powdered iron or ferrite.

0b1630fe79fe1b4fee6355ec411be6476932713e	comparing of switching frequency on vector controlled asynchronous motor		Nowadays, asynchronous motors have wide range use in many industrial applications. Field oriented control (FOC) and direct torque control (DTC) are commonly used methods in high performance vector control for asynchronous motors. Therefore, it is very important to identify clearly advantages and disadvantages of both systems in the selection of appropriate control methods for many industrial applications. This paper aims to present a new and different perspective regarding the comparison of the switching behaviours on the FOC and the DTC drivers. For this purpose, the experimental studies have been carried out to compare the inverter switching frequencies and torque responses of the asynchronous motor in the FOC and the DTC systems under different working conditions. The dSPACE 1103 controller board was programmed with Matlab/Simulink software. As expected, the experimental studies showed that the FOC controlled motors has a lessened torque ripple. On the other hand, the FOC controlled motor switching frequency has about 65-75% more than the DTC controlled under both loaded and unloaded working conditions.	asynchronous system;clock rate;dspace;festival of code;matlab;power inverter;ripple effect;simulink	Yilmaz Korkmaz;Fatih Korkmaz;Ismail Topaloglu;Hayati Mamur	2014	CoRR	10.5121/ijscai.2014.3402	control engineering;embedded system;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.33862366117214	40.39190627994803	116250
3e3dd2cbd6cae81eb641458f17d6f62c947c2887	a topology of step-down resonant switched-capacitor-based ac-dc converter for high-frequency ac distribution	fabrication;high frequency rectifier;switched capacitor converter;power converter;ac dc	This paper proposes a switched-capacitor (SC)-based step-down AC–DC power converter with high-frequency feed without rectifier or transformer. The operational principle of the circuits and the design considerations are described. The main advantage of the circuit is that step-down voltage can be achieved in the circuit by simply configuring with cascaded stages, which will be much more convenient to be modular development and easy for replacement and maintenance; the voltage and current stresses of most components are smaller than the conventional converter. Using buffer capacitor to reserve energy, there are no magnetic energy storage elements in the circuits. Weight and size can be further reduced due to high-frequency-power line operation. Zero current switching (ZCS) is achieved by introducing small resonant inductors. Therefore, higher efficiency and power density can be achieved. The performance of the converter has been demonstrated by an experiment with 50 kHz 50 V power feed which is emulated by a signal generator and high-frequency amplifier to prove the concept.	switched capacitor	C.

One has to think about losses all the time when overall leakage currents of less than a few microamperes are desired. In general, reducing the complexity of the circuit reduces the power consumption as well, but efficient charging of an energy storage element such as a battery or ultracapacitor becomes difficult. Finding a well-balanced point where sum of leakage current and charging losses reaches a minimum is the way to go. This paper discusses this issues and shows some diagrams and solutions to the power supply problem one is confronted with, when designing energy self-sufficient sensor nodes.	diagram;power supply;spectral leakage;way to go	Stefan Mahlknecht;Mathias Roetzer	2005	Proceeedings of the Second European Workshop on Wireless Sensor Networks, 2005.	10.1109/EWSN.2005.1462032	embedded system;wireless sensor network;computer science	Mobile	58.736330124374696	44.30723564900218	117119

With the same reasons, a three-level neutral point clamped (3L-NPC) inverter featuring low power device voltage stress and low leakage current becomes increasingly attractive. In this paper, the operation and the features of a novel grid-tied 3L-NPC are presented. The proposed topology is a derivative of the three-level stacked neutral point clamped (3L-SNPC) structure. However, compared with the conventional 3L-SNPC and its pulse width modulation (PWM) strategy, the new topology with novel PWM strategy features completely inactive intrinsic body diodes. Furthermore, only two outer power devices are working with switching frequency, while the other four Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) are actually with the grid frequency. Therefore, the relatively high switching frequency is selected to reduce the inverter output filter inductance. A hybrid CoolMosfet and IGBT power module configuration is also proposed based on the new PWM strategy. The calculation shows that the total power device losses are reduced. The experimental results are illustrated in this paper to confirm the operation of the proposed topology and controller.	clock rate;diode;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;np-completeness;network topology;power inverter;power module;power semiconductor device;prototype;pulse-width modulation;spectral leakage;zero crossing	Yong Wang;Rui Li	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2012.2204712	grid-tie inverter;control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;engineering;control theory	EDA	64.07258377581446	41.565481331037496	117220

795d47b3ae63e380acf587d59d462b9fad1bbca2	an efficient dual charge pump circuit using charge sharing clock scheme	power efficiency	In this paper, the charge pump efficiency is discussed, and a dual charge pump circuit with complementary architecture using charge sharing clock scheme is presented. The proposed charge sharing clock generator is able to recover the charge from parasitic-capacitor charging and discharging, so that the dynamic power loss in the pumping process is reduced by a half. To preserve the overlapping period of the four-phase clock used for threshold cancellation technique, two complementary sets of clocks are generated from the proposed clock generator, and each set feeds a certain branch of the dual charge pump to achieve the between-branch charge sharing. A test chip is fabricated in 0.18µm process, and the area penalty of the proposed charge sharing clock generator is 1%. From the measurement results, the proposed charge pump shows an overall power efficiency increase with a peak value of 63.7% comparing to 52.3% of a conventional single charge pump without charge sharing, and the proposed clock scheme shows no degradation on the driving capability while the output ripple voltage is reduced by 43%.	charge pump;charge sharing	Mengshu Huang;Yimeng Zhang;Tsutomu Yoshihara	2012	IEICE Transactions		charge pump;electrical efficiency;electrical engineering;control theory	EDA	60.721481441806205	45.90814793238187	117686

To decrease these lost surfaces, a multi mobile system is proposed. It consists of several moving cabins in the same shaft, permitting also horizontal motions. The use of direct linear motor drives without counterweight is requested. The direct linear drives are defined by a long stator along the lift cage and by a linear PM magnetic way on each cabin. This paper focuses on the power supply of such a system. As the long linear stator is energized per sector, a methodology is proposed to study the complete system. New modules of Simsen software are developed, as Simsen is well adapted for the study of complex power systems and adjustable speed drives.

90b0c06d8127bbe19faf47bcc45c4098da6a9f4f	doubly fed induction generator (dfig) wind turbine controlled by artificial organic networks		The main goal of this paper is to show the control capabilities of artificial organic networks when they are applied to variable speed wind generators. Since doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is one of the most important variable wind generators, it requires to include advanced controllers which allow to improve its performance during operation. On the other hand, the artificial organic controllers (AOC) are intelligent controllers based on ensembles of fuzzy inference systems and artificial hydrocarbon networks. To understand AOC, this paper introduces the fundamentals of artificial hydrocarbon networks, describes the fuzzy-molecular inference ensemble, and discusses artificial organic controllers when they are deployed in variable speed wind generators. Additionally, DFIG wind turbine model is completely derived in order to test the AOC. A conventional proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller is compared with the proposed PID-based AOC (PID-AOC) for wind generators under linear and nonlinear wind profiles. Five parameters were used for evaluation: pitch angle, stator power, rotor power, generator’s speed and power coefficient. Results showed the superior control performance in wind generators when artificial organic networks are implemented. Particularly, the PID-AOC response obtained higher values of rotor and stator powers, small pitch angle response meaning less energy consumption, high power coefficient values, and smooth starting phase minimizing risks of damage in the DFIG. The proposed PID-AOC can be applied in DFIG to minimize the undesired fluctuation on the electric grid, to reduce the mechanical stress in the blades preventing mechanical damages and to perform good sensitivity when noise in the wind is included.

This paper describes the voltage distortion generated by nonlinear loads and proposes a new harmonic droop control to reduce the voltage harmonic distortion at the point of common coupling (PCC) and to share the harmonic power between parallel islanded inverters controlled by classical frequency droop method. The main objective it to effectively compensate the harmonic currents drawn by each DIC to supply the nonlinear loads in parallel with voltage harmonic damping at PCC. The operation principle of the proposed harmonic droop is explained in details. Modeling and stability analysis are developed in order to define the control parameters suitable for proper operation. Simulation and experimental results are presented to show the competence of the proposed algorithm in achieving harmonic power sharing and in improving the voltage harmonic distortion at the PCC.	algorithm;characteristic impedance;control theory;digital differential analyzer;discontinuous galerkin method;distortion;electric power quality;experiment;impedance matching;inverter (logic gate);microgrid;nonlinear system;portable c compiler;simulation;transformers	Hassan Moussa;Ahmed Shahin;Jean-Philippe Martin;Babak Nahid-Mobarakeh;Serge Pierfederici;Nazih Moubayed	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2017.2687058	control engineering;electronic engineering;voltage droop;computer science;control theory	EDA	64.97958865583459	39.157410799433215	118796

This thesis concerns possible implementations of quantum computing schemes and tries to overcome some standard limitations. The central result is a technique we call reservoir engineering that is applied to optical cavity QED based quantum computing. The usual problem for quantum computing with atomic qubits in cavities is scalability as this requires either the coupling of photons leaking from cavities, using linear optics elements and measurements or shuttling of ions into and out of cavities. We propose an alternative that applies strong dissipative coupling to an environment as a control on fibre-coupled cavity systems. The control mechanism is effectively an overdamping of certain common cavity modes that restricts the time evolution of the qubit-cavity system onto a smaller subsystem consisting of only one common cavity modes. Within this subsystem, we then show that it is possible to implement quantum computing schemes that apply otherwise only to atomic qubits in the same cavity.	cavity quantum electrodynamics;information processing;qed (text editor);quantum computing;quantum information science;qubit;scalability	Jonathan Busch	2010			quantum information;reservoir engineering;theoretical computer science;physics	Theory	57.17520875140005	33.6238015671194	118826

The optimal control of HPS manages the power flow from the energy storage device and power sources to ensure mission effectiveness, namely, meet the pulse power demands as quickly and as efficiently as possible. The real-time control is a key requirement due to the on-demand nature of the problem. This requirement, along with the nonlinear and large scale HPS dynamics, long look-ahead horizon, safety constraints and load disturbances, makes the control problem challenging. In this paper we leverage the dynamic properties of HPS and propose a hierarchical control strategy for the power management of the HPS. The key merit of the proposed approach is that both the long term optimal power demand planning and short term disturbance rejection can be solved in real-time without computational delay. A case study using the HPS model illustrates the real-time computational efficiency and mission effectiveness of the proposed method.	computation;control theory;ibm power systems;nonlinear system;optimal control;power management;real-time clock;real-time operating system;rejection sampling;steady state	Gayathri Seenumani;Jing Sun;Huei Peng	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5717035	control engineering;power-flow study;simulation;engineering;control theory	Embedded	64.15983423101332	36.09962014403859	118836

The approach relies on a frequency domain modeling of system dynamics using positive sequence and negative sequence dynamic components. Following the passivity-based procedure, a family of controllers is obtained whose objective is to deal with unbalanced supply voltages, and to perform regulation of ac unbalanced currents. The proposed solution is relevant for high-power VSI inverters where, due to switching frequency limitations, conventional regulators do not have enough bandwidth to achieve reference tracking. New controllers include adaptive refinements to cope with parameter uncertainties, and stability and convergence proofs are outlined in all cases. Finally, a series of simplifications and adjustments have been explored to reduce the adaptive controllers to PI structures in stationary frame coordinates. The simplified controllers are in a form suitable for implementation, and establish a downward compatibility with standard industrial practice.	backward compatibility;clock rate;inverter (logic gate);stationary process;system dynamics;unbalanced circuit	Gerardo Escobar;Paolo Mattavelli;Aleksandar M.

5944b7290e3a6a58915a0c6f6b50d3531c112dea	quantifying the effect of the grid's r/x impedance on droop control using dc/ac inverter models		This paper presents seven nonlinear mathematical models of a dc/ac droop controlled inverter connected to an infinite bus. These models are produced using the singular perturbation method to decompose a previously proposed 13th order nonlinear model. The models orders are 13th, 11th, 9th, 7th, 5th, 3rd and 1st. Each model ignores certain control or structural component of the full order model and allows researchers to choose the model order that meets their required accuracy and complexity. Moreover, the effect of grid (line) impedance on the accuracy of droop control is explored using the 5th order model. Simulation results show that traditional droop control is valid up to R/X line impedance value of 2. Furthermore, the 3rd order nonlinear model improves the currently available inverter-infinite bus models by accounting for grid impedance, active power-frequency droop and reactive power-voltage droop. Results show the 3rd order model's ability to account for voltage and reactive power changes during a transient event.	ac adapter;characteristic impedance;complexity;large-signal model;mathematical model;network analysis (electrical circuits);nonlinear system;power inverter;quintic function;simulation;structural element	Mahmoud Kabalan;Pritpal Singh;Dagmar Niebur	2018	2018 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2018.8403386	singular perturbation;grid;nonlinear system;mathematical model;mathematics;electrical impedance;voltage droop;inverter;ac power;control theory	Robotics	67.34584039886383	41.473648081849404	120374

The extremum seeker operates by estimating the gradient of the objective function but, unlike other seekers, it does not require a dither signal to produce such estimate. The absence of a dither signal simplifies the choice of parameter values for the seeker, and more importantly, it allows it to converge to the optimal value exactly, not only to a small neighborhood. The proper functioning of the proposed scheme is proved using nonsmooth Lyapunov analysis. The strategy is tested on the input-output map of a real polymer electrolyte fuel cell.	converge;dither;gradient;hydrogen;loss function;lyapunov fractal;maxima and minima;optimization problem;polymer;privacy-enhanced electronic mail	Fernando Castaños;Cristian Kunusch	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2426143	control engineering;mathematical optimization;hydrogen;stability;performance;engineering;electrical engineering;cathode;control theory;system;anode;statistics	Robotics	63.33966839305995	34.57046962181305	120911
9f1b36f933665f9fdc3eae8b5e4353b477b9e579	control review lectures on wave energy		this manuscript describes in a didactic manner the methodology, development, implementation and evaluation of different control strategies to maximize the energy obtained from wave energy converter (WEC) devices. Having this aim in mind, a power take off (PTO) system with different control strategies will be presented. The chosen take off system is an oscillating water column converter (OWC), a device that uses a Wells air turbine as the primary energy converter with a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) as the secondary. The Wells turbine contributes to the robustness of the system because it requires no additional parts to produce unidirectional rotation from the reversing oscillating flow, while the DFIG offers the best capabilities when operating in both sub- and super-synchronous modes. The proposed scheme is based on the NEREIDA MOWC demonstration project, a breakwater wave plant located in the Basque location of Mutriku. This material and teaching experience corresponds to a Master in Control at the Engineering Faculty of the Basque Country University.	mind;owner-free file system;reversing: secrets of reverse engineering;wireless experimental centre	Izaskun Garrido;Aitor Marco;Jon Lecube;Manuel de la Sen;Íñigo J.

To achieve additional high-lift during take-off and landing of a plane, air is blown out at the back flap of the wings using a turbo compressor directly driven by an electrical machine. Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices promise large savings in volume, weight and losses of the inverter, which results in a highly-integrated system. Furthermore, the intake air is used as coolant for the power electronics. Such a system with a high power density of 10.8 kW/l has been designed and implemented, and first tests were performed on a laboratory prototype.	alox5ap gene;aircraft;blue (queue management algorithm);computer cooling;convection;cool - action;electronic design automation;gate driver;heat sink device component;heating;inverter device component;junction temperature;logic level;polychlorinated biphenyls;power electronics;power inverter;prototype;rating (action);simulation;speedfan;the 100;fangchinoline;sensor (device);silicon carbide	Jan-Kaspar M&#x00FC;ller;Axel Mertens	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216756	silicon carbide;gas compressor;power density;heat sink;power electronics;control engineering;coolant;engineering;powertrain;inverter	Robotics	61.56922624230758	41.98076670861994	121363
611e4c49a885b77057a3a97d467ad6c5925cfa49	a novel current-limiting circuit based on resistive-type sfcl for fault in dc power system		Abstract Reliability and security are essential concerns in DC power system. However, due to the limited capacity of DC circuit breaker (DCCB), the rapidly growing fault current cannot be reliably interrupted. Thus the reliability of the DC power system cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, a novel current-limiting circuit based on resistive-type superconducting fault current limiter (R-SFCL) is proposed to restrain fault current. The operation procedure of the proposed current-limiting circuit is presented in detail. Then, a detailed mathematical model of opening process is established to analyse parameter design. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of this circuit. Compared with the traditional current limiting solutions, the proposal can effectively limit the fault current to achieve a more reliable breaking serious fault, and the reliability of DC system can be improved. Furthermore, overvoltage on DCCB is also prevented so that the arrester can be cancelled.

It integrates the advantages of the hybrid full-bridge three-level converter and the LLC resonant converter. It can operate not only under three-level mode but also under two-level mode, so it is very suitable for wide input voltage range application, such as fuel cell power system. The input current ripple and output filter can also be reduced. Three-level leg switches just sustain only half of the input voltage. ZCS is achieved for the rectifier diodes, and the voltage stress across the rectifier diodes can be minimized to the output voltage. The main switches can realize ZVS from zero to full load.

In this paper, the resonant parametric perturbation method is applied to control chaos in a voltage-mode controlled buck converter. In particular, the effects of phase shift and frequency mismatch in the perturbing signal are studied. It is shown that the control power can be significantly reduced if the perturbation is applied with an appropriate phase shift. Moreover, when frequency mismatch is inevitable, intermittent chaos occurs, but effective control can still be accomplished at the expense of raising the control power. Analysis, simulations and experimental measurements are presented to provide theoretical and practical evidences for the proposed control method.	buck converter;chaos control;chaos theory;phase-locked loop;resonance;simulation	Yufei Zhou;C.

1f23bd670419fbcf2c69f306942cc90c5bedc921	dynamic modeling, stability, and control of power systems with distributed energy resources		This article presents a suite of new control designs for next-generation electric smart grids. The future grid will consist of thousands of non-conventional renewable generation sources such as wind, solar, and energy storage. These new components are collectively referred to as distributed energy resources (DER). The article presents a comprehensive list of dynamic models for DERs, and shows their coupling with the conventional generators and loads. It then presents several innovative control designs that can be used for facilitating large-scale DER integration. Ideas from decentralized retrofit control and distributed sparsity-promoting optimal control are used for developing these designs, followed by illustrations on an IEEE power system test model. I. INTRODUTION Significant infrastructural changes are currently being implemented on power system networks around the world by maximizing the penetration of renewable energy, by installing new transmission lines, by adding flexible loads, by promoting independence in power production by disintegrating the grid into micro-grids, and so on [1]. The shift of energy supply from large central generating stations to smaller producers such as wind farms, solar photovoltaic (PV) farms, roof-top PVs, and energy storage systems, collectively known as Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) or Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), is accelerating at a very rapid pace. Hundreds of power electronic devices are being added, creating hundreds of new control points in the grid. This addition is complimented by an equal progress in sensing technology, whereby high-precision, high sampling-rate, GPS-synchronized dynamic measurements of voltages and currents are now available from sensors such as Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) [2]. With all these transformational changes happening in the grid, operators are inclining to explore new control methods that go far beyond how the grid is controlled today. A list of these changes is summarized in Table I. In the current state-of-art, power system controllers, especially the ones that are responsible for transient stability and power oscillation damping, are all operated in a decentralized and uncoordinated fashion using local output feedback only. A survey of these controllers is provided in Appendix A. With rapid modernization of the grid, these local controllers, however, will not be tenable over the long-term. Instead, system-wide coordinated controllers will become essential. Such controllers where signals measured at one part of the grid are communicated to other remote parts for feedback are called wide-area controllers [3]. Wide-area control (WAC) alone, however, will not be enough either. It may improve the stability and dynamics performance of the legacy system, but will not be able to keep up with the unpredictable rate at which DERs are being added to the grid. Every time a new DER is added it will be almost impossible for an operator to retune all the wide-area control gains to accommodate the change in dynamics. DERs have high variability and intermittency, and need to be operated in a plug-and-play fashion. Accordingly their controllers need to be local, decentralized, and modular in both design and implementation. In other words, neither should the design of one DER controller depend on that of another nor should either of these two controllers need to be updated when a third DER is added in the future. The overall control architecture for the future grid needs to be a combination of these decentralized plug-and-play DER controllers and distributed wide-area controllers. 1 Department of Systems and Control Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology; 2-12-1, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan. {sadamoto, ishizaki, imura}@sc.e.titech.ac.jp 2 Electrical & Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University; Raleigh, NC 27695. achakra2@ncsu.edu ar X iv :1 80 4. 04 93 3v 3 [ cs .S Y ] 1 3 Se p 20 18	block cipher mode of operation;computer engineering;control engineering;control point (mathematics);global positioning system;heart rate variability;ibm power systems;legacy system;optimal control;phasor;plug and play;power inverter;sampling (signal processing);sensor;sparse matrix;system testing;transmission line	Tomonori Sadamoto;Aranya Chakrabortty;Takayuki Ishizaki;Jun-ichi Imura	2018	CoRR		mathematical optimization;mathematics;grid;electric power system;renewable energy;system dynamics;smart grid;distributed generation;optimal control;control engineering;energy storage	Robotics	63.32199572955184	36.88380885178194	121977

Combination of the circuit blocks achieves a linear voltage-current conversion for a rail-to-rail input signal. Rail-to-rail OTA is proposed using the proposed using the proposed conversion circuit. HSPICE simulations are performed to verify the validity of the proposed V-I converter and rail-to-rail OTA. Simulation results indicate good performances. As an application example, 2nd-order LPF is realized using the proposed OTAs.

Similar analysis can be equally applied to other t ypes of converters. In this paper, a unified model is proposed for buck, boost, and buck-boost converter s under peak or average current mode control to predict the occurrence of subharmonic oscillation. Base d on the unified model, the associated stability conditions are derived in closed forms. The same stability c ondition can be applied to buck, boost, and buck-boost converters. Based on the closed-form condition s, the effects of various converter parameters including the compensator poles and zeros on the stability c an be clearly seen, and these parameters can be consolidated into a few ones. High-order compensator s such as type-II and PI compensators are considered. Some new plots are also proposed for design purp ose to avoid the instability. The instability is found to be associated with large crossover frequency. A c onservative stability condition, agreed with the past research, is derived. The effect of the voltage loop ripple on the instability is also analyzed.

Solution convergence and model accuracy are observed in order to predict power flow distribution through feeder lines resulting from the grid connection of a renewable power plant.

It is known that the DMMPT offers improvements in annual energy compared to a Centralized-MPPT (CMPPT). A model for current in neutral point is proposed for 3L-npc. Furthermore, a generalization of balancing algorithm for 5L-npc is presented. The local stability of the balancing is ensured.

Two transformers are used in the proposed converter. The primary windings of two transformers are connected in series to reduce the voltage stress across the magnetizing inductor, since each magnetizing inductor voltage is equal to one half of the input voltage. Two current-doubler rectifiers at the secondary sides are connected in parallel to reduce the current stress of secondary winding since the secondary winding current is less than one half of the load current. The asymmetrical pulsewidth-modulation technique is used in the proposed converter to regulate the direct current output voltage. The transformer leakage inductance and the output capacitance of switching switches are resonant during the transition interval between two switches in order to achieve zero voltage switching. The operation principle and design considerations of the proposed converter are provided.

Compared with the conventional forward converter, there is one auxiliary switch in the active clamp forward converter to recycle the energy stored in the transformer leakage in order to minimize the spike voltage at the transformer primary side. Therefore the voltage stress of main switch can be reduced. The resonant circuit based on the output capacitance and leakage inductance of the transformer will achieve zero voltage switching turn-on for both main and auxiliary switches to increase the circuit efficiency. The synchronous rectifier is used at the secondary side to further reduce the conduction losses. The operation principles of the active clamp forward converter are analyzed in detail and the circuit performance is compared with the conventional forward converter. The design procedure and example of active clamp forward converter are presented. Finally experimental results are presented for a converter with an ac input voltage of 90~130Vrms, an output voltage of 5 V/20 A and operating at switching frequency of 150 kHz are provided to verify the zero voltage switching at turn-on.	active rectification;circuit design;clamper (electronics);clamping (graphics);clock rate;forward converter;lc circuit;network switch;rectifier;reduction (complexity);spectral leakage;synchronous circuit;system analysis;the spike (1997);transformer	Bor-Ren Lin;Kevin Huang;David Wang	2005	TENCON 2005 - 2005 IEEE Region 10 Conference	10.1109/TCSI.2006.870900	control engineering;electronic engineering;capacitor;resonance;network analysis;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;circuit design;control theory;system analysis;quantum mechanics	EDA	64.06037452172926	42.753822384396265	123339

An optimum power sharing strategy, among different modules of the multilevel inverter, is also presented that equalizes power sharing at the each H-bridge. After a description of the system some simulation results obtained in ModelSim are presented showing the effectiveness of the OCC which follows the reference signal, sinusoidal, in a concrete manner with the capability of regaining steady-state in just one switching cycle.

The proposed control strategy is composed of a voltage controller and a current controller. The roles of these controllers are examined to achieve a bumpless transition through coordination. The developed scheme has been validated through extensive simulation studies. Finally, a physical experimental microgrid with a 1.2 kW fuel cell power module is constructed to validate the performance of the proposed scheme in a physical environment. A grid connection interface has been designed and constructed to allow the microgrid to be connected to the utility grid (university campus grid). Experimental studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving bumpless transitions between the grid-connected and the islanded modes of operation under a variety of conditions.	block cipher mode of operation;control theory;microgrid;power module;simulation;voltage controller	Andrew T.

The cell is combined with a simple current mirror summing node to produce biologically plausible postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). A single charge packet is effectively transferred from the synapse to the summing node, whenever a presynaptic pulse is applied to one of its terminals. The charge packet is “weighted” by a voltage applied to the second terminal of the synapse. A voltage applied to the third terminal determines the charge recovery time in the synapse, which can be adjusted over several orders of magnitude. This voltage determines the paired pulse ratio for the synapse. The fall time of the PSP is also adjustable and is set by the gate voltage of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor operating in subthreshold. Results extracted from chips fabricated in a 0.35-μm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process, alongside theoretical and simulation results, confirm the ability of the cell to produce PSPs that are characteristic of real synapses. The concept addresses a key requirement for scalable hardware neural networks.	addresses (publication format);alignment;anatomic node;appendix;approximation algorithm;arabic numeral 0;artificial neural network;assumed;cdisc sdtm not done terminology;cmos;canonical account;cross-sectional data;current mirror;depletion region;depressive disorder;diffusion capacitance;doping (semiconductor);doping in sports;duty cycle;exptime;electric capacitance;electrical connection;electroconvulsive therapy;extraction;fall time;forty nine;frequency band;network packet;neural network simulation;neuron;neurons;node - plant part;norsk data;pneumothorax, primary spontaneous;parasites;poly da-dt;postsynaptic potentials;p–n junction;quantum well;scalability;semiconductor;sexually transmitted diseases;sodium;stimulation (motivation);synapse;synaptic package manager;transistor device component;vehicle identification number;vulval intraepithelial neoplasia;vw ag:prthr:pt:rbc:ord;whole earth 'lectronic link;wigner distribution function;cisplatin/etoposide protocol;orders - hl7publishingdomain;slope;voltage;width	Thomas Dowrick;Steve Hall;Liam McDaid	2012	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2211035	field-effect transistor;computer science;machine learning;artificial neural network	ML	55.480324370233674	44.58464924426964	123680

Cascade and feedback interconnections of bond graph models are considered and are realized through active (signal) bonds with no loading effect. The use of active bonds may lead to non-conservation of energy and the overall system is modelled by proposed pseudo-junction structures. These structures are build by adding parasitic elements to the bond graph models which assure that each storage element is connected to a dissipative element and the overall system may become singularly perturbed. The structures for these interconnections can be seen as consisting of inner structures that satisfy energy conservation properties and outer structures including multiport-coupled dissipative fields. These structures are called pseudo due to the structural properties of power conservation not being satisfied in the outer structures. The multiport-coupled dissipative fields highl...

While state of the art class E amplifiers widely being used to supply implanted systems show a strong degradation of efficiency when powering distance, coil orientation or the implant current consumption deviate from the nominal design, the presented concept is able to detect these deviations on-line and to reconfigure the amplifier automatically. The concept is facilitated by a new approach of sensing the load impedance without interruption of the power supply to the implant, while the main components of the class E amplifier are programmable by software. Therefore, the device is able to perform dynamic impedance matching. Besides presenting the operational principle and the design equations, we show an adaptive prototype reader system which achieves a drain efficiency of up to 92% for a wide range of reflected coil impedances from 1 to 40 Ω. The integrated communication concept allows downlink data rates of up to 500 kBit/s, while the load modulation based uplink from implant to reader was verified of providing up to 1.35 MBit/s.	characteristic impedance;coil device component;coping behavior;data rate units;driver circuit;elegant degradation;gate driver;imaginary time;impedance matching;implants;input impedance;interrupt;megabit;modulation;online and offline;operational amplifier;power supply;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;prototype;quantitative impedance;telecommunications link	Sebastian Stoecklin;Tobias Volk;Adnan Yousaf;Leonhard M.

17870f4026d57a12faad63631dc3cbcfbe0ae170	an optimization methodology of susceptance variation using lead-lag controller for grid connected fsig based wind generator system		Abstract In wind power system, low frequency oscillations are observed due to imbalance between mechanical input and electrical output. Hence, variable susceptance controllers are being adopted to mitigate these oscillations. However, improper modulation of control parameters also leads to system instability. Therefore, we propose an optimization methodology for mitigating low frequency oscillations in wind power generation system. To visualize our methodology, we use a lead-lag type variable susceptance controller for fixed speed induction generator (FSIG) based wind generation system. Then, we optimize gain and time constants of lead-lag controller using three optimization algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and flower pollination algorithm (FPA). Later, we perform non-linear time domain simulation and quantitative analysis to find average fitness, standard deviation, run time, and iteration number for these optimization algorithms. Moreover, non-parametric statistical analysis, such as Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are employed for identifying statistically significant differences among these algorithms.	mathematical optimization	Ashik Ahmed;Md.

Owing to the non-ideal switching characteristics of the components, pulse dropping occurs since the devices cannot produce a very narrow pulse at the output of a PWM inverter. This causes spectral distortion and is especially unacceptable for digital audio amplifier application. A topology called transient dynamic boost has been developed to solve this problem. By introducing a compensation signal when the amplitude of the modulating signal reaches a critical level, the output signal remain undistorted with an appropriate DC link voltage is applied. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results have verified the validity of the new technique.	audio power amplifier;class-d amplifier;digital signal (signal processing);distortion;electric power conversion;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;source-to-source compiler;spectral density estimation;spectrum analyzer	Bin Zhou;Y.

It is able to realize flexible and dynamic electric power distribution in power systems analogous to the function of information routers in the Internet. It is of great interest to investigate how the energy router can be used to optimize power system operation. This paper formulates the steady-state power flow model of the energy router embedded system network and the related optimal power flow formulation. The role of the energy router in providing extra flexibility to optimize the system operation is studied. Case studies are carried out on a modified IEEE RTS-79 system and a modified IEEE 118 bus system with the energy router.

7e5789a698f8c8f4af868bba89adc2dd870b745a	multivariable control for a three-phase rectifier based on deadbeat algorithm	deadbeat control;voltage source rectifier	This paper presents a deadbeat control technique applied in a voltage source rectifier to regulate both the dc voltage (active power) and reactive power injected to the grid. As the deadbeat control is based on the system model, it leads to a faster response, without overshoot and no need to tune the controller parameters. Hence, it is used to fully control the voltage source rectifier, achieving a fast dynamic response for both the dc voltage and the power factor at the point of connection. However, there are some issues related to the high amount of power required to reach the references -especially in the dc voltage- in a few control steps. The proposed technique also protects the equipment by limiting the maximum power drained to/from the source. The mathematical development is made as a function of the converter power in order to limit it, but at the same time tracking the references with high dynamics, characteristic typical of deadbeat control.

b3cdb667dc32ebdef45e6c6bcd98f0865fca0f4f	modelling and development of a vibration-based electromagnetic energy harvester for industrial centrifugal pump application		Abstract This paper reports a unique vibration-based electromagnetic energy harvester (VEH) designed to power wireless sensors used for fault monitoring of industrial centrifugal pumps. The design consists of two independent moving parts; the central part and the outer part. The uniqueness of the VEH design exists in its ability to produce higher relative velocity between its two moving parts by isolating vibration from the outer part. The developed prototype produced an open-loop voltage of 3.48 V and a closed-loop voltage of 1.63 V for an optimum load of 700 Ω. This constituted for an average power of 3.8 mW delivered to the load at a natural frequency of 200 Hz and an excitation level of 1 g. The experimentation results were in good agreement with the simulation results as the average percentage error was within an acceptable range of 6.15%. A case study is also presented whereby a ZigBee transceiver is successfully powered from the output generated by the VEH.	bioinformatic harvester;centrifugal governor	Syed Faizan-ul-Haq Gilani;Mohd Haris M.

A prototype motor was fabricated by modifying the rotor of a conventional three-phase four-pole 400 W squirrel-cage induction motor. The experimental results of a prototype motor showed superior performance in comparison to conventional motors in terms of the power factor, efficiency and torque characteristics. The power factor can be controlled to be unity, leading or lagging by changing the supply frequency and/or source voltage. The efficiency of the motor, over a wide output power range, is remarkably higher than that of the same size conventional induction motor.

36ffafe7d61cca49e9b44b77617b4399d3cebf74	design of a transmitting coil for effective charging area expansion using a stepped helical coil		In this paper, a novel stepped helical coil is proposed with uniform magnetic field generation for effective wireless charging region expansion. The stepped helical coil uses two or more helical coils, and the desired magnetic field can be formed by controlling the number of turns and the diameter of each coil. In addition, this structure is insensitive to the influence of the ground plane and is easy to manufacture due to its simple architecture. The proposed stepped helical coil was tested for its performance by constructing a magnetic resonance 100 W class wireless charging system at a frequency of 140 kHz. The measurement results show that the charging area of 380.1 cm2 (71.6%), which maintains 60% efficiency, is about 4 times larger than that of the conventional single helical coil structure.	resonance;tesla coil;transmitter	Sang-Won Kim;Jung-Ick Moon;Seong-min Kim;In-Kui Cho;Soo-Ho Sohn	2018	2018 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	10.1109/ICTC.2018.8539563		Robotics	59.01710839949327	43.34543195424859	126696

Salient features of the proposed distributed control strategy are fourfold, first, nonlinearity is considered to cope with large disturbances, second, only a part of generators are controllable, third, no load measurement is required, fourth, communication connectivity is required only for the controllable generators. To this end, benefiting from the concept of “virtual load demand,” we first design the distributed controller for the controllable generators by leveraging the primal-dual decomposition technique. We then propose a method to estimate the virtual load demand of each controllable generator based on local frequencies. We derive incremental passivity conditions for the uncontrollable generators. Finally, we prove that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and its equilibrium attains the optimal solution to the associated economic dispatch problem. Simulations, including small and large-disturbance scenarios, are carried on the New England system, demonstrating the effectiveness of our design.		Zhaojian Wang;Feng Liu;John Z. F. Pang;Steven H.

72a3aa7e0409cc5a9fb6379b00eb85a05c185add	photovoltaic energy harvester with power management system		We present a photovoltaic energy harvester, realized in 0.35-μm CMOS technology. The proposed system collects light energy from the environment, by means of 2-mm2 on-chip integrated microsolar cells, and accumulates it in an external capacitor. While the capacitor is charging, the load is disconnected. When the energy in the external capacitor is enough to operate the load for a predefined time slot, the load is connected to the capacitor by a power management circuit. The choice of the value of the capacitance determines the operating time slot for the load. The proposed solution is suitable for discrete-time-regime applications, such as sensor network nodes, or, in general, systems that require power supply periodically for short time slots. The power management circuit includes a charge pump, a comparator, a level shifter, and a linear voltage regulator. The whole system has been extensively simulated, integrated, and experimentally characterized.		Massimo Ferri;Daria Pinna;Enrico Dallago;Piero Malcovati	2010	J.

Carbon nanotube (CNT) supercapacitors are employed as both energy storage devices and power sources, thereby achieving multidirectional energy exchange. By leveraging advanced semiconductor processes, a low-volume, cost-effective single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) power management unit (PMU) is developed, which connects all the supercapacitors into an autonomous power-supply network. The PMU enables reversible power flows, shorter power-delivery paths, and effective energy reutilization, which enhances the reliability and flexibility of the system. The use of CNT supercapacitors features small form factor and high energy/power density, making them highly attractive for power-constrained devices. A prototype of the PMU is fabricated with a 0.35-μm N-well CMOS process, with a chip area of approximately 4.3 mm2. The PMU interconnects 3-CNT supercapacitors in the power-supply network, and operates from 1.5 to 3 V. The measured peak energy-transfer efficiency is 85.03%. The supercapacitors deliver an energy density of 6.2 Wh/kg, at a high power density of 79 kW/kg and exhibit excellent stability of 98.5% retention, at a current density of 50 A/g.	autonomous robot;cmos;carbon cycle;electrical connection;form factor (design);power management unit;power supply;prototype;semiconductor;small form factor	Rajdeep Bondade;Yi Zhang;Bingqing Wei;Taoli Gu;Hai Chen;Dongsheng Brian Ma	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2523441	embedded system;power-flow study;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;reliability;supercapacitor;energy harvesting	Arch	59.967829724484965	44.292821813186244	127193

Thus, the switching losses on power switches can be reduced. The primary windings of two transformers are connected in parallel to reduce the transformer current stresses. To reduce the transformer secondary winding turns at high-output-voltage applications and distribute output power to two transformers, two transformer secondary windings are connected in series. Thus, the transformer primary currents are automatically balanced. A full-wave diode rectifier is used at the secondary side to realize full-wave rectification at the output side and reduce voltage stress on rectifier diodes. Finally, the performance of the proposed converter is evaluated on a 600-W (400 V/1.5 A) laboratory prototype.	diode;discharger;electric power conversion;experiment;flux limiter;network analysis (electrical circuits);network switch;power inverter;prototype;rectifier;semiconductor;series and parallel circuits;snubber;switched-mode power supply;transformer;transformers;uninterruptible power supply	Bor-Ren Lin;Huei-Yuan Shih	2011	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2010.2042422	forward converter;control engineering;isolation transformer;current transformer;electricity generation;electronic engineering;series and parallel circuits;index term;energy efficient transformer;delta-wye transformer;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;stress;snubber;autotransformer;distribution transformer;physics;diode	HPC	63.631743825292354	41.78556050056349	127228
1bf4e34d14f98771472f140508368350c9c734e7	modeling electronic power converters in smart dc microgrids—an overview		Electronic power converters (EPCs) are the key elements of the smart dc microgrid architectures. In order to enhance the controllability of the system, most of the elements are envisioned to be connected to the different buses through EPCs. Therefore, power flow, stability, and dynamic response in the microgrid are function of the behavior of the EPCs and their control loops. Besides, dc microgrids constitute a new paradigm in power distribution systems due to the high variability of their operating conditions, owing to the intermittent behavior of the renewable sources and customer energy consumption. Furthermore, in order to deal with this variability, the power converters can modify their operation mode, adding complexity to the dynamic and stability analysis of the system. This paper gives an overview of the various analytical and blackbox modeling strategies applied to smart dc micro/nanogrids. Different linear and nonlinear modeling techniques are reviewed describing their capabilities, but also their limitations. Finally, differences among blackbox models will be highlighted by means of illustrative examples.	approximation;complexity;control flow;data center;heart rate variability;interaction;microgrid;nonlinear system;power glove;programming paradigm;smart tv;switched-mode power supply	Air&#x00E1;n Franc&#x00E9;s;Rafael Asensi;Thea Overgaard Wichmann;R.

It is shown that SVM provides a number of degrees of freedom, which make it suitable for optimization, subject to desired constraints. An objective function is defined, which seeks to minimize the most significant harmonic components of the generated waveform while keeping other harmonic components within the acceptable range outlined in the available standards. Since the formulation of the problem involves both real and integer variables, specialized optimization methods capable of handling mixed-integer variables need to be employed, and hence, a genetic algorithm optimizer is used to solve the optimization problem. Optimized SVM sequences obtained for various operating points under different sampling frequencies are shown to result in significant reduction of dominant harmonics while maintaining the waveform quality within prescribed limits.	genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;modulation;optimization problem;sampling (signal processing);waveform	Ali Mehrizi-Sani;Shaahin Filizadeh	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.2008997	control engineering;electronic engineering;genetic algorithm;computer science;engineering;harmonic analysis;control theory;vector optimization	Robotics	67.60707979570566	38.146080463533856	128169

In this paper a three phase boost rectifier is proposed which is switched at the input side by one three phase bidirectional switch. The input switching makes input current switched at high frequency, which is then filtered by a small filter to get low THD input current at near unity power factor. Direct input current switching ensures current displacement with input voltage to be unity. This makes the control logic simpler for maintaining high input power factor and high input power factor. An energy recovery snubber is proposed which makes the efficiency high. A comparison of the proposed input side switched active filter based boost rectifier is made with the conventional boost regulated three-phase rectifier. Results show that the performance of the proposed boost rectifier is superior to the conventional boost rectifier in terms of low input current THD and high input power factor. The rectifier operates at a line voltage of 400 Volts with a power rating of 5 kW.	active filter;diode bridge;displacement mapping;rectifier;snubber;total harmonic distortion	Nazmul Hasan;Md.

However, it suffers from a poor performance under unbalanced and distorted grid conditions. To improve the filtering capability of SRF-PLL, moving average filter (MAF) is incorporated into its control loop at the cost of a slow transient response of PLL in recently published literature. To further improve their dynamic performance without compromising the disturbance rejection capability and stability, a novel PLL based on quasi-type-1 PLL structure is proposed in this paper. A complex notch filter is incorporated into the QT1-PLL to eliminate the fundamental frequency negative sequence voltage component. The window length of MAF in QT1-PLL is reduced. And MAF is responsible for rejecting the rest of harmonics. Parameter design guidelines are suggested to obtain the minimum settling time for both phase jump and frequency jump. The proposed PLL provides a faster transient response with higher stability margins. The effectiveness of the proposed PLL is confirmed through simulation and experimental results and comparison with advanced PLLs.	arnold tongue;control system;phase-locked loop;reference frame (video);rejection sampling;settling time;simulation;unbalanced circuit	Yunlu Li;Dazhi Wang;Wei Han;Sen Tan;Xifeng Guo	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2614008	filter;electrical engineering;harmonic analysis;control theory;pll multibit;transient response	Robotics	68.30541932129462	39.54286964487581	128633

Facing current ambitions e.g. in raising the share of power generation based on renewable energy sources will pose new challenges in maintaining system stability evoked by PQ issues. This paper deals with a modular shunt-type APF, conceptualized to perform various grid conditioning measures such as improving supply reliability, mitigating voltage quality disturbances and providing other ancillary services.

However, constraints on power, system volume, and cost are prohibitive to satisfy these requirements. In this paper, a reconfigurable energy management unit (EMU) is introduced that works within the constraints to meet the requirements. With multi-directional energy flow control, the EMU achieves the unification of photovoltaic (PV) energy harvesting with maximum power point tracking (MPPT), energy storage, voltage regulation, and energy recycling for dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). Supercapacitors are employed for energy storage to enhance operation lifetime. A reconfigurable DC-DC converter architecture is implemented to accommodate flexible voltage conversion and multi-directional energy flows. Functionality is implemented and verified using a CMOS 0.35-µm process. The PV cell voltage is well controlled from 1 V to 5 V to achieve MPPT under varying illumination conditions. Meanwhile, the output voltage is regulated from 1.2 V to 3.3 V with no additional regulator. Energy recycling improves DVS down-tracking by over 15 times.	autonomous robot;cmos;cell (microprocessor);dynamic voltage scaling;image scaling;maximum power transfer theorem;power inverter;requirement;spice 2;transformer;unification (computer science);voltage regulation	Joseph Sankman;Hai Chen;Dongsheng Ma	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2011.5938122	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;wireless sensor network;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Embedded	59.36051182091251	45.185360740575234	129029

In some cases (e.g., boost and buck–boost converters), the input output dynamics can be of nonminimum-phase nature. Current-mode control is the standard strategy for output voltage regulation in high dynamic performance industrial DC–DC power converters. It is basically composed by a saturated linear state feedback (inductor current and output voltage) plus an output voltage integral feedback to remove steady-state o5set. Despite its widespread usage, there is a lack of rigorous results to back up its stabilization capability and to systematize its design. In this paper, we prove that current-mode control yields semiglobal stability with asymptotic regulation of the output voltage. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The CIGRE C4.109 method lacks the ability to determine which harmonic currents have a positive or negative impact on emission in the network. The aggregation of harmonic phasors can support the better understanding of emission based on analysis of the prevailing angle in the harmonic current phasor. This opportunity is evaluated by the application of harmonic emission assessment at a grid-connected 11 kV Photovoltaic plant.	harp;phasor	Brandon Peterson;Johan Rens;Jan Meyer;Gerhard Botha;Jan Desmet	2016	2016 IEEE International Workshop on Applied Measurements for Power Systems (AMPS)	10.1109/AMPS.2016.7602809	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;thd analyzer;total harmonic distortion	HPC	62.45558380504199	38.88434260066334	129804

In this paper, positive Buck-Boost (BB) converter topology is selected and modified to a multi-input (MI) topology that could be controlled suitably by sliding mode control (SMC) technique. The methodology is based on controlling a MI single output system. Within the SMC method, besides robust dynamic behavior of the closed-loop system, power sharing between different sources of energy is achieved. Simulation results show powerful characteristics of sliding mode technique such as robustness in terms of dynamic stability of the converter.	boost converter;buck–boost converter;electric power conversion;hybrid system;robustness (computer science);simulation	Ebrahim Farjah;Saeed Rezaee;Teymoor Ghanbari	2012	2012 25th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2012.6334820	renewable energy;robust control;control engineering;electronic engineering;sliding mode control;network switch;computer science;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;steady state;network topology	EDA	64.43843546327484	37.5358704744404	129888

A fasttransient global search algorithm is proposed to identify the GMPP of a solar panel within hundreds of μs in the presence of multiple local maxima during partial shading conditions. The pulse integration based MPPT circuitry enables highprecision MPPT. Ripple-based irradiance aware adaptive frequency control (IAAFC) is also developed to lower the switching power loss under low irradiance levels, improving the harvester power efficiency over a wide output power range. The proposed energy harvester was implemented in 50 V 0.35 μm CMOS. It tracks the GMPP in 350 μs in the presence of two local maxima with 99% GMPP tracking efficiency. The IAAFC enables the proposed harvester to achieve > 85% power efficiency over a wide power range from 0.98 to 21 W with the peak power efficiency of 94.2% at 1 MHz. The proposed harvester improves the MPPT transient time and the power density by at least 4.5 times and 6 times, respectively, compared with state-ofthe-art counterparts.	bioinformatic harvester;cmos;clock rate;electronic circuit;global storage architecture;goodyear mpp;maxima and minima;maximal set;maximum power transfer theorem;performance per watt;ripple effect;search algorithm;shading	Sandip Uprety;Hoi Lee	2016	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2016.2576025	control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;solar cell efficiency;engineering;electrical engineering;photovoltaic system;control theory;solar energy	Arch	60.004477309887626	45.57673930296296	130046

Past electrochemical management systems have suffered from low efficiency, limited functionality, and extreme cost sensitivity in storage applications [1]. Most battery management systems used for state-of-charge (SOC) equalization in large arrays use resistive shunts, which have low efficiency and lack bidirectionality. Efficient solutions are known, but have not been widely adopted in part due to the size and cost of magnetic components [2]. Resonant/hybrid switched-capacitor (SC) approaches are particularly attractive for electrochemical balancing/equalization, as the voltage ratio between series-connected cells or modules is typically 1∶1 with only minor variation due to cell impedance and state-of-charge (SOC) levels. Compared to pure SC approaches, they can achieve higher efficiency due to soft-charging and expanded capabilities for variable regulation. Compared to traditional buck-boost converters, the needed inductor volume can be 10 to 100× lower due to the reduced volt-second product (flux linkage) provided by the SC stage [3].	bi-directional text;boost converter;characteristic impedance;linkage (software);state of charge;switched capacitor	Christopher Schaef;Eric Din;Jason T.

81f237350f46ef1b0c726a406766574a8d00af85	a single-phase transformerless inverter with charge pump circuit concept for grid-tied pv applications	transformerless inverter charge pump circuit grid tied inverter leakage current elimination;inverters leakage currents topology charge pumps capacitors inductors schottky diodes	This paper proposes a new single-phase transformerless photovoltaic (PV) inverter for grid-tied PV systems. The topology is derived from the concept of a charge pump circuit in order to eliminate the leakage current. It is composed of four power switches, two diodes, two capacitors, and an LCL output filter. The neutral of the grid is directly connected to the negative polarity of the PV panel that creates a constant common mode voltage and zero leakage current. The charge pump circuit generates the negative output voltage of the proposed inverter during the negative cycle. A proportional resonant control strategy is used to control the injected current. The main benefits of the proposed inverter are: 1) the neutral of the grid is directly connected to the negative terminal of the PV panel, so the leakage current is eliminated; 2) its compact size; 3) low cost; 4) the used dc voltage of the proposed inverter is the same as the full-bridge inverter (unlike neutral point clamped (NPC), active NPC, and half-bridge inverters); 5) flexible grounding configuration; 6) capability of reactive power flow; and 7) high efficiency. A complete description of the operating principle and analysis of the proposed inverter are presented. Experimental results are presented to confirm both the theoretical analysis and the concept of the proposed inverter. The obtained results clearly validate the performance of the proposed inverter and its practical application in grid-tied PV systems.	charge pump;control theory;diode;inverter (logic gate);lazarus component library;np-completeness;network switch;page view;power inverter;shortest path problem;spectral leakage	Jaber Fallah Ardashir;Mehran Sabahi;Seyed Hossein Hosseini;Frede Blaabjerg;Ebrahim Babaei;Gevork B.

The boundary conditions for the 100% efficiency operations are analysed under the conditions that the duty ratio is 0.5 and the loaded quality factor is infinite. If the DC supply voltage and the output power are assumed the same, the load resistance R is 53.65% higher, the excess series inductance Lx is 3.99% lower and the maximum frequency f max is improved by 6.47% compared with the conventional class E amplifier. The theoretical analysis is verified by numerical results and harmonic balance simulations. And a lumped element test board is built and measured at 200 MHz utilising a Lateral Double Diffused Metal Oxide Semiconductor (LDMOS) transistor MRF21010 as the switching device. An output power of 33.03 dBm, a drain efficiency of 85.6% and a gain of 16 dB are measured. The approximate transmission-line topology with harmonics suppression is also proposed.

An alternative option is to replace all the separate dc sources feeding the H-bridge cells with capacitors, leaving only one H-bridge cell with a real dc voltage source. This will yield a cost-effective converter. However, the required capacitor voltage balancing is challenging. In this paper, using the phase-shift modulation approach, a new control method for cascaded H-bridge multilevel converters fed with only one independent dc source is presented. The proposed method has a wide voltage regulation range for the replacement capacitors in the H-bridge cells.

The power conditioning systems examined are: an intermediate boost converter integrated with a 2- and 3-level inverter. The aim is to determine which power conditioning system yields the highest efficiency in terms of power losses of the semiconductor devices with a predetermined operating condition. In view of this, a relation between the fuel cell operating condition and power loss is established to evaluate the efficiency of the system. The power loss model presented in this paper has taken into account the conduction and switching losses of the semiconductor devices within each power conditioning system. Simulation results are presented showing the power loss characteristics with the operating condition. Finally, with regard to the global efficiency for the power conditioning systems, an intermediate boost converter integrated with a 3-level inverter is found to be the most favourable choice considering the typical operating condition encountered by a fuel cell at the kWatt level.	boost converter;cell (microprocessor);diode;power inverter;requirement;semiconductor device;simulation	Md.

1b94dbc14f9c69d839c6fa39b97e30cae30f7cfa	middle-level she pulse-amplitude modulation for cascaded multilevel inverters		This letter presents a novel middle-level selective harmonic elimination-pulse-amplitude modulation (SHE-PAM) method to calculate switching angles and to synthesize reference voltage for variable dc voltage sources connected to multilevel inverter. Instead of conventional multivariable nonlinear transcendental SHE-pulse-width modulation (SHE-PWM) equations or polynomial equations derived from them, the proposed method works on univariate linear equations. Due to reduced computational complexities, it can be implemented in real-time for the inverter having a large number of levels. Without amplifying the magnitude of higher order harmonics, proposed method eliminates a significant number of harmonics as compared to SHE-PWM and conventional SHE-PAM methods. The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output voltage is a function of only number of voltage levels and remains constant for a whole range of modulation index. The theoretical analysis and working characteristics of suggested method are validated by simulation and experimental studies.	analysis of algorithms;inverter (logic gate);linear equation;nonlinear system;polynomial;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;real-time clock;simulation;total harmonic distortion	Piyush L.

The proposed transformer structure is compared with other typical structures with the leakage inductance, ac capacitance, ac resistance, and the ratio of ac–dc resistance taken into consideration. The proposed structure features lower leakage inductance, smaller ac capacitance, lower ac resistance, and lower ratio of ac–dc resistance, which is suitable for high-frequency high-efficiency applications. A planar transformer with the proposed structure was built and tested in an LCLC resonant converter, where the input voltage is 40 V, the output is 4800 V, the switching frequency is 500 kHz, the output power is 288 W, and the efficiency is 96.8%, which validates the analysis.

dbd749a9ec88366dcb8af5ef2789b43ec4f12a7d	nonlinear analysis of the tristable energy harvester with a resonant circuit for performance enhancement		The tristable energy harvesters (TEH) can achieve broadband energy harvesting performance from low frequency and low level excitations. Previous studies mainly focused on the tristable energy harvesting structure that is connected to a pure resistor. This paper presents an enhanced TEH with a series resistor-inductor resonant (RL) circuit connected to the piezoelectric layers. The influence of the resonant frequency of the circuit, the excitation level, and equilibrium positions on dynamic responses is analyzed using modern methods of nonlinear dynamics. The results demonstrate that the proposed TEH undergoes the periodic and chaotic motions alternatively along with the increase of the resonant frequency of the RL circuit. Furthermore, the TEH with a RL circuit dramatically enhances the energy harvesting efficiency, and simultaneously slightly decreases the vibration response. The presented TEH with a RL circuit will open a new page in the nonlinear energy harvesting technology.	harvester;lc circuit	Bo Yan;Shengxi Zhou;Grzegorz Litak	2018	I. J.

One advantageous approach to gain a good understanding of the processes and algorithms involved is simulation on conventional computers. Simulations allow better understanding of the capabilities of molecules because they can occur at the level of reliability, efficiency, and programmability that are standard in conventional computation and are desirable for experiments in vitro. Here, we describe in some detail the architecture of a general-purpose simulation environment in silico, EdnaCo, establish its soundness and reliability, and benchmark its performance. The system can be described as an emulation of the events in a real test tube. We describe the major pieces of its architecture, namely, a distributed memory (file) system, a kinetic engine, and input/output mechanisms. Finally, the ability of this environment in preserving major features of the wet counterpart in vitro is evaluated via an implementation on a cluster of PCs. The results of several simulations are summarized that establish the soundness, utility, applicability, and cost efficiency of the software to facilitate experimentation in vitro.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computation;computer simulation;cost efficiency;distributed memory;emulator;experiment;general-purpose modeling;input/output;soundness (interactive proof)	Max H.

However, when implemented using the principles which apply to voltagesource inverter PWM pattern generators, the switching frequency is equal to: 1) the carrier frequency in standard carrier-based implementations and 2) a function of the cycle frequency, sequence of space vectors, and selection of the zero space vector in space vector implementations. This paper shows that this frequency can be reduced to one-half of the respective frequencies. Two pattern generators are investigated: 1) an analog on-line carrier-based technique, namely, the modified dead-band technique and 2) a digital on-line space vector-based technique, where advantage is taken of the extra zero state available in current–source converters. It is shown that the switching frequency reduction is achieved with no penalty in the line current harmonic distortion. Moreover, a significant reduction of ac line current distortion is obtained with the modified dead-band technique for modulation indexes greater than 0.4. The principles of operation of the proposed schemes are explained. Experimental results on a 5kVA current–source rectifier and a 5-kVA current–source inverter confirm the feasibility and features of the proposed pattern generators.	carrier frequency;clock rate;current source;distortion;inverter (logic gate);online and offline;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;rectifier	José R.

Indeed, these parasitic capacitances between cells in the array can modify applied polarizations and can disturb the functioning of the whole array. Their impact increases when the cell size is reduced, especially as the ultimate size of the 22 nm node is reached. We develop 3D TCAD simulations to extract parasitic capacitances as well as measurements on specific test structures or geometrical calculations, showing their increasing importance in the future technologies, especially for 22 nm node. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The phase current reconstruction process, in which the sampled dc-link current from a dc-link current sensor is used to reconstruct the phase currents, is comprehensively investigated, taking account of both the region of duty ratio and the operating mode of the continuous current mode (CCM) and discontinuous current mode (DCM). DCM operation reveals that the phase current reconstruction cannot coincide with the average value of the respective phase current. Eventually, it is confirmed that this proposed balance control based on a circular chain control makes it possible to establish an exact current sharing among the phase currents all over the operating condition including the DCM. The actual phase currents do not show any distorted waveforms due to the multisamplings of dc-link current that do not provoke any extra switching of the converter switches at all. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed phase current-balance control are illustrated through the experimental results.	analog-to-digital converter;battery charger;dicom;duty cycle;network switch;unbalanced circuit	Jungho Han;Joong-Ho Song	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2530781	control engineering;electronic engineering;current mirror;network switch;computer science;engineering;constant current;control theory;current limiting	EDA	64.7771725482107	40.96934762934834	133834

The main circuit consists of a diode-bridge rectifier, a boost inductor, two AC power switches, and two capacitors. According to the proposed control scheme based on a voltage comparator and hysteresis current control technique, the output capacitor voltages are balanced and the line current will follow the supply current command. The supply current command is derived from a DC-link voltage regulator and an output power estimator. The major advantage of using a three-level rectifier is that the blocking voltage of each AC power device is clamping to half of the DC-link voltage and the generated harmonics of the three-level rectifier are less than those of the conventional two-level rectifier. There are five voltage levels (0, /spl plusmn/V/sub DC//2, /spl plusmn/V/sub DC/) on the AC side of the diode rectifier. The high power factor and low harmonic currents at the input of the rectifier are verified by software simulations and experimental tests.	pulse-width modulation;rectifier	Bor-Ren Lin;Hsin-Hung Lu	1999	IEEE Trans.

44d0dc99cde0184de180fbae0c03a4cd7bdddac9	battery recharging issue for a two-power-level flywheel system	engineering and technology;teknik och teknologier	A novel battery recharging system for an all-electric driveline comprising a flywheel with a permanent magnet double wound synchronous machine (motor/generator) is presented. The double winding enables two voltage levels and two different power levels. This topology supersedes other all-electric drivelines. The battery operates in a low-power regime supplying the average power whereas the flywheel delivers and absorbs power peaks, which are up to a higher order of magnitude. The topology presents new challenges for the power conversion system, which is the focus of this investigation. The main challenge is the control of the power flow to the battery when the vehicle is parked despite the decay of the flywheel machine voltage; which is dependent on its charge state, that is, rotational speed. The design and simulation of an unidirectional DC/DC buck/boost converter for a variable rotational speed flywheel is presented. Conventional power electronic converters are used in a new application, which can maintain a constant current or voltage on the battery side. Successful PI current control has been implemented and simulated, together with the complete closed loop system.		Janaína Gonçalves de Oliveira;Hans Bernhoff	2010	J.

The LCD with cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) best satisfies display performance, size, and efficiency. To operate the CCFL, a driving circuit is needed to light the lamp with a relatively high voltage and then stabilize the arc current. For minimizing the component count and size, a high-frequency zero-voltage switching (ZVS) resonant converter is preferred. In this paper, a field-programmable-gate-array-based ZVS resonant converter for driving CCFL with digital dimming capability is presented. The proposed digital controller utilizes the pulse density modulation technique to adjust the output power. A 3-W prototyping system is built and tested; experimental results show that the proposed system can reduce the voltage spike by more than 15%, compared to the low-frequency dimming methods. The overall system power efficiency is approximately 85%. The advantages of the proposed system include high efficiency, low output voltage and current spike, wide dimming range, flexibility, and compactness.	computer;display device;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;lamp (software bundle);laptop;liquid-crystal display;performance per watt;pulse-density modulation;switched-mode power supply;voltage spike	Yi-Hwa Liu	2007	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2007.903935	electronic engineering;digital control;computer hardware;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;liquid-crystal display;control theory;field-programmable gate array	EDA	61.32397311355822	44.1377975628553	134734

In power systems, the switching frequency is commonly limited to prevent power losses, and chattering or ‘ripple’ appears especially in the system current. Common methods to decrease such ripple are based on ‘harmonic cancellation’ using the multiple number of phase channels having the desired phase shift that brings cancellation in the sum of outputs from the individual channels. In this article, a design principle of sliding mode control for a multiphase controller is proposed. The methodology is originated from the concept of multidimensional sliding mode and provides desired phase shifts between phases with the help of adaptive width for the hysteresis loops in switching elements.

b898e81bedb43b3d6fa956c2284ea91b97f06fbd	online voltage stability assessment of power system by comparing voltage stability indices and extreme learning machine		Nowadays the modern power systems are large complex systems and widely distributed geographically. The increase in demand, generator reaching reactive power limits and line/generator outages may operate the power system in stressed conditions leads to voltage instability or voltage collapse. Voltage stability has become of major concern among the power utilities, because of several events of voltage collapse occurred in the past decade. Thus the real time voltage stability assessment is essential by estimating the loadability margin of the power system. Voltage stability analysis was studied on IEEE 30 and IEEE 118 bus systems using many voltage stability indices based on line/nodal and the results are compared with the proposed new index based on SVM and ELM.

The impact of intrinsic random device variations, including fin Line Edge Roughness (LER), Work Function Variation (WFV) and fin width scaling on FinFET and Trigate device Subthreshold Slope (S.S.), VT, 6T SRAM Read Static Noise Margin (RSNM) and Write Static Noise Margin (WSNM) are investigated and compared by using 3D atomistic TCAD simulation. The results indicate that Trigate device shows slightly better variability control under the same electrical width and fin width (10nm and 7nm) considering fin LER and WFV. Next, we investigate the impact of single charged trap induced Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) on FinFET and Trigate device characteristics, 6T SRAM and logic circuits. The top-gate and the lower fin height of Trigate device under the same electrical width and fin width cause the current density to concentrate close to the bottom of the fin, resulting in stronger dependence on the location of the trap, larger RTN ΔID/ID amplitude and larger ΔVT with a trap placed at the worst position under fin LER and WFV. The impact of RTN trapping/detrapping on 6T SRAM RSNM, the leakage-delay of inverter, Two-Way NAND and 2-To-1 Multiplexer (MUX) are examined. With degreasing supply voltage, the RTN degradation of Trigate SRAM RSNM and logic circuits become larger compared with the FinFET counterparts.	bounded variation;burst noise;elegant degradation;flux limiter;hardware random number generator;heart rate variability;image scaling;list of code lyoko episodes;logic gate;molecular dynamics;multiplexer;multiprotocol label switching;noise margin;power inverter;qualitative comparative analysis;simulation;spectral leakage;static random-access memory;traffic collision avoidance system	Chia-Hao Pao;Ming-Long Fan;Ming-Fu Tsai;Yin-Nien Chen;Vita Pi-Ho Hu;Pin Su;Ching-Te Chuang	2012	2012 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/APCCAS.2012.6419072	electronic engineering;parallel computing;static random-access memory;logic gate;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system	EDA	54.091054989919414	42.97491503007096	135853

In contrast with conventional MOSFET technologies, the improved electrical characteristics of TFETs promise a better behavior in the process of rectification and conversion at ultra-low power (μW) and voltage (sub-0.25 V) levels. RF powered systems can not only benefit from TFETs in front-end rectifiers by harvesting the surrounding energy at levels where conventional technologies cannot operate but also in the minimization of energy required by the power management circuit. In this work we present an energy harvesting circuit for RF sources designed with TFETs. The TFET controller emulates an adequate impedance at the output of the rectifier in order to allow maximum transfer of power from the RF source to the input of the boost converter. The output load is activated once the output capacitor reaches a voltage value of 0.5 V. The results show an efficiency boost of 89 % for an output load consuming 1 μW with an available RF power of -25 dBm.	boost converter;characteristic impedance;dbm;emulator;power management;radio frequency;rectifier;simulation	David Nunes Cavalheiro;Francesc Moll;Stanimir Valtchev	2016	2016 14th IEEE International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)	10.1109/NEWCAS.2016.7604751	control engineering;electronic engineering;power factor;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	59.59937206634248	44.825410664126395	136348

Therefore, cooling and humidification systems are essential parts of every Building Automation System (BAS), which is utilized in server rooms. Although the current climate control systems ensure appropriate thermal conditions to computational nodes such as servers, they waste substantial amount of energy. The main cause of this inefficiency is that the current climate control systems, which are responsible for thermal management of the data centres, follow rigid control strategies that maintain constant thermal conditions irrespective of climate changes caused by various computational loads in the plant. To address this issue, in our previous works we proposed a method of optimizing energy consumption in data centre cooling systems while maintaining an acceptable level of thermal comfort for CPUs in the server room. In this paper, we present the enhancement of our previous method by incorporating humidity control into it. The enhanced method consists of a thermal model of server room, and a simulation tool to find an energy efficient control strategy for the climate control system in different situations by comparing different control strategies. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been investigated via simulation and the result, which shows 41.5% reduction in total energy consumption is presented.	automation;broadcast auxiliary service;central processing unit;computer cooling;control system;control theory;data center;server (computing);server room;simulation;thermal management (electronics);type system	Yulia Berezovskaya;Arash Mousavi;Valeriy Vyatkin;Xiaojing Zhang;Tor Björn Minde	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793777	simulation;engineering;operations management;mechanical engineering	Embedded	62.01317446471428	34.9685952401002	136662

It offers high-energy conversion quality using a small number of capacitors and power devices and consequently, has a very low production cost. An averaged model of the topology is detailed. The operating principle of the transformerless seven-level inverter is analyzed and detailed. The multilevel sinusoidal modulation has been adapted for use with the PUC-based structure. The control strategy has been designed to reduce the harmonic contents of the load voltage. With such converters, filters' rating is considerably reduced. A comparative study is performed to highlight the advantages of the new packed U cells topology. The operation of the proposed converter topology has been verified through simulation.

First, the maximum-power-voltage-based control scheme and direct maximum power control scheme are introduced for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT). By using T-S fuzzy model representation, the two MPPT control schemes are formulated to an output tracking control problem in a unified form. Then, the T-S fuzzy observer and controller are developed to achieve asymptotic MPPT for uncertain PV power systems, where the controller and observer gains are able to be separately solved from novel linear matrix inequality formulation. Furthermore, the MPPT robustness is also discussed in the presence of rapidly changing atmosphere and external disturbances. Different from the traditional MPPT approaches, the proposed T-S fuzzy controller does not require searching the maximum power operational point and using coordinate transformation. All the buck, boost, or buck-boost converters can be used to achieve MPPT in the same control method. Finally, the satisfactory performance is shown from the simulation and experimental results.	boost converter;buck–boost converter;experiment;ibm power systems;linear matrix inequality;maximum power transfer theorem;robustness (computer science);simulation;social inequality;mpv	Chian-Song Chiu;Ya-Lun Ouyang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2010.2093900	control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;computer science;engineering;photovoltaic system;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy control system	Robotics	65.51319205791859	37.23283884878034	137346

The proposed equipment overcomes the drawbacks of the traditional instrumentation (large thermal capacitance, lack of individual thermal control for each sample, no thermal runaway detection), enabling a new methodological approach. Several electrical measurements during the test are allowed. Multiple benefits derive from this new approach: the identification of early warnings in accordance with configurable thresholds of degradation and thermal runaway quenching. Furthermore, the test can be stopped solely for the out-of-specification devices.

The asynchronous buck converter achieves higher efficiency in light load condition compared to synchronous buck converters. Furthermore, the proposed buck converter switches operation mode automatically from pulse-width modulation (PWM) mode to pulse-skipping mode (PSM). By reducing power MOS on-state resistance and optimizing rise/fall time of switches, the proposed buck converter also obtains high efficiency under heavy load condition. The maximum efficiency of the proposed buck converter is 92.9%, implemented with 0.35μm BCDMOS 2P3M process, and the total size is 1.1× 1.2mm2. The input range and output range of the converter are 6–30 V, and (Vinput–3) V, respectively, with the maximum output current of 3 A. Moreover, its built-in current loop leads to good transient response characteristics. Therefore, it can be used widely in communication system and 12 V/24 V distributed power system.	buck converter	Zhaohan Li;Yongcheng Ji;Shu Yang;Yuchun Chang	2016	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S021812661650136X	forward converter;control engineering;electronic engineering;flyback converter;buck converter;computer science;engineering;asynchronous communication;ćuk converter;control theory;buck–boost converter;boost converter	EDA	62.73329844528482	43.2486236181401	138058

The proposed phase-shift modulation technique does not require any extra active/passive circuitry to guarantee soft-switching. In addition, the proposed technique can be applied to the general category of power circuit topologies for dc/dc converters, which use a full-bridge inverter in their power circuit. The proposed hybrid phase-shift modulation technique includes two distinct modulation strategies based on the operating condition of the converter. Thus, it has a variable structure that can optimize the performance for various operating conditions. The main advantages of the proposed technique are the achievement of soft-switching independent of the load condition, and optimized performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation/experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed hybrid phase-shift modulation technique over the conventional one.	electronic circuit;modulation;power inverter;simulation	Majid Pahlevani;Shangzhi Pan;Praveen K.

The control of the overall circuit is ensured by a 7-bit shift register. For higher loading capability a buffer is connected to the output. To preserve the possibility of voltage ramping, the CUT has a separated supply rail. The CUT can be also connected to a feedback network integrated on the chip, and thus, turned into an oscillator.	analogue electronics;cmos;electronic oscillator;operational amplifier;shift register;vhdl-ams	Juraj Brenkus;Viera Stopjaková;Jozef Mihálov	2008	2008 11th IEEE Workshop on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits and Systems	10.1109/DDECS.2008.4538805	operational amplifier;control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;shift register;oscillation	EDA	62.678341158680134	41.86607602851993	138560

For fuel cell vehicles, not only the fuel cell system and the hydrogen storage system but also the high-voltage system is very important, such as a traction motor to propel the vehicle, motors that drive some devices for the fuel cell system, a second battery that stores braking energy and assists the acceleration, inverters which supply alternating current to the prescribed motors, and converters which change voltage generated by the fuel cell stack to the specific level for each subsystems to operate.

This paper describes additional contribution to primary frequency control based on voltage-dependent noncritical (NC) loads that can tolerate a wide variation of supply voltage. By using a series of reactive compensators to decouple the NC load from the mains to form a smart load (SL), the voltage, and hence the active power of the NC load, can be controlled to regulate the mains frequency. The scope of this paper focuses primarily on reactive compensators for which only the magnitude of the injected voltage could be controlled while maintaining the quadrature relationship between the current and voltage. New control guidelines are suggested. The effectiveness of the SLs in improving mains frequency regulation without considering frequency-dependent loads and with little relaxation in mains voltage tolerance is demonstrated in a case study on the IEEE 37 bus test distribution network. Sensitivity analysis is included to show the effectiveness and limitations of SLs for varying load power factors, proportion of SLs, and system strengths.	characteristic impedance;constant current;data (computing);frequency response;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;linear programming relaxation;sl (complexity);series and parallel circuits;voltage regulation	Zohaib Akhtar;Balarko Chaudhuri;Ron Shu-Yuen Hui	2015	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2015.2402637	control engineering;electronic engineering;power control;engineering;electrical engineering;electrical impedance;automatic frequency control;control theory;ac power;voltage optimisation;voltage regulation	Visualization	64.25246182871643	44.01820924309211	138957

This system can be implemented in national highways where wind can be collected due to the high speed motion of vehicles and at the same time the solar energy from the ambient will also be collected. Finally both energies will be acquired simultaneously for charging the batteries and is utilized for satisfying the electrical demands of domestic and rural areas. For the purpose of maximum uninterrupted power supply in industries and factories, a DC generator and power supply line are also connected to the system. But these two systems work in a priority order only when the demand is not met by the Wind-Solar system. The main advantage of this system is, it can be implemented in both standalone and grid connected modes.	uninterruptible power supply	P. Freddy Simon;Bojan Anand;A. J.

4b981155dcda0c2c319e757cd8c2eee536742876	[131] experimental study of the short-circuit robustness of 600 v e-mode gan transistors		This paper presents experimental robustness of 600 V GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) submitted to Short-Circuits (SC) operation modes. A dedicated secured test bench has been developed and designed in order to protect as quickly as possible the Device Under Test (DUT) after failure. Some devices featured a great robustness under SC and were able to support several SC of a very long duration. On the contrary, others failed immediately at the first pulse, for a low dissipated energy. The obtained results reveal a severe dispersal in terms of SC robustness for these new emerging components. Gate behavior has been also studied, showing a leakage current during each SC, destructive or not. A part of the paper is also dedicated to the study of the effects of case temperature and DC voltage on robustness.	transistor	M. Landel;C.

This paper studies the dynamic behavior of this system. First, the operation modes and the steady-state properties of the converter are addressed, and, then, a stability analysis that includes both the power stage and control parameters is carried out. Different bifurcations are determined from the averaged model and from the discrete-time model. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion is used to obtain the stability regions of the averaged (slow-scale) dynamics in the design parameter space, and a discrete-time approach is used to obtain more accurate results and to detect possible (fast-scale) subharmonic oscillations. Experimental measurements were taken from a system prototype to confirm the analytical results and numerical simulations. Some possible nonsmooth bifurcations due to the change in the switching patterns are also illustrated.	analog-to-digital converter;authorization;bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;dc-to-dc converter;dynamical system;event dispatching thread;ieee xplore;jacobian matrix and determinant;nsb/appstudio;numerical analysis;period-doubling bifurcation;prototype;pulse-width modulation;ripple effect;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;simulation;steady state	Vanessa Moreno-Font;Abdelali El Aroudi;Javier Calvente;Roberto Giral;Luis Benadero	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2009.2023769	computer simulation;control engineering;discrete time and continuous time;electronic engineering;von neumann stability analysis;voltage;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;nonlinear system;engineering;power electronics;control theory;pulse-width modulation;feedback;mathematics;parameter space;steady state;oscillation;negative feedback	Embedded	67.15381395231043	42.84407662463864	139827

This paper attempts to develop a unitized design method of a segmental secondary LSRM, which is characterized by a modular magnetic circuit structure and the independent operation of multimover units. The developed design method is directly performed in linear domain without transforming it to a rotary SRM, which complies with the essential natures of the segmental secondary LSRM, showing that it is capable of delivering more power at the same dimensions compared to the conventional tooth type LSRM. Further, the sensitivity analysis of the critical geometric parameters is performed, and the guidelines for selection of the best dimension parameters are given. Finally, the three-phase and four-phase LSRMs are designed and prototyped, respectively with a 1-m long stator. The experimental results validate the design procedures and analysis above.	rotary system;system reference manual	Daohan Wang;Dengxu Zhang;Xingfei Du;Xiuhe Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2018.2829690	electromagnetic coil;control theory;propulsion;control engineering;engineering;magnetic circuit;stator;horizontal and vertical;linear induction motor;switched reluctance motor;modular design	EDA	67.26407611597809	37.11420833809312	139963

Prior studies have shown that by heating the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus of rodents with a heated water-perfused probe the body temperature can be lowered, but this method is not feasible for chronic use. Here we present two control circuit designs that employ high performance operational amplifiers and a feedback network that has the ability to chronically modulate the temperature of the POA of the hypothalamus, thus adjusting the body temperature set point. This will be done by permanently implanting a heated micro-probe (thermistor) and using a feedback system to accurately control the temperature of the thermistor to help the brain center control the temperature. The control circuit and feedback network were designed to provide accurate and sustainable control over the subjects body temperature while focusing on the miniaturization of components without sacrificing performance. For this design the power consumed by the circuit was achieved to be 3.8 mW and the size of the board is currently 9 cm2. Tadiran batteries were used to employ high-performance button cells. The thermistor used is around 360 μm and it is capable of controlling the temperature between 98.6 °F/37 °C and 122 °F/50 °C. Thus, the circuit is sufficiently small to be carried by a rodent while chronically controlling the POA temperature.	common object request broker architecture;norton system insight;operational amplifier;rechargeable battery	Admir Horta;Eric Gernux;Matt Couceiro;Dieter Haemmerich;Mohamed Almekkawy	2016	2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON)	10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777815	resistor;temperature measurement;temperature control;thermistor	EDA	57.256348624947606	45.52662575043898	140291
3af5f50f5bb7fd82d65a1e13ef01e2656b24e3d1	quadratic buck-boost converter with positive output-voltage and continuous input-current		Electrical power processing is an essential component of renewable energy sources such as PV panels and fuel cells conversion systems. The first stage of power conditioning usually consists of a DC-DC converter that enables a suitable DC bus voltage for a load feeder-or grid-tie-inverter. Motivated by the current needs in power conditioning of PEMFC systems, we propose a new power electronics converter. The proposed topology has a quadratic buck-boost voltage gain which allows a wide range of input voltages, providing a fixed output voltage with additional compelling features such as the circumvention of: the use of transformers, coupled inductors or extreme duty cycles. Moreover, the input current of the proposed converter is continuous and its output voltage is positive with respect to the input one, which is in sharp contrast with respect to other buck-boost topologies whose output voltages are in general negative. The main principles, steady-state analysis, and a small-signal model for the proposed circuit operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM) are presented in detail. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis.	boost converter;buck–boost converter;grid-tie inverter;power electronics;power inverter;simulation;small-signal model;steady state;transformers	Julio Cesar Rosas-Caro;Victor M.

Most of the research on GIC done in Europe so far refers to Scandinavian power grids. A power outage due to GIC occurred in southern Sweden in October 2003. The principal reason that similar GIC problems as in Sweden have not occurred in Finland is in the use of different transformer types in these two countries. However, due to the northern location, research on GIC in the Finnish high-voltage system is continued. The largest GIC recorded in 400 kV transformer neutrals are 320 A and 201 A in Sweden and Finland, respectively. GIC magnitudes in a system do not only depend on the intensity of magnetic disturbances but network parameters (resistances and topology) also play a significant role. The increasing size of the European high-voltage power grids, the complex interconnections and the extensive transport of energy between different countries make today's systems more prone to GIC problems	downtime;ibm power systems;transformer	Risto J.

Being a current controlled PWM technique this scheme provides fast dynamic response as well as inherent short circuit protection of the drive. This scheme facilitates realization of voltage space vectors of higher magnitude across the motor windings with only one low voltage DC source, The PWM scheme is implemented on a TMS320F28335 digital signal controller. Experimental validation of the proposed scheme is carried out on a 1.1KW induction motor with open-end stator windings.	approximation;arabic numeral 0;common-mode interference;controllers;digital signal controller;drug vehicle;dual;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;experiment;flatulence;inverter (logic gate);inverter device component;matlab;oscilloscopes;parabolic antenna;phasor;pokeweed mitogens;power (psychology);power inverter;power supply;pulse-width modulation;short circuit;steady state;xfig;voltage	M.

A new parameter s (V/s), called the slope of switch voltage when the switch turns on is introduced to obtain an image of the distance from the nominal conditions. By examining off-nominal Class-E operation degree of the design freedom of the Class-E amplifier increases by one. In addition various amplifier parameters such as operating frequency, output power, and load resistance range can be set as design specifications. For example, the peak switch voltage and switch current can be taken into account in the design procedure. Examples of a design procedure of the Class-E amplifier for off-nominal operation are given.

It is determined that in a voltage mode—voltage source configuration, a transformer tree can yield the 22<R>n</R> discrete outputs corresponding to an n-bit input word, requiring a single diode or equivalent nonlinear element per logical product. It is also shown in this configuration that by including additional input transformers, use can be made of flux storage to produce a synchronous automaton whose ultimate speed is limited by the switching rate of the active elements and distributed reactance only. In a voltage mode—impedance source configuration, a system producing 2<R>n</R> decoded outputs results, which appears to have particular significance in core-store and READ-only memory drive applications. Based on this, a high-speed storage system is proposed.	automaton;characteristic impedance;computer data storage;diode;magnetic-core memory;nonlinear element;nonlinear system;transformer;transformers;voltage source	John Harley	1968	IEEE Transactions on Computers	10.1109/TC.1968.229157	selection;index term;computer science;electrical engineering;operating system;linear map;read-only memory	Arch	65.39911072902562	43.58895676452255	142188

However, implementing a multifrequency transmitter often requires compromises in system size, complexity, power transfer capability, or output regulation. In this paper, a single-inverter-based dual-mode WPT system is proposed. The system employs a multifrequency programmed pulse width modulation scheme. This multifrequency modulated inverter can simultaneously generate and regulate 100-kHz and 6.78-MHz outputs, or multiple frequencies within ranges of 87–300 kHz, which facilitates the development of multistandard WPT technology for consumer electronics. The principle of the proposed modulation is illustrated, where two different frequencies are concurrently modulated using a programmed pulse train of square waveforms for power delivery, while eliminating certain harmonics. Design tradeoffs and constraints are examined through analytical circuit models. Finally, experimental results are provided to verify the method on a gallium-nitride-based WPT prototype.	power inverter;prototype;pulse-width modulation;transmitter	Chongwen Zhao;Daniel Costinett	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2681974	control engineering;electronic engineering;pulse-frequency modulation;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	65.21249627088326	44.910851551550685	142570

In order to prolong the lifetime of the energy storage units (ESUs) and avoid the overuse of a certain unit, the SoC of each unit should be balanced and the injected/output power should be gradually equalized. Droop control as a decentralized approach is used as the basis of the power sharing method for distributed energy storage units. In the charging process, the droop coefficient is set to be proportional to the nth order of SoC, while in the discharging process, the droop coefficient is set to be inversely proportional to the nth order of SoC. Since the injected/output power is inversely proportional to the droop coefficient, it is obtained that in the charging process the ESU with higher SoC absorbs less power, while the one with lower SoC absorbs more power. Meanwhile, in the discharging process, the ESU with higher SoC delivers more power and the one with lower SoC delivers less power. Hence, SoC balancing and injected/output power equalization can be gradually realized. The exponent n of SoC is employed in the control diagram to regulate the speed of SoC balancing. It is found that with larger exponent n, the balancing speed is higher. MATLAB/simulink model comprised of three ESUs is implemented and the simulation results are shown to verify the proposed approach.	autonomous robot;coefficient;computer data storage;control system;diagram;matlab;simulation;simulink;state of charge	Xiaonan Lu;Kai Sun;Josep M.

A grouping algorithm is proposed which reduces the area decomposition problem to obtaining a basis for the slow subsystem and performing a Gaussian elimination.

The optimization problem is solved by using a built-in solver of the MATLAB software embedded in an iterative-based algorithm. The proposed algorithm is well verified by comparing its generated result with a trustful solution obtained from examining all possibly coordinating combinations of voltage regulating devices and PVs in the simplified Maehongson test system in Thailand. Effectiveness of the algorithm is also illustrated on that test system with a consideration of time-variant load and PV generation. All revealed features exhibit the high ability of applying the proposed method for implementing a closed-loop CVR functionality in distribution systems.	algorithm;anomalous photovoltaic effect;approximation;canonical account;embedded system;global optimization;inverter (logic gate);iterative method;linear least squares (mathematics);load profile;matlab;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;page view;quantum fluctuation;solar inverter;solver	Van Tu Dao;Surachai Chaitusaney;Hanh Thi Nguyet Nguyen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2536782	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;photovoltaic system;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;physical chemistry;ac power;voltage optimisation;statistics;voltage regulation	EDA	63.878497633748204	36.719079261191766	142976

The modular approach is provided by using the triple port active bridge DC-DC converter modules and the cascaded H-Bridge multilevel inverter structures. The modular approach helps in easy scaling up, easy maintenance and better controllability of the available power. The triple port bridge is capable of supplying and receiving power in any of its ports, allowing various control modes. Also the voltage control mode at its output allows for additional grid services. The cascaded H-bridge is a multilevel inverter with higher number of voltage levels, reduced filter size, lower switching frequency, lower dv/dt and EMC issues. The experimental and simulation results presented in this paper ensures that the proposed architecture is suitable for large scale photovoltaic and energy storage grid integration.

This strategy can effectively control influence of inverters on power grid. In order to reduce the circulating current and power oscillation, this paper proposed a pre-synchronization control strategy which adds the pre-synchronization module and virtual inductive to the controller. In this way, phase angle, amplitude and frequency of the host and slave in parallel system tend to be consistent, so the circulation and power oscillation can be suppressed effectively, and the dynamic performance of the system is enhanced.	ac adapter;characteristic impedance;coefficient;control theory;controllers;converter device component;interface device component;inverter (logic gate);inverter device component;large;matlab;output impedance;power inverter;quantitative impedance;radionuclide generators;simulation;simulink;small-signal model;voltage	Bo Liang;Li Yuren;Wei Zequn;Zhu Yuqing;Zhang Wenjing	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216706	grid;control engineering;permanent magnet synchronous generator;engineering;control theory;control theory;electrical impedance;inverter;amplitude;oscillation;automatic frequency control	EDA	65.4218379416902	40.19237203323351	144414

The settings of the droop parameters for distributed generation (DG) units can considerably affect the ability of an IMG to satisfy the required voltage tolerance boundary prescribed in steady-state voltage regulation standards. This paper analyzes the complexity of voltage regulations in droop-controlled IMGs. A new algorithm is proposed to satisfy the voltage regulation requirements of IMGs. The proposed algorithm obviates the need for a centralized secondary controller, where each DG unit updates its own voltage droop parameters, autonomously, via interaction with other DG units, using a low-bandwidth, peer-to-peer communication network. To that end, a distributed constraint satisfaction approach is adopted to formulate the problem of voltage regulation in a multi-agent environment.

Because of some unidirectional devices (diode bridge and anti-run-back diodes), the system is not totally reversible. Some storage and dissipation systems are necessary to store or/and dissipate the returned energy to maintain the DC bus voltage and to increase the energy efficiency. This paper introduces four supervision strategies in two levels to maintain the DC bus voltage and compares these strategies with the help of two criteria: the voltage performance and efficiency. © 2010 IMACS.

All-spin logic (ASL) is among the most promising spintronic logic switches. Previous attempts to model ASL in the linear and diffusive regime either neglect the dynamic characteristics of the transport or do not provide a scalable and robust platform for full micromagnetic simulations and inclusion of other effects like spin Hall effect (SHE) and spin-orbit torque (SOT). In this paper, and based on a finite difference scheme, we propose an improved self-consisting magnetization dynamics/time-dependent carrier transport model that captures the main characteristics of ASL devices.	beyond cmos;computation;finite difference method;network switch;scalability;simulation;spin hall effect;spintronics	Meshal Alawein;Hossein Fariborzi	2016	2016 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures (NANOARCH)	10.1145/2950067.2950075	electronic engineering;spin pumping;nuclear magnetic resonance;condensed matter physics;physics	Arch	57.09188283017764	35.827072245486704	144864

Interest in advanced controllers for normal operation has expanded in recent years, but fault detection and fault tolerant control for wind turbines is a less well-developed area of interest. In this benchmark challenge, we have reworked a previous challenge paper to present a more sophisticated wind turbine model - a modern 5 MW turbine implemented in the FAST software - and updated fault scenarios. These updates enhance the realism of the challenge and will therefore lead to solutions that are significantly more useful to the wind industry. This paper presents the challenge model and the requirements for challenge participants. In addition, it provides additional information about the faults selected for the challenge and their basis in field data.	as-interface;algorithm;benchmark (computing);fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;microwave;requirement;whole earth 'lectronic link	Peter Fogh Odgaard;Kathryn E.

Based on the analysis of the output characteristics of impact-type piezoelectric energy harvester, a new resistive matching impedance strategy was proposed to obtain maximum power. Besides, a low-power oscillator was presented to realize sectionalized frequencies. Finally, experimental results show that the controller for sectionalized matching impedance consumes 9.9% of the harvested power when the input average power is 0.9mW, and only 3.7% when the input average power is 2.1mW. The efficiency of the proposed sectionalized matching impedance energy harvesting circuit is around 76 %, which is increased by 59% and 22% at the strike frequency of 0.5Hz, as compared with the constant resistive matching circuit and with the constant resistive matching circuit having sleep mode, respectively.	characteristic impedance;circuit design;impedance matching;low-power broadcasting;maximum power transfer theorem;piezoelectricity;power management;sleep mode	Nan Chen;Tingcun Wei;Dong Sam Ha	2017	2017 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2017.8001376	control engineering;control theory;wind power;damping factor;energy harvesting;engineering;power management;electrical impedance;circuit design;impedance matching;electronic engineering;vibration	EDA	59.88638398689146	44.91767415274966	145403

54653b0838085bedf70d6b29e2288535e7d21855	finite time current observer based adaptive backstepping control of buck converters		A finite time current observer based adaptive backstepping control strategy is proposed for the output voltage regulation of buck type DC-DC converters. The proposed current observer is designed by utilizing only the output voltage information to reconstruct the inductor current profile while achieving an adaptive control by means of backstepping procedure. This method eliminates the usage of extra sensor involved in sensing the inductor current, thereby reducing the cost of control besides overcoming the problems of measurement noise encountered while sensing. Simulations have been performed on a buck converter using Matlab software under both continuous and discontinuous conduction modes. Further, the usefulness of proposed scheme is also examined by subjecting the buck converter system to sudden changes in load resistance. The results obtained reveal that the proposed observer is successful in not only estimating the nominal inductor current but also estimates the perturbed level of inductor current under load disturbances in finite time. Satisfactorily transient and steady state response in the output voltage are ensured by using the proposed method.	buck converter;control theory;dc-to-dc converter;input impedance;level of measurement;matlab;steady state;voltage regulation	Tousif Khan Nizami;Arghya Chakravarty;Chitralekha Mahanta	2015	2015 Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)	10.1016/j.jfranklin.2018.05.026	control engineering;electronic engineering;buck converter;engineering;control theory	EDA	66.10919628108053	39.05540176893965	145848

The harmonic performance of the inverter is evaluated through weighted voltage total harmonic distortion for different modulation indices. To calculate switching loss, analytical expressions for switching instants are generated by comparing the triangular carrier signal with the equivalent modulating signals corresponding to space vector based modulation schemes and switching instants are obtained in terms of Kapteyn series. The losses are compared analytically for three popular space vector based modulation schemes, namely conventional space vector PWM, 60° bus clamping PWM and 30° bus clamping PWM.	carrier wave;clamping (graphics);inverter device component;oximetry, pulse;pokeweed mitogens;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;sampling (signal processing);total harmonic distortion;voltage;width	M.

0256df5dbf071729f2049bdbb464e6e40e3e52d2	control of modular multilevel converters based on the state-plane analysis and coordinate transformation		Because of its simple modular structure and easy voltage scaling, the modular multilevel converter (MMC) is deemed the most suitable for high-voltage power conversion using relatively low-voltage devices. In most practices, the volume of the capacitors is more than 50% of the total module size. Hence, methods of reducing circulating energy and the size of the capacitor bank have been widely pursued. The state plane analysis offers graphical visualization of the power throughput and circulating energy. It also identifies the cause for each component of the circulating energy. The corresponding coordinate transformation provides a simple equivalent circuit model, leading to the establishment of the two control laws that enable maximum power throughput with minimum circulating energy. In this paper, the state plane analysis and the two control laws are utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of existing control methods. Moreover, based on the two control laws, a method consisting of current injection, common-mode voltage injection, and input voltage control is proposed, which achieves a dramatic capacitor reduction compared to the existing methods.

ac88eec47b5c09fda6d2309eaaa98d38e745efc2	sensor fault resilient operation of permanent magnet synchronous generator based wind energy conversion system		An approach to ensure sensor fault resilient operation of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind energy conversion system (WECS) has been presented in this paper. Sensors measuring WECS quantities such as generator and grid side currents, generator speed and DC link voltage play essential role in reliable and efficient operation of PMSG based WECS. Malfunctioning of such sensors can significantly disrupt the efficient operation of WECS. The proposed approach complements WECS control systems with sliding mode observer (SMO) based fault diagnosis (detection and estimation) and mitigation components to ensure sensor fault resilient operation of the WECS. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated through rigorous simulation studies carried out on a WECS connected to a practical test distribution system, which clearly demonstrates that the proposed approach is capable of nullifying the impact of sensor malfunctioning and ensuring efficient and optimal operation of WECS.	control system;sensor;simulation	S.

f6ca657f4bc84f3dfee0d657e82478a4dbbae207	stability enhancement in multi-machine power systems by fuzzy-based coordinated avr-pss		This paper presents performance of intelligent fuzzy-based coordinated control for Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) and Power System Stabilizer (PSS), to prevent losing synchronism after major sudden faults and to achieve appropriate post-fault voltage level in multi-machine power systems. The AVR and PSS gains can adaptively change to guarantee the power system stability after faults. For change in AVR and PSS gains, at least one significant generator in each area of a multi-area power system is equipped with fuzzy logic unit. The fuzzy logic unit accepts normalized deviations of terminal voltage and phase difference of synchronous generators as inputs and generates the desirable gains for AVR and PSS. The construction of appropriate fuzzy membership functions and rules for best tuning of gains is described. The proposed fuzzy control methodology is applied to 11-bus 4-generator power system test case. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed fuzzy-based coordinated control strategy.	atmel avr;control theory;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;ibm power systems;physical symbol system;simulation;system testing;test case;voltage regulator	Rahmat Khezri;Hassan Bevrani	2015	IJEOE	10.4018/IJEOE.2015040103	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	EDA	66.02811810399308	37.06096644400618	146990

The drive's speed controller includes an augmented proportion-integration (PI) control which increases drive efficiency and enhances overload protection. The augmented PI speed control is simply a traditional PI control with signal paths additively influenced by two new signals. These two new signals force the PI control to not only track the reference speed, but also control the difference between the synchronous speed and rotor speed. The synchronous-to-rotor speed difference is influenced towards an optimal value for increased energy efficiency, and is limited, in the service of overload protection. The system was evaluated in transient simulation using a magnetic saturation motor model. The system tracked randomly generated signals, designed to mimic the time-varying input a driver would provide.

This necessitates a wind energy conversion system WECS to remain connected to the grid in order to maintain power system stability during grid faults. This paper proposes a superconducting fault current limiter control strategy to improve the fault ride-through FRT capability of a doubly-fed induction generator DFIG-based WECS during grid faults. The outstanding aspect of the proposed technique is that it reduces the fault current level at the stator side and suppresses the rotor inrush current during incidents of grid faults. Consequently, the oscillation in the DC-link voltage and the electromagnetic torque of the WECS are reduced to a minimum permissible limit. Therefore, the proposed strategy improves the FRT capability of the WECS. Thus, the WECS remains connected to the grid and contributes necessary power system stability during and after the grid faults. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is studied through a time domain simulation carried out in a MATLAB/Simulink environment.	current limiting;limiter	R. Sitharthan;M.

The described method is based on multivariable-proportional-integral (PI) regulators and provides fast dynamics and a zero steady-state error. Contrary to the well-known conventional PI-based control strategies in RRFs, the presented method provides practically decoupled axes with a superior disturbance rejection capability. Moreover, its implementation is relatively simple and does not impose excessive structural complexity compared to its conventional PI-based competitors. The method is applicable to both single- and three-phase systems and also to anisotropic three-phase systems, e.g., synchronous motors with different direct and quadrature impedances driven by VSCs. Implementing a three-phase test system, the performance of the presented method is experimentally evaluated.	apache axis;control theory;coupling (computer programming);experiment;reference frame (video);rejection sampling;steady state;structural complexity (applied mathematics);synchronization (computer science);voltage source;whole earth 'lectronic link	Behrooz Bahrani;Stephan Kenzelmann;Alfred Rufer	2011	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2010.2070776	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;transfer function	Visualization	66.98647131300817	39.25678837238373	148299

By applying two auxiliary switches and coupled inductors, soft-switching condition is achieved for all semiconductor elements regardless of the power flow direction. Moreover, the presence of coupled inductors provides significant reduction in the converter volume, since all the converter inductors are implemented on a single core. Also, all semiconductor elements benefit from soft-switching condition in full duty cycle range, and thus, high efficiency is achieved for full line voltage range. No extra voltage and current stresses on the main switches and the ease of control are the other properties of the proposed converters. The proposed bidirectional buck and boost converter is fully analyzed for both buck and boost operating modes. The validity of the theoretical analysis is justified using the experimental results of a 240-W 50-100-V prototype converter.	boost converter;duty cycle;emitter-coupled logic;function prototype;network switch;pulse-width modulation;semiconductor	Mohammad Reza Mohammadi;Hosein Farzanehfard	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2148681	equivalent circuit;control engineering;electronic engineering;buck converter;engineering;ćuk converter;control theory;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	64.18798975745648	42.04503579833206	148307

The challenge of the current controller is how to fast and precisely track the current with zero steady-state error. This paper proposes a novel feedback mechanism for the conventional proportional integral controller. It allows the steady-state error suppression with no need of additional complex control algorithms such as the synchronous reference frame transformation. Five alternative implementation methods are comparatively evaluated from the viewpoint of the steady-state and dynamic responses. Further, the theoretical analysis done indicates that the widely used P+Resonant control is just a special case of the proposed control solution. The time-domain simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and experimental results from a TMS320F2812 DSP-based laboratory prototypes are in good agreement, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed generalized method.	algorithm;feedback;inverter (logic gate);matlab;power inverter;reference frame (video);simulation;simulink;steady state;zero suppression	Xiaoqiang Guo;Josep M.

Each of the new topologies proposed is based on a flying capacitor principle and requires only four power switches and/or diodes, one capacitor, and a small filter at the output stage. A simple unipolar sinusoidal pulse width modulation technique is used to modulate the inverter to minimize the switching loss, output current ripple, and the filter requirements. In general, the main advantages of the new inverter topologies are: 1) the negative polarity of the PV is directly connected to the grid, and therefore, no leakage current; 2) reactive power compensation capability; and 3) the output ac voltage peak is equal to the input dc voltage (unlike neutral-point-clamped and derivative topologies, which requires twice the magnitude of the peak ac voltage). A complete description of the operating principle with modulation techniques, design guidelines, and comprehensive comparisons is presented to reveal the properties and limitations of each topology in detail. Finally, experimental results of 1-kVA prototypes are presented to prove the concept and theoretical analysis of the proposed inverter family for practical applications.	charge pump;diode;inverter (logic gate);network switch;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;requirement;ripple effect;spectral leakage	Yam Prasad Siwakoti;Frede Blaabjerg	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2740821	capacitor;control theory;solar micro-inverter;ripple;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;engineering;leakage (electronics);ac power;photovoltaic system;pulse-width modulation	EDA	64.403322303307	41.959865294364086	148671

These materials constitute unique systems combining collective properties of solids with structural diversity of molecules which show distinctive photoelectrochemical properties. Theoretical models of electronic interactions between molecules and semiconductor surfaces have been presented. Additionally, the review summarises the idea of small particles that can work as electronic devices. These devices are able to sense the environment and communicate with other devices and with the user. The devices are based on surface modified wide-band gap semiconductors and the photoelectrochemical photocurrent switching effect. This effect has created a new platform for novel chemical switches, logic gates and other information processing devices. The mechanism of photocurrent switching is discussed with respect to the type of surface complex-support interaction. Photoelectrochemical properties of multicomponent photoelectrodes based on wide band gap nanocrystaline semiconductors modified with various molecules were investigated. The review presents some examples of hybrid materials working as logic devices, including reconfigurable ones and simple arithmetic systems together with mechanistic problems related to nanoscale information processing.

The supply pins, their numbers and their respective positions, can have an influence on the robustness of circuits on ESD (ElectroStatic Discharges) and FTB (Fast Transient burst) tests. For cost reasons, this number of supply pins tends to be reduced for the benefit of I/O in order to increase the functionalities of the microcontrollers. The objective of this work is to study the impact of the number and the placement of these supply pins on the FTB tests. A quick explanation of the different results is also proposed to conclude this study.	input/output;integrated circuit;microcontroller;power supply	Yann Bacher;Cesar Gori;Nicolas Froidevaux;Philippe Dupre;Henri Braquet;Gilles Jacquemod	2015	2015 IEEE 6th Latin American Symposium on Circuits & Systems (LASCAS)	10.1109/LASCAS.2015.7250418	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	63.59502805786589	44.01273153830206	149505

The ballast intent is to efficiently operate the maximum number of TL5 lamps with different power ratings at nominal power, using a resonant variable inductance, provided by a magnetic regulator, while maintaining the switching frequency constant. A microcontroller and additional digital circuitry are used to command a dc-dc buck converter to supply the necessary dc control current to the magnetic regulator and to regulate the switching frequency of the half-bridge resonant inverter that supplies the lamp. The selection of the resonant capacitance is done in order to comply with the SoS limits established for each lamp.

This can be modeled as cyber physical power systems (CPPS) to analyze connections and interactions, and security is one of the key factors to find the inner unmanaged vulnerabilities. In some cases, voltage source inverters (VSI) with pulse width modulation (PWM) are sensitive to initial conditions, and this is a typical chaotic state. In this paper, we present a CPPS model with the improved chaos prediction and suppression methods to enhance the security with the abilities to avoid and eliminate chaos. The main process is “prediction–quantization–control”. First, an improved maximum velocity criterion method is used to predict the possibility of chaos in the parameter space of CPPS. Second, when a possibility of chaos is predicted, a sinusoidal wave frequency modulation is used to suppress chaos. To analyze the connections of the inner entities’ transmission, a security coefficient is introduced to obtain hazard perception and to express measurements quantitatively. Third, it has proposed a chaotic control algorithm based on a fuzzy model with closed-loop dynamic mechanism to solve the security coefficient effectively. The experiments prove the predicted result has a margin of error of plus or minus 10%, and the sinusoidal wave frequency modulation can avoid chaos on CPPS. Also, the results show that security coefficient increases by 13.89%, which means it is useful with sensitive parameters and other related disturbances. Overall, this CPPS model can eliminate potential chaos phenomena caused by inversion processes, and it can be used into smart grids to improve the security effectively.	ibm power systems;zero suppression	Hongjun Dai;Shulin Zhao;Kang Chen	2017	J.

The proposed topology has a CSI at one side of the stator winding and a capacitor-fed voltage source inverter (VSI) at the other end. The CSI feeds only active power to the motor and the VSI is controlled to provide the reactive power required for operation of the CSI at leading power factor, thereby facilitating natural commutation of SCRs. This topology does not require any interfacing inductor or separate dc voltage source for the VSI. The control scheme enables operation of the motor even at very low speeds without problems such as commutation failure. The experimental verification of the proposed scheme is carried out on an induction motor with open-end stator windings. A digital signal processor (TMS320F28335) is used for implementation of the control algorithm.	algorithm;current source;digital signal processor;power inverter;signal processing;silicon controlled rectifier;voltage source	Richu Sebastian C;P.

This representation may be used to investigate the impact of such changes on properties such as characteristic frequencies. The general problem area is the modelling of systems, whose structure is not fixed but evolves during the system life-cycle. The specific problem we are addressing is the study of effect of changing the topology of an electrical network that is changing individual elements of the network into elements of different type and value, augmenting / or eliminating parts of the network and developing a framework that allows the study of the effect of such transformations on the natural frequencies. This problem is a special case of the more general network redesign problem. We use the Impedance-Admittance models and we establish a representation of the different types of transformations on such models. The representation of the structural transformations is given in terms of the companion pencil that preserves the natural topologies of the RLC network.	rlc circuit	Nicos Karcanias;John Leventides;Maria Livada	2014	2014 6th International Symposium on Communications, Control and Signal Processing (ISCCSP)	10.1109/ISCCSP.2014.6877902	topology;control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;network simulation;extension topology;logical topology	Arch	67.75826535899586	43.87751769235892	151008
3c17d0205cfe1c3e8a08b5babc057b16179452e1	seismic active control under uncertain ground excitation: an efficient cognitive adaptive optimization approach		Several disastrous incidents from earthquakes have been recorded in recent and past human life. Despite the improvements in structural stability and vibration resilience, heavy structures still suffer from construction cost problems which usually hinder their potential investment. Vibration active control techniques present a great potential for reducing the anti-seismic protection costs. So far, existing building vibration control strategies are unable to provide a reliable operation able to reject the evolving uncertain non-linear dynamics that grow as the amplitude of the exogenous ground disturbance increases. This paper applies a vibration active control optimization methodology in applications involving large structures. A simulation model of the structure is used to optimize, in an offline manner, the total structure displacement metric. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the adopted approach namely Automated Fine-Tuning Cognitive Adaptive Optimization (AFT-CAO) - can effectively deal with seismic dynamics both in low and large seismic cases. AFT-CAO was proven capable to provide efficient control decisions that well-established LQR cannot outperform. The structure model used for the simulation tests consists by three vertically interconnected masses, each connected to an external lateral spring with an adjustable applied restoring force.	adaptive optimization;automatic frequency control;displacement mapping;dynamical system;experiment;lateral thinking;mathematical optimization;online and offline;program optimization;simulation	Iakovos T.

Accordingly, in recent years the awareness of people about EVs has increased significantly. In addition to the well-known advantages such as cleaner environment, less oil-dependency, cheaper fuel, more silent operation etc., through smartgrids, EVs offer a unique benefit called vehicle to grid (V2G) technology. In order to define the role of EVs as distributed storage devices, simulation works undertaken in Paladin Designbase 4.0 are presented in this paper. It is shown that through V2G, EVs can support better operation of smartgrids in terms of reliability and storage. In order to achieve these, the components of smartgrids shall communicate and share information via communication lines. Having a universal communication standard is vital for implementing the plug-and-play concept in smartgrids. IEC 61850, the substation automation standard, could be used for this purpose. However, it is insufficient and must be expanded to cover missing links. In this paper, authors propose an extension to the IEC 61850-7-420 standard by defining the information model for controlling the charging and discharging of EVs.	clustered file system;discharger;extended validation certificate;information model;plug and play;simulation;traction substation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Taha Selim Ustun;Cagil R.

Important concerns for subthreshold logic at present are increased sensitivity to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations. Analysis is done addressing the nano-scale complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) device and circuit subthreshold behaviour to PVT variations, showing their poor performance and robustness in terms of power, delay, energy consumption and so on. Next part of the study addresses how double gate (DG) fin-shaped field-effect transistors (FinFETs) are better candidates for subthreshold logic in comparison to equivalent bulk CMOS devices in terms of robustness. It is observed that DGFinFETs have almost 81% better power performance characteristics than equivalent bulk CMOS option for subthreshold operation. Among the various DGFinFET device options, 3TDG (tied gate DG) device option has better (approximately 77%) energy delay product (EDP) characteristics than 4TDG (independent gate DG) device option for subthreshold operation. Comparative studies show the suitability of symmetric, asymmetric oxide features in combination with tied and independent gate options for subthreshold operation, showing better EDP characteristics of 3TSDG device option and better robustness of 4TSDG device option.	cmos;gnu nano;semiconductor;transistor	Ramesh Vaddi;Sudeb Dasgupta;R.

As well as, the doubly fed asynchronous machine based VSD suits for different variable speed applications due to its effective controllability with partial rated power converters. To improve the performance of the doubly fed system in the aspect of cost effective energy saving, a fuzzy logic controller based switching strategy is introduced in this paper. The proposed energy optimal fuzzy switching strategy overcomes the traditional model based control and it is flexible to adopt in any existing doubly fed VSD without any extensive modification.

In this paper a single-phase hybrid multilevel inverter based on cascading full bridge and half bridge cells is introduced. Moreover the associated switching technique with multicarrier PWM is designed to generate five-level voltage at the output. As well, the designed switching technique allows the capacitors of the half bridge cell to have balanced voltage despite load changes. Furthermore, this study is extended to more cells using unequal DC sources to produce more voltage levels. Simulations have been performed on two and three cells to demonstrate the efficiency of the presented cascaded inverter with equal and unequal DC sources and switching technique.	computer simulation;inverter (logic gate);network switch;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;waveform	Hani Vahedi;Kamal Al-Haddad;Philippe-Alexandre Labbe;Salem Rahmani	2014	2014 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2014.6864951	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory	Arch	64.04636670096492	41.25888468684443	151810

Such terminal failures could be reproduced by inserting charged cards which thus act as ESD/EMI sources. In this work, the cards’ discharge pulses are characterised with sub-nanosecond temporal resolution in a configuration very similar to the one in the field. From the exact pulse forms effective equivalent circuits are extracted, which show a clear correlation to the failure generation capability of the cards. Especially the influence of an absent RF antenna and the missing generation of terminal failures for a certain DI-card can be seen electrically by a lower effective card capacity. The presented test and extraction method is not only able to classify the failure generation capability of chip cards but could also lead to a future ‘‘charged card model’’ (CCM) for testing the ESD susceptibility of terminals. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome the control problems involving coordination control schemes of multi-BESSs in real-time as well as optimized operation strategies of dc grids in long-term, this paper presents the adaptive coordinated droop control of multi-distributed battery energy storage systems in DC distribution grids. The adaptive coordinated droop is proposed to force real-time state of charge of BESS to track on the optimized scheduled state of charge (SOC) in long-term. Furthermore, in this approach, the energy storage units (ESUs) with higher SOC dispatch more power, while the ones with lower SOC dispatch less power. The SOC difference among ESUs exponentially reduces and finally the exchange power is equally shared between the distributed ESUs. Meanwhile, the exchange power share speed can be adjusted by changing the exponent of SOC in the adaptive coordinated droop control.	dynamic dispatch;real-time clock;state of charge	Duc Nguyen Huu;Hung Truong Nam	2015	IEEE EUROCON 2015 - International Conference on Computer as a Tool (EUROCON)	10.1109/EUROCON.2015.7313703	system on a chip;control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;battery	Robotics	63.57152664770209	36.39162869446972	152258

A new wireless power transfer technique using optimal resonant load transformation is presented with significantly improved efficiency at the cost of only one additional chip inductor component. The optimal resonant load condition for the maximized power transfer efficiency is explained. The proposed technique is implemented using printed spiral coils with discrete surface mount components at 13.56 MHz power carrier frequency. With an implantable coil having an area of 25 mm × 10 mm and a thickness of 0.5 mm, the power transfer efficiency of 58% is achieved in the tissue environment at 10-mm distance from the external coil. Compared to previous works, the power efficiency is much higher and the structure is compact with planar integration, easy to tune, and suitable for batch production, as well as biocompatible owing to no incorporation of ferromagnetic core.	carrier frequency;contactless smart card;inductive coupling;mobile device;near field communication;performance per watt;performance tuning;printing;resonance;spiral model;surface-mount technology;thickness (graph theory);transmitter	Rui-Feng Xue;Kuang-Wei Cheng;Minkyu Je	2013	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2012.2209297	control engineering;power module;electronic engineering;resonant inductive coupling;power factor;engineering;electrical engineering;switched-mode power supply	Visualization	58.136533497806305	43.56412873567761	152387

The output voltage harmonics are dependent on the converter firing delay angles and, consequently, on the specific power locus followed by the ac/dc converter. This power locus ensures minimum fifth and seventh harmonics (total rms) in the input current which provides minimum input current total harmonic distortion when the reactive power is less than 0.5 p.u. The series APF is connected between the load and the converter output via a magnetic amplifier to eliminate the dc current from the APF inverter, thus reducing inverter losses. Voltage harmonic compensation using a series APF, with and without a magnetic amplifier, is examined with both resistive and inductive loads. The simulation results for compensating a 3.3-kV MV 12-pulse converter system are experimentally verified using a scaled prototype 12-pulse converter with a series APF.	australian privacy foundation;current source;experiment;isolation transformer;locus;magnetic amplifier;network switch;power inverter;prototype;simulation;thyristor;total harmonic distortion;voltage source	Mostafa S.

Variation of the deceleration photocell resistance varies the frequency of an oscillator circuit to alternately flash a pair of warning lights at a frequency dependent on the rate of deceleration of the vehicle. The acceleration photocell must receive maximum illumination (a threshold value) to actuate a light for warning of a minimum rate of acceleration of the vehicle. A manual switch allows a high flash rate of alternate warning lights to be controlled by the operator of the vehicle. An audio generator produces a continuous tone for acceleration and an interrupted tone for deceleration, the frequency of interruption corresponding to the flash rate of the deceleration warning lights. The system is an aid in preventing rear end collisions and will save gasoline if properly used.

5abfa135af676cbcbe0a183c994aa9c5a04ad464	field orientation based on current amplitude and phase angle control for wireless power transfer		The low coupling coefficient between the transmitter and receiver is the major constraint of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system. Although some approaches, such as increasing the quality factor and achieving precise impedance matching, can reduce the adverse impacts of the low coupling coefficient and improve the system performance, high leakage magnetic flux between the transmitter and receiver remains a problem. With the increase in transfer distance and the misalignment between the transmitter and receiver, the increasing leakage magnetic flux of nondirectional fields degrades the WPT system performance. This paper proposes an active field orientation method to shape the magnetic flux so as to minimize the leakage flux. The amplitude and phase angle of the magnetizing current are controlled, and a coil structure for minimizing the coupling among the transmitters and generating a three-dimensional magnetic field is proposed. This method realizes three-dimension full-range field orientation with adjustable magnitude and direction of B-field at an arbitrary point, and as a result the B-field is concentrated with reduced leakage magnetic flux. The proposed field orientation shaping technique is verified by theoretical analysis, simulation, and experimental results.	coefficient;full-range speaker;impedance matching;noise shaping;simulation;spectral leakage;transformer;transmitter	Qi Zhu;Mei Su;Yao Sun;Weiyi Tang;Aiguo Patrick Hu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2767556	control theory;electromagnetic coil;amplitude;leakage (electronics);inductance;engineering;impedance matching;magnetic flux leakage;wireless power transfer;electronic engineering;magnetic flux	EDA	63.85129550938869	45.30948465946842	153151

In this paper, the principle of neutral point clamped three-level (NPC3L) inverter is elaborated firstly, and a fourth-order RC equivalent circuit of IGBT is derived, on which basis the power-loss model of IGBT and the optimized maternal power-loss thermal model, using an optimized power-loss algorithm, are established. Secondly, in accordance with the optimized maternal power-loss thermal model, the generic formulas of power-loss calculation are deduced to calculate the power-loss modification values of NPC3L and soft switching three-level (S3L) inverters, which will be the thermal sources during thermal analysis for maternal power-loss thermal models. Finally, the experiment conducted on the 2.1 MW experimental platform shows that S3L inverter has the same excellent output characteristics with NPC3L inverter, reduces the power loss significantly by 213 W in each half-bridge, and decreases the temperature by 10°C, coinciding with the theoretical calculation, which verifies the accuracy of optimized power-loss algorithm and the effectiveness of the improvement.

Based on this method, we present a multilayer thin film design of power transfer cells for medical applications. Consisting of a tape coil in the exterior layer and strips in the interior layer separated by an insulation layer, these cells have an equivalent structure of multiple inductors and capacitors, forming several resonant frequencies. In order to verify these frequencies, a mesh current analysis is performed computationally. Our experiments show that this analysis is accurate.

560edddfd95d28b5574facb5dc475a4ca429b3f1	analysis of strategy for achieving zero-current switching in full-bridge converters		Conventional zero-voltage and zero-current-switching (ZVZCS) full-bridge converters are widely used because they can realize zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for the leading leg and zero-current switching (ZCS) for the lagging leg. However, the large turn-off loss of the leading leg is still unacceptable in high-voltage high-power applications where insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) with current tailing are employed. Hence, it is preferable to achieve ZCS for all IGBTs of full-bridge converters. This paper analyzes the ZCS conditions for pulsewidth modulated (PWM) full-bridge converters and proposes a general strategy for achieving ZCS for main switches, including the control strategy and design method of the topology. Based on this theory, a novel ZCS PWM full-bridge converter with simple auxiliary circuit is derived and tested. It can achieve ZCS not only for the main switches of full-bridge converter, but for the auxiliary switch as well, and obtain high efficiency. The operation principle of the proposed ZCS PWM full-bridge converter and the design procedure are presented. The experimental results of a 600 V/2.5 kW prototype are also included to verify the theoretical analysis.	control theory;h bridge;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;network switch;prototype;pulse-width modulation;switched-mode power supply	Liangcai Shu;Wu Chen;Dajun Ma;Guangfu Ning	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2779443	control engineering;engineering;bipolar junction transistor;converters;pulse-width modulation;inductor	EDA	65.02910024456803	41.58067177537576	153557

This increasing power consumption has resulted in increasing dc voltage levels, to reduce energy losses and the size of wiring, as a result of the reduced current levels. However, traditional protections such as circuit breakers are not adequate for the protection of the new systems in high dc voltage, and consequently, it is necessary to introduce new technologies in the field of protection devices. One of these is the solid-state power controller (SSPC), which combines the functions of connecting loads to the bus bars and protecting electrical installations against overload and short circuits. On the other hand, within these electrical systems, the connection of certain loads, such as highly capacitive ones (dc-dc, inverters, etc.), implies the need to develop new control strategies to improve the connection process by SSPCs. This paper presents and analyzes a new advanced control strategy that optimizes the performance during the connection of highly capacitive loads using SSPCs.	advanced process control;control theory;inverter (logic gate);solid-state drive;wiring	Daniel Izquierdo;Andrés Barrado;Cristina Fernandez;Marina Sanz;Antonio Lázaro	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2012.2219832	fuse;control engineering;circuit total limitation;power module;electronic engineering;distribution board;power factor;power control;engineering;electrical engineering;circuit breaker;electric power system;power-system protection;power engineering;volt-ampere;electrical load	EDA	63.08809845429101	39.65153023873143	153773

Operation of a battery storage system is coordinated with a supercapacitor with a view to improve the life span of the battery. In this regard, the battery storage system is connected to the load side of the system while the supercapacitor is connected to DC bus of the back-to-back converter of the DFIG. The operation of the hybrid energy storage system is coordinated through the implementation of an energy management algorithm (EMA) which is developed with a view to reduce the depth of discharge (DOD) and ripple content of the battery current. The dump load is connected to the load side of the system which utilises the power in situations that can not be handled via energy storage system. In addition, a novel coordination method has been proposed to coordinate the power flows among all system components with a view to regulate the power flow and thereby ensuring the robust voltage and frequency control on the load side and capturing the maximum power from wind.	algorithm;computer data storage;depth of discharge;discharger;maximum power transfer theorem;power management;power supply;ripple effect	Nishad Mendis;Kashem M.

These models typically describe only intra-cycle effects, that is, those manifesting within a single charge/discharge cycle of a battery. However, basic battery dynamics, during a single discharge, cannot provide a true estimate of the actual lifetime of the battery, e.g., how its usability decreases due to long-term and irreversible effects, such as the fading of capacity due to aging or to repeated cycling. While some solutions in the literature provide answers to this problem by proposing suitable models for these effects, they do not provide solutions for how to incorporate them into a generic model template. In this work we propose a method to include inter-cycle battery effects into a reference model template in an automated way, and using solely data reported by battery manufacturers. Flexibility and accuracy of the proposed strategy are demonstrated by modeling a commercial lithium iron phosphate battery, whose datasheet provides long-term capacity fading information.	capacity loss;charge cycle;datasheet;discharger;experiment;extrapolation;population;reference model;usability	Massimo Petricca;Donghwa Shin;Alberto Bocca;Alberto Macii;Enrico Macii;Massimo Poncino	2014	2014 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)	10.1109/ICCD.2014.6974723	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;forensic engineering	Vision	57.75643146377678	38.1651831854503	153936

To achieve high voltage gain without large duty cycle operation, combination of coupled inductor and switched capacitor voltage doubler cells are used. By incorporating active clamp circuit, voltage spike due to the leakage inductance of the coupled inductor is alleviated and zero-voltage switching turn on of the main and auxiliary switch is obtained. Due to the use of MOSFETs of low voltage rating and soft turn on of the switches, conduction loss and switching losses are reduced. This improves the efficiency and power density of the converter. The proposed converter can achieve high voltage gain with reduced voltage stress on MOSFET switches and output diodes. Design and analysis of the proposed converter is carried out, and finally, a 500-W experimental prototype is built to verify theoretical analysis.	clamper (electronics);clamping (graphics);dc-to-dc converter;diode;duty cycle;emitter-coupled logic;network switch;prototype;rectifier;spectral leakage;switched capacitor;switched-mode power supply;transformer;voltage doubler;voltage spike	Shelas Sathyan;Hiralal Muralidhar Suryawanshi;Makarand Sudhakar Ballal;Amardeep Balasaheb Shitole	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2448515	forward converter;voltage doubler;control engineering;voltage regulator;electronic engineering;charge pump;capacitor;flyback converter;voltage droop;network switch;buck converter;inductance;engineering;78xx;electrical engineering;ćuk converter;voltage divider;switched-mode power supply;stress;low-dropout regulator;inductor;voltage multiplier;dropout voltage;voltage optimisation;pre-charge;overdrive voltage;physics;boost converter;negative impedance converter;voltage regulation	EDA	63.166738746171234	42.84483613847194	154053

The conventional high-voltage ESD devices are unsuitable for new high-voltage applications due to their low holding voltage, low ESD robustness, and their large size. In this study, a stacking structure with a high holding voltage and a high failure current is proposed and successfully verified using a 0.35um BCD (Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS) process in order to achieve the desired holding voltage and an acceptable failure current. The experiment results show that the holding voltage of the stacking structure can exceed the operational voltage found in high-voltage applications. In addition, the stacking structure can provide a high ESD robustness.

86d3b05f737c5b3503b9c9a028da0f769346e2ad	unified digital modulation techniques for dc–dc converters over a wide operating range: implementation, modeling, and design guidelines		It is essential to retain improved efficiency in a dc–dc converter over a wide load current range to extend the battery-life in portable devices. This requires a multi-mode controller, consisting of pulse-width-modulation (PWM) and pulse-frequency-modulation (PFM) schemes. However, existing approaches attempt to integrate structurally different controllers; thus it is difficult to achieve a seamless controller transition. While a digital platform offers controller configurations, it remains difficult to identify a suitable digital PWM/PFM technique and decide on its sampling mechanism to achieve stable behavior. This paper proposes a unified digital PWM/PFM scheme which shares a common digital PWM (DPWM) block and has the provisions for online controller configuration and automatic (switching) frequency adaptation. The proposed scheme retains improved efficiency over a wide operating range and inherently achieves seamless controller transitions. Further, a unified discrete-time framework is proposed for the analysis and design of the proposed multi-mode controller. Buck and boost converter prototypes are tested and the proposed controller is implemented using a field-programmable-gate-array device.	algorithmic inference;boost converter;experiment;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;flyback;load management;personal digital assistant;pulse-width modulation;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);seamless3d	Bipin Chandra Mandi;Santanu Kapat;Amit Patra	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2017.2753539	modulation;electronic engineering;switching frequency;capacitor;mathematics;control theory;boost converter;converters;control engineering;pulse-width modulation	EDA	61.62655080057632	44.88939954278417	155141

In this case, the multimode modulation strategy is usually adopted. Based on the analysis of a modified 24-sector space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) technique, several synchronous modulation strategies with different pulse numbers are proposed in this paper, which can be applied to the two-level six-phase voltage-inverter-fed asymmetrical dual-stator induction machines. By comparing the harmonic performance of the synchronized modulations, the authors present a set of multimode SVPWM strategy, which is suitable for the high-power traction drive systems under low switching frequency. At the same time, the switching strategy for transitions between different modulation modes is proposed as well. Simulation and experimental results verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed synchronized modulation strategies and the switching strategy between different modulation modes.	clock rate;computer cooling;phase-locked loop;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;simulation;synchronization (computer science);traction teampage	Chenchen Wang;Kun Wang;Xiaojie You	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2585459	control engineering;synchronization;electronic engineering;pulse-frequency modulation;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;engineering;control theory	EDA	65.1510104049519	39.98081965968623	155453

The use of this kind of systems can be expanded for several applications, for example in implantable devices inside the human body where it is impossible to use wires. Furthermore, they enable measurements in harsh or hermetic environments, such as under extreme heat, cold, humidity or corrosive conditions. The use of batteries as a power supply for these devices represents one solution, but the size, and sometimes the cost and unwanted maintenance burdens of replacement are important drawbacks. In this paper passive and self-powered autonomous sensors for harsh or hermetical environments without batteries are discussed. Their general architectures are presented. Sensing strategies, communication techniques and power management are analyzed. Then, general building blocks of an autonomous sensor are presented and the design guidelines that such a system must follow are given. Furthermore, this paper reports different proposed applications of autonomous sensors applied in harsh or hermetic environments: two examples of passive autonomous sensors that use telemetric communication are proposed, the first one for humidity measurements and the second for high temperatures. Other examples of self-powered autonomous sensors that use a power harvesting system from electromagnetic fields are proposed for temperature measurements and for airflow speeds.	architecture as topic;autonomous car;autonomous robot;corrosives;electromagnetic phenomena;exposure to humidity;implants;power (psychology);power management;power supply;report;sensor (device)	Emilio Sardini;Mauro Serpelloni	2009		10.3390/s90200943	embedded system;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;nanotechnology;energy harvesting	Robotics	57.89308950372315	43.86132113707258	155992
02dd9a0a5c4beedfde38615b411e8691e59b9858	acoustic aspects of dry-type air-core reactors - specification, design, testing, field measurements		The demand for dry-type air-core reactors (henceforth, referred to as “reactor(s)”) is growing because of the increasing use of power electronics in transmission and distribution grids and because of the implications of dispersed energy generation. For reactors used in power electronic grid applications such as High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) and Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) applications, the content of the harmonic currents is significant. For other applications such as Filter Reactors, Detuning Reactors and Reactors for Mechanically Switched Capacitors with Damping Network (MSCDN), the harmonic currents can also be significant. This paper presents the correct method for specifying these harmonic currents and the possible consequences of specifying them incorrectly. Additionally, this paper discusses new and innovative solutions for mitigating the sound emission from reactors. For the purpose of sound planning, measuring the sound level of a reactor is equally as important as designing the reactor. Therefore, the last two sections of this paper will present and discuss the modern methods for measuring the sound level of reactors in the test lab and in the substation.	acoustic cryptanalysis	Peter Dopplmair;Peter Griebler;Helmut Reisinger;Sigfrido Salubro	2017	Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik	10.1007/s00502-016-0452-4	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	SE	62.42914948700818	39.216226344957995	156218

To maintain a specific frequency in the islanded mode as an important requirement, the control of DGs' output and charge action of DSs are used in supply surplus conditions and load-shedding and discharge action of DSs are used in supply shortage conditions. Recently, multiagent systems for autonomous microgrid operation have been studied. Especially, load-shedding, which is intentional reduction of electricity use, is a critical problem in islanded microgrid operation based on the multiagent system. Therefore, effective schemes for load-shedding are required. Meanwhile, the bankruptcy problem deals with dividing short resources among multiple agents. In order to solve the bankruptcy problem, division rules, such as the constrained equal awards rule (CEA), the constrained equal losses rule (CEL), and the random arrival rule (RA), have been used. In this paper, we approach load-shedding as a bankruptcy problem. We compare load-shedding results by above-mentioned rules in islanded microgrid operation based on wireless sensor network (WSN) as the communication link for an agent's interactions.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;awards;biological science disciplines;dss brand of docusate sodium;discharger;fairness measure;game theory;interaction;microgrid;multi-agent system;osteoporosis, postmenopausal;rule (guideline);rule 184;rule 90;traffic collision avoidance system;virtual 8086 mode	Hak-Man Kim;Tetsuo Kinoshita;Yujin Lim;Tai-Hoon Kim	2010		10.3390/s101008888	computer simulation;control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;electricity;physical chemistry;physics	AI	63.239661228296065	35.842563562536476	156313

The proposed indexes are used to check whether the time series from dynamic simulations will converge to a safe and stable equilibrium point and to measure the quality of the stability. They can also be used to classify simulations according to the severity of the contingency applied. The Integral Square Generator Angle (ISGA) index is used as a dynamic index to assess the validity of the proposed indexes and their use for classification of timedomain simulations. An illustrative example using the Klein-Rogers-Kundur's two-area system is presented and then the static indexes are validated trough several nonlinear simulations using the KTH-Nordic32 system.	computation;converge;instability;nonlinear system;simulation;system dynamics;system time;time series;type system	Felix Rafael Segundo Sevilla;Luigi Vanfretti	2015	2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2015.7131846	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	HPC	67.84668040906648	37.20569549406031	156415

Power is needed as well as telecommunications are in our society today. Power head lines are parallel or crossed with telecommunication ones, so influences could be electric, magnetic or even resistive ones. All these interferences, individual and together, could cause injuries to telecommunication human operators or great damages on the IT equipment. This paper presents first a computational method used for a better overview on this subject, by assessing the values of the capacitive current, capacitive voltage, longitudinal induced voltage, resistive voltage, psofometric voltage. The architecture of the proposed system, both hardware and software, is briefly described after, as well as a teaching methodology proposed in order to present all these aspects to students or interested personnel.

The difficulty in the practical implementation of those computers is to build a microscopic quantum system that can be controlled at a larger macroscopic scale. Here I show that vertical lines of donor atoms embedded in an appropriate Zinc Oxide semiconductor structure can constitute artificial molecules that are as many copy of the same quantum computer. In this scalable architecture, each unit of information is encoded onto the electronic spin of a donor. Contrary to most existing practical proposals, here the logical operations only require a global control of the spins by electromagnetic pulses. Ensemble measurements simplify the readout. With appropriate improvement of its growth and doping methods, Zinc Oxide could be a good semiconductor for the next generation of computers.	computer;quantum computing;semiconductor	Jerome Tribollet	2005	Quantum Information & Computation		quantum simulator;quantum information;quantum cellular automaton;theoretical computer science;quantum network;loss–divincenzo quantum computer;open quantum system;zinc;nanotechnology;quantum sensor;quantum computer;quantum imaging;quantum process;physics;quantum mechanics	Theory	56.88946323960688	34.39856398007836	157010
58b8fee218763e8440a1b6a7283bb071b373bd8f	analyzing cascading failures in power grids under the ac and dc power flow models		In this paper, we study cascading failures in power grids under the nonlinear AC and linearized DC power flow models. We numerically compare the evolution of cascades after single line failures under the two flow models in four test networks. The cascade simulations demonstrate that the assumptions underlying the DC model (e.g., ignoring power losses, reactive power flows, and voltage magnitude variations) can lead to inaccurate and overly optimistic cascade predictions. Particularly, in large networks the DC model tends to overestimate the yield (the ratio of the demand supplied at the end of the cascade to the initial demand). Hence, using the DC model for cascade prediction may result in a misrepresentation of the gravity of a cascade.	cascading failure;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;simulation	Hale Cetinay;Saleh Soltan;Fernando A.

When assembled in packs, application of such batteries takes the form of energy storage systems in a variety of configurations, such as a microgrid, which play a key-enabling role in future energy solutions by integrating distributed renewable energy sources and storage systems. In the interest of using batteries more effectively, their behavior under various operating conditions must be understood. This paper describes a framework for estimating the terminal voltage of a lead-acid battery at different working temperatures using feed forward and recurrent neural network techniques for use in large-scale microgrid applications. The methodology is developed for Li-ion batteries and then extended to lead-acid batteries, where simulation results are compared against extensive laboratory tests performed at varied conditions found in photovoltaic and electric vehicle charging applications. Utilization of the resulting energy storage system model is illustrated in a large-scale simulation for a microgrid application.	algorithm;artificial neural network;computer data storage;estimation theory;experiment;feed forward (control);microgrid;random neural network;rechargeable battery;recurrent neural network;self-replicating machine;simulation;stationary process;system configuration;test data	Moinak Pyne;Stephen Yurkovich	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2016.7587987	electronic engineering;simulation;engineering;electrical engineering	Embedded	62.06570910463875	35.46818639388975	157378

Distribution systems are, indeed, experiencing significant changes in terms of operation philosophies that are often based on optimal control strategies relying on the computation of linearized dependencies between controlled (e.g., voltages, frequency in case of islanding operation) and control variables (e.g., power injections, transformers tap positions). As the implementation of these strategies in real-time controllers imposes stringent time constraints, the derivation of analytical dependency between controlled and control variables becomes a non-trivial task to be solved. With reference to optimal voltage and power flow controls, this paper aims at providing an analytical derivation of node voltages and line currents as a function of the nodal power injections and transformers tap-changers positions. Compared to other approaches presented in the literature, the one proposed here is based on the use of the [Y] compound matrix of a generic multi-phase radial unbalanced network. In order to estimate the computational benefits of the proposed approach, the relevant improvements are also quantified versus traditional methods. The validation of the proposed method is carried out by using both IEEE 13 and 34 nodes test feeders. The paper finally shows the use of the proposed method for the problem of optimal voltage control applied to the IEEE 34 node test feeder.	analytical engine;apollonian network;automated planning and scheduling;centralized computing;coefficient;computation;ibm power systems;jacobian matrix and determinant;numerical analysis;optimal control;radial (radio);real-time clock;real-time locating system;slack variable;time complexity;transformers;unbalanced circuit;unbalanced line;while	Konstantina Christakou;Jean-Yves Le Boudec;Mario Paolone;Dan-Cristian Tomozei	2013	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2012.2221751	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;smart grid	Embedded	64.48783878493136	36.41744555656456	157453

On one hand, the rectifier, which is designed to operate in continuous-conduction mode (CCM) at full power, operates at reduced load, discontinuous-conduction mode (DCM) occurs in a zone which is close to the crossover of the line voltage. On the other hand, with the reduced input inductance, the DCM mode occurs even when the rectifiers operate at full power. In this paper, the digitized feedfoward compensation method is proposed for the rectifier to reduce the impact of the switch between DCM and CCM. The theoretical analysis of the proposed method is deduced, furthermore, the control design strategy is given. The experimental results are obtained by using a digitally controlled VIENNA rectifier, which validated the proposed compensation method.	control engineering;coupling (computer programming);dicom;digital signal processor;duty cycle;feedforward neural network;mathematical model;multi-chip module;powerbuilder foundation classes;prototype;total harmonic distortion;vienna rectifier;virtual 8086 mode	Lijun Hang;Ming Zhang;Leon M.

This transmitter provides a swing level control to support the diagnostic mode and improve the signal integrity in the absence of the destination termination. By using the variable parallel termination, the proposed transmitter maintains the constant output impedance of the source termination while the swing level is controlled. Also, the series termination using an external resistor is used to reduce the impedance mismatch effect due to the parasitic components of the capacitor and inductor. To verify the proposed transmitter, the voltage-mode driver, which provides eight swing levels with the constant output impedance of about 50 Q, was implemented using a 70 nm 1-poly 3-metal DRAM process with a 1.5 V supply. The jitter reduction of 54% was measured with the swing level controlled voltage-mode driver in the absence of the destination termination at 1.6-Gb/s.	single-ended signaling;transmitter	Young-Chan Jang	2010	IEICE Transactions		resistor;embedded system;transmitter;electronic engineering;dynamic random-access memory;capacitor;jitter;non-volatile memory;signal integrity;engineering;electrical engineering;integrated circuit;single-ended signaling;output impedance;inductor	Visualization	62.635936272312804	44.1973343576676	157948

These characteristics help reduce diode loss and remove dissipative snubber circuitry. In addition, this structure has the additional advantage of output inductor size due to the reduction of voltage variation applied to the inductor. The feasibility of the proposed charger is verified with a 6.6-kW prototype implemented by a design procedure.	battery charger;diode;division algorithm;electronic circuit;extended validation certificate;lagrange multiplier;network switch;on-board data handling;prototype;pulse-width modulation;rectifier;resonance;snubber;spectral leakage;switched-mode power supply;transformer	Yoon-Jae Kim;Jun-Young Lee	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2535237	forward converter;control engineering;electronic engineering;charge pump;flyback converter;inductance;engineering;electrical engineering;ćuk converter;buck–boost converter;snubber;inductor;boost converter;diode;voltage regulation	EDA	63.18751130091891	42.60563818453919	158453

Stability challenges become further aggravated when multiple local controllers are running together with the fan control scheme. In this paper, we present a global control scheme which tackles the concerns on the stability of enterprise servers while reducing the performance degradation caused by the variable fan speed control scheme. We first present a stable fan speed control scheme based on the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller by adaptively adjusting the PID parameters according to the operating fan speed and eliminating the fan speed oscillation caused by temperature quantization. Then, we present a global control scheme which coordinates control actions among multiple local controllers. In addition, it guarantees the server stability while minimizing the overall performance degradation. We validated the proposed control scheme using a presently shipping commercial enterprise server. Our experimental results show that the proposed fan control scheme is stable under the non-ideal temperature measurement system (10 sec in time lag and 1°C in quantization figures). Furthermore, the global control scheme enables to run multiple local controllers in a stable manner while reducing the performance degradation up to 19.2% compared to conventional coordination schemes with 19.1% savings in power consumption.	computer fan control;electronic speed control;elegant degradation;logic programming;pid;quantization (signal processing);sensor;server (computing);simulation;system of measurement	Jungsoo Kim;Mohamed M.

The proposed LFC structure is able to dynamically maintain the system frequency at the nominal value against the power imbalances. To achieve proper transient response, the integral control parameter of the LFC controller is optimized using the genetic algorithm (GA). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, several simulation case studies are carried out. The results show that the wind farm can effectively participate in the regulation of power system frequency in the future utility grid.	control theory;genetic algorithm;macromodel;simulation	Mohammadreza Toulabi;Ali Mohammad Ranjbar;Houshang Karimi;Mojtaba Shiroie	2012	2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465857	control engineering;electronic engineering;power control;engineering;control theory	EDA	64.94990900808641	37.43217738436834	159591

1cb9da8880189daa30c66054f66e2235b5805119	a novel msb-prediction sar adc strategy for battery pack voltage detection		Abstract In this paper, a most significant bits (MSBs) prediction strategy for the design of successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) in battery pack voltage detection is proposed to reduce conversion time without losing accuracy. The strategy takes advantage of the battery pack voltages characteristics where there is a strong correlation among neighboring cell voltage values. By generating the MSBs with the quantization results of the battery pack in the previous loop, the ADC just needs to convert the remaining least significant bits (LSBs). This paper analyzes the relationship between saved time and five parameters: reading frequency ( f ), cell number of battery pack (N), cell number (CN) for MSB-prediction, standard deviation (σ), change rate of digital number ( K ), which can give a feasible prediction on saved working time in any conditions. With this strategy, in a f  = 50 kHz, N = 10, CN = 8, σ = 10 system, up to 27.83% A/D conversion time can be saved in charging state, and 27.89% A/D conversion time can be saved in discharging state.	successive approximation adc	Jiangtao Xu;Jinlong Wang;Jing Gao;Zhiyuan Gao	2018	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2018.08.004	electronic engineering;battery pack;engineering;voltage;quantization (signal processing);standard deviation;successive approximation adc	EDA	60.59543758473967	45.864033959271	160011

Most commonly, the SSPFC converters are operated at DCM mode due to the simplicity of the control, non-existence of the reverse recovery losses. For ac/dc converters supporting universal input voltage range, DCM operation with relatively low dc link voltage results in highly distorted input current. In multi-level SSPFC converters, the dc link voltage can be adjusted in a larger window between 400V-800V thanks to the reduced voltage stresses on the switches. Thus, with an integrated controller adjusting dc link voltage with respect to line voltage, power factor at high line voltage can be improved. However, in DCM mode, the efficiency of the converter slightly decreases at high dc link voltage. In this paper, the tradeoff between the efficiency and the input factor is analyzed in a new integrated three-level PFC converter.	dicom;duty cycle;network switch;powerbuilder foundation classes	Serkan Dusmez;Bilal Akin	2014	2014 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2014.6864646	forward converter;control engineering;electronic engineering;flyback converter;ćuk converter;control theory;boost converter	Arch	64.3670917230276	41.49451582227459	160622

By encoding the qubit on two levels and using simple projective frequent measurements yielding the quantum Zeno effect, we demonstrate how to implement a well defined quantum register, quantum state transfer on demand, universal two-qubit gates and two-qubit parity measurements. Thus, we argue that the main ingredients for universal quantum computation can be achieved in a spin chain with an always-on and constant many-body Hamiltonian. We also show some possible modifications of the initially assumed dynamics in order to create maximally entangled qubit pairs and single qubit gates.	information processing;many-body problem;quantum information science	Alex Monras;Oriol Romero-Isart	2010	Quantum Information & Computation		quantum simulator;quantum operation;quantum information;amplitude damping channel;quantum network;quantum discord;quantum capacity;quantum technology;open quantum system;quantum zeno effect;quantum dissipation;quantum sensor;qubit;quantum channel;quantum electrodynamics;quantum computer;condensed matter physics;quantum process;quantum dynamics;quantum algorithm;physics;one-way quantum computer;quantum mechanics;quantum error correction	Theory	56.77661591785317	34.41002693558183	160655

c705621a1a9df08733001fefa7dc40832df8228e	optimum design of series compensation to improve power system transient stability using dfql and pso based controllers		The present study determines the optimum value of series compensation to improve the transient stability of a multi-machine power system using both dynamic fuzzy Q-learning(DFQL) controller and particle swarm optimization(PSO) based bang-bang controller. The DFQL based controller are suitable for continuous control and the bang-bang controller for discrete controller. The series compensation from DFQL controller is used to continuously vary the overall reactance of the transmission line using various FACTS compensator such as static synchronous series capacitor(SSSC), thyristor-controlled series capacitor(TCSC), thyristor-controlled series reactor(TCSR). The compensation from PSO based bangbang controller is used in fixed series FACTS compensators, i.e. thyristor-switched series reactor(TSSR), thyristor-switched series capacitor(TSSC) where the value of the compensation is varied between various fixed values of compensation. The effectiveness of these compensating controllers are illustrated via simulations considering a 3-machine power system. The results of the simulation demonstrate that PSO based bangbang controller could damp out the oscillations following a disturbance with different series compensation locations, while DFQL could stabilise the system only if the series compensation is installed at an appropriate location.	bang file;bang–bang control;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;q-learning;simulation;thyristor;transmission line	Lv Zhou;Akshya K.

86ebcc44ec2b17a9938fe55b0e5ff53131db7bec	complete small-signal model of three-phase photovoltaic inverter considering the source and load effects		The amount of photovoltaic inverters connected to the electrical grid is increasing. In order to control the power fed to the grid, the inverter must be controlled, and many different approaches for small-signal modeling have been proposed to facilitate the controller design. However, a solar panel cannot be modeled by an ideal current source and the photovoltaic inverter is not connected to an ideal grid on the load side. This paper proposes a generalized method to include the load and source effects to the dynamic model of a photovoltaic inverter. The method can be used to include the source impedance of the photovoltaic generator and impedance of the distribution line in the small-signal model of the photovoltaic inverter.

The proposed rectifier consists of two switches and two active diodes. The switches discharge the transducer capacitor at optimal instants two times for every cycle. The active diodes are based on op-amps with a preset dc offset, which reduces the voltage drop and the leakage current and avoids instability. In addition, the controller for the proposed rectifier is simple to reduce the circuit complexity and the power dissipation. The proposed rectifier was designed and fabricated in 0.18-μm CMOS technology. Measured results indicate that it achieves power efficiency of 91.2%, and the amount of power extracted by the proposed rectifier is 3.5 times larger when compared with the conventional rectifiers. The proposed rectifier does not require any off chip components to enable a full chip integration, and the die area of the proposed circuit is 0.08 × 0.20 mm2.	cmos;cpu power dissipation;circuit complexity;comparator;cycle (graph theory);diode;discharger;electronic circuit;instability;maximum power transfer theorem;network switch;performance per watt;piezoelectricity;rectifier;simulation;spectral leakage;transducer	Xuan-Dien Do;Huy-Hieu Nguyen;Seok-Kyun Han;Dong Sam Ha;Sang-Gug Lee	2015	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2312532	control engineering;synchronization;metal rectifier;electronic engineering;capacitor;transducer;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;very-large-scale integration;inductor;energy harvesting;precision rectifier	EDA	59.577067218294104	44.98700560697739	161799

The differential equations of the proposed TPSF-EPLL are originally derived based on minimizing the cost function with a gradient descent algorithm. Moreover, the system structure, the design guidelines of each parameter in both frequency and amplitude loops, and the stability analysis of the TPSF-EPLL are presented. The main advantage of the TPSF-EPLL is that it requires less calculation since transformation into a rotating reference frame is not involved, and all the calculation is performed in a two-phase stationary frame. Experiment results of steady state and dynamic performance of TPSF-EPLL are presented and compared with some classical PLLs to verify the validity of the theoretical analysis and its advantages.	algorithm;experiment;gradient descent;loss function;microcontroller;phase-locked loop;reference frame (video);sensor;stationary process;steady state;two-phase commit protocol;two-phase locking	Fengjiang Wu;Lujie Zhang;Jiandong Duan	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2014.2368257	control engineering;electronic engineering;von neumann stability analysis;phase-locked loop;computer science;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics	EDA	67.93233314429689	38.88976313488269	162080
534b2aa5b1903e25405a0da7a11143baa41953f5	investigation of vdmosfet's switching power dissipation changes under constant electrical stress		Abstract This study aims to examine the electrical stress effects on the switching power dissipation in n-channel VDMOSFET. We set up a resistive load NMOS inverter as a test circuit. At first step of measurement, VDMOSFETs are subjected to the high constant voltage (55V DC ) up to 6 h and this degradation process is continued until just prior to the oxide breakdown. Stress induced changes in output voltage and current are extracted using the resistive load NMOS inverter. The static and dynamic power dissipations, and power-delay product are calculated accordingly. In addition, assuming that the inverter load is selected as n-channel VDMOSFET, the power dissipation is calculated. In resistive load NMOS inverter, it is observed that the static power dissipation is decreased by 5.3%, the dynamic power is increased by around 60% and the total power dissipation is decreased by 5% compared to before the stress. In enhancement load NMOS inverter, the total power dissipation has a decrease of around 92%.

This rise in luminous flux is based on both higher efficiency and forward current, being the latter the reason why switching regulators have become interesting for current control. Linear regulators usually work quite well in lamps where the forward current is kept at a low level, whereas the efficiency drops as forward current rises. Another drawback of linear regulators is that the load voltage must be lower than the supply voltage, otherwise the LED lamp does not work The advantages of switching regulators consist of both high efficiency whatever the working point is, and the capability of working in any condition of supply and load voltage. In this paper, three high efficiency-one switch-simple-switching converters such as buck, boost and buck-boost converter are discussed for the use in automotive LED lighting applications, both for 14 V network and 42 V Powernet system, the newest power bus system, consisting of a 14/42 V dual voltage bus.	boost converter;buck converter;buck–boost converter;can bus;control system;flux qubit;hysteresis;led lamp;luminous studio;ripple effect;series and parallel circuits;switched-mode power supply;transistor;voltage regulator	David Gacio Vaquero;Antonio J.

38fe62e6aca9e4f82941d0eeba611469d40b16d7	a dynamic state estimator for the development of a control signal for power system damping enhancement		Small signal stability enhancement in power systems is often accomplished using supplementary controls. The usual technique is to utilize a power system stabilizer to generate a control signal that is applied to the excitation of a large synchronous generator. In this paper, a different approach is taken: a control signal is obtained using estimated signals from a ‘dynamic state estimator’, and the supplementary control is implemented using a static VAr compensator in the transmission circuit adjacent to a synchronous generator. The details of the design of the dynamic state estimator are given. A simple example is used to illustrate the concept. The paper is intended to show feasibility of a dynamic state estimator to provide a control signal for damping enhancement.	amplitude damping channel;ibm power systems;stabilizer code	I. L.

The full-feedforward functions of grid voltages are derived for the stationary α- β frame, synchronous d - q frame, and decoupled synchronous d - q frame-controlled three-phase LCL-type grid-connected inverters. The derived full-feedforward functions mainly consist of three parts which are proportional, derivative, and second derivative parts. The use of the traditional proportional feedforward function in the three-phase LCL -type grid-connected inverter will result in the amplification of the high-frequency injected grid current harmonics. With the proposed full-feedforward schemes, the injected grid current harmonics and unbalance caused by grid voltages can be greatly reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed feedforward schemes is verified by the experimental results.	feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;inverter (logic gate);lazarus component library;power inverter;stationary process;synchronization (computer science);video compression picture types	Weiwei Li;Xinbo Ruan;Donghua Pan;Xuehua Wang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2012.2193864	control engineering;feedforward neural network;electronic engineering;capacitor;engineering;electrical engineering;harmonic analysis;control theory;mathematics;inductor;feed forward;quantum mechanics	HPC	65.1250521926787	40.00070890554006	163017

The model considers the MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) technique to track the maximum power that could be extracted from the wind energy, due the non-linear characteristic of the wind turbine. The model consists of wind generation model, converter model (DC-DC converter), and MPPT controller. The main contribution of our work is in the model of DC-DC converter (buck converter) which is developed in rather details, which allows the MPPT controller output (duty cycle) adjusts the voltage input of the converter to track the maximum power point of the wind generator. The simulation results show that the developed model complies with the theoretical one. Further the MPPT control shows a higher power output compared to the system without MPPT.	algorithm;buck converter;duty cycle;energy systems language;matlab;maximum power transfer theorem;nonlinear system;norm (social);simulation;simulink	Aryuanto Soetedjo;Abraham Lomi;Widodo Puji Mulayanto	2011	Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics	10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021836	wind power;control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;buck converter;engineering;control theory;power optimizer	Robotics	65.58643730233462	37.88471825966294	163126
a13521aed23ad1e6e09ccf18502c5625568d2c59	a developed modified osap controller with repetitive control action for ups		In this work, a developed modified one sampling ahead preview (OSAP) controller with repetitive control action for single – phase voltage source PWM inverters used in (UPS) systems is proposed. The proposed technique minimizes largely the plant modeling errors resulted from simplification made to obtain a linear discrete time plant model. In addition, due to the repetitive control action, this digital control scheme can minimize the steady-state error and periodic distortions caused by nonlinear cyclic loads. Hence, the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) will be reduced. This technique utilizes a switching frequency greater than the sampling frequency, yielding additional minimization in the plant modeling errors. As the sampling frequency is less than the switching frequency, it is possible to implement this controller on a low speed microcontroller. Plant model and theoretical analysis of the control scheme are discussed. Simulation results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed approach under different load conditions.	clock rate;inverter (logic gate);level of detail;microcontroller;nonlinear system;pulse-width modulation;sampling (signal processing);simulation;steady state;total harmonic distortion;uninterruptible power supply;ups (debugger);voltage source	Azzam A.

For the purpose of this Track, A complex system may be large or small in scale. A characteristic, however, is that such a system exhibit a behavior under stress that is difficult to predict. This may be because models are not well understood (i.e. load models in electric power systems, behavioral models in social and economic systems). It may be because the number of variables is so large that it is beyond simulation capabilities of current computers, or because the relation between a large number of variables is so complex that current mathematics or simulation methods are inadequate. The electric power system is a worthy example of such a system.	complex system;complex systems;computer;ibm power systems;mathematical model;simulation	Robert J.

0cca5084c60bba8c2e57f9350b82609854f4c1ce	model-based development of transmission concepts for hybrid electric powertrains		Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) are developed to reduce the fuel consumption and the emission of carbon dioxide. The transmission is a core component in PHEVs since it defines the interaction between the internal combustion engine and the electric motors. Due to the complexity of PHEVs, a model-based development is carried out for novel transmission concepts, which takes the overall power train into account, as well. In this contribution, an approach for the model-based development of transmission concepts for PHEVs is presented. It incorporates the development and evaluation of new concepts as well as the development and test of corresponding controllers. Since each step of the development requires a power train model with an appropriate level of detail, an automatic model generation is used to enable an efficient workflow. This contribution focuses on the development of new transmission concepts only. It comprises an optimization of the number of gears and transmission ratios for an exemplary transmission. As a result of the proposed approach a novel transmission concept for PHEVs including a model-based evaluation is presented.	hybrid kernel;level of detail;mathematical optimization;model-driven engineering	Stefan Geng;Tobias Zubke;Thomas Schulte	2017	2017 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2017.7995944	vehicle dynamics;model-based design;internal combustion engine;powertrain;electric motor;level of detail;control engineering;fuel efficiency;engineering;transmission (mechanics)	Robotics	61.38944835974338	34.79575690308504	163970

IDE modulation unifies all the PWM schemes reported up to now and is thus called as unified PWM. It is revealed that conventional trailing-edge, leading-edge, trailing-triangle, and leading-triangle modulations are special cases of IDE modulation. The control laws of IDPV controlled buck converter with IDE modulation are investigated and compared with those of IDPV with DDE modulation. Their stabilities and robustness are analyzed subsequently. Digital implementation of the unified PWM is also carried out. Steady-state and transient performances of IDPV controlled buck converters with IDE modulation and DDE modulation are compared and verified by experimental results. It is concluded that steady-state and transient performances of IDPV with IDE are better than those of IDPV with DDE modulation.

It can be directly expanded to 3×N-modular MC, but in order to improve the power quality, the phase-shifted (PS) method and phase disposition (PD) method are proposed. The former is suitable for the 3×N-modular MC with any multiwinding transformers (including phase-shifting transformers). Moreover, the latter is only applicable to the 3×N-modular MC with ordinary multiwinding transformers. The PD method has advantages over the PS method in the output current quality and efficiency. However, the PS method is superior to the PD method in the input current quality. Experimental results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed modulation schemes.	correctness (computer science);electric power quality;input/output;modulation;semiconductor device;transformer;transformers;two-phase locking	Yao Sun;Wenjing Xiong;Mei Su;Xing Li;Hanbing Dan;Jian Yang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2494871	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	64.84938146237667	41.37153954216203	164553

Here, a bidirectional boost converter is integrated with a resonant voltage quadrupler cell to obtain higher voltage gain. The auxiliary switch of the converter, which is connected to the output port acts as an active clamp circuit. Hence, zero voltage switching turn-on of the MOSFET switches are achieved. Coupled inductor's leakage energy is recycled to the output port through this auxiliary switch. In the proposed converter, all the diodes of the quadrupler cell are turned off with zero-current switching (ZCS). This considerably reduces the high-frequency turn-off losses and reverse recovery losses of the diodes. ZCS turn-off of the diodes also remove the diode voltage ringing caused due to the interaction of the parasitic capacitance of the diodes and the leakage inductance of the coupled inductor. Hence, to protect the diodes from the voltage spikes, snubbers are not required. The voltage stress on all the MOSFETs and diodes are lower. This helps to choose switches of low voltage rating (low RDS(ON)) and, thus improve the efficiency. Design and mathematical analysis of the proposed converter are made.

The microgrid presented here consists of several line-interactive uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems connected in parallel. The control technique is based on the droop method to avoid critical communications among UPS units. Thus, a flexible microgrid is obtained to operate in either grid-connected or islanded mode. A small-signal analysis is presented in order to analyze the system stability, which gives rules to design the main control parameters. Simulation and experimental results are presented, showing the feasibility of the proposed controller.	autonomous robot;control flow;control theory;inverter (logic gate);microgrid;nonlinear system;signal processing;simulation;small-signal model;steady state;uninterruptible power supply;ups (debugger)	Josep M.

The gate signals for the master and slave converters are generated using the rising and falling edge instants from the original control gate signal of the controller, respectively. Therefore, the required 90° phase difference between two signals can be always kept at any instant and at any output load condition. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This is especially true when the load demands active power. One of these topologies is the five-level multipoint clamped (5L-MPC) converter. The back-to-back (B2B) configuration of two 5L-MPC converters and the use of a space vector modulation (SVM) that exploits the voltage balancing capability of the redundant switching vectors extend the operation conditions range in which a proper voltage balance can be achieved. However, if practical modulation restrictions are considered (limitation of voltage steps, dead times, switching losses, etc.), the voltage balance cannot be achieved for all operation conditions. In this paper, an SVM which takes into account practical restrictions is proposed. In order to guarantee the voltage balance at any operation condition, the grid-side rectifier exchanges reactive power with the grid-side LCL filter. Thus, the voltage balance of the dc-link is guaranteed while a unity grid-side power factor is achieved. The proposed modulation scheme and the voltage balancing strategy are experimentally validated in a 6.6 kV 1.5 MW 5L-MPC B2B converter.	experiment;lazarus component library;microwave;modulation;multipoint ground;rectifier	Mikel Mazuela;Igor Baraia;Alain Sanchez-Ruiz;Ivan Echeverria;Inigo Torre;Inigo Atutxa	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2580128	control engineering;support vector machine;electronic engineering;capacitor;power factor;network switch;buck converter;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;switched-mode power supply;ac power;voltage optimisation;boost converter;voltage regulation;modulation	EDA	64.20814824717316	40.983296714389134	165615

Simulation of the dynamic behaviour of a machine fed through static power control equipment containing switching devices of one kind or another can be conveniently achieved using this model. The procedure is simple and can be applied, with considerable flexibility, to any system containing one or more induction machines. The model is inherently capable to account for iron losses as well. It is also suited for simulation of machine dynamics with unbalance introduced in the stator electrical circuits by a fault, provided the structure of the windings remains unaltered. A similar network model can be derived to represent a machine with an asymmetrical internal fault which splits one or more stator phases into multiple sections with or without interconnections. A previously published model of a triac has been improved (Ghani 1981).	mathematical induction;network model;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;squirrel;triac	Sayeed Nurul Ghani	1988	Simulation	10.1177/003754978805000503	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory;system dynamics	ML	66.30351757279918	41.721100645054115	166020

23076cbdaf4604b26e41bdefa3f3ebae2f2e90fc	stability and performance analysis of a sic-based cascode switch and an alternative solution		Wide band-gap semiconductors are most attractive as materials for power devices due to low losses, improved temperature capability and high thermal conductivity. Although silicon carbide Schottky diodes have been commercially available on the market for years, an active wide bandgap switch is still missing. Probably the best performance of upcoming devices is gained with normally-on concepts such as silicon-carbide JFETs and gallium-nitride HEMTs. However, the vast majority of power electronic topologies rely on normally-off switches. An alternative approach is the use of the cascode concept which combines a normally-on wide band-gap device with high blocking capability and a low-voltage normally-off silicon MOSFET. In this work, the performance and stability of such an arrangement is analyzed and an alternative solution is proposed.	blocking (computing);diode;integrated circuit;network switch;power semiconductor device;profiling (computer programming);sic-povm;schottky barrier	Ralf Siemieniec;Gerhard Nöbauer;Daniel Domes	2012	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2011.12.006	electronic engineering;electrical engineering;forensic engineering	Metrics	62.94634794642244	45.72596315600758	166199

Active diodes controlled by two novel unbalance-sized comparators are adopted, thus improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the rectifier. To further improve the efficiency and lower the start-up voltage, a clock-less asynchronized hysteretic DC-DC boost converter has been used, thus avoiding the power losses related to the driving clock as well as eliminating the requirements of high driving voltage. Simulation based on 0.18-μm CMOS process shows that with a 0.37 Vpeak input voltage, the converter is capable of harvesting > 100μW power with more than 1 V output voltage and over 85% efficiency.

Our optimized operate method can achieve high speed performance by employing a lower duty ratio (25%) CK2 with its pulse located in the middle of the pulse of CK2L to fully use the bootstrapped high voltage of node Q. In addition, the size of devices is optimized by calculation and simulation, and the function of the proposed gate driver is predicted by the circuit simulation. Furthermore, the proposed gate driver with 20 stages is fabricated by the IZO TFTs process. It is shown that a 2.6 μs width pulse with good noise-suppressed characteristic can be successfully output at the condition of Rload = 6 kΩ and Cload = 150 pF. The power consumption of the proposed gate driver with 20 stages is measured as 1 mW. Hence, the proposed gate driver may be applied to the display of 4K resolution (4096 × 2160) at a frame rate of 120 Hz. Moreover, there is a good stability for the proposed gate driver under 48 h operation.

ca9a5788fbc7edd710d7d5d73d1d2b8b8461073c	extension of virtual-signal-injection-based mtpa control for five-phase ipmsm into fault-tolerant operation		This paper introduces a novel fault-tolerant control for the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) operation in five-phase interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM), termed MTPA fault-tolerant control. The key of this fault-tolerant control is that the reluctance torque is considered and used by MTPA under open-circuit fault. Based on the decoupled model of five-phase IPMSM on synchronous frame and the computing method of d-axis and q-axis voltages under various open-circuit faults, the virtual signal injection control (VSIC) can be applied to realize the MTPA under the fault-tolerant operation by the postfault field-oriented control (FOC) and carrier-based PWM (CPWM). This method is parameter independent in tracking of the MTPA points under the fault-tolerant operation. Besides, it can effectively reduce the amplitude of the fundamental current and improve efficiency compared with traditional $i_{d} = {\text{0}}$ fault-tolerant control. Moreover, it is robust to current and voltage harmonics and machine torque disturbances under the postfault operation. The proposed method is verified by experiments under various postfault operating conditions on an IPMSM prototype drive system.	apache axis;experiment;fault tolerance;festival of code;prototype;pulse-width modulation	Qian Chen;Wenxiang Zhao;Guohai Liu;Zhipeng Lin	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2018.2826473	control theory;control engineering;fault tolerance;synchronous motor;synchronous frame;magnetic reluctance;harmonics;torque;amplitude;engineering;pulse-width modulation	Embedded	67.12313593493008	39.225510591036276	167859

The fuel-cell hybrid system considered in this paper consists of fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors, along with associated dc/dc and dc/ac converters. The energy management schemes addressed are state of the art and are most commonly used energy management techniques in fuel-cell vehicle applications, and they include the following: the state machine control strategy, the rule-based fuzzy logic strategy, the classical proportional-integral control strategy, the frequency decoupling/fuzzy logic control strategy, and the equivalent consumption minimization strategy. The main criteria for performance comparison are the hydrogen consumption, the state of charges of the batteries/supercapacitors, and the overall system efficiency. Moreover, the stresses on each energy source, which impact their life cycle, are measured using a new approach based on the wavelet transform of their instantaneous power.

A comparison of the simulation results between the proposed strategy and a multiple feedback loop approach is presented to verify the effectiveness of our design. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy has a significant improvement.

The PV active power output can be controlled in the load-following mode when sufficient solar power is available to supply a local load, or the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode when a local load is large or injection to the system is allowed. Two selected control approaches, P-Q control in the load-following mode and P-V control in the MPPT mode, are investigated in this paper. The P-Q control is implemented with a relatively simple approach, while the P-V control demands an extra MPPT logic, which is solved based on a power balance between the dc and ac sides in a two-stage PV configuration. The control algorithms are tested with the IEEE 13-bus distribution feeder with various system conditions like the presence of multiple PV generators, imbalance, harmonics, and faults. The MATLAB and SimPowerSystems simulation results clearly demonstrate the capability of the proposed control in maintaining the P/V bus as either a P-Q or P-V bus depending on different applications.	algorithm;interconnection;jumbo frame;matlab;maximum power transfer theorem;microgrid;page view;power inverter;reference frame (video);simulation	Sarina Adhikari;Fangxing Li;Huijuan Li	2015	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2015.2429597	control engineering;power module;nominal power;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;base load power plant;power factor;power control;engineering;photovoltaic system;control theory;physical chemistry;stand-alone power system;electric power system;solar micro-inverter;power engineering;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;power optimizer	Arch	63.64901192889103	38.49858135941077	168542

The proposed system possesses an external powering amplifier and an internal bidirectional microstimulator. The energy of the microstimulator is provided by a rectifier that can efficiently charge a rechargeable device. A fully integrated regulator and a charge pump circuit are included to generate a stable, low-voltage, and high-potential supply voltage, respectively. A miniature digital processor includes a phase-shift-keying (PSK) demodulator to decode the transmission data and a self-protective system controller to operate the entire system. To acquire the cardiac signal, a low-voltage and low-power monitoring analog front end (MAFE) performs immediate threshold detection and data conversion. In addition, the pacing circuit, which consists of a pulse generator (PG) and its digital-to-analog (D/A) controller, is responsible for stimulating heart tissue. The chip was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) with 0.35-μm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology to perform the monitoring and pacing functions with inductively powered communication. Using a model with lead and heart tissue on measurement, a -5-V pulse at a stimulating frequency of 60 beats per minute (bpm) is delivered while only consuming 31.5 μW of power.	amplifier;analog;cmos;capacitor device component;charge pump;demodulator device component;digital-to-analog converter;electroencephalography phase desynchronization;error detection and correction;feedback;implants;in situ nick-end labeling;key (cryptography);lasers, semiconductor;low-power broadcasting;myocytes, cardiac;power (psychology);pre-shared key;pulse generator;pumping (computer systems);real-time clock;rechargeable battery;rectifier device component;stimulation (motivation);telemetry;beats per minute;pump (device);voltage	Shuenn-Yuh Lee;Chih-Jen Cheng;Ming-Chun Liang	2011	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TBCAS.2011.2126570	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;control system;electrical engineering;amplifier	EDA	56.22046302999929	46.19790404344559	168753

Via this strategy, each one of the six transistors conducts for 150°, instead of the known 180° or 120° conduction-modes, resulting in a new space voltage-vector diagram (SVD). For a wye-load connected to the VSI, the known 6 active and 2 zero voltage-vectors, coincided in the origin, construct the classical 7-SVD. Using the new controling strategy, new different 6 non-zero voltage-vectors are primarily introduced to the literature and added to the former ones conistituting an innovated 13 space vector diagram (13-SVD) for the inverter, instead of the conventional 7-SVD. The output phase-voltage becomes a 7-level, 12-step waveform, and a 50% reduction of the total harmonic distortion is obtained. Comprehensive study for the new switching strategy and the resulting voltage vectors is proposed, and comparisons with other VSI topologies; like neutral point clamped (NPC) and multilevel inverters (MLI) were also carried out. Simulation and experimental results show the contribution of the proposed technique.	diagram;inverter (logic gate);np-completeness;network switch;power inverter;simulation;singular value decomposition;total harmonic distortion;transistor;voltage source;waveform	Mohamed H.

8d10f3aaa3b891dc5d01ad90603161f26bc9b62c	interaction resonance mechanism of the parallel-inverter system containing multiple types of inverters		Almost all existing relevant literatures are focused on the multi-inverter system that only contains one type of inverter. Till now, the interactions in multi-inverter system consisting of polytype inverters have been not investigated systematically. To fill this gap, the paper is aimed at the stability study of the generic system containing multiple types of inverters. The mathematic model of interactions between different types of inverters as well as between the inverter and the power grid are divided into the admittance network and the excitation source. Based on the division stabilities of those interactions are investigated by root locus and a commonly used stability criterion is proposed for the multi-inverter system. To guarantee the system stable, the following two conditions should be satisfied: (a) the admittance network is stable; (b) any two inverters don't have the same unstable poles. The stability of the interaction between the inverter and the power grid is only depended on the criterion (a), whereas the stability of the interaction between different inverters is determined by both conditions. The theoretical analysis is verified by experimental results.	control theory;emoticon;excitation;generic drugs;interaction;inverter (logic gate);inverter device component;locus;literature;mathematics;numerous;power inverter;resonance;unstable medical device problem	Chen Zheng;Lin Zhou;Jinhong Liu;Gaofeng Hao	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216214	root locus;grid;control theory;control engineering;resonance;engineering;admittance;inverter;excitation;electrical impedance;stability criterion	Robotics	65.70627900048045	41.12790334305363	168889

While there are a number of equivalencing methods, little attention has been paid on how to retain thermal line limits from the original system. This paper presents an approach to develop an equivalent network for a large scale power system that preserves the thermal line limits from the equivalenced lines. The proposed method is able to assign limits to equivalent lines with inexpensive computation and is operating point independent even with a loaded system. The algorithm is applied to create a backbone type equivalent system of the Eastern Interconnection in North America.	algorithm;computation;ibm power systems;interconnection;internet backbone;operating point;transmission line	Wonhyeok Jang;Saurav Mohapatra;Thomas J.

The control law is implemented monitoring only the DC―DC output voltage, and is capable of producing a maximum overshoot/undershoot of 50 mV for load transients from 0 A to 1.5 A and vice versa. The maximum settling time for these conditions at 1.5% is 5.51 μs for a load transient from 1.5 A to 0.15 A. For line transients the DC―DC converter produces minimal overshoot/undershoot. Results are present for the Matlab ®  model with the continuous control law and for the final implementation using HSim ®  with the digital control law implementation. The ADC is implemented using a current controlled delay line and it is insensitive to layout parasitics, temperature, supply voltage and process parameters changes. The ADC self calibration capability is considered a major original contribution of this work.

124b49490319948fb6fb6d3f2e8ddf7c0bb48f7c	an optimization approach for modulation in multilevel converters		In the control of power converters, it is well known that the modulation strategy can be used not only for the discretization of averaged control signals, but also for the fulfillment of additional control objectives, such as voltage balance among capacitors or common mode reduction. The resulting number of switches is an important issue since the fulfillment of these additional objectives usually leads to an increase in the number of switches and, thus, in power losses. In this paper, the modulation stage is formulated as an optimization problem in order to minimize the number of switches. The resulting problem is formulated as an linear, mixed-integer programming problem that can be solved offline and the solution can be stored as a look-up table for its use during online operation. The resulting approach is applied to a 3-phase, 5-level diode-clamped converter (DCC) working as rectifier.

b403c46e7d9d85688549189dbcdbfc2fd1a3f28d	novel intelligent and sensorless proportional valve control with self-learning ability		Linear control is widely used for any fluid or air flows in many automobile, robotics, and hydraulics applications. According to signal level, valve can be controlled linearly. But, for many valves, hydraulics or air is not easy to control proportionally because of flows dynamics. As a conventional solution, electronic driver has up and down limits. After manually settling up and down limits, control unit has proportional blind behavior between two points. This study offers a novel valve control method merging pulse width and amplitude modulation in the same structure. Proposed method uses low voltage AC signal to understand the valve position and uses pulse width modulation for power transfer to coil. DC level leads to controlling the valve and AC signal gives feedback related to core moving. Any amplitude demodulator gives core position as voltage. Control unit makes reconstruction using start and end points to obtain linearization at zero control signal and maximum control signal matched to minimum demodulated amplitude level. Proposed method includes self-learning abilities to keep controlling in hard environmental conditions such as dust, temperature, and corrosion. Thus, self-learning helps to provide precision control for hard conditions.		Bayram Akdemir	2016	J.

Using large amounts of energy from wind arouses critical issues such as voltage variation and poor quality power supply. Several papers have been published on suggestions to improve performance of wind turbines during grid fault; however, to the authors' knowledge only a few papers address this problem with dynamic references. This paper presents the fuzzy adaptive theta particle swarm optimization (FAΘPSO)-based fuzzy controller applied to a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) to operate at medium voltage. The proposed method attempted to determine required reactive power reference and active power amplification factors based on recommendations presented by the German Transmission Code 2007 and capability limits of the DFIG. Optimum values of membership functions were obtained by utilizing an FAΘPSO algorithm. This method improves voltage profile at the first instant besides during the grid fault. Moreover, aforementioned method also acts as an additional controller that could emerge with different inner controllers in the DFIG.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;membership function (mathematics);particle swarm optimization;power supply	Siavash Beheshtaein	2014	2014 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2014.6864659	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	EDA	65.55650137455618	37.03821073481286	170492

The functionality and the performance of biomedical implants are largely constrained by their power consumption. Delivering enough electrical power to implants wirelessly is one of the critical challenges that implant developers are facing nowadays. The wireless power transfer (WPT) using rotating magnets has demonstrate its capability to supply a large amount of electrical power to implants. The printed spiral coils (PSC) have the advantage of the batch-fabrication over the coils that are made of filaments. Previous design principles of filament coils are not sufficient to optimize all aspects of PSC due to the technology constraints. In this project, we develop a comprehensive theories on design and optimization of PSC to achieve maximum power delivery efficiency at a given size.

Simulation results show that a mismatch between the two initial sensing capacitors of the accelerometer or a mismatch between the two capacitance-voltage conversion circuits has a great effect on the output noise floor. When there is a serious mismatch, the noise induced by a sinusoidal carrier is the major noise source. When there is no or only a slight mismatch, the differential capacitance-voltage conversion circuits become the main noise source.

The proposed control strategy is based on the injection of a high-frequency voltage signal and the subsequent demodulation of the resulting high-frequency stator current components. The coupling due to high-speed operation that degrades the estimation accuracy of similar algorithms based on signal injection is taken into account. Modeling of the machine response to a high-frequency voltage signal injected into the estimated d-axis is presented, also considering the influence of damping circuits both on the d- and q-axis. Local asymptotic stability of the proposed observer is also demonstrated.

Consequently, the integrated circuits have to be designed for reliability in order to stay alive but also to guarantee the normal operations during severe electrical aggressions. Unfortunately, the simulation of functional failures during severe ESD or EMC events remains very challenging for analog products due the frequency domain and to the high current injection mechanisms.

Although it is turned off, it still consumes 1 to 3 W when it is plugged into an ac socket. In this design the touch panel microwave oven consumes 3 mW when it is turned off and yet plugged in. A more effective circuit design for a touch panel microwave oven is proposed to reduce the standby power consumption, which is also easy to apply to future products. This power consumption in the standby state is lower than that of others and not only simple to set up but also inexpensive1.	circuit design;microwave;touchscreen	Cheng-Hung Tsai;Ying-Wen Bai;Ming-Bo Lin;Roger Jia Rong Jhang;Chih-Yu Chung	2013	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2013.6490241	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	Visualization	57.40345419970769	42.928340121340554	171324

Considering that doubly fed induction generation (DFIG) systems have the tolerance capability, to overcome the drawback of LVRT operation of DFIG system using crowbar, a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is connected to the stator side to prevent the stator voltage fast changing, and then the rotor side converter (RSC) can be in normal operation. A mathematical model of the rotor voltage of DFIG during a symmetrical voltage dip is presented to describe the allowable changing rate of the stator voltage. A new connection structure of DVR is proposed where DVR and GSC share a DC capacitor. Based on the coordinated control of the DFIG system and DVR, the active power regulation and reactive power compensation can be implemented under the grid fault. The simulation results for a 1.5MW DFIG system is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed protection compared to the rotor crowbar during grid fault.	computer simulation;control theory;convolutional code;crowbar (circuit);digital video recorder;gsc bus;mathematical model;r.o.t.o.r.

The proposed method injects compensation currents into the power supply nodes on the ATE system in a feed-forward manner such that the ATE power supply waveform matches with the one on the customer's operating environment of the DUT. A method for calculating the compensation current is also described. Experimental results show that the proposed method can emulate the power supply voltage waveform under a customer's operating condition and eliminate 95 % of overkills/underkills in the maximum operating frequency testing with 105 real silicon devices. Limitations and applications of the proposed method are also discussed.		Masahiro Ishida;Toru Nakura;Takashi Kusaka;Satoshi Komatsu;Kunihiro Asada	2016	J.

3a27068fceaf5a12393fb9699671b484928fcfd8	a fast switching current regulator using slewing time reduction method for high dimming ratio of led backlight drivers	voltage control;slewing time reduction backlight driver current regulator dimming ratio;circuits and systems;light emitting diodes;switches;light emitting diodes regulators voltage control voltage measurement switches timing circuits and systems;voltage measurement;regulators;timing	This brief proposes a fast switching current regulator to achieve a high dimming ratio of the light-emitting diode (LED) backlight drivers. The proposed current regulator employs the slewing time reduction method to enhance the dimming ratio by decreasing the rising time of the LED forward current. A six-channel LED backlight driver was fabricated using a 0.35-μm bipolar-CMOS-DMOS process technology which includes an n-type MOSFET with a low voltage of 5 V and a high-side lateral double diffused MOSFET with a breakdown voltage of 60 V. The measured rising time and minimum pulsewidth of the LED forward current are reduced to 4.8 ns and 12 ns, respectively, at a current transition of 60 mA. Consequently, the dimming ratio of the LED backlight driver using the proposed current regulator is calculated to be 160 000: 1 at a dimming frequency of 500 Hz, which is more than three times higher than that obtained using the previously reported current regulators. Therefore, the proposed current regulator is suitable for high-end displays which require high image quality.	backlight;cmos;current source;diode;image quality;lateral thinking;oled;pulse-width modulation;thyristor	Hyun-A.

Their increased penetration coupled with uncoordinated charging could impact the distribution system in terms of unbalanced voltage and transformer overloading. Although PEV battery charging is increasing, impact on the distribution system is not fully investigated. This paper focuses on unbalanced voltage caused by uneven distribution of PEV penetration among the phases. Using real data provided by utility, a distribution system has been modeled and tested using Matlab-Simulink. PEV penetration levels at 10-80% are studied, unbalanced voltage is calculated, and transformer overloading is observed. As PEV adoption is expected to increase, the impact on the distribution system will increase. Coordinated or smart charging of PEVs will be essential for consumers and utilities.	battery charger;load profile;matlab;open research;plug-in (computing);simulink;transformer;transformers;unbalanced circuit	S.

Active power filters are typically connected in parallel to the harmonic/reactive current sources and cancel the harmonic/reactive components in the line current so that the current flow into and from the grid is sinusoidal and in phase with the grid voltage. Since the APFs process only the harmonic/reactive power, their power-handling capability can be much higher than that of the cascade power-factor-correction methods. In this paper, the one-cycle control method is extended to control three-phase APFs. The proposed control approach employs one integrator with reset along with several logic and linear components to control a voltage-source converter to achieve three-phase unity power factor for the current to and from the power grid. No multipliers or sensors for the load current and the APF inductor current are required. Furthermore, there is no need to calculate the reference for controlling APF inductor current so that complicated digital computation is eliminated. The operation switching frequency is constant that is desirable for industrial applications. The proposed control approach features great simplicity, excellent harmonic/reactive current cancellation, and solid stability. It is a cost-effective solution for power quality control for electronic equipment, buildings, industrial facilities, ships, airplanes, distributed power generation stations, etc. All findings are supported by experimental results.	apf-mp1000;clock rate;computation;current source;electric power quality;in-phase and quadrature components;loss of significance;nonlinear system;sensor;unity	Chongming Qiao;Taotao Jin;Keyue Ma Smedley	2004	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2004.825223	control engineering;volt-ampere reactive;electronic engineering;power factor;power control;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;ac power;volt-ampere	EDA	64.60328167628904	39.093910189739034	173483

We solve an open problem of Morris by showing that Murty’s least-index pivot rule (under any fixed index order) leads to a quadratic number of iterations on Morris’s highly cyclic P-LCP examples. We then show that on K-matrix LCP instances, all pivot rules require only a linear number of iterations. As the main tool, we employ unique-sink orientations of cubes, a useful combinatorial abstraction of the P-LCP.	complementarity (physics);complementarity theory;iteration;linear complementarity problem;olap cube;time complexity;unique sink orientation	Jan Foniok;Komei Fukuda;Bernd Gärtner;Hans-Jakob Lüthi	2009	Discrete & Computational Geometry	10.1007/s00454-009-9182-2	time complexity;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;lemke's algorithm;mathematics;mixed complementarity problem;numerical linear algebra;linear complementarity problem;complementarity theory;computational complexity theory	Theory	54.46046264513606	33.468342205249215	174481

These generators are both grid-connected and stand-alone applications. We present an overview of the essential research results. The paper concentrates on the operation and modeling of stand-alone power systems with PV power generators. Systems with PV array-inverter assemblies, operating in the slave-and-master modes, are discussed, and the simulation results obtained using a renewable energy power system modular simulator are presented. These results demonstrate that simulation is an essential step in the system development process and that PV power generators constitute a valuable energy source. They have the ability to balance the energy and supply good power quality. It is demonstrated that when PV array- inverters are operating in the master mode in stand-alone applications, they well perform the task of controlling the voltage and frequency of the power system. The mechanism of switching the master function between the diesel generator and the PV array-inverter assembly in a stand-alone power system is also proposed and analyzed. Finally, some experimental results on a practical system are compared to the simulation results and confirm the usefulness of the proposed approach to the development of renewable energy systems with PV power generators.	diesel;electric power quality;ibm power systems;inverter (logic gate);power inverter;simulation;solar cell;uninterruptible power supply	Jan T.

531c11dc8122991846e723bc6ee4a991e1ef0648	direct control of a three-phase active filter on a disturbed network		In order to correct the power factor and limit the flow of harmonics in the source, the effectiveness of active power filters associated to control law is no longer to be demonstrated. Almost all of these methods are designed for a perfect sinusoidal source and do not produce sinusoidal current when the voltages are disturbed. The work developed here concerns active filtering on a perturbed network, that is to say the presence of voltage harmonics at the connection point in addition to a system of unbalanced voltages. A proposed method called DCAP (Direct Control for Active Power) is based on new definition of the sinusoidal active currents desired on the source and assuming a unity power factor under perturbed and polluted system voltages that leads to the DCAP control strategy for active filter. This method considers the active power and the effective value of the fundamental of the voltage is described and its results are compared with those obtained by the p-q theory, the modified p-q theory and the p-q-r method for application on a three-wire disturbed and non-linear load distribution network. The comparison concerns the harmonic distortion rate (THD) of the desired currents obtained on the source as well as Unbalance Factor (UF) of the system of these currents.	3,5-dichloro-1,4-aminophenol;active filter;control theory;generalized myotonia of thomsen;load balancing (computing);nonlinear system;optimal control;sex factors;total harmonic distortion;unbalanced circuit;voltage	Antoine F.

This method is characterized by simultaneous switching of both transistors, which yields an increased frequency of current ripple component, when in a typical unipolar modulation only one transistor is switched. A BLDC motor control system is also presented, which reflects the idea of a logic rectifier for the determination of an equivalent dc value.

The star connected Dickson converter is used, not only for its low bottom plate voltage swing and efficient use of switches, but also for its very regular structure. This regular structure allows it to operate as a folding Dickson converter, implementing several conversion ratios, as well as reusing all of its flying capacitance. Folding is achieved by changing the phases of the switches, and keeping certain flying switches on in both phases, virtually lumping flying capacitors together. This last fact, along with the other benefits of the Dickson converter, makes it a good candidate for full integration. The flying switches of the converter are driven from their own converter, using an adapted bootstrapped converter which uses the intrinsic operation of the Dickson converter to copy the voltage of the flying capacitors and boost it by Vout.	dc-to-dc converter;lumpers and splitters;network switch;sample rate conversion;transformer	Athanasios Sarafianos;Michiel S.

72d78d75e7046f4bdffcccc298ce5ebade435545	fast pre-charge strategy of a modified mmc with enhanced dc fault ride-through capability		This paper proposes a modified topology of modular multilevel converter (MMC) to accelerate the DC fault ride-through speed. The modified topology mainly consists of a half bridge sub-module (HBSM) and a modified series double submodule (MSDSM). The difference between the series double submodule (SDSM) and the MSDSM is a damping resistance which is used to increase the capability of the energy dissipation when DC fault occurs. This improvement can disperse the energy to dissipate. Moreover, the selection of resistance is analyzed. In addition, an improved pre-charging strategy based on this modified topology is presented to shorten the start-up time of MMC. At the same time, the value of additional limiting resistance can be lowered because the damping resistances of the MSDSMs are more fully utilized. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed topology and pre-charging strategy.	memory management controller;pre-charge;simulation;uptime	Dongye Li;Yichao Sun;Jianfeng Zhao;Zhendong Ji	2017	2017 IEEE 26th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	10.1109/ISIE.2017.8001334	pre-charge;control engineering;engineering;control theory;modular design;limiting;dissipation;electronic engineering	Arch	64.35005970435064	40.63670145701065	176299

A differential Clapp-VCO has been successfully implemented in the 0.13 m CMOS process and it uses a series-tuned resonator. Two single ended nMOS-core Clapp-VCOs are used to form a differential VCO by the aid of a cross-coupled nMOS pair and a transformer. The measured results show that the fresh Clapp-VCO operates from 18.8 to 22.2 GHz and hot-carrier stressed experimental data indicate that the damage increases the oscillation frequency and degrades the phase noise of oscillator.

The share of power is done autonomously without communication between Converters. Despite the lot of desirable features the Droop method had, there exist some limitations concerning the accuracy of the reactive power shared between converters when line impedance mismatches exist. This paper presents the droop control law for islanded microgrid, and proposes an online state estimation of the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage, which is then used as a feedback signal for the Droop control to accurately share the power between parallel converters. Thus the proposed method keeps the advantages of the Droop control method to manage the power between distributed generations in autonomous fashion without additional communication links.	autonomous robot;characteristic impedance;existential quantification;feedback;impedance matching;microgrid;optimal control;portable c compiler	Hassan Moussa;Jean-Philippe Martin;Serge Pierfederici;Nazih Moubayed	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7793441	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.31348344882967	38.247836157982356	176925

The power amplification module amplifies the output power for ultrasonic transducer. The phase difference detection module detects the phase error by sampling the current and voltage of ultrasonic transducer. To verify the performance of the designed frequency tracking system, contrast experiments between system with frequency tracking and system without frequency tracking were conducted.

7d4c85662ca70abb26e37b2fc40a045fd0369f70	nonisolated high gain dc–dc converter for dc microgrids		DC microgrids are popular due to the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaics and fuel cells. Owing to the low output voltage of these dc power generators, high efficient high gain dc–dc converters are in need to connect the dc microgrid. In this paper, a nonisolated high gain dc–dc converter is proposed without using the voltage multiplier cell and/or hybrid switched-capacitor technique. The proposed topology utilizes two nonisolated inductors that are connected in series/parallel during discharging/charging mode. The operation of switches with two different duty ratios is the main advantage of the converter to achieve high voltage gain without using extreme duty ratio.

However, scheduled or forced isolation can take place. In such conditions, the MicroGrid must have the ability to operate stably and autonomously, requiring the development of suitable control strategies in order to enable MicroGrid islanded operation. The MicroGrid power sources can also be exploited in order to locally promote a service restoration strategy following a general blackout. A sequence of actions for the black start procedure is also identified and it is expected to be an advantage for power system operation in terms of reliability as a result from the presence of very large amounts of dispersed generation in distribution grids.	circuit restoration;microgrid	C.

For the same operating conditions, qSBI has the following advantages over qZSI: 1) Three capacitors are saved; 2) the current rating on both of its switches and diodes is lower; 3) its boost factor is higher with an equivalent parasitic effect; and 4) its efficiency is higher. However, qSBI has one more active switch and one more diode than Z-source/ qZSIs. In addition, the capacitor voltage stress of qSBI is higher than that of qZSI. The dc and ac component circuit analysis, impedance design with low-frequency and high-frequency ripples, component stresses, and power loss calculation are presented. A prototype based on a TMS320F28335 DSP is built in order to compare the operating principle of qSBI and qZSI.	boost;characteristic impedance;diode;inverter (logic gate);network analysis (electrical circuits);network switch;power inverter;prototype;semiconductor;solar micro-inverter;z-source inverter	Minh-Khai Nguyen;Young-Cheol Lim;Sung-Jun Park	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2424201	control engineering;electronic engineering;capacitor;inductance;engineering;electrical engineering;capacitance;stress;inductor;physics	EDA	64.13367722046206	42.05161898303614	177139
86c74c272fb9069f347346696d976b908bd8b799	flexible control strategy for mmc to comply with voltage support requirement under unbalanced grid faults		According to the grid codes, grid-connected converters should have the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) and voltage support abilities. In this paper, a flexible control strategy for the modular multi-level converter (MMC) is presented. First, the mathematical models based on Kirchhoff's laws of MMC are analyzed, and a flexible coordinated controller, which is to protect the multi operating variables in the MMC system and implemented in the d-q coordinate, is proposed. In order to achieve the voltage support capability for MMC, the proper injected power can be deduced considering the line characteristic. Finally, the simulating results from MATLAB/ Simulink, and the experimental results from a scaled-down MMC prototype are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed control strategy.

4ae5e9bb04afa1bde6be21c198212db37ee2afe1	analysis of water booster pressure systems as dispatchable loads in smart-grids		Water Booster Pressure Systems (WBPSs) are responsible for supplying water and maintaining pressure in a building pipeline. Whereas there are plenty of buildings using these hydraulic systems, the WBPSs are potentially useful to offer energetic services required by Smart-Grids. Then, it is necessary to evaluate if the systems are dispatchable, and what energy services they can offer. In this work, it is developed a model of a WBPS as a dispatchable load. The model is carried out from first-principles and tuned with experimental data of air pressure, power consumption and water flow. It is shown that the WBPS has the possibility of behaving as dispatchable load by changing the pressure set point. Finally, from the time response to the variation of the set point, WBPS can provide Spinning Reserve Services.	booster (electric power);dynamic dispatch;ibm power systems;linear algebra;low-power broadcasting;mathematical model;response time (technology);smart tv;synchronization (computer science)	Cesar Diaz;Fredy Ruiz;Diego Patino	2017	2017 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT-Europe)	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2017.8260168	atmospheric pressure;booster (rocketry);experimental data;dispatchable generation;control engineering;smart grid;engineering;atmospheric model;hydraulic machinery	Robotics	62.06489699228736	35.07958712309905	177974

The authors have devised a body area network that relies on two innovations; the use of conductive fabrics, and the use of DC powerline communication. By combining these innovations, we have created a truly wearable network that allows full generality of sensor location, spatial distribution of the medium to reduce overall bulk, and maintains sufficiently low line impedance for simultaneous power and data delivery over a single conductor. We have created a method for analysis of the transmission properties of conductive fabric garments. In addition, we evaluate the basic transmission line characteristics of the garment.

In its design one have used the Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) technique in the primary circuit to improve the efficiency by reducing losses caused by MOSFET switches, and the resonant inductive coupling to ensure the energy transfer.

The existing harmonic current sharing strategies suggest a tradeoff between voltage quality and harmonic sharing effectiveness. In this paper, a novel control strategy is proposed to achieve current harmonic sharing by directly controlling the inherent impedance of the inverter. The proposed technique achieves harmonic sharing, in a distributed generation (DG)-based islanded microgrid, without using any communication infrastructure. This paper also proposes a droop technique to distribute the harmonics generated by the nonlinear load as per the kVA ratings of different DG units in the system. The proposed concept of variable inverter impedance and its application in an islanded microgrid is validated using experimental studies.	characteristic impedance;control theory;discontinuous galerkin method;microgrid;nominal impedance;nonlinear system;power inverter	Preetha Sreekumar;Vinod Khadkikar	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2574308	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;electrical impedance;harmonic analysis;control theory;mathematics;resistance	EDA	64.92730172729804	38.72938894229639	178413

As originally proposed in the literature, hybrid active filters were presented to improve the physical limitation of tuned passive filters. A new conditioner named smart impedance is proposed to eliminate the need of passive filter tuning procedure, the whole tuning process is performed electronically. The proposed topology is able to manipulate the displacement power factor and perform multiple frequency harmonic current mitigation at the same time. In weak systems, where the source impedance is not negligible, like in smart grids, smart impedance guaranties the voltage regulation and stability. The smart impedance control strategy uses proportional resonant controller, which allows phase-locked loop-less power system synchronization. Smart impedance system is composed of an active converter, a coupling transformer, and a capacitive unit, arranged as three phase or single phase equipment.	active filter;characteristic impedance;control theory;digital photo frame;displacement mapping;distortion;filter bank;nominal impedance;output impedance;phase-locked loop;resonance;smart tv;transformer;voltage regulation	Robson B.

In the proposed technique, fault signature dictionaries are generated from the currents in the power supply bus. To obtain signatures rich in information for efficient diagnosis, the transistors in the circuit are forced to operate in all regions of operation by using a ramp signal at the supply instead of the conventional constant dc signal. The signatures are then clustered into different groups using a Kohonen neural network classifier. This technique has the potential to detect and diagnose single andmultiple shorts as well as open circuits. The theoretical and experimental results of the proposed technique are verified using a CMOS Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) circuit.		Shyam S.

Its pumping operation is based on cascading several crossconnected NMOS voltage doubler stages. For very low-voltage applications (1.2 V, 0.9 V), where the performance of the NMOS transistors is limited due to body effect, two improved versions of the charge pump with cascaded voltage doublers (charge pump with CVD) are also proposed. The first utilises PMOS transistors (charge pump with CVD-PMOS) in parallel to the cross-connected NMOS transistors, while the second improves the pumping gain by boosting the clock amplitude (charge pump with CVD-BCLK). Simulations at 50 MHz have shown that a five-stages charge pump with CVD can achieve a 1.5–8.4 V voltage conversion. For the same stage number and frequency, an output voltage of 4 and 7.3 V can be generated from 0.9 V, by using the charge pump with CVD-PMOS and the charge pump with CVD-BCLK, respectively.	cmos;charge pump;chemical vapor deposition;computer simulation;nmos logic;pmos logic;pumping (computer systems);transformer;transistor;voltage doubler	Yiannis Moisiadis;Ilias Bouras;Angela Arapoyanni	2002	VLSI Design	10.1080/1065514021000012084	electronic engineering;charge pump;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;low voltage	EDA	61.81221603440509	46.195676761363075	178664

From the “system” perspective of the grid, increased wind penetration carries responsibility for greater participation in grid frequency regulation, a function historically provided by traditional synchronous generators. From the “component” perspective of the individual turbine, requirements for long mechanical life and low maintenance translate to a need for control imposing low stress on the drivetrain/gearbox. Recent literature has tended to treat these two separately, while the work here proposes and analyzes a distributed control design that jointly addresses both. To achieve the required flexibility, available actuation is assumed to be augmented by modest amounts of controllable power from battery storage, along with industry-standard power controls at the wind turbines themselves (i.e., the new control design focus is on the batteries, to supplement standard, existing controls on wind turbines). Novel features of the methodology include: (i) adoption of an “exosystem” state model representing wind speed disturbances; (ii) assurance that actuators remain within saturation limits for modeled disturbances (e.g., batteries within their maximum power capability); (iii) use of a modest number of phasor unit measurements at the distributed controllers to enhance observability in relevant modal subspaces.	distributed control system;estimation theory;ibm power systems;letter-quality printer;maximum power transfer theorem;modal logic;phasor;rechargeable battery;requirement;test case	Chaitanya A.

The implemented ultrasonic subsystem, based on ultrasonic PZT ceramic discs driven in their low-frequency, radial/planar-excitation mode, further ensures that 29 μW of power is delivered 70 mm deeper inside a homogenous liquid environment-with no acoustic matching layer employed-with an efficiency of 1%. Overall system power consumption is 2.3 W.

The proposed strategy was first designed to control the torque in discontinuous-conduction mode and then extended to operate in CCM as well. With CCM, the torque can be increased at high speed without modifying the number of turns, the source voltage, or the converter; it is achieved through the control. Reviews of past control strategies, as well as the principle of this mode and its influence on the machine performance, are presented. The advantages and drawbacks of the proposed strategy are outlined. In particular, the power and torque densities of the SRM are improved so that this machine becomes comparable with ac machines without the drawback of field weakening. A new control law has been studied and implemented; simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.	booster (electric power);control theory;dicom;field-programmable gate array;lisp machine;mathematical induction;maximal set;multistage interconnection networks;nominal power (radio broadcasting);online and offline;optimal control;power inverter;simulation	Hala Hannoun;Mickaël Hilairet;Claude Marchand	2011	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2011.2124478	system on a chip;control engineering;electronic engineering;optimal control;digital control;network switch;computer science;engineering;control theory;electronic speed control;supplier relationship management;torque;field-programmable gate array;direct torque control	Robotics	66.8484143348982	39.88511198857913	179646

Firstly, a new distribution network reconfiguration model considering access of energy storage devices is built. This model takes the minimum of network losses as objective function and considers the new constraints of power and voltage caused by the energy storage devices. The dual power flow directions are also considered in reconfiguration schemes. The improved genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed model to get the optimal reconfiguration scheme. Lastly, two distribution networks with access of energy storage devices are tested to verify the correctness and effectiveness of proposed method.	converge;correctness (computer science);genetic algorithm;loss function;optimization problem;radial (radio)	Qinghong Wang;Guangkai Li;Qinghong Wang;Xu Yang;Peng Wu	2016	2016 3rd International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI)	10.1109/ICSAI.2016.7810944	parallel computing;real-time computing;control reconfiguration;control theory;energy storage	EDA	64.36890244726831	32.356568303738655	179910
22e407b03a1af2db7b56769da90428ca005ff6d1	an adjustable sensorless shoot-through protection for h-bridges		The converters relying on H-bridge configurations exhibit complementary “symmetrical” switching devices for which a triggering dead-time must be considered in order to prevent shoot-through faults. There are two ways in which such dead-time is usually added to the bridges' input signals; namely, from the switching program itself, and by using dedicated embedded modules inside micro-controllers. There are also protections that sense the semiconductors' current to identify and avoid its increase above some threshold. However, those techniques rely on programming skills, operating robustness-against noise, supply variations, IC's malfunctioning, etc.-or in surging currents which are anyhow undesired. In this work, an adjustable and sensorless shoot-through protection is presented as a physical circuit to mend the triggering signals if needed, so the desired dead-times are enforced. The circuit has been prototyped and tested against faulty and non-faulty signals to evaluate its proper operation.

A wide zone can be created over which power transfer is relatively constant. This gives good tolerance to the alignment of the pickup relative to the track allowing simple low-cost pickup structures to be used. While three-phase IPT tracks make the vehicle pickup and power transfer simpler, they are difficult for the power supply to drive due to the presence of mutual coupling between the track phases resulting from the physical layout of the track. These mutual inductances induce voltages within each track phase that, because of the inductor-capacitor-inductor network, cause large currents within the power supply inverter and imbalances within the system. This paper presents an analytical assessment of the problems caused by the interphase mutual inductance, and three possible solutions. Two of the methods involve modifications to the track layout to alter or remove the mutual inductances, while the third and preferred technique requires additional ferrite cores between the various phases to compensate this adverse mutual inductance without affecting the power transfer to the pickup loads.	clock rate;denial-of-service attack;ferrite (magnet);inductive coupling;information processes and technology;integrated circuit layout;interphase;polyphase matrix;polyphase quadrature filter;power inverter;power supply;thread (computing);toroidal graph;transformer;two-phase commit protocol;unbalanced circuit	Michael L.

Using only (n+1) power switches, this topology is able to achieve full single-pulse operation, thereby reducing switching losses and acoustic noise. It also achieves a greater demagnetizing voltage compared to the basic buck-fronted topology, without having to increase the DC-source voltage. The converter is more robust as its dump capacitor stops being charged if the chopper switch fails.

A switching frequency of around 200 kHz for the transistors successfully reduces the volume of these isolation transformers, whereas insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are not capable of achieving such a high switching speed. The high-voltage tolerance of SiC MOSFETs, 1200 V, enables increasing the input voltage up to 600 V. High-voltage tolerance, on the other hand, is not compatible with low on-resistance for Si MOSFETs. A three-phase circuit topology is used to achieve up to 5 kW of power capacity for the converter and reduce per-phase current at the same time. Current-balancing transformers among these three phases effectively suppress a maximum peak current from arising in the circuit, a technique that miniaturizes the input and output capacitances. The conversion efficiency of the converter reaches 97.6% at 5-kW operation.	cineon;circuit topology;clock rate;electric power conversion;input/output;insulated-gate bipolar transistor;lunar lander challenge;power mosfet;principle of good enough;sic-povm;transformers;vehicle identification number	Yusuke Nakakohara;Hirotaka Otake;Tristan M.

The negative impacts caused by DGs should be reduced inside the microgrid. Photovoltaic (PV) generation is one of the major distributed energy sources, and the performance of PV generation systems connected to microgrid directly affects power quality and other technical indexes of the microgrid. Thus, the research of flexible microgrid connection control for PV generation system has both theoretical significance and practical value. This paper makes a concise exposition on the    $H_{\boldsymbol {\infty }}$    control theory and applies this theory to the flexible microgrid connection control for PV generation systems. This paper focuses on the specific situation where the microgrid is grid tied to the main power grid. We establish the mathematical model of PV generation system and adopt the    $H_{\boldsymbol {\infty }}$    control theory to design a voltage tracking controller. Theoretical analysis proved that our control system is internally stable. Simulations under six different conditions are performed using MATLAB/Simulink, and the results demonstrate that the grid-tied PV generation system using    $H_{\boldsymbol {\infty }}$    controller has high control accuracy and robustness.

To tackle this issue, in this work, a reconfigurable rectifier with adjustable conversion ratio is proposed without affecting the matching with the antenna under different configurations. Based on this, a UHF (900 MHz) energy harvesting system with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is proposed. The system is implemented using TSMC 65 nm CMOS process. Post-layout HSPICE simulation is performed for verification. With the MPPT, the reconfigurable rectifier is always configured to achieve the maximum efficiency.	cmos;maximum power transfer theorem;radio frequency;reconfigurable computing;rectifier;spice 2;simulation;ultra high frequency	Xing Li;Chi-Ying Tsui;Wing-Hung Ki	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2015.7168578	control engineering;embedded system;power-flow study;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;energy harvesting;radio frequency	EDA	59.10594903132673	45.97687495587412	180844

The 49 levels are achieved by stacking three 17-level inverters. Each of the 17-level inverter is developed by cascading a flying capacitor (FC) inverter with three capacitor-fed H-bridges. The device count can be reduced by making the FC and the three cascaded H-bridges common to the dc link in each phase using selector switches in between them. The selector switches need to operate at fundamental frequency only. Also, the devices need to block very low voltages. Hence, MOSFETs can be used. This topology requires three dc sources, each of $V_{\text{dc}}$ /6 only, which can be replaced with stacked batteries for electric vehicle applications. The reduction in the dc voltage requirement is achieved by using a normal symmetric six-phase induction motor with parallel connection of the opposite phase windings. All the floating capacitors in the topology can be balanced irrespective of any modulation index or load power factor. Due to the high number of voltage levels, nearest level control can be used instead of pulse width modulation, which reduces the switching losses. The  $dv/dt$ during the inverter operation is also less. Detailed experimental results at different speeds of operation and during transients ensure that the novel topology can be a viable option for high-power adjustable speed drives.	charge pump;inverter (logic gate);network switch;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;series and parallel circuits;stacking;transient (computer programming)	Viju Nair R;K.

This new application of RPI simplifies the circuit design by using fewer components, and has lower power losses than conventional driver circuits. The circuit employs two resonant MOSFETs and zero-voltage-switching technique to generate an asymmetric pulse train with moderate rising and falling time to drive the data electrodes of a PDP. The circuit also recovers the reactive energy from the PDP, like conventional energy recovery circuits. Power losses are further reduced by adding a dc offset voltage to the pulse train. The power consumptions of different driving circuits are assessed. The proposed circuit is tested on a dual-scan 42-in SVGA ac plasma display panel and is found to be practical.	circuit design;device driver;dual scan;plasma display;power inverter;super video graphics array;switch	Kun-Ming Lee;Chern-Lin Chen;Shin-Tai Lo	2003	IEEE Trans.

A particular challenge is related to ensuring the correct and reliable operation of protection schemes. Implementing smarter protection in the form of adaptive setting selection is one way of tackling some of the protection performance issues. However, introducing such new approaches especially to safety critical systems such as protection carries an element of risk. Furthermore, integrating new secondary systems into the substation is a complex and costly procedure. To this end, this paper proposes an adaptive protection architecture that facilitates the integration of such schemes into modern digital substations which are a staple of smart grids. Functional features of the architecture also offer powerful means of de-risking schemes and flexible implementation through self-contained modules that are suitable for reuse. An example adaptive distance protection scheme is presented and tested to demonstrate how the architecture can be implemented and to highlight the architecture's novel features.	software deployment;traction substation	Ibrahim Faiek Abdulhadi;Federico Coffele;Adam Dysko;Campbell D.

The proposed topology implements a conditioning scheme described by a rectangular charge-voltage cycle (QV-cycle) of tunable aspect ratio. These circuits show an exponential increase of the converted energy over operation time if studied in the sole electrical domain. The QV-cycle's aspect ratio can be set to values that were previously inaccessible with other exponential conditioning circuits. After a brief intuitive presentation of the new topology, its operation is rigorously analyzed and its dynamics are quantitatively derived in the electrical domain. In particular, the aspect ratio of the rectangular QV-cycle describing the biasing scheme of the transducer is expressed as a function of the circuit's parameters. Practical considerations about the use of the reported conditioning circuits in actual e-KEHs are also presented. These include a discussion on the applications of the proposed conditioning, a description of the effects of electrical nonidealities, and a proposition of an energy extracting interface.	biasing;cvar;charge pump;circuit topology;computer simulation;diagram;emoticon;mathematical optimization;multistage interconnection networks;numerical analysis;operation time;paging;semiconductor industry;series and parallel circuits;series-parallel graph;steady state;time complexity;transducer;voltage doubler	Armine Karami;Dimitri Galayko;Philippe Basset	2017	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2016.2603064	control engineering;electronic engineering;capacitor;transducer;electrical engineering;kinetic energy;capacitance;energy transformation;quantum mechanics;electrostatics	EDA	66.43647855821679	44.414231254893664	181592

However, high cost and slow dynamic response of FC still persist as the main hurdles for wider applications. To remedy this problem, an energy storage system with adequate power capacity has to be incorporated. This paper presents a novel control design for FC-battery hybrid power system which enables both active current sharing and power source management control in such hybrid systems. Different hybrid power system structures are investigated and evaluated; dual-converter structure and four modes of operation are defined to provide efficient and sustainable solution to such a hybrid power system. A novel integrated control system with inherent current sharing and generation mode swapping capability is proposed; based on system component status, the control system is able to regulate the output power from each source under different scenarios.

ef87a415beedb2592e548a69948d87ad0256eee2	selective wireless power transfer via magnetic resonant coupling by using variable impedance circuit		Recently, Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) via Magnetic Resonant Coupling is especially focused around the world. Since a space will have a lot of devices in the future, WPT considering multiple devices will be required. It is important to consider not only power transfer efficiency but also power distribution when power is wirelessly transferred to multiple devices. The amount of received power in a receiver depends on the impedance of the receiver and the ratio of power distribution has the relation to the impedance. Conventional WPT system requires a few controllable repeaters and the large size of the receiver. In this paper, a variable impedance circuit for power distribution is proposed. Using the proposed circuit controllable by DC voltage, the problem for the conventional system is solved. In the future when WPT is popular, the circuit realizes electrically controllable power distribution.

An improvement in performance to the conventional distance relay is expected, once the ANNs can learn the different fault conditions as well as network changes in order to operate in less time correctly. In this work, the relay protection zone (96% of a transmission line length) was determined by forward and reverse single-line-to-ground fault condition. The input data shows the trip/no trip decision of a protection system. The approach used in this paper utilizes the voltage and current post-fault samples as input to a moving data window. The implemented neural network should capture the knowledge for the correct relay operation facing the different network conditions.	artificial neural network	Mário Oleskovicz;Denis V.

Therefore, the temperature monitoring and the induced power management become more and more critical. The thermal fluctuation effects of the recently discovered spintronic memristor make it a promising candidate as a temperature sensing device. In this paper, we carefully analyzed the thermal fluctuations of spintronic memristor and the corresponding design considerations. On top of it, we proposed a temperature sensing circuit design by combining spintronic memristor with the traditional CMOS current reference. Our simulation results show that the proposed design can provide high accuracy of temperature detection within a much smaller footprint compared to the traditional CMOS temperature sensor designs. As magnetic device scales down, the relatively high power consumption is expected to be reduced.	cmos;circuit design;memristor;power management;quantum fluctuation;simulation;spintronics	Xiuyuan Bi;Chao Zhang;Hai Li;Yiran Chen;Robinson E.

The basic task of the harvester is to convert vibrational into electrical energy. As these energy harvesting devices shrink in dimensions, while still providing sufficient energy, they will be key enablers for wireless autonomous sensor networks. For such a purpose, vibration harvesters are being investigated which feature a footprint of 1 cm2 and an average power harvesting level of 100 μW. A detailed description of the design and fabrication for the piezoelectric, electrostatic and electromagnetic harvester is given. Furthermore, the interaction between a piezoelectric vibration energy harvester, the power converter and the energy storage system is investigated. A system level approach, including mechanical and electrical domains, is pursued for impedance matching between both domains in order to investigate the physical design aspects of the energy harvester on the electrical domain. Two matching methods, such as complex and real matching, are presented and compared to each other. Finally, several energy storage systems are briefly presented in order to store the irregular available scavenged energy and supply the functional circuitry in the system like sensor(s), signal processing and transceiver. In order to reduce power consumption, the transceiver operates in pulsed load condition which makes the energy storage system crucial.	intelligent agent	Bert Op het Veld;Dennis Hohlfeld;Valer Pop	2009	Information Systems Frontiers	10.1007/s10796-009-9160-5	physical design;embedded system;impedance matching;wireless sensor network;ambient intelligence;electromagnetism;computer science;piezoelectricity;signal processing;energy storage;energy harvesting	Robotics	57.59137544994634	44.56003538314508	183407

The proposed converter can regulate output voltage within wide range of the power and input voltage variations. Proposed converter does not require snubbers or resonant switches and with proposed control sequence ensures switches operation under soft-switching conditions in all transient states. Soft-switching in semiconductors allows achieving high efficiency. Moreover, the input side current is continuous. The operating principle for the energy transfer from the current-fed to voltage-fed side is described, design guidelines along with experimental verification of the proposed converter are shown in this paper.

Macroscopic Penning traps allow for the containment of a few to a few million atomic ions whose internal states may be used in quantum information experiments. Ions are laser Doppler cooled [1], and the mutual Coulomb repulsion of the ions leads to the formation of crystalline arrays [5, 6, 7, 8]. The structure and dimensionality of the resulting ion crystals may be tuned using a combination of control laser beams and external potentials [9, 10]. We discuss the use of two-dimensional 9Be+ ion crystals for experimental tests of quantum control techniques. Our primary qubit is the 124 GHz ground-state electron spin flip transition, which we drive using microwaves [11, 12]. An ion crystal represents a spatial ensemble of qubits, but the effects of inhomogeneities across a typical crystal are small, and as such we treat the ensemble as a single effective spin. We are able to initialize the qubits in a simple state and perform a projective measurement [1] on the system. We demonstrate full control of the qubit Bloch vector, performing arbitrary highfidelity rotations (τπ ∼200 μs). Randomized Benchmarking [13] demonstrates an error per gate (a Pauli-randomized π/2 and π pulse pair) of 8±1×10−4. Ramsey interferometry and spin-locking [14] measurements are used to elucidate the limits of qubit coherence in the system, yielding a typical free-induction decay coherence time of T2 ∼2 ms, and a limiting T1ρ ∼688 ms. These experimental specifications make ion crystals in a Penning trap ideal candidates for novel experiments in quantum control. As such, we briefly describe recent efforts aimed at studying the error-suppressing capabilities of dynamical decoupling pulse sequences [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], demonstrating an ability to extend qubit coherence and suppress phase errors [11, 12]. We conclude with a discussion of future avenues for experimental exploration, including the use of additional nuclear-spin-flip transitions for effective multiqubit protocols, the potential for hardware refinements to suppress qubit error rates well-below predicted fault-tolerance thresholds, and possibilities for single-ion addressing useful for the realization of complex entangled states.	bloch sphere;coherent control;coupling (computer programming);dynamical decoupling;electron;experiment;fault tolerance;ground state;lock (computer science);microwave;quantum information;qubit;ramsey's theorem;randomized algorithm;trap (computing)	Michael J.

By establishing the mathematical model of the grid-connected inverter around the zero-crossing points (ZCPs), the reason for causing the current ZCD is presented. It is ascribed to the slope of the actual current less than that of the reference one around the ZCPs. The expressions of the critical phase angle (the starting point of the current ZCD) and the amplitude of the current distortion corresponding to the parameters of the inverter and connected utility grid are obtained, and the solution for the ZCD based on on-line leading phase angle compensation is proposed.

The improved dynamic model is obtained thanks to a revised state transition equation of the rotating phasor and its derivatives. The proposed approach is assessed with dynamic compliance tests defined in the synchrophasor standard and in a power system test case. As the results show, the modified TKF can track the time-varying behavior of dynamic phasors under non-steady state conditions in power systems. It achieves good estimation performance without manually adjusting the Kalman gain as in the existing solution. Thus, the modified TKF fully exploits the self-adaptive nature of the Kalman filter principle.	ibm power systems;kalman filter;mathematical model;overshoot (signal);phasor;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;state transition table;steady state;system testing;test case	Junqi Liu;Fei Ni;Junjie Tang;Ferdinanda Ponci;Antonello Monti	2012	2012 3rd IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Europe (ISGT Europe)	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2012.6465846	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;extended kalman filter	Robotics	67.94243232977256	37.54602810925814	185076

To this end, we introduce the notion of p-robustness as the capability of ensuring the proper functioning of the electric power grids, in the sense of guaranteeing generic controllability of the associated dynamical system, under arbitrary p transmission line failures. Then, we provide conditions under which the electric power grid is p-robust, and an algorithm that determines the minimum number of transmission lines in the electric power grid that is need to add in order to transform a non-robust (0-robust) electric power grid into a 1-robust electric power grid. Further, we discuss how the methodology can be extended to ensure p-robustness with a relatively small number of additional transmission lines. We present an illustrative example of the proposed analysis and methodology using the IEEE 39-bus system, whose dynamical model is described by 127 state variables.	algorithm;dynamical system;electronic switching system;fault detection and isolation;hybrid system;network topology;transmission line	Guilherme Ramos;Sergio Daniel Pequito;Antonio Pedro Aguiar;Soummya Kar	2015	2015 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2015.7331082	control engineering;power-flow study;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;engineering;control theory	EDA	63.62331467986108	38.67111098419657	185532
b3d59f64dde176a044d2b7efb73cfd0880d16ca3	enhanced next generation alternator	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	The power requirements of automotive alternators are increasing significantly due to the introduction of new vehicle electrical loads. Moreover, the possible transition to a 42 V electrical system is introducing new concerns regarding the load dump overvoltage transient of alternators. This thesis makes several contributions to the power density, efficiency, and transient performance of future alternators. A comparison and design optimization of four alternator types is conducted to identify the least cost alternator that meets the challenging requirements of future automobiles. Alternator designs with conventional diode rectifiers and switched-mode rectifiers are investigated. It is found that optimized Lundell alternators are capable of meeting the demands of future systems, and that wound field synchronous machines may also be competitive. It is also found that incorporation of a simple switched-mode rectifier enables substantial improvements in designs optimized for their use. The behavior of the Lundell alternator under load dump transient conditions is studied. It is found that rotor eddy currents limit the rate at which the machine can be de-excited to terminate the transient overvoltage. Models for the de-excitation process are developed based on experimental measurements, and new field control circuits are proposed that provide fast field de-excitation. The use of foil field windings in Lundell alternators to improve alternator power density is also explored. Foil field windings are shown to provide higher conductor packing factors than conventional wire wound fields (e.g. 73% as opposed to 64% for a typical wire wound design) and offer improved thermal transfer properties. These advantages are demonstrated to enable significant increases in field ampere turns and achievable alternator output power. However, realizing these advantages requires new field excitation circuits that can deliver high field currents at low voltages, without exceeding the limited current ratings of alternator brushes. Two new field excitation circuits capable of meeting the needs of foil field windings are developed and experimentally demonstrated. The first field excitation circuit is based on the use of a coreless printed circuit board transformer with a rotating secondary for contactless transfer of power to the rotor. A stationary inverter delivers high frequency ac to the transformer primary, and the power received by the transformer secondary is rectified and delivered to the field. This approach eliminates the need for brushes, and their associated wear and current limitations. This rotating transformer topology is designed, built and tested at standstill with a foil wound bobbin. Experimental results demonstrate that a 51% increase in ampere turns on the rotor can be delivered with this approach, which is more than sufficienct for practical applications. The second class of field excitation circuits developed in this thesis uses a DC/DC converter on the rotating side to provide a step down in voltage and a step up in current for the foil field. Control information is communicated to the rotating converter to regulate the field. An experimental alternator implementing a foil field winding and this excitation circuit is developed and experimentally validated. Tests at idle speed demonstrate an improvement of 15% in alternator output power, and an approximate increase of 30% in field ampere turns for similar temperature limits. It is anticipated that significantly larger power improvements could be achieved if the alternator stator were redesigned to take advantage of this improved field capability.

The output voltage regulation is normally achieved by an outer voltage feedback loop and a sinusoidal pulse-width-modulated (SPWM) inner current loop. Due to output voltage disturbances, such as those produced by a capacitive load, the inner current loop can be easily driven into over-modulation and possible six-step operating regions. Current research efforts have focused on extending the linearity of the modulated voltage in the over-modulation range to reduce the input current harmonics and on studying the closed-loop stability via conventional small-signal linearization around a fixed operating point. Such linear techniques obviously fall short of predicting large-signal transient stability. In this paper, catastrophic bifurcation of the three-phase voltage-source converter is reported. The physical origin of the phenomenon is identified. Boundaries of catastrophic bifurcation in the parameter space are derived. The phenomenon has been verified experimentally.	bifurcation theory;clamping (graphics);current loop;experiment;feedback;large-signal model;nonlinear system;operating point;pulse-width modulation;rectifier;small-signal model;solar cell;switched-mode power supply;transfer function;voltage regulation;voltage source	Meng Huang;Siu Chung Wong;C.

55fc5ad167dfa59eec38e64d596e436049f26d21	injection-locked power oscillator for resonance frequency tracking in wireless power transfer		This paper presents a transmitter architecture for wireless power transfer with automatic resonance frequency tracking to maintain high efficiency over wide variations of antenna distance. By injection-locking the source oscillator to the output resonance in a positive feedback loop, the closed-loop transmitter functions as a power oscillator with the oscillation frequency determined by the most dominant resonance in the coupled antennas. We show that this frequency tracking minimizes the change in input impedance presented to the power amplifier (PA), and hence mitigates mismatch that can cause a sharp non-linear drop in PA efficiency. The power oscillator was tested well above and below critical coupling, and maintained PA efficiency above 60 % even when highly over-coupled at 25 % spacing (10mm/40mm) below critical coupling. Compared to an open-loop system, the charging range with efficiency over 50 % is doubled.

3d047847abc4c098da5ac9796943ff3827f29b9e	an efficient approach to handle the problem of load flow divergence in phasor based simulators		Dynamic behavior and stability of power systems can be studied with phasor-based programs in a reasonable time. Dynamic simulation of power systems needs to be initialized by Load Flow (LF) solutions. However, LF solutions may diverge in some critical conditions. This paper proposes an efficient Transient Stability (TS) based method to overcome the problem of load flow divergence in phasor-based power system simulators. The main idea is using the capability of TS module in such packages in order to overcome the divergence problem in fast-decoupled load flow (FDLF) method. This article focuses on LF convergence in networks with high R / X ratios branches such as distribution systems and microgrids. Suggestions for speeding up the convergence time and preventing of angle instability during TS simulation are described. The proposed methodology can be utilized in TS programs that use FDLF method for solving LF problems. The obtained accurate simulation results in a reasonable time show the efficiency and practical applicability of the proposed method. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Quasi-Z source qZS indirect matrix converter can provide high voltage gain and ensure a sinusoidal input current without additional input filter, which requires 12 power switches in rectifier stage. In this paper, a simplified qZS indirect matrix converter is proposed to overcome aforementioned limitations and achieve 1 higher voltage gain than 0.866, 2 less power switches, and 3 LC-filter function integrated in qZS network to avoid additional filter. The new converter's operating principle and equivalent circuits are analyzed, and the modulation method is presented. The input current closed-loop control is employed to implement sinusoidal input current waveform even though the proposed converter has less power switches and without extra input filter. A test bench is used to verify the simplified qZS indirect matrix converter and control methods. Simulation and experimental results identically validate the proposed converter system with wide voltage gain range and low input current harmonics.

0f740d18fc38cd05c9ac1d6bc7cbc6a97babc920	a new technique for simultaneous load current sharing and voltage regulation in dc microgrids		Regulating the output voltage of distributed generation units while maintaining proper power sharing among them is a challenging control issue in dc microgrids. This paper presents a new technique to regulate the voltage levels across the dc microgrid loads and achieve proper load current sharing among the distributed generation units without directly regulating their output voltages. To implement the proposed technique, a hybrid communication scheme comprising a centralized scheme for load current sharing and a decentralized scheme for load voltage regulation is proposed. The dynamic performance of the investigated dc microgrid is examined under different operating conditions through extensive digital computer simulation analyses in MATLAB. The simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed technique under different operating and loading conditions including constant impedance, power, and current loads, communication link failure, and plug-and-play feature of the distributed generation units.	centralized computing;characteristic impedance;computer simulation;matlab;microgrid;plug and play;voltage regulation	Made Andik Setiawan;Ahmed Abu-Siada;Farhad Shahnia	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2017.2761914	control engineering;computer science;vehicle dynamics;real-time computing;voltage;distributed generation;electrical impedance;voltage regulation;energy storage;microgrid	Arch	64.29239576604161	37.80307319999163	187372

In this scenario, the transmission of electrical energy over long distances has become a key issue and high voltage DC (HVDC) transmission systems have demonstrated to be the best cost effective solution. Among the different HVDC technologies, modular multilevel converters (MMC) provide the highest power quality, modularity, reliability and availability. In this paper, the control of two HVDC stations based on MMC is proposed. A set of power and voltage limits are defined for each station and the control scheme is designed to work inside these limits. Due to this operation mode, the controller in one station does not require information from the other station. The different operating modes of the MMC-HVDC transmission system are analized and simulation results are obtained, in order to validate the proposed control strategy.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;control theory;electric power quality;local variable;midi machine control;memory management controller;prospective search;simulation	Ricardo Lizana;Marcelo A.

Often aircraft weight reduction is the focus, with due consideration also given to safety, function, and performance. Aircraft weight reduction directly translates into fuel savings followed by reduced CO2 emission, and thus it supports environmental protection. A set of approaches to optimize the electrical system has been investigated for very large modern civil aircraft. Three of these approaches are presented and their benefits and drawbacks are discussed. Firstly the effects of a 230 VAC supply applied to all alternating current consumers of the electrical system are looked at. Secondly the idea of a central power center located in the middle of the aircraft is reviewed. Thirdly the consequences of a shift of allowed voltage drops from one part in the electrical system to others are considered.

Recently, typical commercially used microinveter can achieve high efficiency. By using microinverter system, high Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) efficiency by its small photovoltaic area can be achieved. The proposed circuit is a combination of a gradationally controlled voltage source with low switching frequency, a series connected active filter with high switching frequency and an unfolding circuit.

9b8084ac8dc1292c7fb7bfa15aaf9741b2c51644	a developed two-leg ladder multilevel converter structure		The applications of multilevel converters (MCs) in industry have been increased because of their advantages such as high quality output waveform and lower harmonic distortions. This paper proposes an improved two-leg ladder topology for MC. For generating all levels at output voltage waveform, two methods are investigated for selecting the values of dc sources. The suggested structure generates a large number of levels at output voltage waveform with the least number of power electronic components such as insulated gate bipolar transistors, gate driver circuits, dc voltage sources and anti-parallel diodes in comparison with other similar topologies. Also, the magnitude of blocked voltage by switches is low. Power losses analysis on the proposed topology is provided. It is shown that the number of on-state switches in the presented structure is less than other similar topologies, which causes the voltage drop and power losses of proposed topology to be reduced. To show the merits of the proposed structure,...

Conventionally, a backlight module driving inverter is designed to operate with a low-input DC voltage. Therefore, a buck converter is required to step down the high-output DC voltage of a power factor correction (PFC) pre-regulator. The circuit cost is high and the conversion efficiency is low. In this letter, a high-input-voltage HB resonant inverter with only one transformer is used to drive multiple lamps. Analysis and design considerations are discussed in detail. Simulations and experimental results are close to the theoretical prediction. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	backlight	Yu-Kang Lo;Kai-Jun Pai;Kuan-Hung Wu;Huang-Jen Chiu	2011	I. J.

333842642f8306563db7e585759d62ed6c875716	robust distributed control of dc microgrids with time-varying power sharing		This paper addresses the problem of output voltage regulation for multiple DC/DC converters connected to a microgrid, and prescribes a scheme for sharing power among different sources. This architecture is structured in such a way that it admits quantifiable analysis of the closed-loop performance of the network of converters; the analysis simplifies to studying closed-loop performance of an equivalent single-converter system. The proposed architecture allows for the proportion in which the sources provide power to vary with time; thus overcoming limitations of our previous designs in [1]. Additionally, the proposed control framework is suitable to both centralized and decentralized implementations, i.e., the same control architecture can be employed for voltage regulation irrespective of the availability of common load-current (or power) measurement, without the need to modify controller parameters. The performance becomes quantifiably better with better communication of the demanded load to all the controllers at all the converters (in the centralized case); however guarantees viability when such communication is absent. Case studies comprising of battery, PV and generic sources are presented and demonstrate the enhanced performance of prescribed optimal controllers for voltage regulation and power sharing.	centralized computing;control theory;distributed control system;microgrid;voltage regulation	Mayank Baranwal;Alireza Askarian;Srinivasa M.

Hall sensors are widely used in BLDC motor applications to provide rotor information for phase commutation, but the low angle resolution provided results in torque ripple and reduced efficiency. While the raw angle cannot be used directly, the rotor angle generated with the algorithm can be used in vector control to meet speed and torque demand on the drive with optimum power. The proposed algorithm has been designed to avoid multiplication and division operations for optimal use of FPGA resources to balance economical constraints with computational performance.

However, if the transformer is removed, the galvanic isolation between the PV generator and the grid is lost. This may cause safety hazards in the event of ground faults. In addition, the circulation of leakage currents (common-mode currents) through the stray capacitance between the PV array and the ground would be enabled. Furthermore, when no transformer is used, the inverter could inject direct current (dc) to the grid, causing the saturation of the transformers along the distribution network. While safety requirements in transformerless systems can be met by means of external elements, leakage currents and the injection of dc into the grid must be guaranteed topologically or by the inverter's control system. This paper proposes a new high-efficiency topology for transformerless systems, which does not generate common-mode currents and topologically guarantees that no dc is injected into the grid. The proposed topology has been verified in a 5-kW prototype with satisfactory results.	control system;galvanic isolation;interference (communication);page view;power inverter;prototype;requirement;solar inverter;spectral leakage;transcranial direct-current stimulation;transformer;transformers	Roberto González;Eugenio Gubía;Jesús López Taberna;Luis Marroyo	2008	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.924015	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control system;electrical engineering;photovoltaic system;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;transformer	HPC	63.43400103264483	42.94408415241383	189658

These actions prevent high rotor currents that can be damaging to power electronic converters. Under this condition, DFIGs have to absorb reactive power from the external power grid to provide generator excitation. As a result, it will further depress the voltage at the WF terminal bus and affect the protective relay operation of transmission lines in severe situations. This paper is concerned with the performance of distance relays on a power grid with WFs that are equipped with crowbar circuits. Numerical simulations are conducted on IEEE 39 bus system with WF connections. It is found that the fault on the terminal line of a WF is likely to induce mis-coordination of distance relays, leading to system security problems.	crowbar (circuit);r.o.t.o.r.;relay;server farm;short circuit;simulation;transmission line;ws-coordination	Lina He;Chen-Ching Liu	2013	2013 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)	10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497829	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	62.209896937583856	37.53195110324427	190203

It proposes a simple and inexpensive solution to enhance power quality when a particular connection to the high-voltage transmission network is required. It presents the design of a hybrid active filter topology connected to the MV level of a power distribution system. Its main task is to regulate a 132-kV voltage level. Reconfiguration of the power delivery network imposes new constraints in a distribution substation so that the reactive compensation should be increased. The topology of a shunt hybrid active filter is analyzed. It is built with the series connection of a passive filter and a low-rated active filter. The proposed filter is directly connected to a 13.8-kV level with no need of a step-down transformer. The possibility of different levels of reactive power compensation is implemented. The proposal shows very good performance for different load demands.	active filter;electric power quality;series and parallel circuits;traction substation;transformer	Victor Fabián Corasaniti;Maria Beatriz Barbieri;Patricia Liliana Arnera;María Inés Valla	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2014369	control engineering;electronic engineering;power factor;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;active filter;transformer	HPC	63.737543996181124	40.68692550537481	190937

To address this problem, we model wide area voltage control as a dynamical system under the presence of an adversary that aims to disrupt the network's voltage and steer the system towards voltage collapse. Under this framework, we derive stealthy attack templates that aim to reveal the attack locations and timing that will be most effective on the power grid. From the perspective of defending the grid, the attack templates reveal the critical locations for the optimal distribution of resources to mitigate potential cyber-attacks.

The later does not require synchronization of electrical events with mechanical motion, which eliminates difficulties in gate clocking and the power consumption associated with intelligent control circuitry. However, implementation of asynchronous energy harvesting circuits with the mechanical-to-electrical converter can be detrimental to the performance of the converter when done without concurrent optimization of the mechanical device and the circuit, an aspect mainly overlooked in the literature. This paper carries out system level analysis of electrostatic micro-generators with asynchronous control and charge fly-back mechanism to optimize the useful energy generated by the harvester. Our theoretical and experimental investigations show that there is an optimum value for either the storage capacitor or cycle number for maximum scavenging of ambient energy via asynchronous electrostatic transduction. The analysis also indicates that the maximum power is extracted from the system when approaching synchronization of mechanical and electrical events. However, there is a region of interest where the storage capacitor can be optimized to produce almost 70% of the ideal power, taken as the power harvested with synchronous converters when neglecting the power consumption associated with synchronizing control circuitry. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by measurements on an asynchronous energy harvesting circuit implemented with a macro-scale electrostatic converter prototype.	bioinformatic harvester;clock rate;electric power conversion;electronic circuit;intelligent control;mathematical optimization;maximum power transfer theorem;prototype;region of interest;synchronization (computer science);transduction (machine learning)	Asantha Kempitiya;Diana-Andra Borca-Tasciuc;Mona Mostafa Hella	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2141097	control engineering;synchronization;electronic engineering;capacitor;electrostatic discharge;engineering;electrical engineering;capacitance;energy harvesting;energy transformation;physics;electric generator;electrostatics;intelligent control;region of interest	EDA	59.672721707730645	44.49479864921883	191006

One of the strategy uses the Current Error Space Phasor (CESP)approach, while the other strategy uses the average value of the inverter pole voltage to generate a variable hysteresis band in which the current error oscillates so that nearly constant switching frequency can be achieved. The controller in both the strategies achieves a phase-to-phase harmonic performance that is very near to the voltage controlled VSI fed IM drive, while getting the advantages of the dynamic performance of current controllers. Both strategies have been successfully simulated in MATLAB (Simulink)and experimentally validated using dSPACE-1103 kit on 1HP IM drive.

Space-borne circuits are one of the areas where a custom DC/DC converter design with coupled inductors could be preferred to have a detailed design of all variables. Output voltage regulation can be improved using coupled output inductors on a multiple-output DC/DC converter, and, as demonstrated in this paper, it provides an enhanced stability. This paper presents the small signal analysis of a push-pull converter with seven outputs having all its output inductors coupled together and compares it theoretically to the uncoupled version to demonstrate the stability improvement. The theoretical results are validated by simulating a linear model of the circuit and measuring the frequency response on an experimental prototype.

bb625eb985517b32ccf2ac558c7f07264af001cf	carrier phase shift modulation for reducing the common mode voltage in a two-level three-phase inverter		Due to the ever increasing use of Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) which involves fast switching converters, focus on reducing the Common Mode Voltage (CMV) is picking up pace. Moreover, the application of SiC power electronics switches, which can switch at much higher switching frequencies than conventionel IGBTs, has refocused the attention on converter redesign to mitigate EMI/EMC issues. The reduction in CMV is necessary to limit the Common Mode Currents (CMC) which in turn reduces the inverter induced bearing currents and shaft voltage. This paper introduces a new scheme, which modulates the shift in the carrier wave for eliminating the highest peaks in CMV. Design, analysis, and simulations have been performed and will be discussed here in details. This new method is compared with the conventional PWM methods and to other similar methods for reducing CMV.		Shivang Agrawal;R. S.

More than a possible answer to ultimate miniaturization problem in nanoelectronics, molecular electronics is foreseen as a possible way to assemble a large numbers of nanoscale objects (molecules, nanoparticules, nanotubes, and nanowires) to form new devices and circuit architectures. It is also an interesting approach to significantly reduce the fabrication costs, as well as the energetic costs of computation, compared to usual semiconductor technologies. Moreover, molecular electronics is a field with a large spectrum of investigations: from quantum objects for testing new paradigms, to hybrid molecular-silicon complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices.

This technique compensates lagging power factor loads using inductive energy storage elements instead of electrolytic capacitors (e-caps). Although ubiquitous in power electronic converters, e-caps have well-known failure modes and wear-out mechanisms. Therefore, the capacitors used to store energy in a voltage-sourced inverter (VSI) reactive power compensator require continuous monitoring and periodic replacement, both of which significantly increase the cost of the traditional load compensation technique. MPC of the matrix converter provides reactive power compensation by controlling the input reactive power and the output current to the inductive storage elements. Thus, compared to VSI techniques, the proposed reactive power compensation technique is more reliable and has a longer expected service life that is not limited by failure and wear-out modes of capacitors.	ac/ac converter;power inverter;the matrix	Mohammad B.

This paper proposes an area partitioning algorithm that minimizes both real and reactive power imbalance between generation and load within islands. The proposed algorithm is a smart grid technology that applies a highly efficient multilevel multi-objective graph partitioning technique. Thus, it is applicable to very large power grids. The proposed algorithm has been simulated on a 200- and a 22,000-bus test systems. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the voltage profile of an island after the system reconfiguration compared with the algorithm that only considers real power balance. In doing so, the algorithm maintains the computational efficiency.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;graph partition;load shedding;real-time clock;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;turing test;type system;on-line system	Juan Li;Chen-Ching Liu;Kevin P.

The objective of the book is to present a broad range of topics related to electric power systems to electrical engineering students at the undergraduate level. Chapter 1 presents well-organized general background information: functions and structure of power systems, different types of power generating plants, voltage levels, recent growth trends, and introduction to load flow, economic load dispatch, fault, and stability studies. Chapter 2 reviews basic concepts. This chapter is new and is useful for the reader. Voltage, current, real and reactive power definitions, notations, and positive directions are given for single-phase and threephase systems. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss overhead transmission line positive sequence parameters: series resistance and inductance, and shunt capacitance for single-phase lines, three-phase single and double circuit lines, and for single and bundle conductors up to four subconductors per bundle. The treatment of series resistance, especially that of the skin effect, is significantly shorter than in the second edition of the text. Chapter 5 examines voltage and current relations on short, mediumlength, and long transmission lines, and complex power-flow diagrams in terms of ABCD constants. Chapter 6 is devoted to the representation of power systems: oneline diagrams, symbols, impedance diagrams, per-unit quantities and computations, impedance computations of three-winding transformers, and a review of dc calculating boards. Chapter 7 describes network equations and solutions for simple power-system computations, such as node elimination by star-mesh transformations, loop and node equation formulations, and node elimination technique, after a concise review of matrixes. Network bus admittance and bus impedance matrixes are also discussed somewhat briefly at the end of the chapter. Chapter 8 covers load-flow studies through the analysis of the GaussSeidel and Newton-Raphson iterative methods. Important features of digital-computer programs are also reviewed. Chapter 9 treats some principles of load-flow control. It starts with a review of synchronous machines. Then the roles of excitation and power angle of a synchronous machine are discussed. Capacitor banks, real and reactive power-flow control by regulating transformers (magnitudeand phase-shifting types) are also emphasized. Chapter 10 is concerned with the economic operation of power systems, specifically with the distribution of load between units within a plant, transmission losses, loss coefficients, distribution of load between plants, and includes an updated section on automatic load dispatching. The topic of Chapter 11 is symmetrical three-phase faults on synchronous machines. Transients in RL series circuits, synchronous machine reactances and short-circuit currents, machine internal voltages during transient conditions, and the selection of circuit breakers are covered. The use of the bus impedance matrix in three-phase fault computations is also a part of this chapter. Chapters 12 and 13 contain a discussion of relationships of unsymmetrical phasors and their symmetrical components, the phase shift of positiveand negative-sequence voltages and currents caused by wye-delta transformer banks, power in terms of symmetrical components, sequence impedances and sequence networks, and the derivation and analysis of unsymmetrical fault computations on unloaded generators and power systems. A brief review of the use of the bus impedance matrix for unsymmetrical faults is also given. Chapter 14 is entitled """"Power System Stability"""" and reviews the stability problem, steady-state stability, transient stability quantities and equations (e.g., swing equation), equal-area criterion of stability, and the step-by-step solution of the swing curve for a two-machine system. Digital-computer programs for determining multimachine transient stability and some factors affecting transient stability are also discussed, although briefly. The text ends with an Appendix that contains electrical characteristics of ACSR conductors, synchronous machine constants, typical range of transformer reactances, and ABCD constants for six different networks. The value of the book is enhanced by about 65 numerical examples and about 200 problems (according to the publisher, there are 77 new problems). The reader will appreciate the abundant number of figures, the clear style and logical organization of the text, and the updated content related to modern trends in practice. Instructors of power system analysis courses or practicing engineers might miss some topics, such as the review of cables, zero sequence inductances and capacitances of transmission lines, and discussion of series faults and phasor diagrams for unsymmetrical faults. It would have been helpful to use metric and nonmetric units consistently together, following the guidelines of the IEEE. A comprehensive organized list of references at the end of the text would have been a valuable tool for further studies for the interested reader. In summary, this text is excellent, a welcome addition to the analysis of power systems, and a strong candidate for classroom use in power system analysis courses at the undergraduate level."""	abcd schema;characteristic impedance;coefficient;computation;computer program;diagram;dynamic dispatch;electrical engineering;ibm power systems;impedance parameters;iterative method;mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory;multimachine;newton's method;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);phasor;series and parallel circuits;steady state;system analysis;transformer;transformers;transmission line;whole earth 'lectronic link;y-δ transform	D.

Aiming at the problem of generator overload caused by sudden load applying in such systems, this paper proposes a novel emergency control strategy which increases the inverter output power according to the changing rate of system frequency. This control strategy is based on the constant current control of inverters and voltage and rotate speed droop control of generators. And it effectively solves the generator overload problem and guarantees the continuous power supply for all the loads in the system. The control strategy is validated by time-domain electromagnetic transient simulations.	constant current;control theory;diesel;ibm power systems;inverter (logic gate);inverter device component;iron overload;power inverter;simulation;uninterruptible power supply;voltage	Xueyan Zhang;Lijun Fu;Fan Xin Ma	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216416	electric power system;hybrid power;electricity generation;control theory;control engineering;engineering;voltage;inverter;voltage droop;automatic frequency control;constant current	Embedded	64.30560901057666	38.369233918510574	193634

Comparisons suggest that in an NMOS transistor operating in the linear or saturation region, BSIM-Flicker model is accurate and therefore preferable. In a PMOS transistor, the most suitable model to describe its 1/ f  noise performance in the linear regime is also BSIM-Flicker, whereas SPICE-Flicker is more preferable in saturation. In NMOS transistors, the selected model provides an accurate description of the flicker noise, contrary to PMOS transistors, where simulation models appear to be unreliable and need further improvement.	flicker noise;nmos logic;pmos logic;spice 2;transistor	Thomas Noulis;Stilianos Siskos;Gérard Sarrabayrouse	2007	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2006.09.021	flicker noise;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;noise measurement;electrical engineering;comparative research;simulation modeling;physics	EDA	65.18473800877297	45.99058423186761	194070

92132f55397d8489dabd92611fd728ee12cfe543	enhanced space vector pwm for six to three-phase matrix converter interfacing pmsg with the grid		This paper presents a complete analysis, design and implementation of an enhanced space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) control for six-phase to three-phase grid connected matrix converter. The matrix converter (MC) is designed based on 18 bidirectional switches in order to interface a high performance fault tolerant multiphase permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) to the main utility grid. The proposed converter along with its SVPWM algorithm offers a bidirectional power flow, full control of the input and the output power factor, no limitations on the input and output frequencies, nearly sinusoidal output voltage and input currents and an improvement in the maximum voltage ratio. The MC and its control system are demonstrated, analyzed and discussed with extensive MATLAB/Simulink simulation studies. The simulation results show that the MC based on its proposed SVPWM has a significant improvement in the maximum voltage ratio and the THD which will make it a good candidate for interfacing distributed generators to the utility grid.	ac/ac converter;algorithm;cell-matrix junction;control system;converter device component;fault tolerance;generalized myotonia of thomsen;input/output;interface device component;matlab;magnet <device>;neoplasms, multiple primary;network switch;pokeweed mitogens;pregnant mare serum gonadotropins;pulse-width modulation;simulation;simulink;switch device component;the matrix;total harmonic distortion;voltage;width	Giulio Tozzi;Moataz Elsied;A.

The ESS operates as the isochronous generator, responsible for forming the microgrid voltage and frequency, whereas the WTG and PV distributed energy resources (DER) operate in maximum-power-point-tracking (MPPT) mode. Mitigation solutions in the form of supplementary power control loops, employed on the power-electronic interfaced DERs are proposed in order to enhance the resilience of the microgrid to large voltage deviations resulting from cyber-attacks compromising data integrity. In the event where the supplementary control is no longer capable of compensating for the cyber-induced power mismatch, a load management scheme is proposed to curtail non-critical loads and prevent the microgrid voltage from collapsing. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes on a 25 kV inverter-based microgrid benchmark.	benchmark (computing);computer data storage;data integrity;load management;microgrid;power inverter;simulation	Martine Chlela;Diego Mascarella;Geza Joos;Marthe Kassouf	2016	2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905961	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	HPC	64.53395367846164	37.9771049929775	195079

Therefore a great portion of research is focused on control algorithms for reduction of structural loads, but typically wind turbine rotor is considered to be perfectly symmetrical, and therefore such control algorithms cannot reduce structural loads caused by rotor asymmetries. In this paper, the reduction of wind turbine structural loads caused by rotor asymmetries is discussed. To this aim, suitable transformation of structural loads and control algorithm based on such transformation are proposed. Simulation results show that proposed control algorithm is capable of reducing structural loads caused by rotor asymmetries.	algorithm;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;structural load	Vlaho Petrovic;Mate Jelavic;Mato Baotic	2014	2014 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2014.6862484	aerospace engineering;automotive engineering	Robotics	65.39803063277033	36.117249567228725	195101
4206312a89ba8055b35942b6fe0c62b8c8f47d43	low-voltage ride-through operation of permanent magnet synchronous generator with active and reactive power injection		This paper presents the design and implementation of a grid-connected permanent magnet synchronous generator wind power system with low-voltage ride-through. A control system regulates the constant dc-link voltage and provides the maximum power transfer to the grid by controlling unity power factor. The active power is regulated to reduce the current excess, and the reactive power is injected into the grid to avoid the inverter damage under grid faults. A dc-link voltage controller maintains a constant dc voltage during faults. The proposed control system is experimentally validated for the normal and faulty conditions on a grid-connected wind power system. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system regarding voltage and power control.		Labib Labib;Adel Merabet;Amer M. Y. M.

This is subsequently investigated by means of simulations based on a compact model which includes all major and secondary electro-thermal effects (i.e. latch-up). The results enable an interpretation of the observations and point out how the limits of transient safe operation can be significantly reduced by parasitic effects.	failure analysis;insulated-gate bipolar transistor	Jesús Urresti-Ibañez;Alberto Castellazzi;M.

379de301b33236900b66f6c82f7844d5f8b5bcbd	a battery charging compatible profile for wireless power transfer		Wireless power transfer has been introduced as a proper replacement for conventional cable power transfer systems recently. With the developments of the electric transportation, transferring power wirelessly has been found to introduce several advantages in charging Lithium-Ion batteries. Among different configurations of wireless power transfer, Series Parallel structure is found to be more interesting in high power applications, because of its high voltage gain. This paper investigates almost consistent output voltage of a wireless power transfer system with fixed switching frequency which fits Lithium-Ion battery charging profiles. Moreover, ZVS operation of the switches in rated power is guaranteed in order to avoid MOSFETs switching losses. A method for selecting the compensation capacitors is introduced.

This paper studies a piezoelectric energy harvester for the parasitic mechanical energy in shoes originated from human motion. The harvester is based on a specially designed sandwich structure with a thin thickness, which makes it readily compatible with a shoe. Besides, consideration is given to both high performance and excellent durability. The harvester provides an average output power of 1 mW during a walk at a frequency of roughly 1 Hz. Furthermore, a direct current (DC) power supply is built through integrating the harvester with a power management circuit. The DC power supply is tested by driving a simulated wireless transmitter, which can be activated once every 2-3 steps with an active period lasting 5 ms and a mean power of 50 mW. This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying piezoelectric energy harvesters to power wearable sensors.	activity recognition;activity tracker;bioinformatic harvester;conflict (psychology);durability (database systems);embedded system;embedding;gait analysis;hertz (hz);kinesiology;low-power broadcasting;manuscripts;parasites;piezoelectricity;power management;power supply;prototype;shoes;simulation;thickness (graph theory);transmitter device component;wearable computer;wearable technology;direct current;sensor (device)	Jingjing Zhao;Zheng You	2014		10.3390/s140712497	medical research;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;mechanical engineering	Mobile	57.61801848068945	43.91398266925902	195663
d3b9d06e8d98c8d0fcf85a1548cfdb9309b11e60	anomalous latchup failure induced by on-chip esd protection circuit in a high-voltage cmos ic product	esd protection circuit;power line;chip;electrostatic discharge;high voltage;article	Latchup failure induced by electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection circuits occurred anomalously in a high-voltage IC product. Latchup issues existed at only three output pins, two of which belonged to the top and the other to the side. The layouts of top and bottom output pins are identical, and side output pins have another identical layouts. In our experiments it was found latchup of two top output pins were originated from the latchup of the side output pin, and therefore heat-induced latchup aggravation issue must be noticed during latchup test. Furthermore, large power line current (Idd) existed during triggering this side output pin and led to subsequent latchup. After thorough layout inspection, the layout of this side output pin is identical to all other side output pins except that it has an additional Nwell (NW) resistor of gate-triggered high-voltage PMOS beside. It was later proved by engineering experiments that this NW resistor is the origin of inducing latchup in this product, and a new mechanism was proposed for this latchup failure. Improvements and solutions were also provided to successfully solve the latchup issues of these three output pins. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

ddca116ec5bbb20e0e0f6e036f8ba9ee49ed3928	multi-resonant gate drive circuit of isolating-gate gan hemts for tens of mhz		Research of power supplies for megahertz (MHz) class applications such as a semiconductor manufacturing apparatus, induction heater and wireless transfer is carried out. A liner amplifier is generally used for MHz class applications. The loss of the power devices on a liner amplifier is theoretically high. To reduce the loss, the class E and Φ2 inverters are proposed, and some of the resonant gate drive circuits (GDC) are utilised at those of the gate port. However, the control signal of the GDC becomes complicated due to the additional switches. Moreover, the switches in the GDC perform the hard-switching, and the drive loss can thus be increased. In this study, a multi-resonant gate drive circuit is proposed, and its design method is introduced. It can generate the trapezoidal wave gate-to-source voltage with the simple control signal, and zero voltage switching operation is achieved at the switches of the gate drive circuit. First, its operation is experimentally verified. Secondly, the drive loss is also compared with that of the conventional circuit. Furthermore, its operation with the class E inverter with a cascode GaN high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) is confirmed at the switching frequency 13.56 MHz.

The effects of power sources, electric devices, and cabling on the systems' impedance are investigated to predict frequency-dependent voltage fluctuations and resultant possible interferences. Then, a rapid and accurate method for measuring the impedance of electrical power-net systems in cars is presented. This method is based on a time-domain measurement. At an access point, where an electrical load is to be connected, the power net is loaded with a current pulse with peak amplitudes up to 100 A. The current pulse and the resulting voltage response are digitally recorded versus time. By means of a Fourier transform, the impedance at the access point is computed in a frequency range between 0 Hz [direct current (dc)] and 100 kHz.	characteristic impedance;chassis;electrical load;equivalent circuit;frequency band;impedance matching;nominal impedance;resultant;transcranial direct-current stimulation;wireless access point	Martin Sylvester Bechteler;Christian Michael Schessl;Thomas Franz Bechteler	2010	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2009.2037886	fourier transform;impedance matching;wave impedance;electronic engineering;internal resistance;damping factor;high impedance;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;image impedance;quarter-wave impedance transformer;impedance bridging;input impedance;output impedance;voltage source;negative impedance converter;characteristic impedance	EDA	65.83056095215093	45.84729752101479	196074

It is shown that four-wire DVR do better then the traditional three-wire DVR, unbalance voltage and zero sequence components can be lessened by four-wire DVR effectively, because it provides zero sequence current circuit. However, the interaction between DC-side and AC-side in this topology leads to an unbalance in the DC-link capacitor voltages and it causes zero sequence resonance especially when the DVR is under open loop control.

However, their actual benefits are not yet clearly verified while the energy efficiency can be improved in many ways. The carbon emission benefits from EV is largely diminished if we charge EV with electricity from petroleum power plants due to power loss during generation, transmission, conversion and charging. On the other hand, regenerative braking is direct power conversion from the wheel to battery and one of the most important processes that can enhance energy efficiency of EV. Power loss during regenerative braking can be reduced by hybrid energy storage system (HESS) such that supercapacitors accept high power as batteries have small rate capability.  Conventional charge management does not systematically exchange charge between the supercapacitor and battery. However, asymmetry in acceleration and deceleration as well as battery charging and discharging capability make the supercapacitor state of charge (SoC) management override the efficiency optimization. Unlike previous works, we show how charge migration during idle and cruise/stopping time can be beneficial in terms of energy efficiency and cruise range. Systematic charge migration decouples SoC management and charging efficiency optimization giving a higher degree of freedom to charging efficiency optimization. We demonstrate the proposed charge migration between the supercapacitor and battery improves energy efficiency by 19.4%.	battery charger;computer data storage;electric sheep;electric power conversion;extended validation certificate;mathematical optimization;state of charge	Sangyoung Park;Younghyun Kim;Naehyuck Chang	2013	2013 50th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)	10.1145/2463209.2488854	trickle charging;electronic engineering;regenerative brake;engineering;electrical engineering;automotive engineering;automotive battery;supercapacitor;energy storage	EDA	65.76713102298243	35.651999549274315	196404
c78f1689948dad7cef7d74e9b48df8808303bdf8	space vector modulation technique on single phase sensor-less puc5 inverter and voltage balancing at flying capacitor		This paper presents the design of space vector modulation (SVM) technique to control the switches of single phase sensor-less 5-level Packed U-Cell inverter (PUC5) along with voltage balancing at flying capacitor. To generate five equal voltage levels at the output waveform, which results in reducing total harmonic distortion (THD) the switches of PUC5 should be properly triggered. Utilizing SVM technique by tuning the interval time among the state vectors on PUC5 inverter is discussed at this paper for voltage balancing at auxiliary capacitor. Moreover, appropriate patterns of switching states are used in this paper to reduce the switching losses by minimizing the transition from one state to another state. Simulation results by MATLAB Simulink are presented to validate the capability of proposed modulation technique. Furthermore, a comparison between the results of level shift pulsed width modulation technique (LS-PWM) and SVM is carried out to demonstrate the lower power loss of SVM.

This paper investigates a decentralized management problem of PCSs (Power Conditioning Systems) which are used to interconnect the PV system into the power grid. We consider a real-time pricing strategy of the operator who plays the role of a management office of a PV generation plant. Each PCS determines own set-points of the active and reactive power injections by solving an individual small size optimization problem that includes the conceptual price provided by the operator. This feedback interaction between the operator and PCSs eventually suppresses the voltage deviation. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated through the numerical and real physical experiments.	electric power quality;experiment;interconnection;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;page view;real-time clock;real-time computing;variable pricing	Hikaru Akutsu;Kenji Hirata;Akihiro Ohori;Nobuyuki Hattori;Yoshito Ohta	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963369	operator (computer programming);interconnection;power control;control engineering;computer science;control theory;grid-connected photovoltaic power system;ac power;photovoltaic system;optimization problem;maximum power point tracking	EDA	64.33013637905198	35.7927297127146	196898

These controls are built for installations that are typically heavy, require a lot of power, and don't require close tolerances on the algorithm. However, due to the high correlation of direct solar incidence, solar thermal applications require much stricter tolerances, but can be built with much lower power requirements due to the significantly reduced weight. The proposed system will use an Arduino style microcontroller for a dual axis tracking system. One axis will be an axial “turntable” controlled with a single pneumatic cylinder. The second axis will be angular, and will be controlled with two pneumatic cylinders. The voltage required for this system is 12 VDC, which will allow for flexible energy storage options. The use of a USB enables Arduino will allow an end user to utilize a laptop to run diagnostics when installing the full system to enable optimization of the power generated. Once the system is optimized, it will be able to run without the interface to reduce the power requirement of the control system. This paper will show that the proposed system is energy efficient and cost effective with the ability to integrate with local resources. This system, when combined with a lightweight solar thermal generator, will be an ideal daytime generator for remote installations, especially in those areas with little or no access to traditional grid power.	algorithm;angularjs;apache axis;arduino;control system;cylinder seal;incidence matrix;laptop;mathematical optimization;microcontroller;optic axis of a crystal;requirement;tracking system;usb	Darick W.

Inspired by a previous scheme for optical cavities [Phys. Rev. A 73, 043803(2006)], we employ a superconducting qubit coupled to two nondegenerate quantum modes and use a driving field on the qubit to adequately control the resonator-qubit interaction. Based on the generation of two-mode squeezed vacuum states, firstly we analyze the validity of our model in the ideal situation and then we investigate the influence of the dissipation mechanisms on the generation of the two-mode squeezing operation, namely the qubit and resonator mode decays and qubit dephasing. We show that our scheme allows the generation of highly squeezed states even with the state-of-the-art parameters, leading to a theoretical prediction of more than 10 dB of twomode squeezing. Furthermore, our protocol is able to squeeze an arbitrary initial state of the resonators, which makes our scheme attractive for future applications in continuous-variable quantum information processing and quantum metrology in the realm of circuit quantum electrodynamics.	circuit quantum electrodynamics;decibel;dephasing;information processing;physical review a;qed (text editor);quantum information science;quantum metrology;qubit;superconducting quantum computing	E.

a4fcf946f6b81ae8f95829dce2267af9085379ac	load-frequency control in a multi-source power system connected to wind farms through multi terminal hvdc systems		Abstract This paper addresses the wind farm contribution in frequency control during the integration in the power grid. In the proposed model, the wind farm utilizes inertia control and droop control techniques with the purpose of improving the frequency regulation. In order to achieve optimal results, all the parameters of the controllers for the different units in the power grid are obtained by using a particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and by introducing a modified objective function instead of a conventional objective function e.g., Integral Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE). Also, different constraints such as reheat turbine, time delay, governor dead band and generation rate constraint (GRC) are considered for thermal and hydro units with the aim of studying a more realistic power system, which is the main contribution of this paper when compared to the oth0er works in this field. It is shown that, in case of a perturbation in power demand, the system frequency will recover quickly and effectively in comparison with the traditional approaches. In addition, a sensitivity test is carried out in a single power grid area in order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Then, the system is extended to a multi-area power system using a multi-terminal HVDC for further investigation of the suggested strategy. Simulation results are presented in order to assess the performance of the proposed approach in the power system.	multi-source	Mehdi Tavakoli;Edris Pouresmaeil;Jafar Adabi;Radu Godina;João P. S.

Both dc homopolar and ac synchronous machines were successfully tested from the 1970s to the 1990s. Three different 70-MW generators were recently demonstrated by the SuperGM project in Japan. However, economic considerations with respect to competitive cost combined with the requirement for liquid helium cooling did not make these machines commercially attractive. On the other hand, high-temperature superconductors (HTSs) can operate at much higher temperatures (30-40 K), providing much larger thermal margin and simpler cooling systems. This refrigeration advantage has provided new impetus to the development of such machines for commercial applications. In the last few years, a number of superconducting rotating machines with HTS field windings have been demonstrated and several projects are currently transitioning to advanced development stages. HTS machines with ratings from a few kilowatts to several megawatts have been demonstrated in the United States and Europe. Currently, large high-torque ship propulsion motors, large generator prototypes, and synchronous condensers are under development and are expected to be commercially available in the next few years. Prospects for improved life cycle cost, smaller size, less weight, and higher efficiency benefits are providing incentives for the development of these larger rating HTS machines. This paper reviews the past and recent progress on the worldwide development of industrial-grade superconducting rotating machines utilizing low-temperature superconductor and HTS field windings and provides an outlook on the benefits and opportunities of this new technology.	computer cooling;helium;high-throughput satellite;microsoft outlook for mac;model–view–adapter;multistage interconnection networks;steady state;titanium nitride	Swarn S.

The selective harmonic elimination method is used to eliminate harmonics 11 and 13, working with very low switching frequency, where six-pulse harmonic orders 6k/spl plusmn/1 are eliminated by the delta-wye connection of the transformer. In this way, the input current at the mains is highly sinusoidal with small harmonics starting at frequencies of order 23 and 25. Resonances have been detected, originated mainly by the capacitances of feeding cables and noneliminated harmonics, which produce high-voltage distortion.

Distributed generations (DGs) are predicted to perform an increasing role in the future electrical power system. Expose of the DG, can change the fault current during a grid disturbance and disturb the existing distribution system protection. Fault current limiters (FCLs) can be sorted into L-types (inductive) and R-types (resistive) by the fault current limiting impedance. In this paper, a new SSFCL has been proposed. SSFCLs can provide the fast system protection during a rigorous fault. The act of dynamic damping enhancement via the SSFCL is appraised in the presence of the wind-turbine power generation. Hence, its efficiency as a protective device for the wind-turbine system is confirmed via some case studies by time-domain simulation based on the PSCAD/EMTDC.	characteristic impedance;current limiting;discontinuous galerkin method;lr parser;limiter;power supply;quantum fluctuation;r-type;short circuit;simulation;solid-state drive;vii	Alireza R.

A key concept in the restructuring of the electric power industry is the ability to accurately and rapidly quantify the capabilities of the transmission system. Total Transfer Capability (TTC) is defined as the amount of electric power that can be transferred over the interconnected transmission network in a reliable manner while meeting all of a specific set of defined pre- and post-contingency system conditions. Available Transfer Capability (ATC) is a measure of the transfer capability remaining in the physical transmission network for further commercial activity over and above already committed uses. In this paper, MATLAB software is used to determine the Total Transfer Capability (TTC) of power transfers between different control areas in deregulated power systems without violating system constraints such as thermal, voltage, and stability constraints. The main aim of this paper is to calculate total transfer capability and capacity benefit margin of IEEE 30-bus reliability test system (RTS) for calculation of ATC. The IEEE 30-bus RTS is partitioned into 3 control areas. It is required to calculate the TTC for each control area to enhance the open access of a transmission network by providing a market signal of the capability of transmission systems to deliver electric energy.	advanced transportation controller;computation;ibm power systems;matlab;smoothing	Priti Kachore;M.

The bridge-type floating source circuit suitable for sensor array processing has been proposed to maintain reliable constant drain–source voltage and constant drain current (CVCC) conditions for measuring the threshold voltage variation of ISFET due to the corresponding hydrogen ion concentration in the buffer solution. The proposed circuitry applied to Si3N4 and Al2O3-gate ISFETs demonstrate a variation of the drain current less than 0.1 mA and drain–source voltage less than 1mV for the buffer solutions with the pH value changed from 2 to 12. In addition, the scaling circuitry with the VT temperature correction unit (extractor) and LABVIEW software are used to compensate the ISFET thermal characteristics. Experimental results show that the temperature dependence of the Si3N4-gate ISFET sensor improved from 8mV/1C to less than 0.8mV/1C. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

5e37d28390cb85e3e30b645335273ae3bc66725e	probabilistic optimal storage allocation and operation to ensure voltage stability margin		Voltage Stability has become an issue for many of the today's power systems, due to the uncertain characteristics of loads and renewable energy resources. On the other hand, recent advances in Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) have initiated global interest to harness their potential in enhancing reliability and robustness of power systems. In this paper, optimal placement, sizing, and operation of ESS devices in power systems with embedded wind farms are studied. The objective of the allocation problem is to minimize the required ESS size to be installed such that a desired level of Voltage Stability Margin (VSM) is always ensured. The uncertainties of wind power generation and loads are taken into account, by considering their corresponding probability density functions (PDFs) and using a probabilistic optimization approach. Reactive power capabilities of both ESS devices and wind farms, as well as a 10% extra rating of their associated inverters are also used as additional flexibilities to reduce the required ESS sizes. The method is tested on IEEE 30-bus test system.	embedded system;existential quantification;ibm power systems;inverter (logic gate);mathematical optimization;memory management;phase margin;portable document format;power inverter;stochastic process;viable system model	Ahvand Jalali;Mohammad Aldeen	2017	2017 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe (ISGT-Europe)	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2017.8260104	wind power;renewable energy;robustness (computer science);probabilistic logic;voltage;electric power system;ac power;energy storage;control engineering;computer science	EDA	64.7577007836853	32.339014882784376	198518

The RF performance degradation in terms of cut-off frequency, minimum noise figure, and RF power has been measured and analyzed. The reduction of transconductance is turned out to be one of the major causes of the RF performance degradation. The measurement also shows that the RF performance degradation is more significant than the DC performance degradation. Especially, the degradation of minimum noise figure is the most significant.	hot-carrier injection;radio frequency;silicon on insulator	Byung-Jin Lee;Kyosun Kim;Jong-Tae Park	2004	Microelectronics Reliability	10.1016/j.microrel.2004.07.083	transconductance;mosfet;electronic engineering;engineering;silicon on insulator;cutoff frequency;rf power amplifier;direct current;noise figure;electrical engineering	Networks	63.47795070525942	45.59984384687687	198717
4b917816f8c9edff91b0d0b520df46d1e745b13a	an improved zero-current-switching single-phase transformerless pv h6 inverter with switching loss-free		In this paper, a switching loss-free (SLF) concept for the first six-switches H-bridge inverter (H6-I) topology is proposed. SLF means that its switches are able to operate with soft turn-on and turn-off transitions. In order to implement the SLF goal, a new resonance-trajectory is proposed. Compared with the zero-current-transition H6-I (ZCT-H6-I) topology published in previous literature, the proposed resonance-trajectory can precisely compensate for losses of resonant tanks every switching period. With this intention, an implementing circuit is structured based on the H6-I topology, and its detailed operation principle and performance characteristics are analyzed. As a result, all active switches of the new circuit are switched under zero-current turn-on and zero-current turn-off conditions. Also, the reverse recovery problem of freewheeling diodes is alleviated owing to the zero-current turn-off property of diodes. The SLF target is realized in theory. Finally, experimental results from a 1 kW prototype at 50 kHz switching frequency are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SLF concept in practice. Specifically, the conversion efficiency of the new circuit is over 95% in a wide load range, and there is roughly a 1.5% efficiency improvement compared with the hard-switching H6-I topology.	clock rate;flyback diode;h bridge;network switch;power inverter;prototype;resonance;sandy bridge	Huafeng Xiao;Xiang Lin;Yanqing Li	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2694398	control theory;resonant inverter;control engineering;switching frequency;diode;engineering;energy conversion efficiency;inverter;electronic engineering	EDA	64.22789690589065	42.13279360303754	199016
fcd96e40130a0f9d60474b4db91e3bf3c931f5fd	transient stabilization of multimachine power systems: towards a global decentralized solution	stabilization;power systems;adaptive nonlinear control	A global solution to the problem of transient stabilization of multimachine power system with non-negligible transfer conductances was recently reported. The proposed scheme is a  centralized  nonlinear dynamic controller that ensures global asymptotic stability of the desired operating point. Due to technological and reliability considerations the exchange of information between generators is restricted, hence the need for  decentralized  controllers. The main contribution of this paper is the proof that, using local measurements available with existing technology, it is possible to transform the previous centralized controller into a truly decentralized one—provided the derivative of the active power at each generator can be suitably estimated. Some simulation results using the 10-machine New England benchmark show that transient stability enhancement and voltage regulation under different fault scenarios is effectively achieved.	ibm power systems;multimachine	Diego Langarica-Córdoba;Romeo Ortega;Daniele Casagrande	2015	Eur.

The flexibility of such an approach allows one to easily and quickly control two-level inverters. Furthermore, this approach may be also extended with few changes to the control of multilevel inverters. The algorithm that is presented here for two-level voltage-source inverters (VSIs) also obtains efficient detection and management of both the linear and overmodulation ranges. In the overmodulation range, which is treated by using the alpha-beta components of the reference-voltage space vector, the algorithm shows the advantage of lower calculation time, thus allowing one, if required, to increase the switching frequency. Several simulation runs have been performed, aiming to test the proposed procedure for both two-level and multilevel VSIs. Finally, the new algorithm was experimentally validated in the case of two-level inverters by using it in a VSI workbench that can carry out several experimental tests	algorithm;central processing unit;clock rate;computer simulation;duty cycle;experiment;interference (communication);inverter (logic gate);microcontroller;microprocessor;power inverter;pulse-width modulation;real-time computing;real-time transcription;software portability;universal controls;voltage source;workbench	Antonio Cataliotti;Fabio Genduso;Angelo Raciti;Giuseppe Ricco Galluzzo	2007	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2007.894768	control engineering;support vector machine;algorithm design;electronic engineering;voltage;computer science;engineering;control theory;pulse-width modulation;software testing;space vector modulation;overmodulation;duty cycle	Robotics	67.83397850317812	38.67841213708396	199131

In the proposed PV-FC hybrid system, the PV generator feeds a variable load through a DC-DC converter controlled by an MPPT control (maximum power point tracking) and transfers energy to the electrolyzer side if possible to produce hydrogen which will be stored in a tank for a later use in the fuel cell (PEMFC). When the PV system cannot completely meet the load demands, the FC system provides the lack of power. The MATLAB-Simulink environment is used for the simulation of the PV-FC hybrid proposed system.

a08f0deb4debd28f66207b8af5f706ec5c8a754f	modeling and control of lcl-filtered grid-tied inverters with wide inductance variation		Because of the low power losses and moderate cost, the magnetic powder cores are popular in producing the filtering inductors for the high efficient and cost-effective power converters. However, the soft magnetic property of the powder cores leads to the wide variation of inductance along with the changing of the inductor current in one cycle of the grid, which challenges the system stability and power quality. In this paper, the current-dependent small-signal model of a three-phase LCL-filtered inverter is derived for designing the corresponding controller. Based on the developed small-signal model, a capacitor current feedback based active damping loop and a fractional order repetitive control based compound current control loop are designed to stabilize the system and enhance the control accuracy in steady-state, respectively. The controller design procedure is given in detail. Finally, all-digital simulation has been conducted on a 3.7 kVA inverter system to verify the theoretical expectations.

78e464bde9968cfaffe1acbf5e22fb95fef65647	design strategy and simulation of medium-frequency transformers for a three-phase dual active bridge		Transformers are key elements in high power dc/dc converters such as the dual active bridge. Special attention is required because the dc-to-dc technique operates with non-sinusoidal voltages and currents. Therefore, iron and copper losses differ when compared to standard ac (sinusoidal) operation and sinus based design rules are no more suitable. The working principle of a dual active bridge (DAB3) relies on a particular value of leakage inductance to control the power flow. This inductance can be realized by the sole leakage inductance of the transformer or by connecting an additional choke inductance. The present paper shows the results obtained using an evolutionary strategy applied to design a transformer. The algorithm is adjusted to the particular conditions of the converter such as the flux density waveform (DAB3). The integration of the inductance can be performed by the design strategy and the design is compared to the external choke inductance solution. At this stage of work, the overall test bench setup is verified using simulations.

The first topology is the hybrid boost rectifier and the other two are novel bridgeless structures, all based on the integration of boost rectifier and the ladder switched-capacitor (SC) cell. The new hybrid structures provide high voltage gain with low voltage stress across the switches, high-power factor, and output voltage regulation. This paper presents the principle of operation, steady-state and dynamic analysis, design methodology, and experimental verification. A different approach is also presented for the design methodology of the SC cell and for the analysis of its influence on the dynamic model. Three 1000-W prototypes with a 220-V input voltage, 800-V output voltage, and 100-kHz switching frequency were designed to corroborate the theoretical study. The best efficiency was 97.1$\%$ in the proposed bridgeless versions and the voltage stress across the switches stands around 400 V. Furthermore, a comparison between the proposed structures and previous topologies is also presented.	bridge (graph theory);clock rate;mathematical model;network switch;powerbuilder foundation classes;rectifier;steady state;switched capacitor;voltage multiplier;voltage regulation	Julio Cesar Dias;Telles Brunelli Lazzarin	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2721919	control engineering;peak inverse voltage;control theory;dropout voltage;low-dropout regulator;voltage regulator;engineering;voltage divider;voltage regulation;boost converter;voltage multiplier;electronic engineering	Visualization	64.83006042340241	42.115576249972165	199837
