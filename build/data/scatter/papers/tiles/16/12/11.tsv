There have been sever- al approaches to convert analog systems to their digital counterparts and a high- resolution time-to-digital converter (TDC) is a key element for the digitalization of analog circuits. Recently TDCs using a noise shaping technique with oversampling have been introduced to improve resolution. However, they tend to be power hungry or require analog-intensive circuitry as they convert signals from the time domain to the voltage domain in order to perform arithmetic operations. A digital PLL (DPLL) is another crucial SoC component, and low-power area-efficient DPLLs are challenging to design. This paper presents a time-domain low-power ΔΣ TDC with a time-difference accumulator and an area-efficient, low-power, and fast-lock DPLL composed of a synthesizable bang-bang phase and frequency detector (BB-PFD), with a gain boosting mode and a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).	accumulator (computing);analogue electronics;bang file;bang–bang control;cmos;dpll algorithm;electronic circuit;low-power broadcasting;noise shaping;oversampling;phase frequency detector;phase noise;phase-locked loop;pseudorandom number generator;pseudorandomness;random number generation;requirement;system on a chip;time-to-digital converter	Jong-Phil Hong;Sung-Jin Kim;Jenlung Liu;Nan Xing;Tae-Kwang Jang;Jaejin Park;Jihyun F.

This modulator employs operational amplifiers with PST to optimize power consumption among the tri-mode operation. In addition, the modulator incorporates the proposed QMS to mitigate the mismatch between the I/Q multi-bit DACs. Fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS process, the proposed QBP-CTDSM achieves 81/61.2/60.9 dB SNDR across 270- kHz/5-MHz/8-MHz bandwidth. The bandpass center frequency is programmable from 500 kHz to 12 MHz. Measured from a 1.8-V supply voltage, the modulator power consumptions are 4.9/8.9/12.1 mW for the GSM-EDGE/UMTS/DVB-T modes, respectively, which result in FOMs of 0.99/0.95/0.84 pJ/conversion. The measurement results also show that the QBP-CTDSM achieves image rejection ratios better than 55 dB for all modes.	automatic gain control;cmos;delta-sigma modulation;digital video broadcasting;gain–bandwidth product;image resolution;image response;image scaling;infinite impulse response;low if receiver;low insertion force;low-power broadcasting;operational amplifier;planar separator theorem;rejection sampling;sinadr;scalability;scrambler;signal-to-noise ratio;triangular function	Chen-Yen Ho;Wei-Shan Chan;Yung-Yu Lin;Tsung-Hsien Lin	2011	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2011.2164026	operational amplifier;electronic engineering;index term;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;delta-sigma modulation;signal-to-noise ratio;cmos;digital video broadcasting;second-order logic;modulation	EDA	61.40430176256016	52.5423915478987	75844

By using the adaptive body-bias technique, the threshold voltage of the cross-coupled pair is reduced, and meanwhile the effective source-to-drain voltage and oscillation amplitude are increased, which improves the phase noise. In addition, the back-gate capacitances from the cross-coupled pair are used for frequency tuning which avoids quality factor deteriorations resulted from using extra tuning capacitance. In a standard 65nm CMOS process with a 0.4-V power supply, the proposed VCO achieves FOM of 189.8 with a phase noise of −122.5 dBc/Hz at 10MHz offset when operating at 24.25 GHz.

Offset calibration is achieved by digitally adjusting the bulk voltages of the preamplifier input devices. Without introducing additional capacitive loading in the analog path, this technique improves the accuracy of flash ADCs while not impairing their high-speed performance. A 4-bit ADC in 90-nm CMOS with the proposed technique achieves 3.71 effective number of bits (ENOB) at 5-GS/s sampling rate with 2.5-GHz effective resolution bandwidth (ERBW). The calibration generally improves ENOB by approximately 0.5 bit after calibration. The ADC consumes 86 mW at 5 GS/s with a 2.5-GHz input achieving a 1.32-pJ/convstep figure of merit.

By incorporating the proposed capacitor-swapping technique, which eliminates the problematic MSB mismatch transition of a binary-weighted capacitor digital-to-analog converter, the 12-bit linearity of the ADC is achieved without increasing the capacitor size for improved matching. The small capacitor size results in low power consumption. In addition, an on-the-fly programmable dynamic comparator is used for quick comparisons with low noise contributions within the limited power budget. The ADC is fabricated using a 110-nm CMOS process. It consumes 16.47 μW from a 0.9-V supply at a conversion-rate of 1 MS/s. The measured DNL and INL are within 0.3 LSB and 0.56 LSB, respectively. The measured SNDR and SFDR are at 67.3 dB and 87 dB, respectively.

This paper presents the first low-cost, ultra-low power, passive RFID tag, fully integrated on a single substrate in a standard CMOS process. The system combines a 24 GHz, dual on-chip antenna, RF front-end, and a C-Flash based, rewritable, non-volatile memory module to achieve full on-chip system integration. The complete system was designed and fabricated in the TowerJazz 0.18 μm CMOS technology without any additional mask adders. By embedding the RF, memory, and digital components together upon a single substrate in a standard digital process, the low-cost aspirations of the “5-cent RFID tag” become feasible. Design considerations, analysis, circuit implementations, and measurement results are presented. The entire system was fabricated on a 3.6 mm × 1.6 mm (6.9 mm2) die with the integrated antennas comprising 82% of the silicon area. The total read power was measured to be 13.2 μW, which is sufficiently supplied by the on-chip energy harvesting unit.	biasing;cmos;communications protocol;control unit;die (integrated circuit);electronic circuit;embedded system;integrated circuit;low-power broadcasting;memory module;non-volatile memory;passive optical network;programming research group;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;read-write memory;spectral leakage;substrate (electronics);system integration;volatile memory	Hadar Dagan;Aviv Shapira;Adam Teman;Anatoli Mordakhay;Samuel Jameson;Evgeny Pikhay;Vladislav Dayan;Yakov Roizin;Eran Socher;Alexander Fish	2014	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2014.2323352	radio-frequency identification;embedded system;electronic engineering;computer hardware;computer science;engineering;operating system	EDA	56.91568372342377	49.24444535991219	76514

To achieve both high resolution and low circuit area, we propose a dual-slope voltage-domain TDC, which is composed of a time-to-voltage converter (TVC) and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). In the TVC, a current source and a capacitor are used to make the circuit as simple as possible. For the same reason, a single-slope ADC, which is commonly used for compact area ADC applications, is adapted and optimized. Because the main non-linearity occurs in the current source of the TVC and the ramp generator of the ADC, a double gain-boosting current source is applied to overcome the low output impedance of the current source in the sub-100-nm CMOS process. The prototype TDC is implemented using a 65-nm CMOS process, and occupies only 0.008 mm2. The measurement result shows a dynamic range with an 8-bit 8.86-ps resolution and an integrated non-linearity of ±1.25 LSB.

The main motivation is to estimate the performance of G.fast over phantom circuits for various real scenarios, which are based on measurements performed for a multi-quad metallic cable. Since the performance of G.fast is mostly limited by the crosstalk and especially by far-end crosstalk (FEXT), the estimations are focused mainly on comparisons for FEXT dominating scenario and the situation with completely eliminated FEXT contributions in a metallic cable binder as well as potential impedance mismatches. However, the full coordination of transmitted DMT symbols by vectored discrete multitone modulation (VDMT) for all subscriber lines in large cable binders is computationally very demanding in practice. The conclusions presented within this paper can be helpful to decide potential benefits of phantom mode transmission method in practice.	characteristic impedance;computational human phantom;crosstalk;digital monetary trust;file binder;imaging phantom;impedance matching;integrated circuit;modulation;simulation;transformers;transmission line;virtual circuit;xfig	Pavel Lafata	2015	2015 38th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)	10.1109/TSP.2015.7296379	phantom circuit;systems modeling;telecommunications;electrical engineering;electric power transmission	EDA	63.52660945331377	59.527316976577346	76604

When quantization step approaches the same orders of magnitude of standard deviation of input noise, quantization effects become nonlinear, and additive noise modeling of quantization effects is no longer applicable. By proper offsetting the input signals in this case, the feedback loop of ADPLL can be very sensitive to frequency phase deviation. It results in a larger loop bandwidth, and in turn smaller in-band phase noise than in linear quantization case. A theoretic s-domain noise model is proposed to quantify the phase noise in nonlinear case. Results are verified in Modelsim simulations. Proposed method offers possibility of achieving lower phase noise by lower quantization resolution and less circuit design efforts.	additive white gaussian noise;circuit design;companding;feedback;modelsim;nonlinear system;phase noise;quantization (image processing);quantization (signal processing);simulation;theory;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jue Shen;Fredrik Jonsson;Jian Chen;Hannu Tenhunen;Lirong Zheng	2014	2014 NORCHIP	10.1109/NORCHIP.2014.7004732	gradient noise;control engineering;gaussian noise;effective input noise temperature;electronic engineering;noise shaping;quantization;noise temperature;quantum noise;noise;control theory;mathematics;noise figure;oscillator phase noise;signal-to-noise ratio;phase noise	EDA	66.5943345968079	51.06688091834895	76677

The oscillator has an overall frequency range from 3.1 GHz to 3.6 GHz. The effect of temperature variations on the frequency span has been tuned out by an IPTAT (inversely proportional to absolute temperature) current reference. In this work, using a coarse-fine tuning mechanism lowers the tune range sensitivity of the oscillator, which is usually represented as KVCO. The achieved KVCO is around 490 MHz/V with 400 mV tune voltage sweep.

776e0612784c10a113ced7c7e9572f6eff9d665f	multiphase digitally controlled oscillator for future 5g phased arrays in 90 nm cmos		This paper reports a low noise Digitally Controlled Oscillator (DCO) with multiphase outputs, suitable for next generation phased arrays. The DCO core is implemented using an 8 stage Rotary Traveling Wave Oscillator (RTWO) topology. Simple design equations are presented and insight is given in the layout implementation. Designed in a 90 nm CMOS process, the prototype is tunable from 31.4 to 37 GHz (i.e. 16% tuning range). Drawing 45 mW from a 1.2V supply, the simulated phase noise is −127.3 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset from a 34 GHz carrier, resulting in a phase-noise FoM of −181.4 dBc/Hz. Digitally tuned slow wave transmission lines are used to achieve a fine tuning resolution of 1.8 MHz, resulting in a state-of-the-art tuning FoMDT of −187 dBc/Hz.	cmos;device configuration overlay;digitally controlled oscillator;phase noise;phased array;prototype;rotary woofer;strips;time-to-digital converter;transmission line	Arnout Devos;Marco Vigilante;Patrick Reynaert	2016	2016 IEEE Nordic Circuits and Systems Conference (NORCAS)	10.1109/NORCHIP.2016.7792882	control engineering;electronic engineering;dbc;engineering;electrical engineering;digitally controlled oscillator	EDA	63.4371944328761	51.08491814512857	76910
ce90630c72f41bc5a06352302659ba88d401a773	analysis and comparison of high-resolution gs/s samplers in advanced bicmos and cmos		High-speed and high-resolution analog to digital converters (ADCs) (10+ bits) are essential components of modern wireless communication systems and mmWave radios. Their performance is often limited by the noise and distortion from the front-end samplers, the design of which can be challenging. Modern ADC design has moved heavily to scaled CMOS technologies due to its attractive digital and integration capabilities, but these processes face challenges of high fabrication costs, and diminishing analog performance that has to be bolstered by extensive digital calibration. On the other hand, BiCMOS processes have advanced and scaled sufficiently that they may be able to offer the best of the mixed signal world. This brief examines, both theoretically and through simulations, the design of samplers for high-speed, low-distortion in CMOS and BiCMOS for GS/s ADCs. Two fully differential samplers, with an equivalent sampling frequency of 5 GS/s and an input frequency range of up to 10 GHz, are designed in a 90-nm BiCMOS and a 28-nm CMOS process, respectively, and their distortion performance is analyzed, simulated, and compared.	analog-to-digital converter;bicmos;cmos;die shrink;distortion;frequency band;image noise;image resolution;mixed-signal integrated circuit;network switch;roland gs;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Deeksha Lal;Ahmed M.

Compared with those that have an odd number of stages, such oscillators may have two stable equilibrium states besides an astable equilibrium state in which the circuits can start to oscillate. To avoid the risk of possible latching up into the stable states, an additional start-up circuit technique is proposed. The proposed circuit should also reduce the start-up time. The theory is further confirmed with the design and fabrication of a 4-stage against 3-stage differential ring VCO's in a PLL clock generator based on a 0.13µm CMOS process.	cmos;clock generator;multivibrator;nash equilibrium;oscillator (cellular automaton);phase-locked loop;ring oscillator;semiconductor device fabrication;uptime;voltage-controlled oscillator	Hui Zhang;Haigang Yang;Fei Liu;Yuan-feng Wei;Jia Zhang	2010	2010 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/APCCAS.2010.5774827	control engineering;electronic engineering;voltage-controlled oscillator;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory	EDA	63.013058968171805	48.96355528542338	77229

Though the operations in the analog front-end are ideally reversible, hence no signal degradation should occur before the analog-to-digital conversion (thus preserving the information integrity) however the intrinsic non-idealities in the circuitry may introduce a certain level of distortion. In this paper we provide a simple and flexible approach for the compensation of these effects. We derive useful formulas for obtaining a digital compensation filter by means of a direct transformation of the analog system coefficients. This allows to easily perform the compensation in the digital domain via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). To illustrate the procedure, the case-study of a real Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) receiver is addressed. Numerical results are shown and sample code is also provided for an easy implementation.

Jitter tolerance is improved by tracking correlated jitter using a pulsed clock forwarded from the transmitter side. The clock receiver comprises two injection locked oscillators to frequency-multiply, deskew, and adjust jitter tracking bandwidth. Different data rates and latency mismatch between the clock and data paths are accommodated by a jitter tracking bandwidth that is controllable up to 300 MHz.

The performance of such clocks is measured by the amount of jitter, or phase noise, their outputs exhibit. Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) are typically used to generate high frequency clocks. However, a major disadvantage of PLLs is the accumulation of jitter within their Voltage Controlled Oscillators (VCOs) [1]. Multiplying DelayLocked Loops (MDLLs) have been developed in recent years to drastically reduce the problem of jitter accumulation in PLLs [2].	phase noise;phase-locked loop;tree accumulation	Belal Helal	2008			electronic engineering;computer science;electrical engineering;computer engineering	EDA	59.657452000740385	49.72126417177588	77798

This is mainly driven by the increase in cutoff frequency and decrease in power consumption brought by lower supply voltages. However, at mm-Wave, challenges such as low Q-factor of the tuning varactors and switched capacitors result in a sharp degradation in the resonator Q. For an NMOS LC-VCO (Fig. 8.8.1), a large bias current and high transconductance (gm) are needed to maintain a given oscillation amplitude and to satisfy the startup condition. Since gm has a weak dependency on current in strong inversion, it can primarily be increased by enlarging the device width, W1, as illustrated in Fig. 8.8.2. Further degradation in the device gm is experienced when the VCO operates near the transistor cutoff frequency, necessitating an even larger W1 (Fig. 8.8.2). This results in a large fixed capacitance Cfix1 and hence a limited VCO tuning range (TR) [1,2]. It can also be shown that for the same bias current (i.e. output swing), increasing W1 comes at the expense of large thermal (1/f2) noise. This can be illustrated by examining the excess noise factor F, defined as the ratio between the transistors' switching noise and the tank resistor noise [6]. As depicted in Fig. 8.8.2, an extra 5dB of 1/f2 noise is added to the VCO output when the transistor W1 is increased from 20μm to 60μm, which is required to meet a 2× startup margin. Moreover, increasing W1 leads to a higher contribution of 1/f3 noise from up-converted 1/f noise [7].	bicmos;biasing;cmos;elegant degradation;image scaling;johnson–nyquist noise;nmos logic;noise figure;offset binary;pink noise;signal-to-noise ratio;transistor;voltage-controlled oscillator;xfig	Qiyang Wu;Tony Quach;Aji Mattamana;Salma Elabd;Steven R.

The proposed passive gain technique relaxes the noise requirement of the comparator and reuses the existing capacitor DAC in SAR for minimal overhead. An additional time-out scheme is adopted to advance the SAR conversion whenever the comparator takes longer time to resolve, which improves the overall conversion rate. To prove the concept, an 11-bit ADC prototype was fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology. The prototype measured a peak effective number of bits (ENOB) of 10.2 and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 75.2 dB at a 95-MS/s sampling rate with 1.36-mW power consumption from a 1.1 V supply.

b2e6f77122005aeb13bed1379b1b8ebe0afd4303	a 0.6-v power efficient digital ldo with 99.7% current efficiency utilizing load current aware clock modulation for fast transient response	detectors;frequency modulation;clocks;frequency control;transient response;regulators	This paper describes a fully integrated, low voltage digital low-dropout voltage (DLDO) regulator for ultra-low power applications with a load current aware clock modulation scheme. The proposed DLDO uses a clock modulation technique that provides a fast transient response during load state transitions. The proposed clock modulation (CM) controls the clock frequency when it senses a sudden load current transition. This eliminates the tradeoff between transient time and power efficiency with a fixed clock frequency. Thus, it minimizes the transient response time and maximizes the power and current efficiency. The proposed DLDO operates at 0.6 V and generates 0.55 V output voltage. A test chip is fabricated using 65-nm CMOS technology and demonstrates the current efficiency of 99.7% with the load current from 10 μA to 200 μA with and the quiescent current of 0.9 μA.	biasing;cmos;clock rate;clock signal;coupling (computer programming);dropout (neural networks);low-power broadcasting;modulation;performance per watt;response time (technology)	Karthik Gopal Jayaraman;Karim Rawy;Tony Tae-Hyoung Kim	2016	2016 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems (APCCAS)	10.1109/APCCAS.2016.7803907	cpu core voltage;frequency modulation;detector;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;automatic frequency control;control theory;clock gating;transient response	EDA	61.149864794068876	46.55598076954176	78173

964601ee92a358902935dc7b82dcdb513c1993c2	beyond supply-voltage bootstrapped pulser for driving cmut arrays in ultrasound imaging		A new pulser topology has been presented for driving capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducer (CMUT), which can generate pulses as large as twice the supply voltage. The pulser features bootstrapping and dynamic gate biasing techniques to achieve safe operation beyond the process limits. This circuit improves the driving capability compared to conventional pulsers by requiring lower supply voltages while maintaining the same output pulse pressure levels. The proposed pulser requires two input control signals to reduce the system complexity, and is designed with double-diffused semiconductor (DMOS) transistors to guarantee safe operation at high voltage (HV). Measurement results show 84.2 V amplitude of the pulser output with 45 V supply. The proposed pulser is fabricated in 0.18 μm Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process with 60 V devices. Acoustic measurements performed using CMUTs with 2 pF capacitance and 8.33 MHz center frequency verified that the proposed beyond supply-voltage pulser achieves higher pressure compared to conventional supply-limited pulsers.	acoustic cryptanalysis;biasing;binary-coded decimal;bootstrapping (compilers);cmos;capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers;medical ultrasound;semiconductor;transducer;transistor	Gwangrok Jung;Coskun Tekes;Amirabbas Pirouz;F.

In the realm of wireless communications, graphene shows great promise for the implementation of miniaturized and tunable antennas in the terahertz band. These unique advantages open the door to disruptive wireless applications in highly integrated scenarios where conventional communications means cannot be employed.

Time-interleaved, parallel /spl Delta//spl Sigma/, and frequency-band-decomposition ADCs are three parallel architectures that are shown to be explained using the same underlying theory. This common structure is then used to explore the design tradeoffs among these architectures. It is shown that the frequency-band-decomposition ADC is insensitive to channel mismatches but it is the most complex to design. The Hadamard modulated parallel /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ ADC provides the best performance (without considering nonidealities) but requires large digital filters. Finally, a randomization technique is described that can be used with parallel /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ architectures to spread out the tonal energy due to channel mismatches over the frequency spectrum.	analog-to-digital converter;delta-sigma modulation;digital filter;hadamard transform;parallel computing;qualitative comparative analysis;spectral density	Aria Eshraghi;Terri S.

It is shown that, depending on the initial design, it is possible to define optimized parameter sets with increased performance and remaining flat STF or sets with constant performance and reduced STF peaking. Therefore, the system is first described as switched system to analyse its behaviour in the state space. The different effects of the optimization method on the STF are demonstrated on two example systems with differently designed noise transfer functions (NTF).	1-bit architecture;coefficient;dynamical system;image scaling;mathematical optimization;modulation;national transfer format;signal transfer function;state space;vii	Christoph Zorn;Christian Widemann;Timon Brückner;Maurits Ortmanns;Wolfgang Mathis	2011	2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)	10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043333	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;control theory;mathematics;transfer function	EDA	65.7103653057169	50.759773514862744	79031

The amplifier appears to be the lowest power and most energy-efficient neural recording amplifier reported to date. We describe low-noise design techniques that help the neural amplifier achieve input-referred noise that is near the theoretical limit of any amplifier using a differential pair as an input stage. Since neural amplifiers must include differential input pairs in practice to allow robust rejection of common-mode and power supply noise, our design appears to be near the optimum allowed by theory. The bandwidth of the amplifier can be adjusted for recording either neural spikes or local field potentials (LFPs). When configured for recording neural spikes, the amplifier yielded a midband gain of 40.8 dB and a -3-dB bandwidth from 45 Hz to 5.32 kHz; the amplifier's input-referred noise was measured to be 3.06 muVrms while consuming 7.56 muW of power from a 2.8-V supply corresponding to a noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 2.67 with the theoretical limit being 2.02. When configured for recording LFPs, the amplifier achieved a midband gain of 40.9 dB and a -3-dB bandwidth from 392 mHz to 295 Hz; the input-referred noise was 1.66 muVrms while consuming 2.08 muW from a 2.8-V supply corresponding to an NEF of 3.21. The amplifier was fabricated in AMI's 0.5-mum CMOS process and occupies 0.16 mm2 of chip area. We obtained successful recordings of action potentials from the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) of an anesthesized zebra finch brain with the amplifier. Our experimental measurements of the amplifier's performance including its noise were in good accord with theory and circuit simulations.	action potentials;action potential;amiodarone;amplifier;cmos;cell nucleus;deny (action);differential signaling;finch;hertz (hz);kilohertz;lipoprotein midband b:mcnc:pt:ser/plas:qn;neural oscillation;neuroscience discipline;power supply;rejection sampling;rheumatoid arthritis;simulation;traffic collision avoidance system;trans-activator protein bzlf1;visual prosthesis;zebras;square millimeter (qualifier value)	Woradorn Wattanapanitch;Michale S.

The proposed equalizer is realized with a common gate topology and offers an input impedance of 50 Ω. It also acts as a first stage of current mode receiver and is made adaptive to varying channel loss. Therefore, the need for an external termination to avoid reflections and the need for a trans-impedance amplifier as receiver's first stage is eliminated. The proposed CG-CTLE is compared with conventional common source (CS) CTLE and it outperforms CSCTLE in terms of bandwidth and bit error rate (BER) for the same targeted output signal swing and power consumption. The post layout performance results show that it offers an input impedance of 44.6 Ω, input referred noise of 19.6 √pA/Hz, BER = 10-13 and consumes 13.9 mW power while operating at a data rate of 15 Gbps over a 7.5 inch FR4 PCB trace.	amplifier;bit error rate;cmos;cs-cipher;cg (programming language);characteristic impedance;data rate units;equalization (communications);input impedance;reflection (computer graphics);source-to-source compiler;television interface adaptor;uncompressed video;x.690	Divya Duvvuri;Vijaya Sankara Rao Pasupureddi	2016	2016 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)	10.1109/ISVLSI.2016.105	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Arch	61.33602899482149	53.173222777307366	79153

By spectral averaging, noise estimation is reduced and weak sources can be detected. However, more and more observations are polluted by man-made radio frequency interferences (RFI). The impact of these RFI on spectral measurement ranges from total saturation to tiny distortions of the data. To some extent, the final spectral estimation can be preserved by blanking infected channels in real time. With this aim in view, a complete real time processing line has been implemented on a set of FPGA and DSP. The current functionalities of the system are high dynamic range (at least 70 dB), band selection facilities (from 875 kHz to 14 MHz), high spectral resolution through polyphase filter bank (up to 8192 channels with 49152 coefficients) and real time time-frequency blanking with a robust threshold detector.	algorithm;celestial coordinate system;coefficient;comparator applications;ddos mitigation;digital signal processor;distortion;field-programmable gate array;filter bank;high dynamic range;polyphase matrix;radio frequency;real-time computing;rejection sampling;signal integrity;spectral density estimation;stellar classification	Rodolphe Weber;Lionel Amiaud;Andrée Coffre;Laurent Denis;Alain Lecacheux;Carlo Rosolen;Cédric Viou;Philippe Zarka	2004	2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference		electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	60.83961603080289	57.10127961802686	79180

In this paper, we review the fundamentals of this so-called plasmonic- organic-hybrid (POH) platform. Starting from simple phase shifters to the most compact IQ modulators, we introduce key devices of high-speed data communications. For instance, all-plasmonic Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) are reviewed and long-term prospects are discussed. This kind of modulator already features unique properties such as a small footprint (<; 20 μm2), a large electro-optic bandwidth (> 110 GHz), a small energy consumption (~25 fJ/b), a large extinction ratio (> 25 dB) in combination with a record small voltage-length product of 40 Vμm. Finally, as an example for seamless integration we introduce novel plasmonic IQ modulators. With such modulators we show the generation of advanced modulation formats (QPSK, 16-QAM) on footprints as small as 10 μm × 75 μm. This demonstration ultimately shows how plasmonics can be used to control both phase and amplitude of an optical carrier on the microscale with reasonably low losses.	computer simulation;conley–zehnder theorem;data rate units;definition;dry etching;electron beam tomography;emoticon;erdős–rényi model;evaporation;finite element method;finite-difference time-domain method;foreign function interface;gigabyte;image scaling;interference (communication);mach;microwave;modal logic;modulation;multiphysics;nonlinear system;optical carrier transmission rates;plasmon;proceedings of the ieee;rf modulator;radio frequency;rapid refresh;relative change and difference;seamless3d;silicon on insulator;solver;spin coating;substrate (electronics);sybase iq;topological insulator;velocity (software development);xfig	Christian Hafner;Wolfgang Heni;Yuriy Fedoryshyn;Arne Josten;Benedikt Baeuerle;Claudia Hoessbacher;Yannick Salamin;Ueli Koch;Nikola Dordevic;Pol Mousel;Romain Bonjour;Alexandros Emboras;David Hillerkuss;Pascal Leuchtmann;Delwin L.

According to a common alternate test approach, RF mixer calibration is based on the prediction of the circuit's performance characteristics that requires the acquisition of a set of DC voltage observables obtained from specific nodes of the mixer operating in homodyne mode. These observables, however, often correspond to internal nodes where direct access is not always possible. Furthermore, accurate calibration might require a relatively large set of voltage observables whose direct access would lead to a waste of resources and to increased cost. The proposed built-in technique provides digital readings for the DC levels at all nodes of interest through a single interface by exploiting the use of a voltage acquisition circuit implemented by a simple analog to digital converter, which consists of a ring-type voltage controlled oscillator and a counter. A reading correction method to minimize the uncertainty introduced by process variations and device mismatches in the acquisition circuit itself is also described. The efficiency of the proposed technique has been validated by its application to the calibration procedure of a typical differential RF mixer designed in a 0.18-μm CMOS technology. Simulation results have been obtained and assessed, both for the proposed built-in voltage measurement technique and for the direct voltage measurement approach, in favor of comparison.	accessibility;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;canonical account;embedded system;observable;radio frequency;random access;simulation;voltage-controlled oscillator	John Liaperdos;Angela Arapoyanni;Yiorgos Tsiatouhas	2013	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2013.2246903	mixed-signal integrated circuit;control engineering;electronic mixer;voltage regulator;electronic engineering;calibration;bandgap voltage reference;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;voltage divider;cmos;voltage multiplier	EDA	59.138103253172396	48.56299187548248	79475

Both the fully-differential charge-transfer amplifier and integrator are developed for higher dynamic range of the modulator. A 67 dB of the peak SNR within a 4 kHz of bandwidth is reached in the presented modulator under a 2.5 MHz of sampling rate. The prototype circuit has been implemented in a 0.18 mum 1P6M CMOS technology. The chip area excluding PADs is 0.50 times 0.28 mm2. Due to its zero static current of CTA, only dynamic power is consumed in the circuit. The power consumption of the analog part of the presented second-order DeltaSigma modulator is only 3.4 muW. The total power consumption of the whole modulator is 36 muW at a 1.8 V of supply voltage.	cmos;charge-transfer amplifier;delta-sigma modulation;dynamic range;low-power broadcasting;prototype;rf modulator;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio	Chien-Hung Kuo;Kuan-Yi Lee;Ming-Feng Wu	2008	APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746250	chip;dynamic range;electronic engineering;capacitor;telecommunications;gain;computer science;engineering;noise;electrical engineering;amplifier;delta-sigma modulation;capacitance;charge-transfer complex;cmos;second-order logic;low-power electronics;modulation	EDA	58.62265916450042	51.14332772095394	79539

Therefore, the power optimized design of high-speed CMOS logic-based frequency dividers is sensitive to circuit partitioning and selection of flip-flop-type and logic family. On the basis of two circuit examples, the design of highly power optimized dividers based on conventional CMOS logic is demonstrated. First, a divide-by-15 circuit based on sense-amplifier and master-slave flip-flops is discussed. A 5.5-GHz demonstrator implemented in a 90-nm low-power CMOS technology consumes only 190 muW/GHz for a supply voltage of 1.1 V. Second, an even faster CMOS divider concept without static power consumption, except leakage power, is proposed. The circuit divides an input signal by two and generates four phases with highly accurate phase skew of 90 deg. The maximum operation frequency is 11.6 GHz for a supply voltage of 1.5 V, slow process and worst case operation parameters. Higher frequencies can be achieved by a hybrid approach where the signal is first divided by a factor of two in a single current mode logic (CML) stage and then by the proposed circuit by another factor of two for the generation of the four phases. The divider is applied to dual modulus pre-scalers and IQ receivers. A variant of the circuit contains an intrinsic phase-rotator, allowing pre-scalers without any phase synchronization. Therewith, the power consumption is not only reduced due to the efficient divider implementation but also by a simplified architecture of the overall pre-scaler.	best, worst and average case;cmos;current source;current-mode logic;flops;flip-flop (electronics);glitch;hcmos;logic family;low-power broadcasting;maximum power transfer theorem;modulus robot;overhead (computing);power dividers and directional couplers;sense amplifier;spectral leakage;transceiver;tree (data structure)	Stephan Henzler;Siegmar Koeppe	2008	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2001136	frequency divider;receiver;electronic engineering;master/slave;logic synthesis;voltage;multidisciplinary design optimization;sense amplifier;asynchronous circuit;telecommunications;phase synchronization;receptor;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;optimal design;circuit design;power electronics;diode-or circuit;high frequency;capacitance;power dividers and directional couplers;circuit extraction;cmos;queue;power optimization;wilkinson power divider;low-power electronics;statistics;signal generator	EDA	63.667932433727195	47.40874579878322	79602

The output signal is a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal, where the pulse duration is linearly proportional to the sensor differential capacitance. The original conversion approach consists in stimulating the sensor capacitor with a triangular-like voltage waveform in order to obtain a square-like current waveform, which is subsequently demodulated and integrated over a clock period. The charge obtained in this way is then converted into the output pulse duration by an approach that includes an intrinsic tunable low pass function. The main non idealities are thoroughly investigated in order to provide useful design indications and evaluate the actual potentialities of the proposed circuit. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained with a prototype, designed and fabricated using 0.32 μm CMOS devices from the BCD6s process of STMicroelectroncs. The prototype occupies a total area of 1025× 515 mm2 and is marked by a power consuption of 84 μW.

In contrast with the conventional merged sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA) and first MDAC, the front-end uses an opamp split-sharing scheme to meet the different gain and bandwidth requirements of both the S/H and the first MDAC. This opamp split-sharing scheme mitigates the memory effect without a dedicated clock phase and avoids crosstalk. In the back-end ADC, 4.5-bit opamp-sharing MDACs with four-input operational trans-conductance amplifiers (OTAs) are used for further power saving. Implemented in a 0.18-μm CMOS process, the 14-bit ADC achieves a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 89.1 dB and a signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) of 70.2 dB, with a sampling rate of 100 MS/s and an input of 15.5 MHz. For input signals up to 220 MHz, measured SFDR and SNDR are maintained above 82.7 dB and 66.2 dB, respectively. The ADC consumes 92 mW with a 1.8-V supply, occupying an area of 6.3 mm2.	cmos;conductance (graph);crosstalk;decibel;digital-to-analog converter;discharger;distortion;frequency band;least significant bit;memory effect;noise reduction;operational amplifier;performance per watt;prototype;requirement;sinadr;sample and hold;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;source-to-source compiler;spurious-free dynamic range	Zhenyu Wang;Mingshuo Wang;Weiru Gu;Chixiao Chen;Fan Ye;Junyan Ren	2013	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2013.2252643	operational amplifier;electronic engineering;real-time computing;successive approximation adc;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;cmos	EDA	60.02775920640692	51.013550032650606	80358

Clear benefits in implementation area and accuracy can be reached when using mismatch calibration based on combination selection of minimum-sized transistors. However, with the used high accuracy requirements, the effects of temperature must be taken into the account. Temperature compensation circuitry for combination selection based mismatch calibration is developed, designed and simulated. The new temperature compensated and mismatch calibrated current source achieves 99% accuracy in 4σ confidence over the temperature range of 30 degrees in centigrade. This range can still be extended by recalibrating the current source in intervals of 15 degrees in centigrade.	current source;electronic circuit;requirement;transistor	Joona Marku;Jonne Poikonen;Ari Paasio	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118074	electronic engineering;calibration;engineering;electrical engineering;signal processing;control theory;histogram;accuracy and precision;information technology;microelectronics;transistor	Embedded	59.911872259330885	47.59650106374904	80692

The proposed printed diamond-shaped-patch (DSP) antenna has the capability to provide multiband operation. To create this antenna, several narrow strips acting as resonance paths can be integrated with the DSP antenna. By changing the length of the added resonant strips in the notched region, the center frequency of the multi resonances below the UWB frequency can be fine tuned. This antenna is designed to merge multiple operating bands of at least 850MHz, 1.5, 2.4, 3.1 – 10.6 GHz with a return loss better than 6 dB thereby avoiding usage of multiple antennas.Proposed antenna is planner and will be printed on both the sides of FR4 substrate which adds compactness to antenna that can be embedded easily in any portable devices such as the Smartphones, laptop computers and tablet computers.	microstrip	Aditya Desai;Deepak Chatrabhuj Karia;Madhuri Bhujbal	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-04960-1_20	microstrip antenna	HCI	66.99478526451553	58.51186471932767	80794

The phase detection is carried out by a proposed 10-bit, 0.8 ps resolution TDC using a charge pump and a SAR-ADC, with low power and small area. The TDC enables wide loop bandwidth and low in-band phase noise of the PLL. A varactor-less and AE-less DCO using bridging capacitors is designed, achieving 7 kHz frequency resolution (or 2.6 aF unit variable capacitance). A counter-based architecture is used without requiring long conversion range of the TDC. A gating block gates out one pulse of DCO's output at the reference frequency to accommodate the TDC to the PLL. The prototype chip is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, occupying 0.38 mm2 active area and consuming 9.7 mW power.

Design of CMOS imagers, utilizing self-powered sensors (SPS) is a new approach for ultra low-power CMOS active pixel sensors (APS) implementations. The SPS architecture allows generation of electric power by employing a light sensitive device, located on the same silicon die with an APS and thus reduces power dissipation from the conventional power supply. A detailed analysis of the SPS structure is carried out, with respect to power dissipation requirements, sensor area and power generation efficiency, showing advantages and drawbacks of the proposed concept.

3613f827977fa705debb3fb75e1a130e4911a09a	a 21-gb/s dual-channel voltage-mode transmitter with stacked nrz and pam4 drivers		This paper describes a voltage-mode transmitter that stacks independent non-return-to-zero (NRZ) and four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) drivers for dual channels. The stacked structure can improve the transmitter’s power efficiency owing to its current-recycling capabilities. The PAM4 voltage-mode driver with voltage regulators, implemented to increase data rates, generates multi-level signals. The proposed dynamic load control inside the PAM4 driver minimizes the voltage variation in the output of the regulators, which is caused by the variations of the data patterns. A prototype chip was fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS process. The stacked 7-Gb/s NRZ and 14-Gb/s PAM4 transmitters have achieved a full aggregate transmission rate of 21 Gb/s while consuming 12.6 mW from a 1-V power supply. When transmitting 500-mVpp signals with the proposed transmitter through 2-cm FR4 channels, the eye heights obtained in the NRZ and PAM4 channels were 312 and 92 mV, respectively.	aggregate data;cmos;gigabyte;load management;modulation;performance per watt;power supply;prototype;transmitter;voltage regulator	Sung-Ha Kim;Sang-Hoon Kim;Xuefan Jin;Yoonmyung Lee;Jung-Hoon Chun	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2874630	pulse-amplitude modulation;voltage regulator;computer network;chip;transmitter;transceiver;electrical efficiency;computer science;electronic engineering;cmos;communication channel	Mobile	60.69123447730998	53.63051650662848	81254

In this design, a track and hold (T/H) circuit with self-biased buffer is used to compensate the degradation in amplitude when frequency increases to giga Hz. Averaging termination technique using asymmetric spatial filter response is proposed to relieve the termination offset of the flash ADC. A revised encoder scheme is adopted to solve the problem of different propagation delay. The measurement results reveal that the SFDR and SNDR of the ADC are 26.3dB and 18.4dB, respectively, even the input signal frequency is 4.2GHz. INL and DNL are measured improved to 0.11LSB and 0.18LSB, respectively, when asymmetric spatial filter is used. The power of ADC is 63mW and the active area is 0.49x0.72mm^2.

In our design, a parallel resistance-capacitance shunt feedback with a source inductance is proposed to obtain broadband input matching and to reduce the noise level effectively; furthermore, a parallel inductance-capacitance network at drain is drawn to further suppress the noise, and a very low noise level is achieved. The proposed LNA is implemented by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 0.18-μm CMOS technology.

Such an approach implies that each dB of power or noise is of high importance, as it directly determines the range of operation of a system. Accordingly, a design trajectory that offers certain power savings, while still keeping the system within the required range of operation, appears to be a promising candidate for nowadays highly stringent low-power RF front-end circuit design. The concept of frequency-transconductance tuning, introduced in this paper, offers the possibility for voltage-controlled oscillators to trade power consumption for loop-gain and phase-noise. Detailed analysis shows how this concept is employed to achieve full control over the operation of the oscillator that is being changed as a result of a frequency tuning.	circuit design;decibel;diagram;for loop;low-power broadcasting;oscillator (cellular automaton);performance;phase noise;radio frequency;requirement	Aleksandar Tasic;Wouter A.

The architecture of the modulator consists of Johnson counter, multiplier, adder and RF mixer. The key element in the design is ETSPC flip-flops (FFs) that fulfill high speed and low power requirements. The power-speed tradeoff is optimized by decreasing the size of the FFs, and using direct conversion structure for RF mixer.

24704a370753ca1c545a69f53138870a304c4c2a	fully integrated 60 ghz transceiver for wireless hd/wigig short-range multi-gbit connections		The paper presents the design of a 60 GHz transceiver, with all active and passive devices integrated on-chip including the antenna, for multi Gbit short-range wireless communications. To minimize circuit complexity and cost an on-off-keying (OOK) modulation scheme is selected as well as a 65 nm bulk CMOS technology instead of more costly CMOS SOI or SiGe or III-V technologies. At transmitter side a differential 2 stage common source power amplifier allows for an output power of about 11 dBm. The receiver includes a cascode LNA with a gain of 11 dB and a noise figure of 4.6 dB, followed by a simple envelop detector. For the on-chip antenna, half-wavelength dipole and inverted-F topologies have been designed. For the transceiver prototype the half-wavelength dipole is selected since it has better gain performance (radiation efficiency of 38 %, a peak directivity of 1.76 and a gain of roughly −2 dBi) although for an higher area occupation. The fully integrated transceiver allows for a data rate of roughly 4 Gbit/s at distances of few meters, being compliant with physical-layer specifications of WirelessHD and WiGig alliances.

The parasitics of the pad can be modeled from the L-2L through-line. Measurement results of the transmission lines and transistors can be de-embedded by subtracting the parasitic matrix of the pad. Therefore, the de-embedding patterns, which is used for modeling active and passive devices, decrease greatly and the chip area also decreases. A one-stage amplifier is firstly implemented for helping verifying the de-embedding results. After that a four-stage 60 GHz amplifier has been fabricated in CMOS 65 nm process. Experimental results show that the four-stage amplifier realizes an input matching better than −10.5 dB and an output matching better than −13 dB at 61 GHz. A small signal power gain of 16.4 dB and a 1 dB output compression point of 4.6 dBm are obtained with a DC current consumption of 128 mA from a 1.2 V power supply.

The broadband load impedance match is realized using modified stacked field-effect transistors (FETs) with a resistive feedback by analyzing the matching condition of the source input impedance of the stacked FET. In order to further improve the broadband gain frequency response, the effectiveness of a gain expansion from a stacked driver amplifier is demonstrated to compensate the gain compression of the last-stage amplifier. To verify the design concept, a two-stage three-stacked PA has been implemented in a 0.18-μm CMOS technology. The PA achieves a saturated output power of 22-24.3 dBm and a power added efficiency of 13%-20% within a 194% fractional bandwidth from 0.1 to 6.5 GHz.

Although many studies looked at the effect of distance, few studies were found that investigated methodically the effect of antenna height and antenna placement on the human body. Transmit antenna heights of 1, 2, and 3 meters, receive antenna heights of 1 and 1.65 meters, “on-body” and “off-body” placements of receive antenna, and a total of 11 distances ranging from 1 to 45 meters are tested in relation to received power in dBm. Multiple regression is used to analyze the data. Significance of a variable is tested by comparing its p-value with alpha, and model fit is assessed using adjusted R2 and s of residuals. It is found that an increase in antenna height would increase power-but only for transmit antenna. The receive antenna height has a surprising, opposite effect in the on-body case and an insignificant effect in the off-body case. To formalize the propagation model, coefficient values from multiple regression are incorporated in an extension of the log-distance model to produce a new empirical model for on-body and off-body cases, and the new empirical model could conceivably be utilized to design more reliable wireless links for medical body sensors.	aggregate data;antenna device component;baseline (configuration management);classification tree method;clinical act of insertion;coefficient of determination;dbm;distance;futures studies;height;hypertensive disease;less than;mathematical model;p-value;smartphone;software propagation;transmitter device component;sensor (device)	Daniel S.

Unlike the conventional methods, neither summing op-amp nor a large number of summing capacitors are used in our design. The high-accuracy summing function is accomplished by using a few capacitors with small size to compensate the summing error caused by parasitic capacitance, thereby resulting in a smaller chip area and no additional power dissipation.

93b1749ee85365535b32141dea49958d27baeb31	a time-interleaved sar assisted pipeline adc with a bias-enhanced ring amplifier		This brief presents a time-interleaved SAR assisted pipeline ADC with an inter-stage ring amplifier as an energy efficient structure. Ring amplifiers, an alternative to operational transconductance amplifiers, feature low power consumption and large output swing. Due to non-dominant poles in the three-stage structure, conventional ring amplifiers suffer from a bandwidth-limited settling. A bias-enhanced ring amplifier is proposed, which shifts non-dominant poles to higher frequencies and accelerates signal settling. In addition, a 1.5-bit per comparison scheme is adopted in the two time-interleaved SAR sub-ADCs to speed up the DAC settling of sub-ADCs. Prototyped in a 1.2-V 65-nm CMOS process, the 11-bit ADC achieves over 68.5-dB SFDR with a 2.4-MHz input, and a sample rate up to 250 MS/s while consuming 2.28 mW at 200 MS/s.	amplifier;cmos;digital-to-analog converter;phase margin;sampling (signal processing);settling time;spurious-free dynamic range	Yongzhen Chen;Jingjing Wang;Hang Hu;Fan Ye;Junyan Ren	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2017.2769107		EDA	61.04861304465638	49.65469190369491	82980

The steep-edged rectangular shape of the filter is precisely controlled utilizing digital feedback compensation of the multi-tone pump light. The passband ripple is $$\sim $$ ∼ 1 dB by nonlinearity management of the pump light and using the fiber with a single Brillouin peak. The filter selectivity is improved to more than 40 dB by using pump-splitting dual-stage configuration. We analyze the noise performance of the proposed SBS filter and demonstrate a sub-band extraction of a multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. Furthermore, we validate the amplification performance with different gains for OFDM signal, which shows the potential capability of the filter in the fields of optical signal processing.	adaptive server enterprise;brillouin scattering;frequency divider;microwave;multiplexing;nonlinear system;optical computing;performance evaluation;ripple effect;selectivity (electronic);signal processing;smart battery system	Lilin Yi;Wei Wei;Mengyue Shi;Yves Jaouën;Weisheng Hu	2014	2014 13th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)	10.1007/s11107-015-0520-4	brillouin scattering;low-pass filter;telecommunications;band-stop filter;filter design;high-pass filter	Robotics	64.87795363219573	56.78449763380093	83167

Performance of these transducers has been investigated by analyzing the sources and effects of on-chip parasitic capacitances on the insertion-loss of the transducers. Modeling and experimental studies showed that on-chip parasitic capacitances degraded the performance of the transducers and an improved method of fabrication was suggested and new devices were built. New devices developed with minimal parasitic effects were shown to improve the performance significantly. A 1-mm aperture PVDF device developed with minimal parasitic effects has resulted in a reduction of insertion loss of 21 dB compared with devices fabricated using a previous method.	clinical act of insertion;insertion mutation;medical ultrasound;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;parasites;parasitic element (electrical networks);sodium fluoride 0.0024 mg/mg toothpaste;transducer;transducers;ultrasonography;polyvinylidene fluoride	Chaitanya Chandrana;James R.

The proposed OCMC consists of a fractional-N phase-locked loop (PLL)-based frequency synthesizer, a high-bandwidth track-and-hold circuit, and a 10-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to implement a subsampling scheme. The proposed fractional-N PLL-based frequency synthesizer improves the time jitter accumulated in a voltage-controlled oscillator using a fractional frequency divider operated by an eight-phase clock. The bandwidth of the track-and-hold circuit is designed to be 6 GHz, using inductive peaking realized through a source follower. The OCMC samples 49 points over two unit intervals of a high-speed input signal when the frequency multiplication of the frequency synthesizer is 6.125/6. The 10-bit ADC uses the architecture of a pipelined successive approximation register ADC to reduce the power consumption and chip area. The proposed OCMC is implemented with 65-nm CMOS technology and a 1.2 V supply.

The PLL neural network is an oscillatory neural network as a model of associative memory, and it is represented as coupled phase oscillators with periodic phase variables and periodic nonlinear interactions. In our circuit implementation, the phase variables and their summation and subtraction are represented by pulse- width modulation (PWM) signals. The interactions are realized by using nonlinear current waveform sampled with pulse-phase modulation (PPM) signals converted from the PWM signals. We have designed an element circuit and simulated two coupled such circuits with SPICE using the TSMC 0.25 mum device parameters. The results demonstrate that the element circuits synchronized with in- and anti-phase depending on coupling strength at different operation frequencies. The element circuit has an advantage in extracting phase difference between the circuits. This will facilitate implementing of learning by arbitrary spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rules using the phase difference.	arnold tongue;artificial neural network;cmos;content-addressable memory;coupling constant;interaction;nonlinear system;phase-locked loop;pulse-width modulation;spice;waveform	Daisuke Atuti;Kazuki Nakada;Takashi Morie	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2008.4541882	control engineering;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;computer science;machine learning;control theory;oscillation;artificial neural network	EDA	67.1958667227533	46.87047504243909	84281

The transistors' parasitic effects are taken into account to develop a more accurate behavioral model of the computing nodes. The model is applied to double-binary 0.25-mum BiCMOS analog decoders. Behavioral simulations show that the BJTs' parasitic elements deteriorate the error-correcting performance of a stand-alone a posteriori probability (APP) decoder by 0.5 dB compared with the ideal bit error rate (BER). In a turbo scheme, the loss is reduced to 0.2 dB for a BER that is smaller than 10-2. A simple solution based on an nMOS amplifier is proposed to counterbalance the dominant parasitic element. The amplifier reduces the degradation by 0.2 dB for the APP decoder. However, the turbo decoder is improved only for a BER above 10-2.	amplifier;analog-to-digital converter;behavioral modeling;bicmos;biasing;bit error rate;degradation (telecommunications);elegant degradation;error detection and correction;high- and low-level;nmos logic;simulation;transistor;turbo code;x.690	Nicolas Duchaux;Cyril Lahuec;Matthieu Arzel;Fabrice Seguin	2009	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2009.2015727	behavioral modeling;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;statistics	EDA	54.148384099224266	58.59122667667144	84447
adc379e973b2d2eb16597eca6d54af314e31cc04	didactic: a data-intelligent digital-to-analog converter with a trainable integrated circuit using memristors		In an increasingly data-diverse world, in which data are interactively transferred at high rates, there is an ever-growing demand for high-precision data converters. In this paper, we propose a novel digital-to-analog converter (DAC) configuration that is calibrated using an artificial intelligence neural network technique. The proposed technique is demonstrated on an adaptive and self-calibrated binary-weighted DAC that can be configured on-chip in real time. We design a reconfigurable 4-bit DAC with a memristor-based neural network. This circuit uses an online supervised machine learning algorithm called “binary-weighted time-varying gradient descent.” This algorithm fits multiple full-scale voltage ranges and sampling frequencies by iterative synaptic adjustments, while inherently providing mismatch calibration and noise tolerance. Theoretical analysis, as well as simulation results, show the efficiency and robustness of the training algorithm in reconfiguration, self-calibration, and desensitization, leading to a significant improvement in DAC accuracy: 0.12 LSB in terms of integral non-linearity, 0.11 LSB in terms of differential non-linearity, and 3.63 bits in terms of effective number of bits. The findings constitute a promising milestone toward scalable data-driven converters using deep neural networks.	4-bit;algorithm;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;cmos;circuit design;deep learning;desensitization (telecommunications);differential nonlinearity;digital-to-analog converter;effective number of bits;fits;full scale;gradient descent;integral nonlinearity;integrated circuit;interactivity;iteration;least significant bit;machine learning;memristor;noise reduction;nonlinear system;prototype;sampling (signal processing);scalability;simulation;supervised learning;synaptic package manager;turing completeness	Loai Danial;Shraga Kraus;Shahar Kvatinsky	2018	IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems	10.1109/JETCAS.2017.2780251	effective number of bits;memristor;electronic engineering;robustness (computer science);artificial neural network;control reconfiguration;algorithm design;computer science;integrated circuit;digital-to-analog converter	EDA	60.00308480240636	49.56399669270386	84632

To realize fully-differential operation, a 3-dB power splitter and SiGe photodetector are integrated with the receiver, all in a CMOS 45nm SOI process. The proposed receiver improves sensitivity by suppressing common-mode and supply noise through fully-differential (FD) operation, achieving 12Gb/s at BER <10−12 with input sensitivity of 8.6µAPP while consuming 4.3mW. To understand the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we compare it to a conventional single-ended (SE) receiver on the same test-chip. Measured sensitivity is >2× better than the closest state-of-the-art design, achieving same energy per bit at higher data-rate.	cmos;demultiplexer (media file);electrical connection;power dividers and directional couplers;silicon-germanium;single-ended signaling;x.690	Nandish Mehta;Chen Sun;Mark T.

The total areas and active areas of the SP8T switches are less than 860 × 460 μm2 and 425 × 165 μm2 respectively. The concept is validated with post layout simulation results of three SP8T switches in a 65-nm CMOS.	cmos;low-pass filter;network switch;parasitic element (electrical networks);simulation;transistor	Anak Agung Alit Apriyana;Yue-Ping Zhang	2014	2014 International Symposium on Integrated Circuits (ISIC)	10.1109/ISICIR.2014.7029488	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Arch	64.09071356198073	53.28268252063352	84833

The SPAD pitch of 8 μm makes possible to use the standard micro-lens option proposed by the image sensor process and thus to increase the fill factor from the actual 7% up to nearly 100%. Thanks to the embedded memory, each SPAD can be individually enabled or disabled in order to reduce the dark count rate and consequently improve the signal to noise ratio.	cmos;diode;embedded system;fill factor (image sensor);image sensor;pixel;signal-to-noise ratio;solar cell;token ring	Imane Malass;Wilfried Uhring;Jean-Pierre Le Normand;Norbert Dumas;Virginie Zint;Foudil Dadouche	2013	2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing		electronic engineering;optoelectronics;optics;physics	EDA	55.00259057584004	49.447942867120496	84875

However, the main obstacle to their full acceptance in the wireless-systems arena is their higher content of output spurious tones, whose level is ultimately set by the nonlinearity of the time-to-digital converter (TDC). The known methods to improve the linearity of the TDC either increase its dissipation and phase noise or require slow foreground calibrations. By contrast, the class of digital PLLs based on a one-bit TDC driven by a multibit digital-to-time converter (DTC) substantially reduces power dissipation and eliminates the TDC nonlinearity issues. Although its spur performance depends on DTC linearity, the modified architecture enables the application of a background adaptive pre-distortion which does not compromise the PLL phase-noise level and power consumption and is much faster than other calibration techniques. This paper presents a 3.6-GHz digital PLL in 65-nm CMOS, with in-band fractional spurs dropping from -39 to -52 dBc when the pre-distortion is enabled, in-band phase noise of -103 dBc/Hz and power consumption of 4.2 mW.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;codel;digital delay generator;distortion;dither;integral nonlinearity;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;oversampling;phase noise;phase-locked loop;requirement;time-to-digital converter	Salvatore Levantino;Giovanni Marzin;Carlo Samori	2014	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2014.2314436	adaptive filter;control engineering;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;digital down converter;digital signal;computer science;control theory;cmos;pll multibit	EDA	61.35919974336134	50.11926270388549	85315

Conversion matrices provide a systematic approach to analyze linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) circuits. Using conversion matrices of LPTV components in a frequency domain equivalent circuit allows analysis similar to a linear time invariant (LTI) circuit. For example, Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws, impedance combination rules, etc., can all be used in such equivalent circuits. On applying this method to a mixer-first receiver, a common LPTV circuit, results already established in prior art are reproduced accurately. Further, effects of a few important non-idealities, such as clock overlaps, imperfect clock edges and parasitic components that were not considered previously, are also calculated and verified.	characteristic impedance;clock signal;domain analysis;equivalent circuit;kirchhoff's circuit laws;kirchhoff's theorem;linear time-invariant theory;low-power broadcasting;ohm's law;sion's minimax theorem;time complexity;time-invariant system	Sameed Hameed;Mansour Rachid;Babak Daneshrad;Sudhakar Pamarti	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2015.7168690	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;electrical impedance;control theory;mathematics;frequency domain	Arch	66.15851023483506	50.60518192622803	85486

a965416a3be6a994762f11924253eb492a8ab99d	channel modeling of in-vivo thz nanonetworks: state-of-the-art and research challenges		Recently, it has been proposed, that nanodevices can be injected in the human body and perform non-invasive medical diagnostics. However, due to their small size, a plethora of such nanodevices need to be used in practical applications, thus, creating a nanonetwork, which collects the information and communicates with out-of-body nodes. For these networks, several models have been proposed for the THz channel in the in-vivo scenario. Most of them are based on well-defined theories and physical laws, while some of them are based on experiments. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art of channel modeling of in-vivo communications in the THz band and discuss future trends and research challenges.	nanonetwork;video-in video-out	Vasilis K.

db6cec123c5201eaa95258fd243463d5402d4fc2	a novel digital-intensive hybrid polar-i/q rf transmitter architecture		A novel digital-intensive hybrid transmitter (TX) architecture is presented, combining conventional inphase and quadrature (I/Q) with constrained phase modulation. The proposed architecture utilizes an RF-DAC with phase modulated RF clock and adjusted I/Q components. By incorporating phase modulation the quadrature component is kept small while the inphase component approaches the complex signal envelope. Compared to a digital-quadrature TX architecture this results in a significantly reduced average and peak RF-DAC cell utilization. Therefore, the RF-DAC can be operated in less back-off at higher average output power and drain efficiency. The phase modulation is constrained in order to relax the phase modulators system requirements. Compared to a digital polar TX architecture utilizing an RF digital phase-locked loop with two-point phase modulation, this results in reduced frequency modulation and digital-controlled oscillator tuning range requirements. In addition, the design effort is further shifted from analog to digital domain in order to better exploit the benefits of CMOS technology scaling.	analog-to-digital converter;arnold tongue;cmos;image scaling;in-phase and quadrature components;modulation;phase-locked loop;radio frequency;requirement;system requirements;transmitter	Tobias Buckel;Andreas Springer;Alexander Klinkan;Damir Hamidovic;Christoph Preissl;Thomas Mayer;Stefan Tertinek;Siegfried Brandstätter;Christian Wicpalek;Robert Weigel	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2018.2840844	architecture;radio transmitter design;radio frequency;electronic engineering;control theory;modulation;transmitter;phase modulation;mathematics;frequency modulation;cmos	Arch	61.17770215839231	50.58350171343487	85618

It is based on a multistage interpolating filter, and on a novel time-domain control of the filter stages by signals derived from the sampling frequency clocks. Time-domain resolution of ±300 picoseconds is obtained, compatible with digital audio of 16-bit resolution. In addition to the filter design and implementation, measurement results are presented. They indicate that 16-bit accuracy is indeed achieved, even with asynchronous, drifting and time-varying sampling frequencies. A number of applications (digital mastering, program transfer between conflicting digital audio formats, pitch control with constant sampling frequency in digital recorders, error concealment, interfaces in digital transmission) are presented.	16-bit;frequency changer;sampling (signal processing)	Roger Lagadec;Daniele Pelloni;Daniel Weiss	1982		10.1109/ICASSP.1982.1171661	audio electronics;coherent sampling;sampling;computer vision;real-time computing;digital down converter;digital audio;anti-aliasing filter;telecommunications;audio signal processing;digital signal;time domain;computer science;spatial anti-aliasing;audio bit depth;digital signal processing;finite impulse response;anti-aliasing;mathematics;filter design;high-pass filter;sampling;digital delay line	HCI	57.0044987274874	55.89815838606486	85665

And second, two additional compensation stages are placed strategically between the gain stages alleviating the pernicious load effect. These stages develop two different compensation techniques simultaneously thus increasing the bandwidth. The proposed design consumes 113 mW with a single 1.8 V supply. It achieves a cut-off frequency up to 3 GHz and provides a gain of 21 dB.

6417c45e36e5d86ddca1cdc4741dc6c1ed9c2188	micropower design of an energy autonomous rf tag for uwb localization applications		This paper describes the architecture and the micropower design criteria of a battery-less, energy autonomous, individually addressable RF tag for UWB localization applications, with a focus on baseband circuitry. The tag includes a UHF rectifier, power conversion and management circuits, an addressable wake-up radio module, a microcontroller-based control unit, and circuits for UWB localization. The proposed circuit is suitable for UWB localization either by using passive backscattering of received UWB pulses, or by using active UWB pulses generators. Power for operation is scavenged from a modulated UHF carrier also used for addressing purposes. The circuit is implemented on discrete components in a 3.12 cm2 PCB area. The circuit can wake-up from fully discharged states and operates at distances as high as 10.8 m from a 2W-ERP source in the UHF 865–868 MHz RFID band with a +1.8 dBi receiving antenna. The quiescent power consumption of the tag is 3.88 μW, and the average power consumption at an addressing and activation rate of one time per second is 4.7 μW. The effectiveness of UWB localization was tested in a localization system based on time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) estimations, consisting of multiple UWB readers and UHF transmitters.	autonomous robot;baseband;control unit;erp;electric power conversion;electronic product code;electronic circuit;electronic component;general-purpose markup language;logistics;microcontroller;modulation;multilateration;printed circuit board;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;rectifier;transmitter;ultra high frequency;ultra-wideband	Davide Fabbri;Matteo Pizzotti;Aldo Romani	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351353	microcontroller;electronic circuit;electronic engineering;energy harvesting;computer science;wireless power transfer;ultra high frequency;baseband;electronic component;micropower	EDA	56.65988288317536	47.60151419684061	85896

However, advances in CMOS technology have little impact on channel performance, making channel impairments a bottleneck in wireline links. Furthermore, links are typically designed to cover multiple standards and are expected to operate over a wide range of data rates, making their design challenging [1-5]. This work presents a 4-lane 1.25–28.05Gb/s transceiver in 14nm FinFet technology.

The sensor node is composed of a ZnSSe UV photodetector, a current-sensitive front end including a high-gain current-to-voltage amplifier with 120 dB and a logarithm converter, and a transceiver operated at a 2.4-GHz industrial, scientific, and medical band. A passive photodetector is designed to have a cutoff at 360 nm and convert the UV emission of flame into picoamperes. Including mixed signal processing and ZigBee transmission, the speed of flame detection is as fast as 70 ms. The sensor node consumes only an average of 2.3 mW from a 3.3-V supply. The performance of a prototype sensor node was verified when the luminous flame was imaged onto the sensor node with different angles ranging from -30° to 30° and distances of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 m enabling effective fire safety applications.	amplifier;luminous studio;mixed-signal integrated circuit;prototype;sensor node;signal processing;transceiver	Pedro Cheong;Ka-Fai Chang;Ying-Hoi Lai;Sut-Kam Ho;Iam-Keong Sou;Kam Weng Tam	2011	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2119455	electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;sensor node;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;optoelectronics;signal processing	Mobile	63.42328375507195	55.627046661411995	87501

Although the transient noise simulation (TNS) supported by a commercial simulator takes into account nonlinear time-varying characteristics of the circuit, its simulation time is unacceptably long to obtain meaningful noise estimation results. Since the single-slope analog-to-digital converter with correlated double sampling (CDS/SS-ADC) in a CMOS image sensor (CIS) is composed of several operation phases in which the circuit topologies are different from each other, the noise cannot be estimated by the conventional FNS. This paper presents a noise estimation method for the CDS/SS-ADC that uses the FNS results while the transient noise behavior is taken into account. The proposed method provides noise estimation results closer to that of the TNS than the conventional FNS, whereas the simulation time is about the same as that of the FNS.	active pixel sensor;analog-to-digital converter;cross-correlation;federated naming service;image sensor;mixed-signal integrated circuit;nonlinear system;sampling (signal processing);simulation;time complexity;transient noise	Jimin Cheon;Gunhee Han	2008	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2008.923434	control engineering;effective input noise temperature;computer vision;electronic engineering;image analysis;noise temperature;computer science;engineering;noise measurement;electrical engineering;control theory;frequency domain	EDA	66.47968182196622	50.2571867948631	87603

63ab27672c6e38f28cd2fb160887d79595df7780	over-the-air testing for carrier aggregation enabled mimo terminals using radiated two-stage method		Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) over-the-air (OTA) testing of wireless devices has become increasingly attractive in radiated performance evaluation. As one of the OTA testing methods, the radiated two-stage (RTS) method achieves flexible channel models with low-system cost. However, the existing MIMO OTA testing using RTS method is valid only for single carrier frequency application. This paper applies the RTS method to multiple carrier frequency applications [carrier aggregation (CA)]. Two setups are presented to discuss system cost and calibration time. To validate the RTS OTA testing for CA, the transfer matrices from the OTA antenna ports to device under test antenna ports in three types of RF shielded enclosure are investigated. The results demonstrate that the applied RTS method for CA works better in anechoic chambers. One calibration matrix might need to be adopted for each component carrier when the frequency separation of component carriers is large.

The signal processing is based on obtaining the analytical signal from output optical power of LD by using Hilbert Transform. Then, this analytical signal provides instantaneous phase which is unaffected by the amplitude variations caused by speckle. This instantaneous phase is used for correct detection of fringes. Once SM fringes are correctly detected, then any phase unwrapping method can be used to retrieve the metric information contained in the SM signal. We implemented and tested our design on a Xilinx ZYBO Zynq 7000 development board. Results show that our design is capable of operating at 267 MHZ frequency, while consuming 15k slice registers and 12k LUTs.

The compensation technique incorporates a unique combination of a process corner sensing scheme and a temperature compensating network to appropriately change the control voltage of the differential ring oscillator. Measurements made across a temperature range of −40°C to 125°C and 64 samples collected over 3 runs indicate an average variation of +0.82% (+46ppm/oC) in the clock frequency with temperature, +2.1% with process across chips at room temperature, and a worst-case combined variation of +2.6% (with process, temperature and supply). The variation of frequency with power supply was +0.31% for a supply voltage range of 2.42.75V. The measurement results are in good agreement with the simulation results. The oscillator is intended to serve as a start-up clock for micro-controller applications.	best, worst and average case;cmos;clock generator;clock rate;microcontroller;norm (social);power supply;ring oscillator;simulation	Krishnakumar Sundaresan;Keith C.

In general, an LA consists of an input stage, a logarithmic stage, and an output stage. In order to give a much wider dynamic range and a higher speed than the conventional LA, a new type of two-step linear limiting architecture is proposed in the logarithmic stage. Two kinds of simple attenuators, designed with resistors, and a 30 dB middle amplifier are inserted in the middle of the proposed architecture to reduce the complexity and to increase the input dynamic range.

This radio is designed to meet the 802.15.4a standard for UWB impulse radio while achieving low power operation by aggressively duty cycling both the transmitter and receiver with nearly the same “on-time”. The key advance that enables aggressive receiver duty cycling is a new approach to establishing a robust, low jitter global network clock using a pulse coupled oscillator (PCO) algorithm. In this paper we describe how PCO based synchronization is used to design a radio transceiver capable of balanced two way communication and ad-hoc networking for under 30uW average power in continuous operation.	algorithm;continuous operation;duty cycle;global network;hoc (programming language);transceiver;transmitter;ultra-wideband	Alyssa B.

With respect to the monotonic switching method, the input common-mode voltage variation reduces which improves the dynamic offset and the parasitic capacitance variation of the comparator. The proposed switchback switching method does not consume any power at the first digital-to-analog converter switching, which can reduce the power consumption and design effort of the reference buffer. The prototype was fabricated in a 90-nm 1P9M CMOS technology. At 1-V supply and 30 MS/s, the ADC achieves an sequenced neighbor double reservation of 56.89 dB and consumes 0.98 mW, resulting in a figure-of-merit (FOM) of 57 fJ/conversion-step.

To cope with this problem, a 1-bit-sampling IL (1BS-IL) scheme is proposed in this paper. This scheme includes a mixed 1/M-bit-sampling receiver, and a corresponding packet detection algorithm termed 1-bit-sampling generalized likelihood ratio test (1BS-GLRT). The receiver enables packet detection in IL with a 1-bit ADC, which considerably lowers down the power consumption; besides, the 1BS-GLRT algorithm guarantees promising performance on packet detection. Once detecting the arrival of a packet, the receiver switches to an original sampling precision (i.e., M-bit) ADC to demodulate the packet, which maintains the demodulation performance. Comparisons show that 1BS-IL not only significantly reduces power consumption, but also achieves competitive detection performance.	1-bit architecture;algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;idle scan;low-power broadcasting;network packet;network switch;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation	Bo Gao;Zhenyu Xiao;Changming Zhang;Zhen Chen;Depeng Jin;Lieguang Zeng	2014	2014 IEEE 80th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2014-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2014.6965961	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	57.69536064041613	54.31552470123652	90479

We provide herein an overview of the complexities and requirements of a multi-channel phase-coherent measurement system. Multiple Input Multiple Output [MIMO] systems have to overcome key technical challenges related to phase, time and frequency synchronization in order to coherently receive and process the data acquired/generated from each input/output. In practical MIMO systems, the radio hardware should be capable of acquiring and/or generating such phase coherent signals across the multiple channels. Further, the systems need to be able to sustain the phase coherence over considerable duration of time, depending on the sensitivity of the system. However, drifts will occur owing to the effects like temperature, thermal expansion, mismatched cable lengths, uncorrelated phase noise, ADC sample clock phase noise and quantization noise. Thus, a calibration process is required to compensate for the drift, whenever it crosses a particular threshold value that defines the accuracy of the phase-coherent system. In this paper, an FPGA based software-defined calibration method is presented for synchronizing the phase and magnitude across multiple channels of a system. This method allows the phase/magnitude drift over time to be periodically monitored and calibrated, when there is a need. With the FPGA built into the system, the calibration can take place remotely without the need of connecting the system to an external calibration kit. Also, measurement results are provided for a state of the art super heterodyne receiver system to show that the phase drift is lesser than ±1 degree across a 500MHz - 26.5GHz frequency range at 23°C ± 5°C for 2 and 4 channels configurations. Such systems can find use in a variety of real-world MIMO implementations such as Direction Finding, Beam Steering, Passive Radars, MIMO and Phased-Array Radar Systems, where phase coherence, alignment and /or synchronization has added advantages to multi-channel systems.	coherence (physics);direction finding;field-programmable gate array;frequency band;heterodyne;input/output;mimo;mike lesser;phase noise;phased array;quantization (signal processing);radar;requirement;signal processing;superheterodyne receiver;system of measurement	Shivansh Chaudhary;Abhay Samant	2015	2015 IEEE AUTOTESTCON	10.1109/MIM.2016.7524208	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Embedded	60.08198037774993	56.66137362899855	90660

900b0e8c5c997311f98f2b728609bef3cd2a0f58	multi-mode bandpass cavity filters and duplexer with slot mixed-coupling structure		The quasi-elliptic multi-mode bandpass cavity filters and duplexer with slot mixed-coupling structure are proposed in this paper. A single metal cavity embedded with a rectangular- shaped slot-cut metal plate is utilized to constitute a multi-mode bandpass filter with a few features including wide passband, low profile and controllable transmission zeros (TZs). In this paper, the slot-cut metal plane serves as the multi-mode resonators. In detail, the slot on the metal plane functions as the circuit element to move the higher order modes within the reasonable frequency-band, while serving as a mixed-coupling structure to generate out-of-band transmission zeros. To demonstrate the multiple-mode capability in filter design, the dual-mode, triple-mode, and quadruple-mode filters are developed by appropriately allocating a few TZs in the upper stopbands using the proposed slot mixed-coupling approach, namely, Type-I filters. Next, a quadruple-mode cavity filter with both lower and higher TZs is designed, namely, Type-II filter, which is further applied for the exploration of a duplexer.

However, the design is not as intuitive as one might at first think. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the single cascode amplifiers. The relationship between gain and bandwidth is important. When used to achieve maximum bandwidth the voltage gain of the common-source stage is close to unity. However, when the cascode is designed to obtain a high voltage gain, then the gain-bandwidth trade-off, typical in the common source amplifier, reappears. This analysis is used to provide the basis for practical cascode amplifier design.		Mohamed Ben-Esmael;F. J. Lidgey;Khaled Hayatleh;Bryan L.

The main challenge with this type of ADC is the limited sampling rate which is due to its sequential operation. In flash-SAR architectures, this problem is mitigated by cascading flash and SAR ADCs which operate in two consecutive phases. This paper presents a flash-SAR architecture which noticeably increases the ADC sampling rate using pipelined operation of the first-stage flash ADC and the second-stage SAR ADC. In the first stage, a low-power flash ADC is developed using charge distribution dynamic comparators which require no external reference generator. Using the proposed technique, an 8-bit ADC was designed in a 0.13 μm CMOS technology and its simulation results show an SNDR of 49.29 dB with 690 μW total power consumption at 200 MS/s and 1-V supply.	8-bit;adobe flash;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;comparator;flash adc;low-power broadcasting;performance per watt;sinadr;sampling (signal processing);simulation;successive approximation adc	Monireh Eslami;Mohammad Taherzadeh-Sani;Frederic Nabki	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2015.7168627	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;capacitor;successive approximation adc;network switch;computer science;threshold voltage;cmos;pipeline;flash adc	Arch	59.30253308566335	50.6528730683031	91409

In Inductor-based (L-based) quadrature voltage controlled oscillators (QVCO), there exist two stable quadrature modes. When a transformer is used in place of an inductor in a QVCO, it is shown that the selected quadrature mode of oscillation is different from and more stable than the L-based QVCO. This additional stability ensures that only one mode of oscillation in T-based QVCOs is selected whereas in L-based QVCOs, cascode transistors are commonly used for this purpose. This is demonstrated using an oscillator designed in a commercially available 130 nm CMOS process. The oscillator provides a tuning range of 40.6% (2620-3033, 3423-4446 MHz), a phase noise of -112 dBc/Hz at an offset of 2.5 MHz from 3033 MHz, and a maximum power consumption of 26.4 mW from a 1.2 V supply.	cmos;capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers;compaq lte;existential quantification;gaussian quadrature;maximum power transfer theorem;normal mode;phase noise;transformer;transformers;transistor;voltage-controlled oscillator	Amany El-Gouhary;Nathan M.

The modulator under test (MUT) employs the decorrelating design-for-digital-testability (D3T) scheme to provide two operation modes: the normal mode and the digital test mode. In the digital test mode, the input switched-capacitor network of the D3T modulator is reconfigured as two sub-digital-to-charge converters (sub-DCCs). Each of the sub-DCCs accepts a Σ - Δ modulated bit-stream as its test stimulus. By repetitively inputting the DCCs with the same Σ - Δ modulated bit-stream but with different delays, the DCCs incorporates with the integrator to generate the analog stimulus in the digital test mode. The analog stimulus is analogous to the result of filtering the bit-stream with a two-nonzero-term FIR decorrelating term. Consequently, the D3T MUT suffers less from the undesired shaped noise of the digital stimuli, and achieves better digital test accuracy. Measurement results show that the digital tests present a peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 80.1 dB at an oversampling ratio of 128. The SNDR results of the digital tests differ from their conventional analog counterparts by no more than 2 dB except for the -3.2 dBFS test. The analog hardware overhead of the D3T MUT only consists of 13 switches.	bitstream;decorrelation;distortion;finite impulse response;modulation;network switch;normal mode;overhead (computing);oversampling;rf modulator;sinad;sinadr;switched capacitor	Sheng-Chuan Liang;Hao-Chiao Hong	2011	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2035508	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;delta-sigma modulation;finite impulse response;control theory	EDA	63.96767278563644	48.82726737042867	91622

The design approach exploits the biasing of MOS devices in their moderate inversion region to optimize the trade-off between the performance and the power consumption. A cascade of a low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a mixer achieves a voltage gain of 31.4 dB, and a noise figure (NF) of 6.8 dB while consuming 360 μW. A 101 μW voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is also demonstrated. Several low-power architectures, including a combination of an LNA with a VCO, are also presented. A proof-of-concept prototype for the combined LNA-VCO is implemented in a 0.13-μm CMOS process. The circuit consumes 240 μW from a 0.8 V supply, and achieves a gain of 18.3 dB, an NF of 3.2 dB and a phase noise of -115.4 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset.	biasing;cmos;launch numerical aperture;low-noise amplifier;low-power broadcasting;noise figure;phase noise;prototype;rx microcontroller family;radio frequency;voltage-controlled oscillator	Thierry Taris;Hassene Kraimia;Amir Hossein Masnadi Shirazi;Shahriar Mirabbasi	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Wireless Broadband (ICUWB)	10.1109/ICUWB.2015.7324470	electronic engineering;telecommunications;noise temperature;engineering;electrical engineering;low-noise amplifier;noise figure	EDA	61.58676971905769	52.51607632328968	91714

Similar to ADCs, existing architectures of TDCs can be divided into several categories: flash TDCs [1, 3], pipeline TDCs [2], and SAR TDCs [4]. The highest achievable time resolution of a TDC is mainly limited by the CMOS gate delay. In order to achieve sub-gate-delay resolution, the Vernier method is commonly used. However, the mismatch problem caused by process variation limits its effectiveness, and the same holds for the time amplification method. The gated-ring-oscillator (GRO) method [5] is introduced to achieve sub-ps time resolution, but it still requires an equivalent CMOS gate delay as low as 6ps. Upcoming applications in 4th-generation nuclear reactors, space, and high-energy physics such as the large Hadron collider (LHC), require the TDC to achieve a high time resolution in harsh environments with high temperature and radiation, where the threshold voltage, transconductance, and delay of a transistor undergo dramatic changes. In these cases, the high accuracy and robustness of the TDC need to be inherent to the design rather than by employing a fast CMOS technology.	analog-to-digital converter;cmos;image resolution;large hadron collider;pipeline (computing);propagation delay;ring oscillator;time-to-digital converter;transistor	Ying Cao;Paul Leroux;Wouter De Cock;Michiel S.

A number of 16 equidistant phases of the output clock, programmable in 0.4% steps between 200 MHz and 2.5 GHz are achieved by the use of a phase-switching fractional N architecture. Phase mismatch is optimized by the use of a novel two delay stage ring oscillator running at 4/spl times/ output frequency (800 MHz-10 GHz) and a subsequent divider chain. Jitter and area consumption are improved by solely controlling the VCO via its power supply. The proposed VCO's jitter/power/number of stages relationship behaves analogue to a single ended structure although the ring delivers 4 differential clock phases. The PLL was built in standard 0.12 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. It achieves a phase noise performance of -96 dBc/Hz @ 1 MHz offset on a 1.6 GHz signal. The integrated jitter in the measured band (10 kHz-10 MHz) is 3.8 ps.

We investigate on designing a system architecture of the D-PLT, adopting an efficient modulation technique against power-line channel and supporting a high reliability, which is well suited for the CENELEC B, C, and D bands roughly from 90 to 150 kHz. The proposed D-PLT is eventually integrated to a system-on-a-chip (SoC), synthesizing all of a baseband transceiver, a channel forward error correction (FEC) module, a micro-controller unit (MCU) to access communication protocols, and analog front end circuits, i.e., a pre-amplifier, a gain-amplifier, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a comparator, as well as external interfaces to communicate with application layer. The designed D-PLT is fabricated utilizing a mixed 0.18 um CMOS technology and it is required a total area of about 9,576 mm^2 consuming about 148 mW at the maximum data rates of 2.5 kbps.	amplifier;baseband;cmos;comparator;data rate units;digital-to-analog converter;error detection and correction;forward error correction;microcontroller;modulation;power-line communication;preamplifier;racket;system on a chip;systems architecture;transceiver;unified model	Sungsoo Choi;Yonghwa Kim;Won-Tae Lee	2009	2009 Fifth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications	10.1109/AICT.2009.82	system on a chip;embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;systems architecture	EDA	59.40684613756388	54.63398286591249	92013

Such a Holter recorder with off-the-shelf components is realized with mixed signal processor (MSP) in this paper. To decrease the complexity of analog circuits and the interference of 60 Hz noise from power line, we use the MSP to implement a finite impulse response (FIR) filter which is equiripple design. We also integrate the ringed buffer for the input samples and the symmetrical characteristic of the FIR filter for efficiently computing convolution. The experimental results show that the output ECG signal with the PQRST feature is easy to be distinguished. This ECG signal is recorded for 24 hr using a SD card. Furthermore, the ECG signal is transmitted with a smartphone via Bluetooth to decrease the burden of the Holier recorder.	analogue electronics;bluetooth;convolution;finite impulse response;interference (communication);max;mixed-signal integrated circuit;secure digital;signal processing;smartphone	Ching-Tang Hsieh;Guang-Lin Hsieh;Eugene Lai;Zong-Ting Hsieh;Guo-Ming Hong	2005	Fifth IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE'05)	10.1109/BIBE.2005.2	embedded system;digital filter;computer hardware;computer science;finite impulse response;linear filter	EDA	54.76855380647237	53.64177914225359	92094

The test of mixed-signal circuits involves the generation and analysis of signals. A standard method for the signal analysis is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT algorithms). Such complex algorithms are not suitable for BIST (Built-In Self-Test) or BOST (Built-Off Self-Test) solutions due to their high demand for resources. In this paper, the Goertzel algorithm will be presented as an alternative to FFT algorithms. A new optimized structure of the Goertzel algorithm and its implementation in an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is presented. A comparison within the scope of the production test of RF transceiver devices shows a considerable reduction of the test time (factor 6) and resources (factor 10) compared to a FFT software solution respectively hardware solution.	built-in self-test;fast fourier transform;field-programmable gate array;goertzel algorithm;mixed-signal integrated circuit;radio frequency;signal processing;spectral method;spectrum analyzer;transceiver	A.

Three theoretically possible architectures of a LVDS output driver are discussed in rigorous detail, resulting in the recognition of the most power-conserving circuit configuration. An innovative realization of this identified low-power architecture is presented in this paper along with computer simulation results and test lab measurement data. The novel LVDS driver is designed using a unique hetero-junction bipolar transistor structure. Computer simulation results show total current consumption of 6.3 mA for the bipolar driver at a 1-GHz clock frequency while operating from a positive supply voltage between 1.7 and 3.3 V, as well as demonstrate full stage compliance with all the requirements of the IEEE 1596.3-1996 standard. The presented version of the buffer was utilized in a multiplexer/demultiplexer chip set that was fabricated in a modern 50-GHz-fT SiGe technology.

511722a0527ed36c6b6aa705d2849abd3a2275ce	7.4 a 915mhz asymmetric radio using q-enhanced amplifier for a fully integrated 3×3×3mm3 wireless sensor node with 20m non-line-of-sight communication	antenna measurements;dipole antennas;wireless communication;logic gates;magnetic resonance;capacitors	Enabling long range (>10m) wireless communication in non-line-of sight (NLOS) scenarios would dramatically expand the application space and usability of mm-scale wireless sensor nodes. The major technical challenges posed by a mm-scale form-factor are poor antenna efficiency and the small instantaneous current limit (∼10s of μA) of thin-film batteries. We address these challenges in several ways: 1) We found that a magnetic dipole antenna achieves better efficiency at an electrically-small size than an electric dipole, when the antennas are resonated with off-chip lumped components. In addition, the high impedance of electrically-small electric dipoles (∼4kΩ compared to 10Ω for the magnetic antenna) requires an impractically large off-chip inductor to resonate. 2) By simultaneously considering the magnetic dipole efficiency, frequency-dependent path-loss, and wall penetration loss, we found that a 915MHz carrier frequency is optimal for a 3×3×3mm3 sensor node in NLOS asymmetric communication with a gateway. This is despite the resulting low antenna efficiency (0.21%) which typically drives mm-scale radios to operate at ≫1GHz frequency [1]. 3) In transmit (TX) mode, instead of using a PA and PLL, we utilize a cross-coupled driver to resonate the magnetic antenna at 915MHz with a quality factor (Q) of 110 in order to reduce overall power consumption. 4) In receive (RX) mode, we propose an approach of reusing the cross-coupled driver in a non-oscillating mode to raise the Q of the resonant tank to 300, resulting in 49dB voltage gain at 43µW, thereby replacing a power-hungry LNA and bulky off-chip filter. 5) A sparse pulse-position modulation (PPM) combined with a sensor-initiation communication protocol [2] shifts the power-hungry calibration of frequency offset to the gateway, enabling crystal-free radio design. The complete radio, including the transceiver IC, a 3D antenna, off-chip capacitors, a processor, a power management unit (PMU) and memory, is integrated within a 3×3×3mm3 sensor node, demonstrating stand-alone bi-directional 20m NLOS wireless communication with variable data rates of 30b/s to 30.3kb/s for TX and 7.8kb/s to 62.5kb/s for RX. The transmitter generates −26.9 dBm equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) consuming 2mW power and the receiver has a sensitivity of −93dBm consuming 1.85mW.	carrier frequency;characteristic impedance;communications protocol;dbm;dipole antenna;form factor (design);frequency offset;high impedance;line-of-sight (missile);low-noise amplifier;lumped element model;modulation;phase-locked loop;power management unit;sensor node;sparse matrix;transceiver;transmitter;usability	Li-Xuan Chuo;Yao Shi;Zhihong Luo;Nikolaos Chiotellis;Zhiyoong Foo;Gyouho Kim;Yejoong Kim;Anthony Grbic;David D.

Accordingly, a new low-cost and compact ultrawideband digital receiver for pulse ground-penetrating radar is designed. The merit of this receiver is that it can convert radio-frequency signal to digital signal without any analog sampling gate or analog-to-digital converter. The equivalent sampling rate of the receiver is up to 33 GHz.

Due to this requirement, it is necessary to accurately maintain the duty cycle of the clock signal at 50%. For a multistage clock buffer, a pulsewidth control loop (PWCL) circuit was therefore proposed to adjust the duty cycle of its output signal. This paper is aimed at introducing a new proposed differential PWCL (DPWCL) together with investigating its mechanism through a comprehensive theoretical analysis. By taking advantage of a differential topology, the dc offset in generating the control voltage can be removed thereby improving the duty cycle control accuracy. Moreover, the proposed DPWCL employs a low-pass filter to generate the reference voltage so that the DPWCL does not necessitate a 50% duty cycle reference clock.	clock signal;control system;data rate units;double data rate;duty cycle;feedback;low-pass filter;multistage amplifier;spice 2;simulation;very-large-scale integration	Steve Hung-Lung Tu	2006	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2006.869911	control engineering;electronic engineering;low-pass filter;clock domain crossing;computer science;engineering;control system;electrical engineering;control theory;very-large-scale integration;duty cycle	EDA	60.68082804066485	48.662649979084996	93662

On the other hand, Gm-C-filters avoid the need of a power-hungry driving stage due to their small loading. At the moment, the major challenge for designing Gm-C-based ΣΔ modulator is the narrow linear input range due to the nonlinear Gm amplifier, which leads to low SNDR. This work develops a nonlinearity compensation technique for Gm-C-based ΣΔ modulator. This technique designs a nonlinear feedback DAC which has matched V-I transfer curve as the first Gm amplifier (Gm1). As a result, the distortions of Gm1 are significantly suppressed at the modulator output. This method is prototyped in a 640 MS/s Gm-C-based ΣΔ modulator with 10 MHz signal bandwidth in a 0.18- μm CMOS process. With this technique, the linear input range of the modulator is greatly enlarged. Consequently, the peak SNDR of the modulator is improved by about 8 dB to 75 dB. This >12-bit ENOB is achieved for the first time for wide-band Gm-C-based ΣΔ modulators.	12-bit;active filter;amplifier;bandwidth (signal processing);cmos;decibel;delta-sigma modulation;distortion;effective number of bits;motion compensation;nonlinear system;performance per watt;prototype;sinadr;systems design;transfer function	Jiageng Huang;Shiliang Yang;George Jie Yuan	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2015.2452333	control engineering;nonlinear distortion;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;noise;electrical engineering;control theory;mathematics;linearity;bandwidth;modulation	EDA	62.15745353874823	50.625420769496266	93722

These models are typically derived from discrete data obtained from circuit simulation using numerous input combinations of component sizes for a given circuit topology. The simulations are computationally intensive, therefore it is advantageous to reduce the number of simulations necessary to build an accurate macro model. We present a new algorithm for adaptively sampling multi-dimensional black box functions based on Duchon pseudo-cubic splines. The splines readily and accurately model high dimensional functions based on discrete unstructured data and require no tuning of parameters as seen in many other interpolation methods. The adaptive sampler, in conjunction with pseudo-cubic splines, is used to accurately model various analog performance parameters for an operational amplifier topology using fewer sample points than traditional gridded and quasi-random sampling methodologies.	adaptive sampling;algorithm;analogue electronics;black box;circuit topology;cubic function;discrete mathematics;electronic circuit simulation;interpolation;low-discrepancy sequence;operational amplifier;procedural parameter;sampling (signal processing);spline (mathematics)	Ranga Vemuri;Glenn Wolfe	2003	IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer Aided Design, 2004.

470f653a2f4711732b4b146d654ffc406bbb7b67	a sierpinski space-filling clock tree using multiply-by-3 fractal-coupled ring oscillators		A space-filling clock tree is presented, which takes an advantage of LC resonant clocking, to obtain a uniform phase and amplitude multiply-by-3 clock from a unique Sierpinski-coupled ring oscillator (SCRO) array. The three-stage interleaved SCROs resemble the Sierpinski triangle, and are synchronized with a common frequency to all. The SCRO further provides an aligned output phase relationship to reduce skew. The triangle clock grid with a side length of 3.2 mm is filled by a space-filling clock tree. The 3-D stacked transformers at the tree endpoints extract the third harmonic of the SCRO array oscillation and scale the voltage amplitude of the extracted clock. The transformers also perform a built-in bandpass filtering function to remove injected noise. An experimental prototype integrated in a 90-nm CMOS operates at 2.85–4.3 GHz and consumes 19.2–49 mW under 0.7–1 V supply voltages. With 300-mV added supply noise, jitter was measured as 3.4 ps (rms) and 17.7 ps (pp). The measured results reveal substantial improvements in both power and jitter from this approach.	cmos;canonical account;clock rate;clock signal;clock skew;fractal;frequency multiplier;image scaling;injection locking;lock (computer science);network planning and design;prototype;ps (unix);ring oscillator;sierpinski triangle;sinc function;transformer;transformers	Yi-Wei Lin;Shawn S.

Then, the specifications of a SC circuit are computed from these measured capacitance ratios and compared to the fault-free ones. Moreover a maximal fault diagnosis is realized for the capacitances. This test technique uses re-configurations of the circuit so as that all the capacitance ratios are measured one by one at the different operational amplifiers outputs of the circuit. For this purpose, a standardized re-configuration of the three capacitances types, switched, un-switched and integrating capacitances, is described. Then, a test synthesis algorithm based on the fluency graph description of SC circuits is proposed and offers a formal approach to automate the technique. Finally, some recommendations concerning the design of the extra switches are given and simulations prove the low performance degradation of the circuit in test mode.	maximal set;switched capacitor	Christian Dufaza;Hassan Ihs	1997		10.1109/VTEST.1997.600284	equivalent circuit;control engineering;electronic engineering;switched capacitor;engineering;electrical engineering;stuck-at fault;automatic test pattern generation;control theory;transfer function;circuit extraction	EDA	66.64980015610575	49.59974103792981	94050

Thus, this paper proposes the priority-scheduled program (PSP) for the single-inductor quad-output (SIQO) switching converter. This technique manages energy delivery to multiple outputs, facilitates fast transient response, and reduces cross-regulation simultaneously. Moreover, a level bypass detector (LBD) is used to overcome the limitation of significant loading differences among quad outputs in conventional designs because the PSP technique cantransfer additional energy to low-priority outputs to avoid overshoot voltage at high-priority outputs. Furthermore, voltage disturbance can be filtered out using two additional low-dropout regulators that operate as buffers cascaded at two low-priority outputs. Therefore, the SIQO converter that is fabricated in 40 nm CMOS technology satisfies the power requirements in portable electronics given its low cross-regulation of 0.2%, fast transient response of 15 μs, and an output voltage ripple that is smaller than 30 mV.	analog-to-digital converter;analogue electronics;cmos;digital electronics;dropout (neural networks);load balancing (computing);mobile computing;multiple encryption;overshoot (signal);requirement;ripple effect;switched-mode power supply;system on a chip	Wei-Chung Chen;Yi-Ping Su;Tzu-Chi Huang;Tsu-Wei Tsai;Ruei-Hong Peng;Kuei-Liang Lin;Ke-Horng Chen;Ying-Hsi Lin;Chao-Cheng Lee;Shian-Ru Lin;Tsung-Yen Tsai	2015	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2015.2422071	control engineering;electronic engineering;real-time computing;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;inductor;transient response	EDA	61.52540718561672	46.73584413496323	94098

The dual-band RF front end is composed of a pseudo-differential low-noise amplifier (LNA), down-conversion mixers, and programmable gain amplifiers (PGAs), and can be configured to operate at 1.2 and 1.57 GHz, respectively. The pseudo-differential LNA incorporates an active single-ended-to-differential conversion using capacitive coupling compensation for an improved phase and amplitude imbalance. The high-linearity PGA has a tunable gain range of 18 dB with a 6-dB gain step and a 0.2-dB gain ripple across a 30-MHz band width. The proposed RF front end achieves a maximum voltage gain of 68/65 dB, a noise figure of 2.4/2.6 dB, and an input-referred 1-dB compression point of -42/-39 dBm at the 1.2-/1.57-GHz bands. The receiver draws 10 mA from a 1.8-V power supply. The RF front end is implemented in a 0.18-μm CMOS process, occupying a die area of 1.0 × 0.5 mm2.	cmos;dbm;launch numerical aperture;low-noise amplifier;motion compensation;noise figure;power supply;radio frequency;ripple effect;satellite navigation;single-ended signaling	Jun Wu;Peichen Jiang;Dongpo Chen;Jianjun Zhou	2011	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2011.2106352	electronic engineering;satellite navigation;multi-band device;index term;telecommunications;gain;computer science;engineering;noise;electrical engineering;front and back ends;low-noise amplifier;noise figure;radio frequency	Visualization	61.88743634795656	52.76514714955266	94680

The architecture is based on the poly-phase multipath technique, which has been shown to cancel out many of the harmonics, sidebands and nonlinearity contributions of a power up-converter using a large number of signal paths. This work proposes a design only using 8 paths which is able to achieve &#60;−40dBc harmonic suppression for all harmonics, including the dominant 7th and 9th harmonic. This is done with a combination of duty cycle control of the Local Oscillator (LO) waveform and tunable filtering with only a first order roll-off.	baseband;cognitive radio;collaborative filtering;duty cycle;local oscillator;multipath propagation;nonlinear system;polyphase quadrature filter;requirement;roll-off;transmitter;waveform;zero suppression	Saqib Subhan;Eric A.

The proposed DAC has adopted a segmented architecture in order to achieve a minimized die area and optimized performance. The current steering network consists of binary weighted current sources for the 8 least significant bits (LSBs) and a unary current cell array for the 4 most significant bits (MSBs). A fully differential amplifier (FDA) is utilized in the design to provide differential voltage output, enable the DAC to work at ultra low supply voltages, and reduce harmonic distortion in the output. The simulation results of the extracted layout show a maximum INL and DNL of 0.17 LSB and 0.20 LSB, respectively. The mid-code glitch energy is 78 pV-s and the SFDR is 81.8 dB. The settling time of the DAC is 38.2 ns and the power consumption is 13.4 mW. The chip active area is 330 µm × 224 µm. The DAC performance has also been verified with a supply voltage down to as low as 0.72 V. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a DAC capable of working at such a low supply voltage. This DAC will be used in a bio-implantable system for medical applications.	12-bit;british informatics olympiad;cmos;current source;digital-to-analog converter;distortion;fully differential amplifier;glitch;least significant bit;most significant bit;noise reduction;settling time;simulation;spurious-free dynamic range;unary operation	Guoyuan Fu;Homer Alan Mantooth;Jia Di	2011	2011 12th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design	10.1109/ISQED.2011.5770757	embedded system;differential nonlinearity;electronic engineering;integral nonlinearity;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;cmos	EDA	58.04041840919688	50.58992546926636	95007

This paper reviews a recently proposed multipath polyphase circuit technique which can cancel such harmonics and intermodulation products. This will be illustrated using a power upconverter IC as an example. The upconverter works from DC to 2.4 GHz, and the multipath polyphase technique cleans its spectrum up to the 17th harmonic, keeping unwanted spurious responses more than 40dB below the carrier. The technique can also be useful for other applications, and some possible applications will be discussed.	amplifier;block upconverter;cmos;frequency synthesizer;henk g. sol;integrated circuit;intermodulation;multipath propagation;nonlinear system;polyphase matrix;polyphase quadrature filter;rf modulator;radio frequency;transceiver;vii	Eric A.

5e9ea10e99c0a1291220050d3fb6868dacd5eac5	integrated photonic analog-to-digital converters	electrical engineering and computer science;thesis	Accurate conversion of wideband multi-GHz analog signals into the digital domain has long been a target of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) developers, driven by applications in radar systems, software radio, medical imaging, and communication systems. Aperture jitter has been a major bottleneck on the way towards higher speeds and better accuracy. Photonic ADCs, which perform sampling using ultra-stable optical pulse trains generated by mode-locked lasers, have been investigated as a promising approach to overcome the jitter problem and bring ADC performance to new levels. This work demonstrates that the photonic approach can deliver on its promise by digitizing a 41 GHz signal with 7.0 effective bits and 52 dBc spur-free dynamic range (SFDR) using a discrete-component photonic ADC. This corresponds to 15 fs jitter, a 4-5 times improvement over the jitter of the best electronic ADCs, and an order of magnitude improvement over the jitter of electronic ADCs operating above 10 GHz. The feasibility of a practical photonic ADC is demonstrated by creating an integrated ADC with a modulator, filters, and photodetectors fabricated on a single silicon chip and using it to sample a 10 GHz signal with 3.5 effective bits and 39 dBc SFDR. In both experiments, a sample rate of 2.1 GSa/s was obtained by interleaving two 1.05 GSa/s channels; higher sample rates can be achieved by increasing the channel count. A key component of a multi-channel ADC a dual multi-channel high-performance filter bank is successfully implemented. A concept for broadband linearization of the silicon modulator, which is another critical component of the photonic ADC, is proposed. Nonlinear phenomena in silicon microring filters and their impact on ADC performance are analyzed, and methods to reduce this impact are proposed. The results presented in the thesis suggest that a practical integrated photonic ADC, which successfully overcomes the electronic jitter bottleneck, is possible today. Thesis Supervisor: Franz X.

The tail current is made large when the oscillator output voltage reaches its maximum or minimum value and when the sensitivity of the output phase to injected noise is the smallest; the tail current is made small during the zero crossings of the output voltage when the phase noise sensitivity is large. The proposed technique does not dissipate any extra power, does not use extra noisy active devices and occupies a small area. Besides better noise performance, a VCO with tail current shaping has a better DC to RF conversion and thus larger oscillation amplitude compared to a standard VCO with equal power dissipation. Measurement results for a 2 GHz differential NMOS LC-VCO with tail current shaping fabricated on a 0.25 /spl mu/m BiCMOS process are compared to measurements for a standard VCO in the same process. The phase noise improvement is more than 3 dB at the carrier frequency of 1.75 GHz. The measured phase noise at 3 MHz offset frequency is -134 dBc/Hz from a 1.75 GHz carrier and the VCO draws 1.5 mA from a 1.5 V supply.	bicmos;carrier frequency;nmos logic;noise shaping;phase noise;radio frequency;voltage-controlled oscillator	Baharak Soltanian;Peter R.

42b38a3756e8c1254820671a0a36b304e1c75b65	low-phase-noise wideband mode-switching quad-core-coupled mm-wave vco using a single-center-tapped switched inductor		This paper describes a mode-switching quad-core-coupled millimeter-wave (mm-wave) voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), using a single-center-tapped (SCT) switched inductor for extension of the frequency tuning range (FTR) and improvement of the phase noise (PN). The switches not only serve for in-phase coupling among the VCO cores but also can modify the equivalent tank inductance suitable for coarse frequency tuning. The frequency gaps between the multi-resonant frequencies are controlled by the common-mode (CM) inductance that is precisely set by the lithography fabrication. Together with the tiny varactors for fine frequency tuning, a wide and continuous FTR can be achieved. It is analytically shown that tiny switches (i.e., small parasitic capacitance) for mode selection are adequate to avoid bimodal oscillation, synchronize the VCO cores against resonance frequency mismatches, and prevent PN degradation. A symmetrical layout of SCT switched inductor also aids the VCO to be immune to magnetic pulling. Prototyped in 65-nm CMOS, the VCO exhibits a 16.5% FTR from 42.9 to 50.6 GHz. The PN at 46.03 GHz is −113.1 dBc/Hz at 3-MHz offset, corresponding to a figure-of-merit (FoM) of 183.6 dBc/Hz. The die size is 0.039 mm2.	cmos;die (integrated circuit);elegant degradation;multi-core processor;network switch;pdf/a;phase noise;resonance;transistor;voltage-controlled oscillator	Yatao Peng;Jun Yin;Pui-in Mak;Rui P.

In delta-sigma modulators, techniques such as VCO-based quantizer [1, 2] and time-domain quantization [3] have been proposed to enhance the overall performance. The former provides additional noise shaping and the latter eliminates the need for the flash ADC. However, in addition to process and temperature variations, the inherent nonlinear behavior of the VCO requires careful attention. The time-domain quantization technique is an efficient way to utilize the quantizer but it does not improve the noise-shaping property. In this paper, we describe modified dual-slope and single-slope ADCs using bidirectional discharging. With a small modification in the discharging phase of these types of ADCs, a first-order quantization noise shaping is attained. These structures may be used as standalone ADCs or as the quantizer in a delta-sigma loop. Moreover, because the modified discharging extracts the quantization error in the analog domain, possibilities exist for further performance improvements [4].	delta-sigma modulation;first-order predicate;flash adc;integrating adc;noise shaping;nonlinear system;quantization (signal processing);voltage-controlled oscillator	Nima Maghari;Un-Ku Moon	2011	2011 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference	10.1109/ISSCC.2011.5746403	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;delta-sigma modulation;control theory	EDA	61.36868527223705	50.13273829816567	97340

Despite the advantages of TI structures, power consumption is increased due to the stricter matching requirements between channels; in some cases, >50% of total power is for calibration purposes. Thus, to realize high-speed and high-resolution ADCs with TI structures, it is important to alleviate the calibration burden by choosing a suitable number of power-efficient high-speed single channels. Previously reported CDAC-based 2b/cycle structures made contributions in realizing high-speed single-channel ADCs with high resolution by using additional capacitive DACs and modified switching logic. The power overhead and the complexity of the additional logic and DACs for 2b/cycle implementations have been of trivial concern for low resolution ADCs. However, as resolution increases, the complexity of such circuits becomes considerable, with power taking up a big share of the total. In this paper, a multi-step hardware-retirement (MSHR) technique, which disables low-accuracy hardware blocks of scaled sizes with the requirement relaxations from redundancies in an advancement to the reconfiguration scheme in the work of Kong et al. (2013), is reported to alleviate the overhead of additional logic and DACs for ADCs, requiring high resolutions.

The topology of gm − C active inductors is briefly reviewed. Subsequently, a comprehensive mathematical analysis on the CM stability of OTA-based gyrators is presented. Sufficient requirements for the gyrator’s CM stability, that easily can be considered during the design process of common-mode feedback (CMFB) amplifiers, are defined. Based on these stability requirements, a design methodology and a design procedure are proposed. Finally, in order to validate the proposed procedure, a resonator with 20 MHz resonance frequency and a quality factor of 20 is fabricated with UMC 180-nm CMOS technology and its CM stability is examined.

Feasibility of the proposed communication method is studied through direct measurements of microprocessor PDNs. Decoupling capacitors attached to the package make the PDN a low pass filter. However, the parasitic inductance of a decoupling capacitor becomes more significant beyond the self-resonant frequency, and our measurements on Intel microprocessor PDNs indicate that pass bands exist at frequencies beyond several 100 MHz. Impulse ultra wideband signals are a good candidate for communications over PDNs.	channel (communications);coupling (computer programming);low-pass filter;microprocessor;parasitic element (electrical networks);resonance;ultra-wideband	Rajesh Thirugnanam;Dong Sam Ha	2011	2011 IEEE International SOC Conference	10.1109/SOCC.2011.6085131	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;low-pass filter;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;ultra-wideband;design for testing;software testing;debugging;power-line communication	EDA	64.65943366603024	53.76826726944052	97747

For such current-steering DACs with a high sampling rate, the code-dependent load variations and switching glitches are a main bottleneck which limits the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). Dynamic element matching (DEM) has been an effective solution to randomize these glitches for a higher SFDR and also to reduce the matching requirement of the current cells for an area-efficient design which also improves the SFDR with reduced parasitic capacitance. An effective method named TRI-DEMRZ is proposed in this paper, consisting of time-relaxed interleaving, DEM and return-to-zero encoding. We also apply TRI-DEMRZ in synergy with complementary switched current sources (CSCS) to design the DAC for the purpose of a small die size and enhanced SFDR performance. Post-layout simulations show >80 dB SFDR up to the Nyquist. This DAC has a mixed 1.2 V / 2.5 V power supply and an active area of 0.48 mm2.	cmos;current source;digital-to-analog converter;effective method;forward error correction;glitch;power supply;sampling (signal processing);simulation;spurious-free dynamic range;synergy;three-state logic;tri-level sync	Jianan Liu;Xueqing Li;Qi Wei;Huazhong Yang	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2015.7168811	electronic engineering;real-time computing;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;electrical impedance;finite element method;cmos;transistor	EDA	60.17389362079824	51.06001733087662	97894

They provide accurate assessment of tumor size and location but suffer from some inherent drawbacks. Ultrasound is a detection technique that has been demonstrated as the one without harmful side effects on patients. This paper presents a method to detect the size and location of echogenic tumor in soft tissues using ultrasound. Quantitative ultrasound is utilized to allow an ultrasound signal to be sent from a transmitter to multiple receivers. This received signal is analyzed for echogenic and echolucent tumors to differentiate between them, along with a non-tumor sample. It is also studied for the delay and signal distortion, in order to determine the tumor location. The results are implemented by using field-programmable-gate-array (FPGA) and digital-signal-processor (DSP) technologies. The low transient pulse (LTP) technique is successfully utilized to generate the required short-duration ultrasonic signals in the proposed system. This codesign demonstrates a good application of the FPGA/DSP platform for LTP generation and processing received signals.	digital signal processor;distortion;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;linux test project (ltp);microwave;radiography;resonance;transmitter	Ashish R.

The transceiver includes a receiver section and a transmitter section which are coupled to the synthesizer which generates the appropriate injection signals to achieve tuning. The frequency synthesizer includes a multiposition switch which accesses various addressable memory locations in a programmable read-only memory where the appropriate divisors are stored to cause tuning of the synthesizer to the appropriate communication channel. A zone selector switch enables grouping and easy retrievability of channels. The synthesizer includes a priority channel monitoring system utilizing a channel element for rapid sampling. The divisors are supplied to a single synchronous binary swallow counter which works in conjunction with a dual modulus prescaler to monitor the frequency output of the voltage controlled oscillator. A programmable divider coupled to a reference oscillator source is compared with the output of the synchronous counter in a digital and analog phase detector. The phase detector supplies signals through a loop filter to apply the appropriate voltage to the voltage controlled oscillator.

However, the continued scaling is detrimental to the design of RF and mm-wave systems. Higher sensitivity to process variations and inaccuracies in modeling of active and passive devices pose another challenge to the design of these systems at deep submicron technology nodes. This paper describes the design of a 60 GHz power amplifier in 28 nm CMOS technology. A drain-source neutralization technique maintains the stability of the PA and the wideband nature is achieved by the application of low-k transformer networks. The PA comprises of three stages and achieves an overall bandwidth of 11 GHz with a peak gain of 24.4 dB. Using a two-way transmission line based power combiner, the PA delivers a saturated output power of 16.5 dBm with a peak power added efficiency (PAE) of 12.6%.	audio power amplifier;cmos;decibel;die shrink;digital electronics;image scaling;power dividers and directional couplers;power-added efficiency;radio frequency;transformer;transmission line;very-large-scale integration	Siva V.

d1ecb55a785cecaae1dda21420a1e48d6be84358	optimized active single-miller capacitor compensation with inner half-feedforward stage for very high-load three-stage otas		This paper introduces a new effective single-Miller capacitor compensation topology for three-stage amplifiers with very large capacitive loads, realized through an active-feedback capacitor together with an inner half-feedforward stage. Moreover, an optimized design strategy which profitably exploits the two left half-plane zeros is presented. To improve the amplifier large signal transient response, the topology also includes an external feedforward path, that only marginally affects the frequency compensation, and a novel slew-rate enhancer section. To validate the solutions presented, a three-stage OTA driving a 10-nF load has been designed and implemented in a standard 0.35-μm CMOS technology. The amplifier occupies less than 0.003-mm2 of die area, provides 2.7-MHz gain-bandwidth product and 0.55-V/μs average slew-rate, while consuming only 25-μA quiescent current.	amplifier;biasing;cmos;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;frequency compensation;gain–bandwidth product;large-signal model	Davide Marano;Alfio Dario Grasso;Gaetano Palumbo;Salvatore Pennisi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2016.2573920	control theory;capacitor;feed forward;mathematics	Visualization	62.55209937856483	47.95482078926997	98252
ff79aec37b91834488fe0c5da1c6312a67b5cfcb	background calibration using noisy reference adc for a 12 b 600 ms/s 2 × ti sar adc in 14nm cmos finfet		A 12 b 600 MS/s 2 × TI SAR ADC achieving 60 dB SNDR at Nyquist is presented. Time-interleaving errors are calibrated in the background by using a linear but noisy reference ADC. A test chip demonstrates that interleaving spurs are reduced to below −70 dBFS using an off-chip least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm. The reference ADC is an 8 b SAR with reduced sampling capacitance and input amplitude. This results in a low-power reference ADC with high bandwidth and low harmonic distortion. Linearity errors introduced by capacitor mismatch are reduced with dynamic element matching (DEM). The LMS algorithm also calibrates third-order harmonic distortion. The noise of the reference ADC is averaged in the LMS algorithm. Hence, it allows us to combine the high linearity of the reference ADC with the low-noise performance of the main ADC. The total power consumption, including clock generation and input buffers, is 38.5 mW. The reference ADC running at 200 MS/s contributes 2.2 mW to the total power.	algorithm;cmos;distortion;forward error correction;least mean squares filter;low-power broadcasting;sinadr;sampling (signal processing);successive approximation adc	Danny Luu;Lukas Kull;Thomas Toifl;Christian Menolfi;Matthias Braendli;Pier Andrea Francese;Thomas Morf;Marcel A.

In this context, high-performance DACs have become crucial building blocks. The current-steering-flash DAC architecture is the most popular architecture for speed demanding applications. Although limited by component mismatches, resolution of these converters is typically enhanced by calibration solutions such as laser trimming or corrective active circuitry. Dynamic performances, on the other hand, are strongly dependent on switch design and operation which can easily spoil even the best static accuracy level at higher speeds. For this reason, much effort is concentrated on the design of clean switching processes to optimize signal to noise ratios delivered at the output of the DAC. In this paper, we present a novel switch sizing and compensation technique for inverted R-2R ladder DACs. While traditional switch compensation in the ladder leads to very large switch devices steering MSBs currents, our method allows current-steering with reduced equally sized switches. Results of 12-b DAC test chips fabricated in a 0.18 mum process show that this new technique allows significant area savings, without impairing static accuracy. Other improvements brought by this technique include simplified switch driving circuitry and improved settling time.	biasing;digital-to-analog converter;dummy variable (statistics);electronic circuit;glitch;laser trimming;network switch;performance;point of view (computer hardware company);prototype;resistor ladder;settling time	David Marche;Yvon Savaria;Yves Gagnon	2009	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008510	chip;control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;calibration;multidisciplinary design optimization;switch;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;digital signal processing;settling time;signal-to-noise ratio;cmos	EDA	59.77307874062856	52.13186149867959	98272

It employs OFDM (orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing) spread spectrum technique to allow users to define signal parameters with a great flexibility as per the test requirements. This OFDMmethod essentially starts from the frequency sampling and then conversion to generate time domain signals, which can significantly reduce the number of data points in the signal generation. Response of such test signals from the device under test (DUT) can be captured and analyzed so as to characterize frequency response associated with each frequency tone.

The proposed generator consists of two cascaded polarization modulators driven by two radio frequency signals with different frequencies. By adjusting the parameters, 9, 12, and 16 comb lines can be generated with tunable frequency spacing. The scheme requires no DC bias voltage of the modulators and no optical filter, which makes our method simple and stable. A concept proof simulation is conducted to confirm the feasibility of the generation schemes of the 9-, 12-, and 16-line OFCs.	biasing;polarization (waves);radio frequency;simulation;voltage regulator module	Yang Yang;Jianxin Ma;Xiangjun Xin;Qi Zhang;Yi Zhang;Xiaoli Yin;Ruijiao Zhang;Wen Liu	2015	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-015-0584-1	telecommunications;comb generator	Mobile	65.1478586709823	54.51099148920582	98756

It allows the reduction of word lengths of phase to amplitude converters and D/A converters. The drawback of the conventional phase EF is that it reduces the phase spurs only at DDS output frequencies, which are near DC or half the sampling frequency. New phase EF structures with arbitrary center frequency for cosine and quadrature output DDS are introduced. The cosine and quadrature DDS with tunable phase and amplitude EF were designed and implemented on a programmable logic device (PLD); our experimental results show their desired operation and performance.	direct digital synthesizer	Jouko Vankka;Jaakko Lindeberg;Kari Halonen	2003		10.1109/ISCAS.2003.1205681	control engineering;electronic engineering;direct digital synthesizer;programmable logic array;computer science;programmable logic device;control theory	HCI	62.77213630318196	50.26315245736096	98859

A dual frequency division multiplexing (DFDM) method is proposed to extract accurate lung ventilation. To realize the DFDM, the proposed EIT SoC adopts a dual frequency current generator (DFCG) and a dual frequency read-out front-end (DFRF) to process the two frequencies in one channel at once. Consequently, 65.1% of power consumption and 71.5% of area are reduced in each channel. In the DFCG, dynamic element matching (DEM) and adaptive quantization (AQ) techniques are adopted to achieve -46dBc total harmonic distortion. In the DFRF, a weaver demodulator (WD) and a trimmed notch filter combined with low-pass filter (TN-LPF) reduce the settling time of the sensor front-end by 83.3% (0.17ms) to achieve the 30fps real-time operation with 32 electrodes. The proposed EIT SoC is successfully verified by both in-vitro and in-vivo test and achieved 95.35% accuracy.	cmos;characteristic impedance;electromagnetically induced transparency;frequency divider;language weaver;low-pass filter;multiplexing;oracle advanced queuing;quantization (signal processing);real-time clock;settling time;system on a chip;tomography;total harmonic distortion;twisted nematic field effect;video-in video-out	Yongsu Lee;Kiseok Song;Hoi-Jun Yoo	2015	2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)	10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231259	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	57.35387947808668	50.50837020728124	99168

The resulting explosion in the bandwidth requirements of the polar components can so far be only tolerated for narrowband transmitters, such as EDGE of the 2G cellular. To enable polar topology for wideband transmitters, we propose a technique that alters the signal trajectory such that it avoids crossing (and proximity) of the constellation origin. The resulting substantial decrease of the polar modulator bandwidth is traded off against slight increase of in-band modulation distortion and adjacent channel leakage. We illustrate effectiveness of this method using wideband CDMA (WCDMA) of the 3G cellular. The technique is first mathematically analyzed for various tradeoffs followed by high-level modeling and simulation results. Since the technique is fully contained in the digital domain, its performance effects on the entire RF transmitter can be accurately simulated. A digital architecture to implement the proposed technique is also presented.	audio power amplifier;baseband;distortion;elegant degradation;high- and low-level;matlab;modulation;nonlinear system;radio frequency;requirement;simulation;spectral leakage;transmitter;ultra-wideband;vhdl	Jingcheng Zhuang;Khurram Waheed;Robert Bogdan Staszewski	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2009.2037394	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;modeling and simulation;radio frequency	Mobile	60.37597628843173	58.106470207044914	99190

The phases of filter input and output signals are compared and the phase error is used to generate the control voltage, which adjusts the transconductances of operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) and, consequently, tunes the NF center frequency without quality factor variation. The proposed solution is robust to filter parameter variations. The filter is implemented in 0.13μm SiGe BiCMOS technology. Under the typical circuit operating conditions, the center frequency tuning is within the range from 70MHz up to 150MHz, with tuning error less than 1%. The power consumption is less than 3.6mW, the 1dB gain compression point is −2.5dBm, the input (IIP3) and output (OIP3) intercept points are 3.47 and 9.07dBm, respectively, and the total filter effective noise voltage is 4.35μVrms.

A fault tolerant active pixel sensor (APS) has previously been designed and fabricated that can correct for stuck high and stuck low defects. Analyses of the pixel noise for a standard APS and a fault tolerant APS are presented that consider reset noise, photocurrent shot noise, dark current shot noise, transistor thermal noise, transistor flicker noise, operational amplifier noise, and feedback resistor thermal noise. Under worst case conditions (no illumination), the noise of the fault tolerant APS is 1.106 /spl times/ more than a standard APS. At a typical illumination level, the fault tolerant APS noise is nearly unchanged to that of a standard APS. Previous research has shown that the fault tolerant APS is more sensitive than a standard APS, thus the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the fault tolerant APS should be greater than the standard APS except under very low light conditions.	active pixel sensor;best, worst and average case;dark current (physics);digital camera;fault tolerance;flicker noise;image resolution;johnson–nyquist noise;operational amplifier;shot noise;signal-to-noise ratio;transistor	Cory Jung;Mohammad Hadi Izadi;Michelle L.

6f2c612a582ff4cb404e0262ce384890cfcb5879	an improved-linearity, single-stage variable-gain amplifier using current squarer for wider gain range		A novel single-stage variable-gain amplifier (VGA) based on transconductance \(g_{m}\)-ratio amplifier is analyzed and designed with wider linear-in-dB gain range and improved linearity. The variable-gain amplifier proposed here consists of an exponential control block, a current squarer and an amplifier block with both input and load degeneration. With the help of current squarer which gets square function of the output current from exponential control block, the VGA achieves the maximum linear gain range in single stage. Current squarer is proposed, which is designed with compensation technique to minimize the second-order effect caused by carrier mobility reduction in short channel MOSFET. To avoid the poor linearity performance of the \(g_{{m}}\)-ratio amplifiers, the distortion is analyzed and the linearity is improved by applying input and load degenerating technique. At the same power consumption, the input 1 dB compression point can be improved by nearly 8.78 dB. Simulation results show that the VGA can provide a gain variation range of 64.09 dB (from \(-35.59\) to 28.5 dB) with a 3-dB bandwidth from 47 to 640 MHz.

In digital radio applications, running BER tests during production is highly prohibitive in terms of test cost due to the prolonged testing time required for applying RF modulated digital data-frames (each containing pseudo-random bit patterns) to the receiver and capturing the response digital bits at low baseband data-rate. Accurate and repeatable BER measurement requires the use of a large number of data-frames. In this paper, a new production testing methodology for measuring BER of wireless receivers is presented. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the time for making BER measurements by applying a sequence of AC tests. The BER value is predicted using statistical regression models that map the results of the AC tests to the expected BER value. The method also alleviates the need for using a complex BER tester (BERT).

As millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) circuits are vulnerable to process variations including the mismatch between interconnects, this E-band TX design is conducted in a layout floor-plan oriented way. Compact and symmetrical floor-plans of poly-phase filter (PPF) and I/Q modulator are presented in this work to suppress the LO feed-through (LOFT) and I/Q imbalance over both 71-76 and 81-86 GHz bands. In addition, a systematic design methodology is proposed for the mm-Wave PPF to reduce required EM simulations. The calibration methods used in this design are easy to implement for further reducing LOFT and I/Q imbalance with negligible impact on other TX performance metrics. The 0.225 mm 2 E-band TX achieves a measured output power of 12 dBm and efficiency of 15% with about 15 GHz bandwidth. It features an uncalibrated I/Q imbalance of less than 30 dB from 62.5 to 85.5 GHz.

49dcc6a238f22831adece27b5f8b0643a00a6caa	a low-complexity full-duplex radio implementation with a single antenna		"""This paper presents a novel low-complexity full-duplex radio design, which only uses a single patch antenna without any duplexer or circulator for passive suppression of self-interference, and a computationally efficient technique for linear digital cancellation. The proposed full-duplex design is tested for IEEE 802.11g Wireless Standard on the WARP (v3) software-defined radio implementation platform. It is shown that this design provides a total suppression of 88 dB, which is sufficient for low-power or short-range full-duplex communication. The dual polarized slot coupled patch antenna used in our design provides an interport isolation as high as 60 dB in 2.4 GHz band. Additionally, the digital domain cancellation utilizes a frequency domain-based estimation and reconstruction approach, which not only offers up to <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$61\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> reduction in the computational complexity but also provides a <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$5-7$ </tex-math></inline-formula> dB better digital cancellation performance in highly selective channel conditions, as compared to the time-domain-based techniques.

For wideband high frequency applications, parallel multi-rate conversion systems such as time-interleaved or hybrid filter bank analog-to-digital converters (resp. TI-ADC or HFB) are attractive solutions. This paper compares the robustness of both techniques with respect to non-idealities of the anti-aliasing filter (AAF). Theoretical results show that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation due to out-of-band signals is lesser for HFBs than for TI-ADCs, provided that the analysis filters of the HFB are selective enough. Simulation results show that this is the case even for low-order analysis filters in the case of a four-channel HFB.	aliasing;analog-to-digital converter;anti-aliasing filter;elegant degradation;filter bank;mike lesser;out-of-band agreement;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;ti-nspire series	Caroline Lelandais-Perrault;Morgan Roger	2012	10th IEEE International NEWCAS Conference	10.1109/NEWCAS.2012.6329004	adaptive filter;electronic engineering;low-pass filter;telecommunications;engineering;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;filter design;prototype filter;m-derived filter	Robotics	59.78359826338319	57.67928632192385	101159

This type of networks is characterized by its price, its size and its energy consumption. In the last few years, several recent developments concern these networks but rare of them propose a complete and functional architecture. The challenge of this work consists in proposing a new architecture for impulse communication based on the wavelet transform for both generation of pulses and detection of the information.

We propose a novel method to auto calibrate a programmable receiver equalization circuit to a target gain equalization value without the use of any external test equipment or channel. This method is built upon on-chip eye monitoring and internal loop back capabilities, which are used to measure the gain equalization value. By executing this on-chip gain equalization measurement for various equalizer settings, the setting which produces equalization that is closest to the target value can be determined. This has been implemented in 45nm CMOS for a PCI Express 2.0 transceiver hardware running at 5Gbps.

ABCD-parameters are used to analyze the passive link model, which takes into account termination impedances at transmitter and receiver as well as the network parameters of the interconnect. Voltage transfer function and input impedance of the link model are used to carry out a combined evaluation of frequency dependent signal transmission and power consumption of the link. The combined analysis allows to carry out an optimization of the energy efficiency under the given constraints. It is applied to a realistic high speed backplane link, which is modeled using measured interconnect network parameters.

In our research we explore the power savings gained by splitting the hardware architecture for continuous monitoring into two stages: an always-on ultra-low-power mixed-signal wake-up circuit placed near the sensor, performing coarse recognition (e.g. wake-up circuit) and waking up the main digital processing unit only on event detection. This enables for activation of energy-hungry digital processing only at the rate of event occurrence without penalising responsiveness and monitoring continuity. We focus on the wake-up circuit performing recognition of spectro-temporal audio patterns, consisting of spectro-temporal feature extraction, and the classification sub-circuits. We propose a novel design of the feature extraction circuit. It consists of a spectral decomposition multi-channel analog band-pass filter bank, implemented in generalized impedance converter topology (GIC), and the bank of passive channel detectors for measuring the intervals of in-band signals. Experimental filter characterization demonstrated the benefits of proposed filtering topology for low-power applications in the audio frequency range even with operational amplifiers of very limited bandwidth. Detector's response was verified in multi-channel environment. Preliminary analysis showed power consumption ranging from 10.5 to 13.5 μW per channel using off-the-shelf components.	acoustic cryptanalysis;autonomous robot;characteristic impedance;digital data;electronic circuit;experiment;feature extraction;filter bank;frequency band;high availability;low-power broadcasting;mixed-signal integrated circuit;operational amplifier;prototype;responsiveness;scott continuity;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;verification and validation;wake-on-lan	Dinko Oletic;Vedran Bilas;Michele Magno;Norbert Felber;Luca Benini	2016	2016 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)	10.3850/9783981537079_0295	audio electronics;embedded system;detector;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;audio signal processing;feature extraction;computer science;engineering;band-pass filter;efficient energy use	EDA	54.4429285247883	52.295480706733386	101587

Higher order modes generation and control have been presented with simulated and experimental results. The dual excitation of RDRA generated even and odd modes. Space 's' between top and bottom DRAs, controlled modes and shifting of first and third resonant modes towards second mode resulted into merging of all three modes.

Measurements confirm the low quadrature phase error of the topology and its ability to synthesize the [0.9-4] GHz band, being suited for GSM up to WIMAX applications.	cmos;codel;in-phase and quadrature components;ring oscillator;silicon on insulator	Cédric Majek;Yann Deval;Hervé Lapuyade;Jean-Baptiste Begueret	2009		10.1145/1601896.1601953	control engineering;electronic engineering;frequency synthesizer;engineering;electrical engineering;delay-locked loop;ring oscillator;control theory;delay line oscillator	EDA	63.262587008693785	49.40745292056291	101841

1687fc059aa22e3df3847038e178251e7dd225e7	microstrip dual-mode filters with miniaturized size and broadened stopband using meander-shaped stepped-impedance ring resonator	size miniaturization and harmonic suppression;ring resonator;stepped impedance ring resonator;dual mode bandpass filter	An improved class of microstrip dual-mode bandpass filter is proposed using the meander-shaped stepped-impedance ring resonator (SIRR). This meander SIRR, together with a uniform impedance ring resonator (UIRR), is at first studied to demonstrate its attractive features of harmonic-resonance suppression and overall-size miniaturization. A pair of squared notches is then etched out on the corners along either of diagonal lines of this symmetrical SIRR that is capacitively driven by the two perpendicular feed lines. Two SIRR-based dual-mode filters are therefore designed, simulated and fabricated. The overall size of this filter finds to be reduced by about 50% in area. The 1st harmonic passband of this filter is raised to 5.30GHz that exceeds the three times of its fundamental passband at 1.52GHz as verified by experiment.	characteristic impedance;institute of electronics, information and communication engineers;microstrip;numerical analysis;resonance;return loss;zero suppression	Hang Wang;Lei Zhu	2005	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.2.159	electronic engineering;dielectric resonator antenna;helical resonator	Vision	65.49009736981354	55.992241475298684	102329

The antenna is required to be low-profile because of mount restrictions. However, reduction of its height generally causes degradation of antenna performance. Firstly, an initial low-profile reflector antenna with an elliptical aperture is designed by using Geometrical Optics (GO) shaping. Then a Physical Optics (PO) shaping technique is applied to optimize the gain and sidelobes including mitigation of undesired scattering. The developed design method provides highly accurate design procedure for electrically small reflector antennas.

In contrast, analog resources in mixed signal testers can easily take care of such signals. The purpose of this work is to establish organized methodologies to generate and analyze the SSC implemented signal by using an AWG (Arbitrary Waveform Generator) and a waveform sampler. The first section describes the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) & IFFT (Inverse FFT) method which provides an elegant method to construct a SSC high-speed digital data stream using an AWG. The second section describes an under-sampling method to analyze wideband signals such as a SSC high-speed digital signal by using a waveform sampler. A practical example shows a data stream of a 1.5Gbps SATA (Serial ATA) with a 30ms triangle profile SSC period.	care-of address;digital data;digital signal processor;fast fourier transform;mixed-signal integrated circuit;sql server compact;sampling (signal processing);serial ata;waveform	Hideo Okawara	2011	2011 IEEE International Test Conference	10.1109/TEST.2011.6139159	fast fourier transform;electronic engineering;computer hardware;telecommunications;computer science;spread spectrum	EDA	56.97299267967342	57.627235924853125	102394

Due to a high supply voltage and a large current, HV chips are prone to overheating; thus, they require on-chip temperature sensors to monitor thermal variation. The voltage difference between the drain and source voltages of a metal-oxide-semiconductor, i.e., VDS, of HV devices is enlarged by high supply voltages, causing a severe channel length modulation effect to jeopardize the linearity of the saturation current. The proposed calibrated temperature sensors in this brief provide a nonlinear calibration function to resolve this problem. Moreover, our design reveals a process compensation capability by the proposed process variation canceler. The maximal deviation in the range of (-40°C, +150)°C is measured to be -2.05°C-+2.06°C.	best, worst and average case;channel length modulation;coefficient;image sensor;maximal set;nonlinear system;semiconductor;video for windows	Chua-Chin Wang;Wen-Je Lu;Tsung-Yi Tsai	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2014.2362734	resistor;system on a chip;control engineering;electronic engineering;telecommunications;temperature measurement;computer science;electrical engineering;linearity;quantum mechanics;modulation	EDA	58.68193231466352	47.99033813358591	102616

A three-level buck converter topology with zerovoltage switching (ZVS) is adopted to remove the dominant switching power loss under high-input-voltage condition, thereby enabling the converter to achieve high power efficiency in the megahertz range and reduce the required values of power passives. A constant-frequency adaptive-on-time V2 control is proposed to not only regulate the output voltage, but also offer the flying capacitor self-balancing in the megahertz range and over a wide input range for improving the converter reliability. A body diode-based floating ZVS detector is also developed to enable full-ZVS operation of power transistors in high-frequency low duty-ratio conditions with ≤5 ns ZVS turnon delay. Implemented in a 120 V 0.5 μm CMOS process, the proposed voltage regulator uses four 50 V on-chip power nMOS to support an input voltage from 12 to 100 V and regulates the output voltage at 10 V with a maximum output power of 5 W. The proposed regulator achieves a maximum power efficiency of 90% under the nominal 48 V input and 2 MHz switching frequency. Compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts, the proposed regulator provides 66 times and 2.6 times reductions in the inductance and the total capacitance, respectively.	ahead-of-time compilation;backward differentiation formula;buck converter;cmos;charge pump;clock rate;diode;duty cycle;experiment;maximum power transfer theorem;nmos logic;performance per watt;reconfigurable computing;self-balancing binary search tree;switched-mode power supply;transistor;voltage regulator	Jing Xue;Hoi Lee	2016	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2016.2606581	control engineering;voltage regulator;electronic engineering;capacitor;network switch;computer science;engineering;78xx;control theory;low-dropout regulator;dropout voltage;power semiconductor device	EDA	61.55870684601936	46.744959368281286	102843

It is based on a two-stage topology: The first stage performs a differential measurement to single-ended signal conversion, providing a common-mode rejection that only depends on the matching between two resistors; the second stage filters the signal. Three novel topologies that are based on this technique are presented, analyzed, and measured, and design criteria are finally given. Their performance is compared with that of a state-of-the-art topology that is used as the benchmark, and it results in a better common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR).	benchmark (computing);operational amplifier;rejection sampling;single-ended signaling	Marco Massarotto;Alfonso Carlosena;Antonio J.

This paper introduces a 13mm2, 40nm CMOS 2G/HSPA+/TDSCDMA/UE cat. 4 transceiver that consumes 36/65mA battery-referenced current in 3G/LTE20 modes (B1, -50dBm TX, -60dBm RX). This is achieved in part by employing a multiport single-core LNA with a multitap inductor and a current-mode-driven single-core transmit mixer. Baseband-assisted calibration techniques help achieve <;1.2% RX EVM in LTE20 and >60dBm IIP2 in all bands. To save on platform area and cost, the RFIC supports single-ended LNAs, 32kHz clock generation, and free-running XTAL operation.

The chip has a matched pair of 64-stage cascaded analog second-order filter banks with 512 pulse-frequency modulated (PFM) address-event representation (AER) outputs. The spectral selectivity is sharpened through 2 different on-chip methods: an on-chip local Q DAC and an on-chip spatial sharpening through nearest neighbour lateral inhibition. The fabricated chip in a 4-metal 2-poly 0.35um CMOS process consumes peak 25mW power for the digital circuits and 33mW for the analog core. Dynamic range to produce PFM output is 36dB (25mVpp to 1500mVpp at microphone preamp output). Event timing jitter is 2us for 250mVpp input. The peak output bandwidth is 10M events per second (eps) but typical speech scenarios show rates of 20keps.	binaural beats;cmos;digital electronics;dynamic range;filter bank;lateral thinking;microphone;modulation;preamplifier;selectivity (electronic)	Shih-Chii Liu;André van Schaik;Bradley A.

309707218616b2417ac348559094fc1e0da2862a	a novel low power g m-c continuous-time analog filter with wide tuning range		This paper proposes a CMOS Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) for wide tuning range filter applications with reduced power dissipation. The tuning range can be extended by operating the OTA in weak inversion region as well as in strong inversion region. This can be attained by tuning the bias current, which results in the linear variation of transconductance (gm). A fifth order elliptical low pass filter is simulated with cutoff frequency tuning from 1.5 kHz to 1.6 MHz. Wide tuning range filters can be employed for multimode applications, which in-turns help in saving silicon area. A novel tunable resistor is simulated using twin well technology and its value ranges from 40 kΩ to 30 MΩ. The proposed circuit is simulated in SCL 180 nm standard CMOS technology with 1.8 V as supply voltage and achieves a dynamic range (DR) of 47 dB. Total power consumption of the circuit is 670 μW at 1.6 MHz.	biasing;british informatics olympiad;cmos;cpu power dissipation;dynamic range;elliptic filter;low-pass filter;operational transconductance amplifier;simulation;structured text	P.

The first characteristic resulted in enhancement of the readout speed of the imager, while the second characteristic is shown here to make fixed pattern noise (FPN) less perceptible to the human visual system (HVS). This observation exploits the relatively poor sensitivity of the HVS to obliquely distributed patterns, known as the oblique effect. The effect was modeled using a spatial filter derived from measured characteristics of the HVS, and applied to the obliquely distributed FPN-dominated images of the pyramidal CMOS imager.	cmos;fixed-pattern noise;human visual system model;image sensor;oblique projection;sampling (signal processing)	Fayçal Saffih;Richard Hornsey	2007	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	10.1109/TCSVT.2007.897111	embedded system;computer vision;computer science;image sensor;spatial filter	Visualization	55.153293892926214	49.44840619175848	104416

Biasing conditions for every TFTs and voltage gain are systematically discussed. In addition, influences of threshold voltage shift on both static and dynamic performances are discussed. Comparison results show that the voltage gain can be increased from 40 to 67 dB, and stability of the constant tail-current biasing is better than that of constant voltage biasing method. Further, an oscillating capacitance touch sensing circuit based on the proposed amplifier is shown, and sub-pF touching capacitance can be distinguished.

For many classes of phase manipulated (PM) signals it is possible to transform their periodic ACFs (PACFs) in ideal PACFs by the so-named side-lobe suppression filters (SLSFs). Due to this reason in the paper two necessary conditions for synthesis of energy-efficient SLSFs are proved. On this base it is demonstrated that for the wireless communication system the PM signals with flat or nearly flat energy spectrum could be as useful as the PM signals with ideal PACF.	acf;acoustic lobing;dirac delta function;radar;zero suppression	Mihail P.

The measured gain improves from 13 dB in traditional Zero-Vgs inverters to 76 dB in PLS inverters; the average noise margin increases from 2.58 V (Zero-Vgs) to 6.82 V (PLS) at 20 V supply. Assuming that a positive noise margin for each gate is the only requirement to obtain a fully functional digital circuit, the maximum number of logic gates compatible with a 90% yield improves from 200 Zero-Vgs inverters to above 24 million PLS inverters. A 240-stage PLS shift-register exploiting 13,440 organic TFTs is indeed successfully measured. This is to the authors' knowledge the organic circuit with the highest transistor count ever demonstrated. The control voltage, always within the supply rails, enables automatic correction of the process variations using linear control circuits. The proposed approach will enable a strong increase in the complexity of large-area electronics on foil, with great benefit to applications like flexible displays and large-area sensing surfaces.	barrel shifter;circuit complexity;comparator;control system;control theory;digital electronics;flexible display;inverter (logic gate);linear circuit;logic gate;logic synthesis;noise margin;positive feedback;power inverter;power supply;roll-to-roll processing;semiconductor;shift register;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;transistor count	Daniele Raiteri;Pieter van Lieshout;Arthur H.

Standards between 25 and 32Gb/s are rapidly approaching maturity, and available products and IPs at these rates are iterating to push down power while extending channel-loss recovery limits. Predictably, specifications are now in early stages for extending per-lane bandwith to between 40 and 64Gb/s. Meeting these 25Gb/s+ targets, especially for long-reach applications, is stressing the capabilities of both the underlying circuitry and the communication channels, and has caused significant rethinking of the overall system and circuit architectures for these links. In particular, the debate about multi-level (PAM4) versus binary (PAM2) signaling and which path offers the best energy-efficiency/data-rate scalability has returned to the foreground. Similarly, the emergence of high-speed ADCs with sufficient resolution for link applications has driven renewed interest in DSP-based approaches, while other efforts have pushed more analog/mixed-signal link components to over 60Gb/s/lane. To further ensure low BER operations, sophisticated coding such as FEC is brought into the discussion. Even in the domain of optical communications, significant challenges related to the bandwidth capabilities of the optical devices as well as the back end processing are currently being addressed. In fact, some of the highest speed optical links are limited by the short electrical interconnect between the driver circuitry and the optical module itself. This forum presents state-of-the-art I/O techniques enabling such high line rates across both optical and electrical interfaces as well as a number of emerging standards such as 802.3bj, various flavors of CEI, and HMC (hybrid memory cube).	big data;capability maturity model;electronic circuit;emergence;forward error correction;high-throughput computing;hybrid memory cube;input/output;mixed-signal integrated circuit;scalability;throughput;transceiver;x.690	Ken Chang;Frank O'Mahony;Elad Alon;Hyeon-Min Bae;Nicola Da Dalt;Eric Fluhr	2015	2015 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC) Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7063147	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;cmos;bandwidth;transceiver;modulation	DB	54.78639766305513	56.894546282395616	105266

RF SIC is also critical for full-duplex radios where extremely-high levels of SIC must be achieved, necessitating SIC at various points in the receiver chain. While active RF SIC is potentially compact and highly reconfigurable, the use of active circuitry in the canceller introduces noise, distortion and power dissipation challenges. Furthermore, and particularly for fully-integrated silicon-based SIC implementations, the bandwidth (BW) of RF SIC is limited by the frequency selectivity of the antenna interface and the wireless self-interference channel. In this paper, we present recent developments in fully-integrated RF SIC techniques that address these challenges.	bandwidth (signal processing);cpu power dissipation;characteristic impedance;distortion;duplex (telecommunications);duplexer;electronic circuit;interference (communication);oscillator phase noise;radio frequency;requirement;selectivity (electronic);simplified instructional computer	Jin Zhou;Harish Krishnaswamy	2015	2015 IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2015.7146045	electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering	Mobile	59.05375363161438	58.81935365434378	105270

The tiny capacitors are realized by the coplanar transmission lines which are arranged unsymmetrical in a 6 metal layers (M6) foundry of 0.18µm CMOS technology. These transmission line based capacitors are designed by using electro-magnetic field simulator, and co-designed by using SPICE simulator. Finally, these capacitors are employed to design 15bit DCO and fabricated the proposed DCO in 0.18µm CMOS technology, and tested. The measured phase noise of DCO was -118.3dBc/Hz (@1MHz offset frequency), and the oscillating frequency tuned from 4.86GHz to 5.36GHz in the minimum frequency-tuning step of 18kHz.	cmos;digitally controlled oscillator;phase noise	Ramesh K.

The majority of this power reduction is due to use a fully integrated analog front-end (AFE) with inherent all the necessary functions that needed in traditional ECG acquisition implementation. This AFE is implemented in 0.18um CMOS technology, consumes only around 0.3mW.

Investigations are carried out to see if the network can still perform as an image edge detector, noise remover, or shadow creator when its metal-semiconductor-metal photodiodes (MSMPDs) have a non-linear response and device variations (i.e. variation in sensitivity from one device to another). From HSPICE simulations, it was found that the edge detector is not affected by the MSMPD's non-linearity and tolerates 20% device variation. It was also found that by adjusting the cell's behaviour, the impact of the non-linearity on the noise remover is alleviated to an acceptable level and that the network can perform as a shadow creator and tolerates 40% device variation. This discovery means that the restriction on the fabrication method of the MSMPD may be significantly reduced, if the programmability of the OECNN can be limited.	artificial neural network;cellular neural network;edge detection;metal–semiconductor junction;nonlinear system;spice 2;semiconductor;simulation	Keng-Shen Hung;K.

However, as the required threshold voltage is lowered, the number of samples and, in turn, the data rate and the energy consumed by the overall system increases. In this paper, we present a cubic Hermitian vector-based technique for online compression of asynchronously sampled electrocardiogram signals. The proposed method is computationally efficient data compression. The algorithm has complexity O(n), thus well suited for asynchronous ADCs. Our algorithm requires no data buffering, maintaining the energy advantage of asynchronous ADCs. The proposed method of compression has a compression ratio of up to 90% with achievable percentage root-mean-square difference ratios as a low as 0.97. The algorithm preserves the superior feature-to-feature timing accuracy of asynchronously sampled signals. These advantages are achieved in a computationally efficient manner since algorithm boundary parameters for the signals are extracted a priori.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;analog;analog-to-digital converter;computational complexity theory;cubic function;data compression;data rate units;electrocardiography;extraction;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;voltage	Thanks Marisa;Thomas Niederhauser;Andreas Haeberlin;Reto Andreas Wildhaber;Rolf Vogel;Marcel Jacomet;Josef Goette	2015	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2015.2449901	electronic engineering;interpolation;computer science;theoretical computer science;control theory;mathematics;threshold voltage;compressed sensing	EDA	58.35372521251201	50.512948551666135	105961

The results apply to dc, sinusoidal and more general quasi-stationary signals. It is shown in the case of a simple sigma-delta modulation that no-overload dithering can smooth the error spectrum and can make the quantization error asymptotically uncorrelated with the input. It does hot, however, make the quantization error white. In the case of multistage sigma-delta modulation with the appropriate dithering, the quantization error becomes white, even for a system with only two-stages. The signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) is derived for sigma-delta and multistage sigma-delta oversampled analog-to-digital conversion with additive dithering. Simulation results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.

Instead of using an oversampling scheme which requires a high-speed clock generator, we adopt an interpolation scheme which relaxes the demand of a high-speed phase-locked loop with very high precision. A dual-tracking design is proposed to precisely align both edges of a data eye. Hence, the center of a data eye can be optimally sampled. A standard foundry 0.25-mum 1P5M CMOS technology is used to realize the proposed dual-tracking CDR for 7times100 (bit-MHz) LVDS signaling.

The proposed architecture is targeted for wireless applications where ultra low power consumption and data-rate in tens of megabits per second are needed over distances in the range of tens of centimeters. The transmitter and receiver are both based on super-regenerative principle and both functions in the transceiver utilize one mutual super-regenerative oscillator. Additionally, the transceiver architecture allows fast synchronization of transceivers thanks to the delayed reflection phenomenon which makes it possible to detect correct timing simultaneously at both ends of the system. Measurement results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed principle.	ambient intelligence;data rate units;duty cycle;in-phase and quadrature components;megabit;transceiver;transmitter;ultra-wideband	Joni Jantunen;Antti Lappeteläinen;Jarmo Arponen;Aarno Pärssinen;Michaël Pelissier;Bertrand Gomez;Julien Keignart	2008	IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.901	telecommunications;computer science;oscillation	Embedded	59.681663894357435	54.42416388589185	106784

The robustness of the proposed countermeasure is evaluated by measuring the number of current traces required for a differential power analysis attack. We analyze the relationship between the required number of current traces and the dynamic current variations, and we show empirically that the required numbers of current traces is proportional to an inverse of the square of the rms value of the flattened current. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design by using the experimental results of the fabricated chip. The analysis of the experimental results confirms the effectiveness of the current flattening circuit. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Voltage-Mode drivers require intrinsically half the power of their Current-Mode counterparts and do not require Common-Mode Voltage Control. However, for fast ON/OFF switching a special high-speed voltage regulator is required which needs to be kept ON during data pauses, and hence its power consumption must be minimized, resulting in tight design constraints. A proof-of-concept chip test prototype has been designed and fabricated in low-cost standard 0.35 μm CMOS. At ±500 mV voltage swing with 500 Mbps serial bit rate and 32 bit events, current consumption scales from 15.9 mA (7.7 mA for the driver and 8.2 mA for the receiver) at 10 Mevent/s rate to 406 μA ( 343 μA for the driver and 62.5 μA for the receiver) for an event rate below 10 Kevent/s, therefore achieving a rate dependent power saving of up to 40 times, while keeping switching times at 1.5 ns. Maximum achievable event rate was 13.7 Meps at 638 Mbps serial bit rate. Additionally, differential voltage swing is tunable, thus allowing further power reductions.	32-bit;artificial neural network;cmos;characteristic impedance;data rate units;event-driven programming;hl7 2.5 event type;impedance matching;low-voltage differential signaling;maxima and minima;neural network simulation;power management;prototype;serial communication;sparse matrix;voltage regulator;disease transmission	Carlos Zamarreño-Ramos;Raghavendra Kulkarni;José Silva-Martínez;Teresa Serrano-Gotarredona;Bernab&#x00E9; Linares-Barranco	2013	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TBCAS.2012.2232925	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;78xx;cmos	Mobile	57.53782453658139	52.5917449965746	107112

With the ability to sense the environment, large interferers that overwhelm small desired signals can be avoided. The learning and adapting capabilities are enabled by means of a flexible receiver architecture with variable local oscillators (LOs) and tunable bandpass filters. Avoiding large interferers can reduce image rejection (IR) requirements for a given performance level and results in greater tolerance for low-Q filters and receiver mismatches.

3c41522f9d42d5f8b92c21e0cb36d66050de8629	23.1 an 8gb 12gb/s/pin gddr5x dram for cost-effective high-performance applications	random access memory;pins;clocks;phase locked loops;transmission line measurements;bandwidth;graphics	Over the last years, GDDR5 has emerged as the dominant standard for applications requiring high system bandwidth like graphic cards and game consoles. However, GDDR5 data rates are saturating due to limitations in the clock frequency and column-access cycle time (tCCD). To reach the data rate of 9Gb/s/pin [1], a GDDR5 DRAM has to be clocked at 2.25GHz and operate at a tCCD of 888ps. This combination makes the design of control logic, data path and memory core difficult in a typical DRAM process. Still, the industry is demanding higher system bandwidth to enable continuous improvements in the visual computing arena. For this purpose, an 8Gb GDDR5X DRAM has been developed reaching a data rate of 12Gb/s/pin, which surpasses the fastest published GDDR5 [1] by 33%. This paper introduces GDDR5X and discusses relevant circuit techniques in clock generation, receiver and transmitter design to enable the higher data rates on a conventional DRAM process.	clock rate;data rate units;dynamic random-access memory;fastest;transmitter;video card;visual computing	Martin Brox;Mani Balakrishnan;Martin Broschwitz;Cristian Chetreanu;Stefan Dietrich;Fabien Funfrock;Marcos Alvarez Gonzalez;Thomas Hein;Eugen Huber;Daniel Lauber;Milena Ivanov;Maksim Kuzmenka;Chris Mohr;Francisco Emiliano Munoz;Juan Ocon Garrido;Swetha Padaraju;Sven Piatkowski;Jan Pottgiesser	2017	2017 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2017.7870424	embedded system;real-time computing;phase-locked loop;memory rank;cas latency;computer hardware;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;graphics;operating system;bandwidth	HPC	58.356533247777634	53.88629658272288	107365

In this paper we report an ultra-miniature, 0.003 mm2, PNP thermal sensor in TSMC 65nm. The sensor utilizes a novel switched-capacitor bandgap reference and a single bit sigma-delta modulator to achieve a maximum error of ±1.35°C and a resolution of 130mK for a 12 bit, 4ms conversion. The sensor is the smallest reported BJT bandgap-based sensor, especially when considering the process node, and one of the smallest in all mechanisms.

Using wideband digitization, signal processing tasks are performed in the user spaces of these PCs. However, there is a data timing problem in this scheme. High performance ADCs process samples under the control of their own clocks, which requires the incoming sample stream to be continuous and regularly spaced. But today's PCs lack an I/O system capable of delivering a constant sample stream to the analog front-end. In this paper, several schemes are presented to solve this problem. Simulation results and performance evaluation are also presented.

097fc263e1c74644969183168a43e473a98bd629	wireless monitoring of volatile organic compounds/water vapor/gas pressure/temperature using rf transceiver		This paper describes the development and characterization of a wireless pressure monitoring system (WPMS) using an integrated radio frequency (RF) transceiver for applications such as monitoring of exerted vapor pressure variations of gases, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and water vapor. Parametric sensing and environment detection using integrated approach are the key drivers for modern sensor technology. Our WPMS has an operating frequency band of 2.3152–2.6478 GHz. It has been developed using a pressure transducer, voltage-controlled oscillator, amplifier, and transmit/receive filtennas (filtering antennas). Transmitting antenna has been used for radiating RF signal (conditioned pressure information), while reflecting the undesired harmonics. Filtering antenna at the receiver side has been used to detect the desired RF signal, while filtering out the undesired signal. Experiments have been performed for monitoring a pressure variation of 0–50 kPa for a distance of 3 m from the transmitter. The pressure sensitivity of the system is 6.4 MHz/kPa with a good linearity response. Wireless temperature monitoring using our constructed RF sensor has also been demonstrated. The temperature sensitivity of wireless temperature monitoring system is about −662.2 kHz/°C between −55 °C and 130 °C. Calibration curve and polynomial fitting equations have been provided for evaluating pressure and temperature variations. The main advantages of this integrated system are integrated design, high-pressure/high-temperature sensitivity response, good linearity response, lower cost, less complexity, handheld, compact size, increased flexibility, and indigenous subsystems. The proposed system is suitable for wireless pressure/temperature monitoring applications in gas/oil industry, VOC industry, and steam industry.	amplifier;clock rate;evaporation;frequency band;handheld game console;known-plaintext attack;multi-function printer;polynomial;radio frequency;reduced cost;sensor web;steam;transceiver;transducer;transmitter;voltage-controlled oscillator	Amarjit Kumar;Nagendra Prasad Pathak	2018	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2018.2810718	electronic engineering;acoustics;wireless sensor network;radio frequency;transmitter;frequency band;amplifier;pressure sensor;mathematics;temperature measurement;vapor pressure	Mobile	62.76364648183795	56.66464110084025	107741

In the proposed scheme, the front-end interfacing is based on switched capacitor charge amplifier configuration using a fully differential operational transconductance amplifier and one differential capacitive sensor arrangement which provides differential output with minimum number of circuit components. In the back end, a sigma–delta ( $\Sigma \Delta $ ) modulator is integrated for modulated digital output. The signal conditioning circuit also includes gain programmability by selecting proper feedback capacitor and mismatch cancellation between the sensing capacitors through on-chip capacitors array. The complete application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is designed and fabricated in United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC)  $0.18-\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process technology. The fabricated ASIC is then integrated with a silicon-on-insulator microelectromechnical systems capacitive accelerometer to test and characterize the performance of the proposed scheme. The measured result shows that the sensitivity of the proposed circuit can be varied from 200 to 900 mV/g by changing the feedback capacitor.

In this paper the major considerations of the conformal antenna design were the compact size and the impact on antenna's performance of a steel installation base. By using a chip resistor of large resistance (120 Ω) the antenna size was reduced to 38% of that a conventional annular ring patch antenna. With the addition of the steel installation base the resonant frequency of the antenna increases about 4.2% and the bandwidth reduces from 17.5% to 11.7% by adjusting the load resistance simultaneously. Several key parameters were discussed and optimized, and the antenna was fabricated and its performance measured. The antenna is well matched at 2.4 GHz with 34.2 dB return loss and -2.5 dBi peak gain. Meanwhile, it exhibits excellent radiation patterns with very low cross-polarization levels.	antenna device component;bandwidth (signal processing);decibel;exhibits as topic;input impedance;inverted-f antenna;microstrip;miniaturization;neural network simulation;polarization (waves);resistor device component;resonance;return loss;semiconductor device fabrication;steel	Daihua Wang;Linli Song;Hanchang Zhou;Zhijie Zhang	2012		10.3390/s120708663	folded inverted conformal antenna;antenna aperture;omnidirectional antenna;antenna factor;electronic engineering;text mining;monopole antenna;antenna rotator;microstrip antenna;periscope antenna;telecommunications;antenna measurement;antenna tuner;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;antenna noise temperature;patch antenna;antenna;radiation pattern;loop antenna;coaxial antenna;dipole antenna;antenna efficiency	Mobile	67.1141405716805	56.373596575813565	108444

The array approach enables effective detection and discrimination of several analyte gases by using different gas-sensitive materials. The operating temperature of the metal oxide resistors varies between 200 and 350/spl deg/C. Individual temperature regulation is performed by three on-chip temperature controllers with a resolution of 0.5/spl deg/C. The phase margin of the temperature controllers was improved by adding degeneration resistors in the sources of the power transistors. An implemented sequential operation mode reduces the current consumption by 15%. A ring counter provides the clock signal for sequential operation. A novel circular membrane design was developed to improve the power efficiency of the micro-hotplates.	cmos	Diego Ruben Barrettino;Markus Graf;Martin Zimmermann;Christoph Hagleitner;Andreas Hierlemann;Henry Baltes	2003		10.1109/ISCAS.2003.1206354	chip;surface micromachining;electronic engineering;electrical efficiency;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;temperature control;thermoregulation;heating element;cmos;low-power electronics	Robotics	55.61768584734636	47.94892725544651	108558

The existing LDC error free method based on cumulative distribution function (CDF) neglects the phase nonlinearity of PA and therefore further application is limited. An improved CDF predistortion method is proposed in this paper, which considers not only amplitude nonlinearity but also phase nonlinearity of PAs. Experiment based on High Frequency (HF) PA is done, and the results show that the proposed method works well in compensating the amplitude and phase nonlinearities of HF PA, and the performance in third-order intermodulation (3IM) of the PA output can be improved by 23 dB, but the improvement of the conventional CDF method is 8 dB.	audio power amplifier;baseband;helicon filter;helicon focus;intermodulation;linguistic data consortium;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;nonlinear system;radio frequency;sampling (signal processing)	Lou Jingyi;Gao Jun;Qu Xiaoxu;Chen Lin	2010	2010 International Conference on Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2010.5631961	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	65.70775849891886	52.22449637756448	108717

Transformers are required to have adequate bandwidth to regenerate the measured current, apart from uncertainties that are caused by the nonsinusoidal waveforms along with harmonics. An expression for the transresistance of the current transformer in terms of parasitic components is derived. Approximate expressions for lower cutoff frequency, upper cutoff frequency, and bandwidth are derived from the equivalent models of the current probe in the corresponding frequency range. The expressions are validated by experimental results for a current transformer using a Ferroxcube ferrite core 528T500-4C4.

This paper proposes a multiband quadrature compressive sampling (MQCS) system to perform the sampling at sub-Landau rate. The MQCS system randomly projects the multiband signal into a compressive multiband one by modulating each subband signal with a low-pass signal and then samples the compressive multiband signal at Landau-rate with output of compressive measurements. The compressive inphase and quadrature (I/Q) components of each subband are extracted from the compressive measurements respectively and are exploited to recover the baseband I/Q components. As effective bandwidth of the compressive multiband signal is much less than that of the received multiband one, the sampling rate is much less than Landau rate of the received signal. Simulation results validate that the proposed MQCS system can effectively acquire and reconstruct the baseband I/Q components of the multiband signals.	baseband;compressed sensing;low-pass filter;multi-function printer;radar;randomness;sampling (signal processing);simulation	Shengyao Chen;Feng Xi;Zhong Liu;Bocheng Bao	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)	10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251866	electronic engineering;telecommunications;remote sensing	Embedded	58.34342369610797	57.25889056065125	108987

The method, called decision boundary gap estimation (DBGE), monitors the output of the ADC to estimate the size of code gaps that result at the decision boundaries of each stage. Code gaps result from such effects as capacitor mismatch, finite opamp gain, finite current source output impedance, comparator offset, and charge injection. DBGE does not require special calibration signals or additional analog hardware and can even reduce the performance requirements of the analog circuitry. The calibration is performed using the input signal and thus requires that the input signal exercise the codes in the vicinity of the decision boundaries of each stage. If it does not exercise these codes, then lack of calibration is less critical because the nonlinearities will not appear in the output signal. DBGE is simple and amenable to hardware and/or software implementations. Simulation results indicate DBGE is highly accurate, robust, and adaptive even in the presence of parameter drift and circuit noise.	analog-to-digital converter;analogue electronics;cmos;characteristic impedance;circuit design;code;comparator;current source;decision boundary;electronic circuit;loss function;open research;operational amplifier;output impedance;requirement;simulation;vergence;very-large-scale integration	Lane Brooks;Hae-Seung Lee	2008	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2008.925373	control engineering;electronic engineering;calibration;capacitor;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;electrical impedance;control theory	EDA	58.90822402109325	49.193074339664044	109037

But this type of receiver needs to be properly adjusted regarding the parameters of the sampling and the quantization stage of the analog- to-digital converter to comply with certain performance requirements. This paper studies the impact of the ideal, the track-and-hold and the sample-and-hold sampling circuit on the effective in-band signal-to-noise ratio of the receive signal. It also proposes sets of valid parameters of the complete analog-to- digital converter in terms of the duty cycle, the sampling rate, and the quantization resolution for a given band-pass input signal to limit the maximum performance loss. Moreover, the investigations for the different samplers and the overall analog-to- digital converter are used to trade-off the individual parameters in case of an exemplary LTE signal reception.	analog-to-digital converter;compaq lte;duty cycle;requirement;sample and hold;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio	Bjoern Almeroth;Gerhard P.

Jitter accumulation caused by random pattern signals has already been analyzed. However, periodic pattern signals such as pseudorandom signals are usually used to measure jitter accumulation. This paper describes the difference between the jitter accumulation for both signals and the necessary conditions to accurately estimate jitter accumulation for random pattern signals by using periodic pattern signals. First, it is shown theoretically that systematic jitter for periodic signals saturates, showing a ripple pattern. The limit of increase is determined by the ratio of tank bandwidth and pattern repetition frequency. Up to a certain number of regenerators determined by the ratio, systematic jitter increases in rough proportion to the a s l o p e . It is also shown that the equation to estimate random pattern jitter accumulation is determined by the measured value for periodic pattern signals. Second, jitter characteristics are simulated by optical signal circulating experiments. The results are in agreement with the analysis. In addition, the reduction effects on periodic signal jitter accumulation caused by timing signal delay and nonlinearity of the limiter in the timing circuit are shown.	bandwidth (signal processing);experiment;limiter;nonlinear system;pseudorandomness;ripple effect;tree accumulation	Masaki Amemiya;Mamoru Aiki;T.

In particular the threshold voltage (Vth) variation in printed TFTs is a serious impediment to the successful launch of fully printed TFT-based devices in the market. The underlying causes of the Vth variation in fully printed TFTs were analyzed by considering the misalignment of printed drain-source to gate electrodes, the rheology of electronic inks and effects from external sources of charge. By alleviating the influences of external sources of charge using a printed passivation layer, Vth variation is maintained below 30% using a fully printed process. Based on the attainable variation range, the required number of integrated TFTs was estimated to fabricate a fully printed TFT-based radio frequency (RF) sensor device. A practical compromise enables fully printed RF sensors to be realized via the scalability of printing processes that mitigate Vth variation by minimizing the level of TFT integration. Prototypes of fully printed RF sensors with human interactive capability-an RF sensor label, and an RF e-sensor (cyclic voltammetry) tag-are enabled with as few as 26 printed TFTs, demonstrating that low-cost and high throughput manufacturing of printed electronics is feasible.	printed circuit board;printed electronics;printing;radio frequency;scalability;sensor;thin-film transistor;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;throughput	Jinsoo Noh;Minhoon Jung;Younsu Jung;Chisun Yeom;Myungho Pyo;Gyoujin Cho	2015	Proceedings of the IEEE	10.1109/JPROC.2015.2410303	electronic engineering;thin-film transistor;logic gate;engineering;sensor;electrical engineering;electrode;optoelectronics;flexible electronics;printed circuit board;radio frequency	HCI	54.64018971394809	47.12477385859588	110498

As rat models provide the advantage of recording and stimulating different disease-related regions simultaneously, this paper proposes a battery-less, implantable neuro-electronic interface suitable for studying DBS mechanisms with a freely-moving rat. The neuro-electronic interface mainly consists of a microsystem able to interact with eight different brain regions bi-directionally and simultaneously. To minimize the size of the implant, the microsystem receives power and transmits data through a single coil. In addition, particular attention is paid to the capability of recording neural activities right after each stimulation, so as to acquire information on how stimulations modulate neural activities. The microsystem has been fabricated with the standard 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The chip area is 7.74 mm 2, and the microsystem is able to operate with a single supply voltage of 1 V. The wireless interface allows a maximum power of 10 mW to be transmitted together with either uplink or downlink data at a rate of 2 Mbps or 100 kbps, respectively. The input referred noise of recording amplifiers is 1.16 μVrms, and the stimulation voltage is tunable from 1.5 V to 4.5 V with 5-bit resolution. After the electrical functionality of the microsystem is tested, the capability of the microsystem to interface with rat brain is further examined and compared with conventional instruments. All experimental results are presented and discussed in this paper.	amplifier;cmos;coil device component;data rate units;deep brain stimulation;digital data;electric capacitance;exhibits as topic;experiment;implants;instrument - device;interface device component;literature;low-noise amplifier;matching;maximum power transfer theorem;morphologic artifacts;multiplexing;observable;specification;stimulation (motivation);telecommunications link;telemetry;temporomandibular joint disorders;transmitter;usb hub;disease transmission;latent orf73 antigen, human herpesvirus 8;voltage	Yu-Po Lin;Chun-Yi Yeh;Pin-Yang Huang;Zong-Ye Wang;Hsiang-Hui Cheng;Yi-Ting Li;Chi-Fen Chuang;Po-Chiun Huang;Kea-Tiong Tang;Hsi-Pin Ma;Yen-Chung Chang;Shih-Rung Yeh;Hsin Chen	2016	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2403282	embedded system;electronic engineering;capacitor;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;wireless	Visualization	56.18849338210102	51.05460910407105	111682

Employing these multipliers, large-scale artificial neural networks can be implemented using fewer MOS transistors than are required by implementations employing the so-called Gilbert multiplier. PSPICE circuit simulations have been extensively executed in order to quantify the performance of these multipliers by measuring the following specifications: maximum percentage error, output offset, X or Y nonlinearity, X or Y feedthrough, small-signal bandwidth, and slew rate. An 11-dimensional analog vector multiplier has been designed on a 40-pin MOSIS TINYCHIP with analog pads using the MAGIC VLSI tools and has been fabricated using 2 μm CMOS n-well process via MOSIS.	artificial neural network;neural networks;synapse	Fathi M.

For proof of concept, two prototype double-balanced mixers in 0.16- μm CMOS are fabricated. The first demonstration mixer chip was optimized for full IM3 cancellation and partial flicker noise cancellation; this chip achieves 9-dB flicker noise suppression, improvements of 10 dB for IIP3, 5 dB for conversion gain, and 1 dB for input P1 dB while the thermal noise increased by 0.1 dB. The negative impedance increases the power consumption for the mixer by 16% and increases the die area by 8% (46 × 28 μm 2). A second demonstration mixer chip aims at full flicker noise cancellation and partial IM3 cancellation, while operating on a low supply voltage (0.67 × VDD); in this chip, the negative impedance increases the power consumption by 7.3% and increases the die area by 7% (50 × 20 μm 2). For one chip sample, measurements show >10-dB flicker noise suppression within ±200% variation of the negative impedance bias current; for ten randomly selected chip samples, >11-dB flicker noise suppression is measured.	biasing;cmos;characteristic impedance;computer simulation;distortion;flicker (screen);flicker noise;gilbert cell;johnson–nyquist noise;monte carlo method;negative impedance converter;new foundations;nominal impedance;prototype;randomness;semiconductor device fabrication;spectral leakage;third-order intercept point;value-driven design;zero suppression	Wei Cheng;Anne-Johan Annema;Gerard Wienk;Bram Nauta	2013	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2013.2272339	flicker noise;effective input noise temperature;noise spectral density;noise;burst noise;electronic engineering;telecommunications;noise temperature;y-factor;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;noise;noise figure;phase noise;noise generator;noise-figure meter	HPC	62.70891452623713	52.32841424738697	112080

For such a portable device it is very important to reduce its power consumption and extend its operation time as its battery is the only power source in the system. The hardware circuitry, therefore, must be relatively compact to be in accord with the high integration of the system-on-chip (SOC) and the proper selection of key components. Not only miniaturization can be realized but also cost and power dissipation of the system can be decreased. Whether the implementation can be achieved also depends on antenna efficiency and DVB-T receiver performance. Therefore it is vital to select the right radio frequency architecture, which affects both the signal reception and the power consumption. Based on the demands mentioned above we have chosen single a conversion architecture for the receiver. Furthermore, our design has a better performance than earlier designs because of the use of a shielding case and the appropriate filtering of power ripples. We implement the built-in spiral antenna body by means of the printed circuit board which is low-cost, wideband, small-sized, low-profile, and omnidirectional. Moreover, a heat sink conducts the heat outward and prevents overheating, thus ensuring operational safety.	bandwidth (signal processing);canonical account;computer cooling;course (navigation);digital video broadcasting;dynamic range;electronic circuit;heat sink;interference (communication);lambda calculus;low-power broadcasting;mobile device;noise figure;operation time;printed circuit board;printing;radio frequency;system integration;system on a chip;systems design;tree accumulation;ultra high frequency;watts humphrey	Ying-Wen Bai;Ming-Huei Lin	2007	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2007.4429259	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;heat sink;printed circuit board	EDA	60.22049854183179	54.816029767881446	112351

Conventionally, the best compromise directivity-side lobes level is achieved using Dolf-Chebyshev amplitude distribution. However, classical distribution forms present disadvantages in calculation time, possibility in analyzing larger arrays and the array factor is only optimum in the two principle planes. To overcome these problems, the excitation amplitudes are written under the modal form. The obtained radiated fields compared with measurement results validate the technique. It is also shown that square arrays provide improved performances from point of view of directivity compared to those of rectangular arrays with comparable size. However, above specific array size, the directivity saturates. For this, another modification of the array factor of Chebyshev square array is proposed. The modification preserves the radiation pattern configuration (same number of null radiation directions and sidelobes) and improves both directivity and side lobe levels. Analytical expressions of the array factor, the directivity, maximum half-power beamwidth, and the maximum spacing between elements have been derived. It has been shown that the use of this new technique results in an improved directivity with respect to the classical Chebyshev for a square arrays identical in size, element spacing, direction of the main lobe and side lobes level.

Unfortunately, this results in important key performance issues being overlooked. This paper looks at spurious responses in wide-coverage narrowband receivers that may be employed in sensor networks or for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio. A detailed measurement and graphical plot of all spurious responses from 100 kHz to 1 GHz is presented. This comprehensive assessment illustrates that receivers may show extensive false signal responses, even if they have relatively good classic specifications in areas such as selectivity and image rejection.	cognitive radio;dynamic range;image response;rejection sampling;selectivity (electronic);visual intercept	Chelsi Kovala;William B.

4b21ef5d1af340e2f05e9ef2d64d3ecf61c758d1	analysis of a linearizing direct digitizer with phase-error compensation for tmr angular position sensor		This paper proposes an efficient linearizing direct digitizer for tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR)-based angular position sensor. The proposed linearizing digitizer for TMR angle sensors (LDTA) converts sine and cosine natured analog outputs from the TMR sensor into a digital output that varies linearly over 360° range. The digitization is done without using any analog-to-digital converter. The novel methodology of the LDTA ensures that its performance is least affected by the phase error of the quadratic oscillator used for sensor excitation. This principle also prohibits the adverse effects of the parasitic capacitances of the TMR sensor on angle measurement. Error sources influencing the LDTA performance are identified and analyzed. Detailed simulation and emulation studies of the LDTA were conducted to confirm its methodology. The worst case nonlinearity spotted during emulation studies remains within 0.08% for various probable values of phase error. A TMR-based angle sensor unit is designed and built. Interfacing the LDTA with the developed sensor unit gives an output with worst case nonlinearity of 0.28% and minimal phase-error dependence. The performance of the LDTA is tested and quantified for various other scenarios, including dynamic input conditions and sensor-unit imperfections. The superior performance of the LDTA to that of the existing techniques is also revealed in this paper.	analog-to-digital converter;angularjs;best, worst and average case;electronic component;emulator;layer 2 tunneling protocol;nonlinear system;parasitic element (electrical networks);prototype;robot;sensor;simulation;triple modular redundancy	Nandapurkar Kishor Bhaskarrao;Anoop Chandrika Sreekantan;Pranab K.

In this paper, we also propose a fully integrated active voltage doubler with offset-controlled high speed comparators, which provides much lower dropout voltage and far better PCE at high frequency (HF) range compared to its passive counterparts. Our active voltage doubler was fabricated in a 0.5-µm 3M2P standard CMOS process, occupying 0.144 mm2 of chip area. With 1.72 V peak AC input at 13.56 MHz, the active voltage doubler provides 2.4 V DC output across the 1 k7 load, achieving high PCE of 78%.	cmos;comparator;control function (econometrics);diode;dropout (neural networks);electric power conversion;mathematical induction;motion compensation;power supply;rectifier;sensitivity and specificity;spectral leakage;thermal management (electronics);transistor;usc interactive media & games division;voltage doubler	Hyung-Min Lee;Maysam Ghovanloo	2011	2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)	10.1109/CICC.2011.6055374	chip;control engineering;electronic engineering;electrical efficiency;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;high frequency;energy conversion efficiency	EDA	61.48523638378137	47.84322214162576	113124
72e0621d9ce709ab61dc0c9d4365b8c32712f36e	moving the par reduction criterion into the line driver		Traditionally, Peak to Average Ratio (PAR) reduction in digital subscriber line (DSL) transmitters focuses on a digital-domain signal, either at the output of the baseband processing block or at the input of the digital-to-analogue converter (DAC). However, analysis of a DSL transceiver shows that the power dissipation is highly dependent on the PAR at a certain node inside the line driver. Thus, in order to be fully effective, the algorithm design should include the power amplifier dynamics. A typical, actively terminated, line driver is analysed and a model is constructed for PAR reduction purposes. The PAR reduction algorithm is then extended to take advantage of the model. Simulations show that algorithms which are designed to reduce PAR at the new, physically motivated, node obtain about 0.5 dB lower PAR evaluated at this node compared to methods that focus on the PAR of the DAC input.	algorithm design;analog-to-digital converter;audio power amplifier;baseband;computer simulation;decibel;digital subscriber line;digital-to-analog converter;line driver;linear model;local loop;reduction criterion;transceiver;transmitter	Karl Werner;Niklas Larsson;Niklas Andgart;Thomas Magesacher;Tore Andre;Torbjorn Randahl;Per Ödling	2004	2004 12th European Signal Processing Conference		dsl filter;embedded system;electronic engineering;line driver;digital subscriber line;telecommunications;dsl modem;engineering;single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line	EDA	60.29374223619005	52.68994224302706	113144

With IBFD, a wireless terminal is allowed to transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band. This tutorial paper reviews the main concepts of IBFD wireless. One of the biggest practical impediments to IBFD operation is the presence of self-interference, i.e., the interference that the modem's transmitter causes to its own receiver. This tutorial surveys a wide range of IBFD self-interference mitigation techniques. Also discussed are numerous other research challenges and opportunities in the design and analysis of IBFD wireless systems.	1-bit architecture;circuit design;clipping (computer graphics);decibel;dominator (graph theory);duplex (telecommunications);dynamic range;effective number of bits;frequency band;interference (communication);mimo;modem;noise power;oversampling;power architecture platform reference;quantization (signal processing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;throughput;transmitter;x10	Ashutosh Sabharwal;Philip Schniter;Dongning Guo;Daniel W.

The detector used in this system consists of an array of hydrogenated amorphous silicon photodiodes directly connected to a CMOS readout chip, which is vertically integrated over the sensor array using flip-chip bonding. In particular, the proposed solution relies on a stack of interconnection layers, deposited on top of the photodiode array, to route each individual pixel output to a separate pre-amplifier channel. This avoids the need for a geometrical matching between the sensor array and the chip contact pads. As a consequence, conventional non-pixelated readout chip can be used and easy-scalable large area detectors can be produced. The CMOS chip is connected to an electronic board, providing the interfaces needed to read the signals as well as providing voltage references and power to the chip. The signals are collected and pre-processed by an FPGA chip, providing a very compact and flexible setup. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A key motivation for using a stacked configuration is to minimize the chip area. Also, since numerous components must be integrated into the bottom chip, a scaled 65nm CMOS process is adopted for the bottom chip. The developed CIS features 1.2e- temporal noise with extremely high power efficiency by employing a multiple-sampling (MS) technique. A 2nd-order incremental ΔΣ ADC with inverter-based switched-capacitor integrator realizes the MS technique with low power [1]. However, an exponential number of samples are required to reduce the quantization noise, and conversion speed worsens with higher bit resolution. An extended counting ADC, which is a blend of folding integration and cyclic ADC, attains high resolution with reduced conversion time [2-3]. However, an op-amp with high open-loop gain is required for good linearity and column-to-column matching characteristics, which increases power consumption. Also it is not suitable for scaled CMOS technology. An alternative approach is a single-slope (SS) based MS technique [4], in which two SS-ADCs convert the same pixel signal, and the readout signal is averaged in the digital domain, but the noise improvement is limited to -3dB and the power consumption and area occupation are roughly doubled.	active pixel sensor;cmos;comparator;image resolution;image sensor;mobile app;operational amplifier;performance per watt;pin grid array;power inverter;quantization (signal processing);sampling (signal processing);switched capacitor;time complexity	Kei Shiraishi;Yasuhiro Shinozuka;Tomonori Yamashita;Kazuhide Sugiura;Naoto Watanabe;Ryuta Okamoto;Tatsuji Ashitani;Masanori Furuta;Tetsuro Itakura	2016	2016 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2016.7417937	embedded system;electronic engineering;network switch;computer science;engineering;noise measurement;electrical engineering;electronic packaging	EDA	60.18375937835302	49.26113547738399	113515

37ef85e276118682c80c431adaa1330351edaabe	poster: power over data lines for can using ami code		Electronic control units (ECUs) in vehicles are interconnected with each other. Controller area network (CAN) is one of standards for in-vehicle networks and is widely employed. However, much more weight and space of wiring harness among CAN devices have been required as upgrading higher-performance networks. In this paper, we propose power over CAN (PoCAN), which is an implementation method of power over data lines (PoDL) under the review in IEEE P802.3bu, for twisted-pair (TP) cables among CAN devices to remove power lines. Unipolar non-return-to-zero (NRZ) line codes are employed in CAN and include mainly direct current (DC) component in the signals so that power superposed unipolar NRZ codes will not be suitable for PoDL. Bipolar alternate make inversion (AMI) and NRZ line codes are exploited for PoCAN because AMI-NRZ codes do not include DC component. The waveforms of PoCAN are analyzed in bus networks complied by a CAN standard with an analog mixed-signal (AMS) simulator. Moreover, experimental trials are conducted to evaluate frame transmission of PoCAN. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed PoCAN can achieve the simultaneous transmission of data and DC power in one-pair TP cables.	can bus;code;mixed-signal integrated circuit;simulation;transcranial direct-current stimulation;twisted pair;vhdl-ams;wiring	Tatsuki Matsushita;Daisuke Umehara;Koichiro Wakasugi	2016	2016 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)	10.1109/VNC.2016.7835948	telecommunications;operating system;computer network	EDA	61.50369972244565	59.29724862754118	114068

Our analysis shows that operational amplifiers (opamps) in multi-bits stages can avoid slewing and linearly settle for whole period of amplification. If opamp does not experience slewing, the error caused by incomplete settling can be regarded as a constant gain error, which can be compensated by linear digital calibration scheme. This technique not only can reduce the power consumption of the opamp by relieving its bandwidth and gain requirements, but also can decrease the convergence time of digital calibration algorithms by employing a simple linear calibration scheme. The prototype 11-bit 200-MS/s ADC is designed in TSMC's 0.13um 1P8M process. First stage is designed with insufficient bandwidths and followed by a complete-settling stage and a 9-bit ideal ADC. The SPICE simulation results show the power consumption in the first two stages is 29mW and an effective-number-of-bits (ENOB) is improved from 5.73 bits to 10.83 bits by linear digital calibration within 40,000 iterations.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;effective number of bits;iteration;low-power broadcasting;network analysis (electrical circuits);nonlinear system;operational amplifier;prototype;requirement;spice;simulation	Kuan-Yu Lin;Ji-Eun Jang;Ching-Hsuan Hsieh;Yung-Pin Lee	2010	Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537645	operational amplifier;control engineering;electronic engineering;effective number of bits;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	60.5857289503389	49.666088335533686	114186

The system delivers magnitude and phase signals independently, which can be optimized separately. The method can be applied to any kind of load (resistive and capacitive). Design specifications for CMOS circuit blocks and tradeoffs for accuracy and loop stability have been derived. Simulation results for several loads agree with the theory, enabling its application to any impedance measurement problem, in special, to bio-setups including electrodes.	british informatics olympiad;cmos;capacitive sensing;characteristic impedance;measurement problem;phase-locked loop;simulation	Alberto Yúfera;Adoración Rueda	2009	2009 16th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems - (ICECS 2009)	10.1109/ICECS.2009.5410818	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	65.1947956076591	47.95777559576702	114595

f001a6b75a1506ba84354d415cc7809ffaec5a1a	optimum synchronous phase detection and its application in smart sensor interfaces		Synchronous phase detection is widely used in sensors and telecommunication systems. The resulting SNR depends on the shape of both the input signal and the phase detector's reference. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of optimum synchronous phase detection in terms of SNR. In contrast to a matched filter, the optimum phase reference in the presence of additive white noise is found to be proportional to the derivative of the signal, rather than to the signal itself. Two case studies are discussed: the readout of a thermal-diffusivity sensor (TD sensor) and that of a resistor-based sensor embedded in a Wien bridge (WB sensor). Simulations show that compared to the standard square-wave phase reference, the use of the optimum synchronous phase reference improves the SNR of the TD sensor by 4.2 dB and that of the WB sensor by 6.3 dB. A three-level waveform is proposed as a practical alternative to the optimum phase reference. Its use degrades the optimum SNR by only 1.1 dB and 1.3 dB for the TD and WB sensors, respectively.	color balance;computer simulation;decibel;embedded system;matched filter;phase detector;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;smart transducer;utility functions on indivisible goods;waveform;white noise;wien bridge	Sining Pan;Kofi A.

The MOSAIC network implements the optical layer protocol to support bit-rate transparent multichannel lightpaths. Two types of add/drop multiplexers are implemented and combined in a three-node experiment. Multihop lightpaths are established giving an end-to-end bit error rate of better than 10 9 at 1.2 Gbps. The reconfigurable add/drop multiplexer is based on a novel dilated 2 2 acoustooptic filter switch crossconnect and an analog optoelectronic crossconnect that drives a ten-wavelength laser array transmitter up to 2.5 Gbps per wavelength. The fixed wavelength add/drop multiplexer utilizes a fast digitally tunable laser transmitter. Both add/drop multiplexers support bit-rate transparent 2R optoelectronic regeneration as well as wavelength translation. Subcarrier multiplexing on each wavelength is used to support channel state monitoring and channel equalization as well as transmission of digital network control information. Systems experiments demonstrate cascaded 2R optoelectronic regeneration with wavelength translation and cascaded multichannel optical switching with up to seven hops. It is shown that combining cascaded 2R optoelectronic regeneration with cascaded multichannnel optical switching can be used to balance jitter accumulation and amplified spontaneous emission generated amplitude noise to yield high signal-to-noise ratio for lightpaths.	bit error rate;data rate units;digital electronics;end-to-end principle;experiment;multiplexer;ncsa mosaic;optical switch;signal-to-noise ratio;spontaneous order;subcarrier multiplexing;transmitter;tree accumulation;wavelength-division multiplexing	Roberto Gaudino;May Len;Geoff Desa;Michael Shell;Daniel J.

In order to improve picture quality, the CIS technology has been also scaling aggressively to provide more Mega-Pixels (MP) but it also must be less susceptible and immune to noise sources, particle and defect-free, and highly reliable. In this report, we'll discuss the reliability characterization done on the 3D stack sensor with in-pixel DTI. By optimization of both process and design, noise immune and very high quality advanced CIS products have been successfully qualified and manufactured for volume production.	active pixel sensor;body dysmorphic disorders;cmos;camera module;diffusion tensor imaging;display resolution;image quality;image scaling;image sensor;mathematical optimization;megalanecephaly polymicrogyria-polydactyly hydrocephalus syndrome;mobile operating system;software bug;test scaling;sensor (device)	Younggeun Ji;Jeong Hun Kim;Jungin Kim;Miji Lee;Jaeheon Noh;Taeyoung Jeong;Juhyeon Shin;Junho Kim;Young Ju Heo;Ung Cho;Hyunchul Sagong;Junekyun Park;Yeonsik Choo;Gilhwan Do;Hoyoung Kang;E.

This paper presents modelling of PDN by incorporation of BGR and LDO for analyzing the effect of supply induced noise on the PDN performance. The effect of Simultaneous Switching Noise (SSN) resulting from switching of various analog and digital sub-systems is assessed through power spectral density curves.

The SoC corresponds to one EEG channel, and, depending on the patient, up to 18 channels may be worn to detect seizures as part of a chronic treatment system. The SoC integrates an instrumentation amplifier, ADC, and digital processor that streams features-vectors to a central device where seizure detection is performed via a machine-learning classifier. The instrumentation-amplifier uses chopper-stabilization in a topology that achieves high input-impedance and rejects large electrode-offsets while operating at 1 V; the ADC employs power-gating for low energy-per-conversion while using static-biasing for comparator precision; the EEG feature extraction processor employs low-power hardware whose parameters are determined through validation via patient data. The integration of sensing and local processing lowers system power by 14× by reducing the rate of wireless EEG data transmission. Feature vectors are derived at a rate of 0.5 Hz, and the complete one-channel SoC operates from a 1 V supply, consuming 9 ¿ J per feature vector.	analog-to-digital converter;background process;biasing;british informatics olympiad;characteristic impedance;chopper (electronics);comparator;design rationale;electroencephalography;feature (machine learning);feature extraction;feature vector;input impedance;instrumentation amplifier;low-power broadcasting;machine learning;onset (audio);power gating;sensitivity and specificity;statistical classification;system on a chip	Naveen Verma;Ali H.

Using these, the pair gain (GJ of antennas on 20-0-cm substrates has been improved by -lox over the previously reported result. Lastly, the possibility of realizing single chip radios with integrated antennas for communication over air is suggested by picking up, amplifying, and frequency dividing a 15-GHz sine wave transmitted from a 2-mm long on-chip antenna located 40 cm away using a packaged clock receiver with a 2-mm long on-chip zigzag antenna. Introduction A monolithically integrated true single chip radio (pNode), which incorporates a transceiver, a digital processor, a sensor and a power source has been proposed [ 1],[2]. The goal is to make this radio sufficiently sman so that it can be used like the Smart Dusts [3]. Currently, a version with working frequency of -24 GHz and range of 1-5 m is being developed. Since pNodes use on-chip antennas for transmission and reception, integration of antennas on to a silicon substrate is a critical requirement. pNodes can be distributed in large numbers to sense environments, and groups of pNodes can form a self-organizing wireless communication network for collecting and transmitting data (Fig. 1) much like the Smart Dusts [3]. Previous works have established that waves can be transmitted through silicon substrates and they can picked up using integrated antennas for communication within a silicon integrate circuit [ 1],[4]-[7]. For pNode applications, the waves must be transmitted outside of the chip and propagated over free space. In fact, to improve antenna eficiency, it is desirable to reduce propagation loss in the lossy substrate. To study this, measurement set-ups have been proposed and the basic feasibility of using integrated antennas for communication over 5-m has been established [2]. In order to improve the robustness of communication, to reduce power consumption of radios, and to increase the range, the antenna performance must be improved. To accomplish this, the dependences of integrated antenna characteristics for communication over air on silicon resistivity, substrate thickness, the separation between an antenna and silicon chip edge, and the thickness of oxide layer between an * This work is supported by DARPA (N66001-03-1-8901) and SRC (885.001 & 885.002). antenna and silicon substrate have been investigated and the results are presented in this paper. This paper demonstrates that the power transmission over 5 m can be improved by -lox over the previously published result [2].	integrated circuit;lossy compression;organizing (structure);pair gain;self-organization;software propagation;telecommunications network;thickness (graph theory);transceiver;transmitter	Jau-Jr Lin;Xiaoling Guo;Ran Li;Jason Branch;Joe E.

Wobbling aims at removing the effect of the rounding operation that takes place in an ADC, so that the measured harmonic distortion and noise amplitude can be truly ascribed to the intrinsic non-linearity and noise of the ADC. We compare the wobbling technique with subtractive and non-subtractive noise dithering, both from a performance and an implementation point-of-view. We present results of simulations and measurements validating the wobbling technique for use in a production environment.		R. de Vries;Augustus J. E. M.

While depth is measured in common lidar architectures using the round-trip delay of a short pulse [3] (so-called “pulsed lidar”) or the phase-delay of an intensity envelope on continuous-wave (CW) light (“amplitude-modulated (AM)-CW lidar”) [4], these architectures require sub-picosecond timing resolution and commensurate with high power dissipation and large area for sub-millimeter depth precision.	3d reconstruction;group delay and phase delay;modulation	Behnam Behroozpour;Phillip A.

Various aspects of this problem have been extensively studied. We consider here the effect of clock jitters in the basic system of digital filtering of analog signals. The system consists of an A/D, followed by a digital filter, and then followed by a hold circuit for D/A reconstruction. Thus the readout jitter affects both the leading edge and the trailing edge of the rectangular pulse in the reconstruction. This system includes the familiar sampling of an analog signal and subsequent reconstruction from its samples. Expressions are derived for the mean squared error caused by the sampling clock jitter and readout clock jitters. Expressions are also derived showing how the signal spectra are modified by clock jitters.	analog signal;analog-to-digital converter;clock signal;digital filter;digital-to-analog converter;mean squared error;sampling (signal processing)	Bede Liu	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853905	jitter;time-to-digital converter;clock domain crossing;digital signal;computer science;control theory	Embedded	62.13331980802938	56.76913193396733	116644

This paper initially proposes a new designed patch antenna in multi band and then some parametric variations are applied so that the required resonant length can be changed by which the resonating frequencies can be changed. 1st Proposed antenna is analyzed and then a new type of Patch antenna is introduced. The proposed Antenna is designed by using substrate of Rogers RT/ duroid 5880(tm) having thickness of 0.8mm initial design, and then substrate is changed to Z paper with different substrate thickness so that multiple resonating band can be achieved with enhanced Band width of application. The antenna proposed is designed and simulated using HFSS and results like VSWR and S11 Parameter for analysis is ploted. Finally a comparative study is done to show that how number of band and operating Band Width can be enhanced for planer Antenna system.	hfss;microstrip;printing;thickness (graph theory);variational analysis	Amit Kumar;P.

It could be applied to lots of Power Management ICs (Intergrated Circuits) due the high voltage. By introducing a preregulated current source, the PSRR (Power Supply Rejection Ratio) of 103dB at low frequency and the line regulation of 26.7μV/V was achieved under 15V supply voltage at ambient temperature of 27oC. Moreover, if the proper resistance trimming is implemented, the temperature coefficient could be reduced to less than 16.4ppm/oC. The start up time of the reference voltage could also be decreased with an additional bipolar and capacitor.	bandgap voltage reference;bicmos;biasing;binary-coded decimal;coefficient;current source;feedback;hot swapping;line regulation;power management;power supply rejection ratio;powerbuilder foundation classes;pulse-width modulation;rejection sampling;transistor;uptime	Gu Shurong;Wu Xiaobo;Yan Xiaolang	2006	Engineering Letters		power supply rejection ratio;real-time computing;index term;computer science;high voltage;control theory;switched-mode power supply;low frequency;voltage optimisation	HCI	60.818528488689175	47.36775100304918	117096

To significantly increase the sampling rate of an ADC, time-interleaved ADC (TIADC) is an efficient solution. A M-channels TIADC is composed of M ADCs which operate at interleaved sampling times. Due to the manufacturing process, the main drawback of a TIADC system is that the MADCs are not exactly the same. This means that offset, gain and time mismatch errors are introduced. As a result, these errors cause distortions in the output sampled signal and introduce unwanted tones and noise, and hence, reduce the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) as well as the signal to noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a new orthogonal online digital calibration, for timing skew, offset and gain mismatches, based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technique already used in communications. Our calibration is online, this means that errors can be estimated while the ADC is running. Since most of the calibration processes are carried out on the digital outputs, very little change is needed on the analog part of the ADC. Simulations results showed the efficiency of our proposed calibration architecture.	analog-to-digital converter;analogue electronics;clock skew;computer simulation;distortion;performance;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;spurious-free dynamic range	Guillaume Ferré;Maher Jridi;Lilian Bossuet;Bertrand Le Gal;Dominique Dallet	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2008.4541483	code division multiple access;information and communications technology;electronic engineering;calibration;spurious-free dynamic range;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;signal-to-noise ratio	EDA	57.25100038362778	57.0621577967243	117138

The dc multilevel voltage of the first stage becomes the input voltage of the classical inverter, resulting in a staircase waveform for the inverter output voltage. Such a multilevel waveform is close to a sinusoid; its harmonics content can be reduced by multiplying the stage number of the SC converter. The output low-pass filter, customary after a two-level inverter, becomes obsolete, resulting in a small size of the system, as the SC circuit can be miniaturized. Both stages are operated at a high switching frequency, resulting in a high-frequency inverter output, as required by some industrial applications. A Fourier analysis of the output waveform is performed. The design is optimized with reference to the nominal duty-cycle for obtaining the minimum total harmonic distortion. Simulations and experiments on two prototypes, one with a five-level output and one with a seven-level output, confirm the theoretical analysis.	ac adapter;boost converter;clock rate;computer simulation;duty cycle;experiment;fourier analysis;inverter (logic gate);low-pass filter;mathematical optimization;network switch;power inverter;powerbuilder foundation classes;rectifier;steady state;switched capacitor;total harmonic distortion;voltage regulation;waveform	Boris Axelrod;Yefim Berkovich;Adrian Ioinovici	2005	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2005.852205	control engineering;computer vision;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;signal processing;harmonic analysis;control theory;mathematics;total harmonic distortion	EDA	65.31851390034662	47.54766248444115	117227
3a16eebc23148e75f45fcc240ab92d597e6196ad	a reconfigurable 16/32 gb/s dual-mode nrz/pam4 serdes in 65-nm cmos		While four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4) standards are emerging to increase bandwidth density, the majority of standards use simple binary non-return-to-zero (NRZ) signaling. This paper presents a dual-mode NRZ/PAM4 serial I/O SerDes which can support both modulations with minimum power and hardware overhead relative to a dedicated PAM4 link. A source-series-terminated transmitter achieves 1.2- $\text{V}_{\mathrm {{pp}}}$  output swing and employs lookup table control of a 31-segment output digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to implement 4/2-tap feed-forward equalization in NRZ/PAM4 modes, respectively. Transmitter power is improved with low-overhead analog impedance control in the DAC cells and a quarter-rate serializer based on a tri-state inverter-based mux with dynamic pre-driver gates. The receiver implements an NRZ/PAM4 decision feedback equalizer that employs one finite impulse response and two infinite impulse response taps for first post-cursor and long-tail inter-symbol interference (ISI) cancellation, respectively. First post-cursor ISI cancellation is performed in these comparators to optimize the design’s timing, while the remaining ISI taps are subtracted in a preceding current integration summer for improved sensitivity. Fabricated in GP 65-nm CMOS, the transceiver occupies 0.074 mm2 area and achieves 16 Gb/s NRZ and 32 Gb/s PAM4 operation at 10.9 and 5.5 mW/Gb/s while operating over channels with 27.6 and 13.5 dB loss at Nyquist, respectively.	best, worst and average case;cmos;characteristic impedance;color depth;comparator;cursor (databases);data rate units;diagram;digital-to-analog converter;distortion;emoticon;equalization (communications);finite impulse response;gigabyte;high-level programming language;infinite impulse response;information sciences institute;input/output;interference (communication);long tail;lookup table;modulation;overhead (computing);personal digital assistant;power inverter;sampling (signal processing);secure multi-party computation;serdes;terabyte;three-state logic;transceiver;transmitter;triangular function;x.690;xfig	Ashkan Roshan-Zamir;Osama Elhadidy;Noah Hae-Woong Yang;Samuel Palermo	2017	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2017.2705070	modulation;pulse-amplitude modulation;electronic engineering;control theory;comparator;serdes;computer science;multiplexer;finite impulse response;bandwidth (signal processing);infinite impulse response	EDA	59.68118157707831	52.455970391990306	117432

By using multiple-input-branch technique and resistive shunt- feedback technique, LNA could achieve ultra-wideband input impedance matching with small noise figure degradation. The gain bandwidth is enhanced by an L type inter-stage matching network between the input transistors and the cascode transistor which could enhance both the gain and the gain bandwidth. The gain bandwidth could be further enhanced by the resistors inserted between the bulks and the sources of the input transistors since the resistors could reduce the effects of the drain-bulk capacitance of the input transistors. The techniques proposed offer the advantages of ultra-wideband bandwidth, simple circuit topology, and small chip area. The proofs of techniques are demonstrated by designing the UWB LNA in UMC 0.18um CMOS.	bandwidth extension;cmos;characteristic impedance;circuit topology;elegant degradation;impedance matching;input impedance;launch numerical aperture;low-noise amplifier;noise figure;simulation;transistor;ultra-wideband	Baoyong Chi;Chun Zhang;Zhihua Wang	2008	2008 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2008.4541581	chip;topology;impedance matching;electronic engineering;bandwidth extension;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;low-noise amplifier;ultra-wideband;noise figure;cmos;gain–bandwidth product;network topology	Arch	62.967033241997214	52.660313963576534	118388

When applying CT Digital Signal Processing (DSP), the signals are digitized in amplitude but processed continuously in time. Since the required chip area for the CT delay lines is quite large, a common way for word length reduction of the CT DSP system input is to apply Delta Modulation (DM). Thus the delay lines must be designed only for a word length of one bit. In this contribution it will be shown that digitization by Asynchronous Sigma Delta Modulation (ASDM) can result in several advantages for CT signal processing. Using this novel approach the word length of the signal to be processed is also one bit. Nevertheless, compared to the DM system, several advantages such as improved performance and reduced hardware complexity can result.	delay line memory;delta modulation;delta-sigma modulation;digital electronics;digital signal processing;discrete-time signal	Nima Tavangaran;Dieter Brückmann;Rainer Kokozinski;Karsten Konrad	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		delta modulation;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;control theory	EDA	57.01143808405882	53.35763616978774	118548
c137adb43618058da4f5dd719654b19b7fae89ce	a novel mim-capacitor-based 1-gs/s 14-bit variation-tolerant fully-differential voltage-to-time converter (vtc) circuit		Time-based Analog-to-Digital Converter (TADC), plays a major role in designing SoftwareDe ̄ned Radio (SDR) receivers, at scaled CMOS technologies, as it manifests lower area and power than conventional ADCs. TADC consists of 2 major blocks. The input voltage is converted into a pulse delay using a Voltage-to-Time Converter (VTC). In additions, the pulse delay is converted into a digital word using a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC). In this paper, a novel fully-di®erential VTC based on a new methodology is presented which reports a highlylinear design. A metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor as well as a dynamic calibration technique based on a set of large-sized capacitor-based voltage dividers circuits are utilized to automatically compensate the Process-Voltage-Temperature (PVT) variations. Moreover, the layout design is introduced. The proposed design operates on a 1GS/s sampling frequency with a supply voltage of 1.2V.

ae47184c89961a79d9cfeb932684dbe07316b170	a current reuse wideband lna with complementary noise and distortion cancellation for ultrasound imaging applications		This paper presents a current reuse wideband complementary noise and distortion canceling low-noise amplifier (LNA) for high-frequency ultrasound imaging applications. A single-ended current-reuse LNA structure with low-voltage power supply is utilized to achieve low power consumption. The LNA employs a shunt-feedback feedforward noise canceling technique to accomplish both low noise figure (NF) and wideband impedance matching. A complementary CMOS topology is also exploited to cancel the even-order harmonics to enhance the linearity. The LNA is designed for 30-120 MHz high-frequency ultrasound imaging systems, and is implemented in a 180 nm CMOS technology. The LNA achieves a 2 dB NFmin, a 23 dB voltage gain, and a −56 dBc total harmonic distortion (THD) while dissipating 9 mW of power from a 1.3 V power supply.

The predistortion consists to prevent the instantaneous amplitude to go down or very close to zero for complex modulations where this can normally happen. The technique called zero crossing avoidance was successfully applied to the 8PSK modulation of the Bluetooth standard. Its benefit for decreasing spectral leakage into adjacent channels and reducing the peak frequency deviation of the modulation are demonstrated.	analog signal;bluetooth;modulation;signal reconstruction;spectral leakage;transmitter;zero crossing	Pascal Philippe	2008	2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2008.4674978	electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering	EDA	59.139682289865334	57.96763528239306	118683

On the receiver side, we present a new class of reconfigurable receiver that utilizes random projections to balance the power-bandwidth tradeoff. Such random projection front-ends are ubiquitous and allow the use of sub-Nyquist ADCs. These systems utilize high speed DACs, typically found in transmitters, to generate high fidelity random signals. The emergence of RF-DACs, used for direct digital-to-RF synthesis, can be leveraged for random projection reconfigurable receivers. However, the need for high output power and linearity in both the transmitter and receiver DACs forces an evaluation of RF-DAC topologies with respect to drain efficiency. In this paper, the power efficiencies of several RF-DAC topologies are compared.	digital-to-analog converter;emergence;radio frequency;random projection;reconfigurable computing;requirement;transceiver;transmitter	Waleed Khalil;Jamin J.

In this paper, we present our investigations carried out in the context of a frequency bandwidth extension of PLC systems up to 100 MHz. The current status of EMC regulations for PLC is first recalled. An experimental study is then presented for the assessment of the effect of electromagnetic field radiation from an electrical network, in the 30 – 100 MHz band. Recommendations are given for the injected PSD levels to be used for future studies within the OMEGA project. From these results, the capacity of the PLC channel is evaluated in terms of outage probability. This analysis shows that an extended bandwidth up to 100 MHz provides capacities in excess of 1 Gbps, while satisfying the current emission limits. Finally, the possible countermeasures for the mitigation of EMC issues are discussed.	bandwidth (signal processing);bandwidth extension;chaitin's constant;channel capacity;charge trap flash;cognitive radio;data rate units;dbm;downtime;experiment;fm broadcasting;frequency band;futures studies;interference (communication);offset binary;power-line communication;recommender system;signal processing;smart card;stationary process;sun outage	Pascal Pagani;Richard Razafferson;Ahmed Zeddam;Brice Praho;Mohamed Tlich;Jean-Yves Baudais;Ali Maiga;Olivier Isson;Gordana Mijic;Klemen Kriznar;Spase Drakul	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671825	electrical network;regulation;electromagnetic field;electromagnetism;telecommunications;computer science;noise;programmable logic controller;power-line communication;channel capacity;network topology;electromagnetic compatibility;satisfiability	Arch	68.29562704565596	54.45278612411253	118937

In this paper, by combining the merits of traditional Johnson counter and Pulse-swallow frequency divider, we proposed a novel two-stage divider which can improve the operating frequency and decrease the power dissipation enormously. An adaptive component is built to set the divider in best power-saving mode. Based on the 40nm CMOS process, the frequency of this two-stage divider can reach 4GHz. The minimum power dissipation in divide-by-49 mode is 63μW@1GHz, or 156μW@4GHz. Compared with typical Johnson counter frequency divider, the frequency of the two-stage divider is improved about 1.6 times, while the power optimization ratio is 51.19%.	cmos;clock rate;frequency divider;in-phase and quadrature components;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;modulus robot;phase-locked loop;power optimization (eda);ring counter	Hengzhou Yuan;Zhuo Ma;Yang Guo	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on ASIC	10.1109/ASICON.2013.6811984	frequency divider;frequency multiplier;electronic engineering;frequency synthesizer;engineering;electrical engineering;voltage divider;control theory;current divider;wilkinson power divider	EDA	61.19675298031311	49.769764220351895	119262

The calibration corrects errors originating from mismatched thermometer decoded MSB current sources. The calibration principle is to measure the mismatches and skip over transfer function discontinuations. Four redundant MSB sources compensate the reduced input range cause by the skipping action. The mismatches are measured by using a simple comparator. Manners for extending the calibration range, thus enhancing linearity, are straightforward. Simulation show that the errors caused by the MSB sources are cancelled resulting in clear improvement in static linearity.	16-bit;comparator;current source;digital data;digital-to-analog converter;most significant bit;simulation;transfer function	Jussi Pirkkalaniemi;Marko Kosunen;Mikko Waltari;Kari Halonen	2004	2004 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

However, they are not suitable for underground communication especially when coils are buried in soil. Magneto-inductive (MI) communication is a promising technique for UWCNs; it is not affected by large propagation delays, multipath propagation, and fading. Furthermore, MI communication has lower transmitting power and smaller antenna size than EM. A near-field low-power communication device with an electrically small antenna for low-frequency UWCNs is proposed in this study. The device can be easily buried underground. The proposed device is analyzed in terms of basic communication metrics, i.e., magnetic field intensity, bandwidth, path losses, and received power. Comparison of these four metrics shows that the experimental data closely match those of the theoretical model, and the maximum communication distance of 28.5 m, can be achieved. Moreover, according to the experimental results of our device, we further propose the modified received power model. Results show that the device exhibits good performance and can be used as a stand-alone module in directional underground wireless communication. 相比于传统电磁(EM)波通信, 磁感应(MI)通信由于具有天线尺寸小、低衰落、低能耗和无多径效应等优点, 更适合需要将设备埋设在土壤中的透地通信. 本文提出一种基于电小天线的近场低能耗通信设备, 此设备可用于地下透地通信. 同时, 本文在磁场强度, 带宽, 路径损耗, 和接收功率四方面对设备进行理论仿真和实验测量的对比. 通过这四个指标的比较表明, 测量数据和理论仿真几乎完全匹配, 并且, 该设备的最大的通信距离课达到28.5米. 此外, 根据本装置的实验结果, 我们进一步提出了改进的接收功率模型. 结果表明, 该装置具有良好的性能, 可以作为定向井下无线通信的一个独立的模块.	circuit design;low-power broadcasting;multipath propagation;printed circuit board;software propagation;telecommunications network;theory;transmitter	Jing Ma;Xiaotong Zhang;Qiwei Huang	2014	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-014-5200-y	electromagnetic induction;telecommunications	Mobile	67.4058761589265	55.80923308382847	119482

The circuits are suitable for fabrication in a standard CMOS process. The defuzzification method is based on the Normalisation Locked Loop (NLL) method, with improvements to allow the processing of triangular membership functions whilst ensuring that relative rule weights are preserved. The circuit used to implement this technique is from the family of saturation-mode, square-law circuits proposed by Bult & Wallinga. Results of simulations are presented and discussed. ANALOGUE DEFUZZIFICATION CIRCUITRY Many analogue CMOS circuits exist for performing max and min operations, and for evaluating membership functions in the antecedent, but fewer such defuzzification circuits have been proposed.

The goal pursued is to reduce the in-band distortion by redistributing the noise power over all the frequency band available, in a manner depending upon the feedback network. Since ADM's generally work at a sampling frequency much higher than the Nyquist rate, one could obtain quality improvements by shifting a large amount of quantizing noise outside the base-band. Simulation results reveal that the benefit actually achievable is limited, essentially because the noise shifting causes an increase of slope overload distortion. A suitable ADM scheme with switched narrow-band Noise Shaping filter, permits to mitigate this adverse phenomenon and to achieve a subjective quality improvement.	modulation;noise shaping	Maurizio Copperi;Neviano Dal Degan;José Roberto Boisson de Marca	1981		10.1109/ICASSP.1981.1171153	gaussian noise;effective input noise temperature;computer vision;quality management;oversampling;noise shaping;quantization;noise temperature;computer science;noise measurement;quantum noise;noise;noise;control theory;mathematics;noise figure;noise floor;phase noise	Robotics	66.85340842486231	51.69577274936791	120191

For realization of multi-standard and single-chip transceiver, the prototypes were fabricated by 0.18µm CMOS process. The proposed PAs can achieve a tunable impedance matching within a wide frequency range by utilizing a resistive feedback and parallel resonator with an inductor and capacitor array. Therefore, the proposed PA has a realization possibility of isolator-less PA which contributes to decrease die area including external component. In other words, the PAs have tunable impedance matching function at their output ends. With a 3.3-V supply, three power amplifiers can cover frequency ranges of 0.9-3.0GHz, 2.1-5.8GHz, and 5.7-9.7GHz, respectively.

bdc93de582570433e2128ddc8fae85e4381455db	a continuous-time delta-sigma modulator with self-eld compensated quantizer		A new excess loop delay (ELD) compensation technique, called self-ELD compensation, is proposed in this paper. The digital output information is stored on the input parasitic capacitance of a comparator and used to perform ELD compensation. No dedicated ELD compensation circuit, such as opamp or digital-to-analog converter (DAC), is required, since the proposed method uses the existing circuit component for the ELD compensation. The non-linear parasitic capacitance is linearized by maintaining the input transistor pair always in one region of operation. As a proof of concept, a 3rd order continuous-time delta-sigma modulator with the proposed self-ELD compensation is fabricated in a 0.13 μm CMOS process with an active area of 0.1 mm2. The prototype ADC operates at 500 MHz sampling frequency, and achieves a peak SNDR of 74.4 dB and a peak SNR of 76.2 dB in a 15 MHz bandwidth while consuming 10.1 mW from 1.2 V supply.	cmos;comparator;delta-sigma modulation;digital-to-analog converter;nonlinear system;offset binary;operational amplifier;prototype;quantization (signal processing);sinadr;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;transistor	Changsok Han;Taewook Kim;Nima Maghari	2018	2018 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)	10.1109/CICC.2018.8357087	delta-sigma modulation;comparator;electronic engineering;computer science;operational amplifier;sampling (signal processing);noise shaping;cmos;bandwidth (signal processing);parasitic capacitance	EDA	60.971332287683055	50.61444790148739	120705
cfda78c8955d43beee8efcff2ba6d660d8c1f691	low power high output impedance high bandwidth qfgmos current mirror	compliance voltage;low power;input output impedance;bandwidth;qfgmos	Current mirror is a basic block of any mixed-signal circuit for example in an analog-to-digital converter. Its precise performance is the key requirement for analog circuits where offset is a measure issue. The key parameter which defines the performance of current mirror is its input/output impedance, input swing, and bandwidth. In this paper, a low power design of current mirror using quasi-floating gate MOS transistor is presented. The proposed current mirror boosts its output impedance in range of giga-ohm through use of regulated cascode structure followed by super-cascode. Another improvement is done in reduced input compliance voltage limits with the help of level shifter. The proposed current mirror operates well for input current range 0-700@mA with an input and output impedance of 160@W and 8.55G@W respectively and high bandwidth of 4.05GHz. The total power consumption of the proposed current mirror is about 0.84mW. The low power consumption with enhanced output impedance and bandwidth suits proposed current mirror for various high-speed analog designs. Performance of the presented current mirror circuit is verified using HSpice simulations on 0.18@mm mixed-mode twill-well technology at a supply voltage of +/-0.5V.	characteristic impedance;current mirror;output impedance	Nikhil Raj;Ashutosh Kumar Singh;Anil Kumar Gupta	2014	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2014.05.005	impedance matching;electronic engineering;current mirror;high impedance;engineering;electrical engineering;buffer amplifier;control theory;input impedance;output impedance;voltage source;bandwidth;negative impedance converter	HPC	61.52331581166518	48.370978635955886	120897

Their theoretical models are first analyzed and then implemented in Mat lab. Both simulated GPS data and realistic signals from a Sat-Surf receiver are used to verify the performance of the acquisition schemes. The software acquisition approach provides flexibility and low cost for algorithm redesign and improved intermediate frequency selection capability. The performances of serial search in time domain, parallel search in time and frequency domain acquisition algorithms are compared and evaluated using different incoming signals Carrier-to-Noise density ratios. The serial search acquisition algorithm in time domain has the advantage of working both on block of data or sample. The main disadvantage is the bigger acquisition time it requires. The acquisition in time domain employing FFT is a very fast acquisition algorithm.	algorithm;fast fourier transform;gps navigation software;global positioning system;intermediate frequency;performance;signal processing	Alban Rakipi;Bexhet Kamo;Shkelzen Cakaj;Algenti Lala;Ilir Shinko	2015	2015 7th International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks	10.1109/CICSyN.2015.27	embedded system;real-time computing;time to first fix;global positioning system;computer science;precision lightweight gps receiver	Robotics	56.392318546718165	57.93716959025406	121090

The blue and red filters of the Bayer pattern are replaced by magenta filters. Under each magenta filter are two stacked, pinned photodiodes; the diode nearest the surface absorbs mostly blue light and the deeper diode absorbs mostly red light. The magenta filter absorbs green light, improving color separation between the resulting blue and red diodes. The dopant implant defining the bottom of the red-absorbing region can be made the same as the green diodes, simplifying the fabrication. Since the spatial resolution for the red, green, and blue channels are identical, color aliasing is greatly reduced. Luminance resolution can also be improved, the thinner diodes lead to higher well capacity with resulting better dynamic range, and fabrication costs can be similar to or less than standard Bayer CMOS imagers. Also, the geometry of the layout lends itself naturally to frequency-based demosaicing.	aliasing;bayer filter;cmos;demosaicing;diode;dopant;dynamic range;image quality;image sensor;pixel;signal-to-noise ratio	Douglas J.

Under this scheme, the non-linearity effect of I and Q DACs is suppressed by data-weighted averaging (DWA) individually. At the same time, the two DACs are swapped according to the element selection pointers of DWA. Consequently, the image is restrained by this time-interleaved swapping. The overhead of this scheme is minimal. Extensive MATLAB simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of this scheme. With a 3rd order, 64 oversampling ratio quadrature delta-sigma modulator, this scheme shows 10dB and 25dB improvement in signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) and image rejection ratio (IRR) respectively for the case of 2-bit ΔΣ modulator.	delta-sigma modulation	Chi-Tung Ko;Kong-Pang Pun	2007		10.1109/ISCAS.2007.378322	control engineering;computer vision;delta modulation;dynamic range;electronic engineering;computer science;delta-sigma modulation;control theory;feedback;computed tomography	Robotics	61.840423758890914	50.108692009286315	121335

The behavior of the proposed PWM converter is formulated and simulated in a 0.13μm CMOS technology.

This solution, employing only two Operational Amplifiers (OAs) as active blocks and some passive components, is based on a square-wave oscillating circuit topology which, instead of a voltage integration typically performed by other solutions in the literature, operates a voltage differentiation. Therefore, the proposed circuit, performing an impedanceto-period (Z–T) conversion, results to be suitable as first analog front-end for both wide variation capacitive (e.g., relative humidity) and resistive (e.g., gas) sensors. Its sensitivity and dynamic range can be easily set through external passive components. Preliminary experimental measurements, which have characterized and validated this solution, have been conducted through a suitable prototype PCB fabricated with discrete commercial components. Then, the proposed interface has been also designed at transistor level, in a standard CMOS technology (AMS 0.35 um), developing a single-chip integrated circuit with low-voltage (1.8 V, single supply) low-power (about 350 μW) characteristics in a very small silicon area (lower than 0.6 mm) which results to be suitable for sensor array configurations and portable applications. Further experimental results, achieved utilizing commercial sample resistors and capacitors to emulate sensor behavior, have shown a linear trend and a satisfactory accuracy in the evaluation of floating capacitive (in the range 10 pF–1 μF), grounded resistive (in the range 150 kΩ– 1.5 MΩ) and floating resistive (in the range 10 MΩ–1 GΩ) variations, also when compared to other solutions presented in the literature. The satisfactory interface behavior has been also confirmed by the measurement of both relative humidity through the commercial sensor Honeywell HCH-1000 (capacitive) and carbon monoxide CO through the commercial air quality sensor FIGARO TGS-2600 (resistive). & 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Pseudo DWA is implemented in a 3rd-order /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ A/D converter with a 32-level internal D/A converter (DAC), a 16x OSR, and a 2-MHz conversion bandwidth. Simulations show that, with a 0.5% DAC element mismatch, Pseudo DWA attenuates the DWA tones at the cost of only 1-dB drop in the signal-to-noise ratio.

The constrained nature of these platforms necessitates the use of highly integrated, low-power electronics that are well-suited for large-scale production, assembly, and testing. The high speeds of emerging 4th-generation SiGe BiCMOS technologies makes these platforms realistic targets for >100 GHz applications for the first time. The high integration level, fabrication economy-of-scale, low 1/f noise, built-in total-dose radiation tolerance, and attractive thermal properties of these technologies make them ideal for this application. Ultra-low noise SiGe LNA designs which show the potential of these technologies for use in high-quality radiometers are presented. Future designs will increase integration levels, with the ultimate goal being a full radiometer-on-a-chip containing calibration sources.	advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer;bicmos;built-in self-test;low-noise amplifier;low-power broadcasting;pink noise;power electronics;silicon-germanium	Christopher T.

The conventional NFC antenna of the tablet was embedded under the rear cover because the material of the rear cover of the tablet was ABS plastic which allowed NFC magnetic field to radiate through the rear cover. However, the materials of the rear cover of some tablets and all-in-one desktop PCs were metals such as magnesium or aluminum which did not allow NFC magnetic field to radiate through the rear cover. In order to resolve this issue, the slim NFC antenna was developed and integrated under the bezel of the front screen.	desktop computer;embedded system;multi-function printer;near field communication;radiate;tablet computer	Hideto Horikoshi;Yoshio Nishioka	2015	2015 IEEE 4th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)	10.1109/GCCE.2015.7398497	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Visualization	65.20610980366567	59.70503167233062	122206

This structure is based on analog integrators and achieves analog scan, test frequency generation and test response compaction. A high fault coverage was obtained by using a discrete switched-capacitor ABILBO for testing a biquad filter. The ABILBO area overhead and performance penalty can be very low if functional and testing circuitry are shared. This is typically the case of high order filters based on a cascade of biquads.	data compaction;electronic circuit;electronic filter topology;fault coverage;multi-function printer;overhead (computing);switched capacitor	Marcelo Lubaszewski;Salvador Mir;Leandro Pulz	1996	Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Aided Design	10.1145/244522.244928	mixed-signal integrated circuit;control engineering;analog device;electronic engineering;switched capacitor;fault coverage;engineering;electrical engineering;automatic test pattern generation;design for testing;control theory;analog multiplier	EDA	59.49354020648621	49.32532353733737	122708

In the proposed design, a feedforward architecture which has better stability and performance than traditional feedback architectures is used in the timing synchronization loop. To mitigate the problem of oversampling rate of feedforward synchronizer, an innovative parallel demodulator architecture is presented which is optimized for high speed transmissions. This proposed architecture results in asynchronous data sampling where there is no need to adjust sampling rate of the analog to digital converter with an external feedback. To achieve good stability conditions in the presence of loop delay in carrier recovery loop, an appropriate compensation method using a novel Smith predictor is utilized. Since the delay compensation technique is applied, the proposed architecture is well suited for pipelined VLSI implementations. The proposed architecture is used to implement M-QAM digital communication receiver on a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA platform achieving a clock rate of 612 MHz. Implementation results show that our design has a good performance for different modulation orders as well as excellent robustness against loop delays and variations in the loop.	analog-to-digital converter;carrier recovery;clock rate;coherence (physics);feedforward neural network;field-programmable gate array;kerrison predictor;mathematical optimization;modulation;oversampling;parallel computing;phase detector;phase-locked loop;pipeline (computing);product detector;reconfigurable computing;robustness (computer science);sampling (signal processing);simulation;smith predictor;synchronizer (algorithm);throughput;uncompressed video;very-large-scale integration	Mehdi Ayat;Sattar Mirzakuchaki;AliAsghar Beheshti-Shirazi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2016.2589078	control engineering;synchronization;electronic engineering;real-time computing;phase-locked loop;computer science;control theory;transfer function;robustness	EDA	57.843797878869914	53.2469607800612	122864

Jitter decomposition is important for accurately deriving the total jitter in a system and for aiding in identifying the root causes of jitter. We extend a previous approach for jitter decomposition in clock signals is to enable separation of correlated and uncorrelated jitter in both data and clock signals. We use time lag correlation functions with special test patterns to estimate the characteristic parameters of different jitter components such as peak-to-peak value of DDJ and RMS value of RJ. Our approach can be implemented using only one-shot capture instead of multiple captures to average out the uncorrelated jitter from the correlated jitter. Hardware measurements are presented to validate the proposed technique.	bit error rate;registered jack;test card	Qingqi Dou;Jacob A.

The transducer is based on a resonant impedance inversion method of transfer curve linearization where the displacement probe circuit is kept in resonance by the resonance control loop. The transducer exhibits an extended linear range due to the compensation of displacement probe losses by a negative impedance converter (NIC) at the transducer input. Particular attention is paid to the NIC design and its temperature compensation. The new voltage-controlled NIC circuit is introduced, which can easily be realized with a standard commercial integrated circuit (LM 1496). Details of the transducer's reference generator and the NIC control voltage generator are also presented. The transducer's linear range extends from 0.25 to 3.75 mm (approximately 44% of the 8-mm probe diameter) while maintaining nonlinearity within plusmn2% F.S. This result is, at least, a 75% improvement to the best commercially available eddy-current displacement transducers (a linear range of 80 mil ~2 mm for an 8-mm probe). Further linearization can be achieved by postlinearization of the detected signal.	characteristic impedance;conductance (graph);control system;integrated circuit;inverse transform sampling;negative impedance converter;network interface controller;network topology;nonlinear system;operational amplifier;phone connector (audio);programming in the large and programming in the small;prototype;resonance;transducer;transfer function	Darko Vyroubal	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2009.2017165	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;eddy current;automatic control;control theory;physics;quantum mechanics	EDA	59.86558460459353	46.597119424520656	124285

Using the proposed adaptive supply-ripple cancellation (ASRC) technique, where the ripples copied from the supply are injected adaptively to the body-gate, the PSR-hump of conventional LDOs can be suppressed significantly. The proposed LDO was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, and the measured PSRs were less than −36dB at all frequencies from 10kHz to 1GHz, despite changes in a load current (Zl) and a dropout voltage (Fdo).	cmos;dropout (neural networks);low-dropout regulator;power supply;rup hump;rejection sampling;ripple effect	Younghyun Lim;Jeonghyun Lee;Suneui Park;Jaehyouk Choi	2018	2018 23rd Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)	10.1109/ASPDAC.2018.8297329	electronic engineering;capacitor;dropout voltage;ripple;low-dropout regulator;transistor;computer science;logic gate;regulator;cmos	EDA	62.181447175174824	47.98423772289828	124549

It has the advantages of a low dark current, high signal-to-noise ratio, and a high fill factor over the conventional passive pixel sensor imager or active pixel sensor imager. The readout circuit called the zero-bias column buffer-direct-injection structure is also proposed to suppress both the dark current of the photodiode and the leakage current of row switches by keeping both biases of photodiode and the parasitic p-n junction in the column bus at or near zero voltage. The improved double delta sampling circuits are also used to suppress fixed pattern noise, clock feedthrough noise, and channel charge injection. An experimental chip of the proposed PAPS CMOS imager with the format of 352/spl times/288 (CIF) has been fabricated by using a 0.25-/spl mu/m single-poly-five-level-metal (1P5M) n-well CMOS process. The pixel size is 5.8 /spl mu/m/spl times/5.8 /spl mu/m. The pixel readout speed is from 100 kHz to 10 MHz, corresponding to the maximum frame rate above 30 frames/s. The proposed still CMOS imager has a fill factor of 58%, chip size of 3660 /spl mu/m/spl times/3500 /spl mu/m, and power dissipation of 24 mW under the power supply of 3.3 V. The experimental chip has successfully demonstrated the function of the proposed new PAPS structure. It can be applied in the design of large-array-size still CMOS imager systems with a low dark current and high resolution.	active pixel sensor;cmos;dark current (physics);image sensor	Yu-Chuan Shih;Chung-Yu Wu	2004	IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCSI.2004.835684	dark current;chip;embedded system;photodiode;electronic engineering;image resolution;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;dissipation;cmos sensor;leakage;signal-to-noise ratio;physics	EDA	55.165674444362296	49.31132993015301	124606

In this paper, we present a 13 μW 87 dB DR ΔΣ modulator for full-spectrum neural recording. To achieve a wide DR and low power consumption, a fully-differential topology is used with multi-bit (MB) quantization scheme and switched-opamp (SO) technique. By adopting a novel fully-clocked scheme, a power-efficient current-mirror SO is developed with 50% power saving, which doubles the figure-of-merit (FOM) over its counterpart. A new static power-less multi-bit quantizer with 96% power and 69% area reduction is also introduced. Besides, instead of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor, three high-density MOS capacitor (MOSCAP) structures are employed to reduce circuit area. Measurement results show a peak signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 85 dB with 10 kHz bandwidth at 1.0 V supply, corresponding to an FOM of 45 fJ/conv.-step. which is implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS.	anatomy, regional;arabic numeral 0;cmos;capacitor device component;clock rate;current mirror;distortion;dynamic range;full-spectrum light;implants;kilohertz;metal (api);metal-on-metal implant bearings;modulation;modulator device component;morphologic artifacts;numerous;operational amplifier;proto-oncogene proteins c-mos;q-switched lasers;quantization (signal processing);sinad;sinadr;signal-to-noise ratio;sixty nine;system dynamics;topological insulator;video-in video-out;square millimeter (qualifier value)	Jian Xu;Md Kafiul Islam;Shuo Wang;Zhi Yang	2013	2013 35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610113	local field potential;operational amplifier;spectrum;figure of merit;dynamic range;electronic engineering;neuroscience;electrical efficiency;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;delta-sigma modulation;system dynamics;neurophysiology	EDA	56.552625964792064	49.90988235003753	124615

939efcde9dd4ae4994210da7f9dcb673a5302eb9	passive synthesis of a class of fractional immittance function based on multivariable theory		Passive synthesis of fractional driving-point immittance function is one of the most important research topics in fractional circuits. The synthesis method for a class of fractional driving-point immittance function is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the immittance function of passive fractional circuit is transformed to multivariable positive-real function by proper variable substitution. Secondly, to synthesize the function, except one variable, other high-order variables are transformed to the combination of products of di®erent one-order variables by introducing new variables. Thirdly, synthesize the new function by traditional method. At last, substitute elements inversely twice and the ̄nal circuit for fractional driving-point immittance function can be achieved. The method is veri ̄ed by giving synthesis demonstration.	positive-real function	Guishu Liang;Yongming Jing;Chang Liu;Long Ma	2018	Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers	10.1142/S0218126618500743	multivariable calculus;computer science;control theory;electronic engineering;electronic circuit;immittance;control engineering	EDA	66.90619344322025	47.93486001985199	124907

In order to improve compliance and reduce user discomfort, a capacitive sensor was embedded on a soft contact lens of 200 μm thickness using commercially available bio-compatible lens material and a standard manufacturing process. The results indicated that the reconfigurable sensor interface achieved sensitivity and baseline tuning up to 120 pF while consuming only 110 μW power. The range and sensitivity tuning of the readout circuitry ensured a reliable operation with respect to sensor fabrication variations and independent calibration of the sensor baseline for individuals. The on-chip voltage scaling allowed the further extension of the detection range and prevented the implementation of large on-chip elements. The on-lens system enabled the detection of capacitive variation caused by pressure changes in the range of 2.25 to 30 mmHg and hydration level variation from a distance of 1 cm using incident power from an RFID reader at 26.5 dBm.	baseline (configuration management);british informatics olympiad;calibration;capacitive sensing;contact lenses, hydrophilic;dbm;dynamic voltage scaling;electronic circuit;embedded system;embedding;image scaling;interface device component;power (psychology);radio-frequency identification;sensor;test scaling;thickness (graph theory);torr	Jin-Chern Chiou;Shun-Hsi Hsu;Yu-Chieh Huang;Guan-Ting Yeh;Wei-Ting Liou;Cheng-Kai Kuei	2017		10.3390/s17010108	embedded system;electronic engineering;computer hardware;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;capacitive sensing	Robotics	57.58224817802766	46.84991824447139	125073

The front-end amplifier is optimized for power efficiency, noise, and silicon area. A balanced tunable pseudo-resistor is used to acquire local field potential (LFP) and action potential (AP) separately. The post-layout simulation results show that the system achieved input referred noise 4.7μVrms and noise efficiency factor (NEF) 2.79 with mid-band gain of 51.9dB and power consumption of 5.22μW. The bandwidth is highly tunable in the range of 2.38Hz-300Hz for high-pass corner and 248Hz–12.9kHz for low-pass corner, which can acquire AP and LPF without out-band noise. The proposed dual-threshold adaptive AP detector can capture action potential precisely from background activity, thus data reduction can be realized by only processing these significant waveforms. The results show that the proposed low-power, low-noise biomedical system is suitable for implantable device applications.	action potential;amplifier;cmos;circuit diagram;detectors;dual;implants;international conference on functional programming;least fixed point;low-pass filter;low-power broadcasting;multiplexer;numerous;performance per watt;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;resistor device component;s100b wt allele;silicon;simulation;spectral efficiency	Jo-Yu Wu;Kea-Tiong Tang	2011	2011 Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society	10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090525	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;integrated circuit	EDA	58.414974835209264	52.482169161086574	125344

Generally a high frequency to low frequency conversion, such as a peak or amplitude detector, is employed to analyze the output of the device under test (DUT). However, this conversion circuit is subject to similar process variations as the DUT, which has to be included in the measurement process. Moreover, despite affecting the accuracy of the entire measurement, the input generation for RF BIST is sparsely discussed. While relative measurements, such as gain, can be made without knowing the input signal attributes, other parameters, such as output power, IIP3, or IIP5 require absolute measurements, hence the knowledge of the input signal amplitude. In this paper, we propose a technique for on-chip amplitude measurement that is independent of process variations. The approach relies on on-chip generation of a square wave using an RF limiter with two different amplitudes. Using these two input signals and mathematical modeling, we extract the amplitude at the output of the DUT with high accuracy. The circuits for the BIST have been designed and simulated at the transistor level, including process variations. The concept of the proposed measurement technique is demonstrated in hardware using off-the-shelf components.	amplifier;built-in self-test;cmos;device under test;electronic circuit;experiment;hardware acceleration;limiter;low-pass filter;mathematical model;overhead (computing);rf modulator;radio frequency;simulation;system of measurement;third-order intercept point;transistor;transmitter	Jae Woong Jeong;Jennifer Kitchen;Sule Ozev	2015	2015 20th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS)	10.1109/ETS.2015.7138762	detector;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;radio frequency	Arch	64.10575162336276	52.42406200764541	126015

To reduce the error caused by circuit noise and external interface, Offset calibration circuit (OCC) is utilized to calibrate the Comparator. The proposed phase shift detector circuit is realized on silicon using a 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The post-layout simulation results show that the proposed design is able to detect the phase difference from −90° to 90°, where the maximum output error of the proposed PSD is 2.37%. Besides, the power consumption is 4.365 mW @ 10 MHz given a 0.9 V power supply voltage.	cmos;comparator;digital signal (signal processing);national supercomputer centre in sweden;optimistic concurrency control;power supply;simulation	Yu-Ting Tu;Deng-Shian Wang;Chua-Chin Wang	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2016.7538996	embedded system;detector;electronic engineering;calibration;phase-locked loop;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;linear circuit;circuit extraction;cmos	EDA	59.128097712290284	48.81560867188469	126520

The length of said inner conductor and the dielectric body is substantially 1/4 wavelength, and the duration (52-1 through 52-4 ) between two resonators is determined according to the specified coupling coefficient for the desired characteristics of the filter. Due to the rectangular dielectric body (51-1 through 51-5), each resonator is stably mounted on the housing (53), and then, the stable characteristics of the filter is obtained. Thus, the use in a vibrated circumstance like a mobile communication is possible. That rectangular dielectric body (51-1 through 51-5) also provides the larger coupling coefficients between resonators, and then, the wideband filter can be obtained.	mobile phone;radio frequency	Kiyomichi Araki	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e89-c.4.445	mobile broadband;radio access network;embedded system;electronic engineering;3g;mobile web;imt advanced;telecommunications;gsm services;mobile technology;mobile phone tracking;base transceiver station;mobile station;mobile computing;physics;cdma2000	Mobile	66.29918884045112	58.31079126762399	127373

The chip was implemented using the 0.18-μm CMOS technology. A source degeneration coupling technique is used to generate quadrature signals and enables the elimination of bimodal oscillation. Capacitive degeneration coupling also provides negative impedance to compensate for losses in the LC tank, resulting in less power consumption in the core circuit to sustain oscillation. The proposed 2.4-GHz QVCO design achieves a 13.46% tuning range and a phase noise of -128.65 dBc/Hz at a 1-MHz offset while only consuming 2.67 mW from a 1.8-V supply. The oscillator demonstrated robust operation from -25 °C to 85 °C with phase noise lower than -122 dBc/Hz at a 1-MHz offset. The proposed QVCO achieves a remarkable figure of merit of -192 dBc/Hz.	cmos;characteristic impedance;lc circuit;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillator	Chi-Hao Hong;Chuan-Yi Wu;Yu-Te Liao	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2014.2362714	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;coupling;phase noise;transistor;robustness	EDA	61.9452531439815	48.052909995994966	127490

Noise squeezing occurs through the phase-sensitive amplification process and suppresses one of the two quadrature components of the input noise. When the input signal is only in the direction of the nonsuppressed quadrature component, squeezing can lower that noise figure by almost 3 dB. The resonant structure of the proposed amplifier is inspired by a Fabry-Perot laser amplifier to achieve the squeezing effect using a low number of LC elements. We design and simulate the proposed noise-squeezing parametric amplifier in a conventional 65-nm CMOS process. A minimum noise-squeezing factor of -0.35 dB is achieved with a signal gain of 26 dB for one quadrature component of a 10-GHz narrow-band signal.	approximation;cmos;decibel;in-phase and quadrature components;lumped element model;noise figure;noise reduction;optical amplifier;optical parametric amplifier;parametric oscillator;quadrature mirror filter;resonance;simulation;steady state;transmission line	Wooram Lee;Ehsan Afshari	2011	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2010.2072370	fabry–pérot interferometer;effective input noise temperature;fully differential amplifier;electronic engineering;dispersion;noise temperature;gain;y-factor;engineering;noise measurement;noise;electrical engineering;quantum amplifier;low-noise amplifier;cutoff frequency;instrumentation amplifier;noise figure;optics;electric power transmission;operational transconductance amplifier;cmos;fet amplifier;direct-coupled amplifier;parametric oscillator;power-added efficiency;differential amplifier	EDA	64.62707529001061	52.408234598325265	127525
bb2b9fea86b5c3ddf914e188f311c57d014398d4	all-digital time-domain cmos smart temperature sensor with on-chip linearity enhancement	linearity enhancement;field programmable gate array fpga;smart temperature sensor;time domain;cmos	This paper proposes the first all-digital on-chip linearity enhancement technique for improving the accuracy of the time-domain complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) smart temperature sensor. To facilitate on-chip application and intellectual property reuse, an all-digital time-domain smart temperature sensor was implemented using 90 nm Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Although the inverter-based temperature sensor has a smaller circuit area and lower complexity, two-point calibration must be used to achieve an acceptable inaccuracy. With the help of a calibration circuit, the influence of process variations was reduced greatly for one-point calibration support, reducing the test costs and time. However, the sensor response still exhibited a large curvature, which substantially affected the accuracy of the sensor. Thus, an on-chip linearity-enhanced circuit is proposed to linearize the curve and achieve a new linearity-enhanced output. The sensor was implemented on eight different Xilinx FPGA using 118 slices per sensor in each FPGA to demonstrate the benefits of the linearization. Compared with the unlinearized version, the maximal inaccuracy of the linearized version decreased from 5 °C to 2.5 °C after one-point calibration in a range of -20 °C to 100 °C. The sensor consumed 95 μW using 1 kSa/s. The proposed linearity enhancement technique significantly improves temperature sensing accuracy, avoiding costly curvature compensation while it is fully synthesizable for future Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) system.	cmos;calibration;certification;curve fitting;diffuse large b-cell lymphoma;fever;field-programmable gate array;full custom;intellectual property;inverter device component;kilohertz;maximal set;performance;power inverter;reuse (action);semiconductor;small;temperature sensor device component;very-large-scale integration;benefit;sensor (device)	Chun-Chi Chen;Chao-Lieh Chen;Yi Lin	2016		10.3390/s16020176	embedded system;electronic engineering;time domain;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;cmos	EDA	59.41861776601924	47.36068017089003	127572

An anti-self-locking circuit is included in the asynchronous event-driven ADC to improve the robustness. A tri-channel UWB transceiver is designed particularly for the data transmission of the 3-axis accelerometers. A power consumption of 4.6pJ/bit is achieved for the transmitter at 10Mbps while operating under 1.2V power supply. The receiver power consumption can be as low as 0.32nJ/bit at 10Mbps under 1.8V supply. To demonstrate one application of the device, the electrogoniometer was used to quantify the in-vivo response of a somatosensory neuron to joint angle changes.	event-driven programming;lock (computer science);neuron;power supply;sampling (signal processing);smart transducer;successive approximation adc;transceiver;transmitter;triangular function;ultra-wideband;video-in video-out	Hongjie Zhu;Tian Qiu;Milin Zhang;Andrew G.

Contrary to other OPAMP approaches for sinusoidal signals reported in the literature and based on a first-order all-pass filter structure, the approximation suggested in this work is based on a different concept. The achieved results demonstrate the functionality of the system for the case of a sinusoidal signal with frequency of 1 kHz. Notwithstanding, the proposed architecture can be extended to operate at higher frequencies by using different building blocks with larger bandwidth. Furthermore, it can be extended as well to work out with other periodic input waveforms, like triangular shapes or square waves, with the use of an appropriate orthogonalizer.	0 a.d.;8-bit;all-pass filter;approximation;barrel shifter;email;first-order predicate;network switch;operational amplifier;optical attenuator;tierra (computer simulation)	Luis Abraham Sánchez-Gaspariano;Clara Iliana Martínez Gómez;José Miguel Rocha-Pérez;Jesús Ezequiel Molinar-Solís;Jesús M.

3a3ef365007f8bcccb37bec39f78785b6fc7ff6d	wideband fully differential current driver with optimized output impedance for bioimpedance measurements		This paper presents a wideband fully differential current driver architecture suitable for bioimpedance measurements. It uses an improved regulated cascode to enhance output impedance, enabling accurate measurements of transfer impedances at low and high frequencies. The current driver architecture maximizes the output voltage swing. An independent reference voltage is used in order to compensate the process variations of the output common mode voltage. The circuit was designed in 0.18μm CMOS AMS process, operating from 1.8V supply voltage. The silicon area is 0.26 mm2. The current driver has a 67 MHz bandwidth and can provide a maximum output current of 600 μA peak to peak with a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) below 0.3% at low frequencies increasing to 0.6% at 8 MHz. Due to the use of regulated cascodes in the output stage, the circuit achieves a 79MΩ output impedance at low frequencies decreasing to 324KΩ at 1MHz, with an output voltage swing of 0.95 V.	cmos;characteristic impedance;nominal impedance;output impedance;total harmonic distortion;verilog-ams	Achraf Lamlih;Philippe Freitas;Stephane David-Grignot;Jérémie Salles;E.

This represents a real challenge, when the design of high-gain amplifiers are considered, without resorting to passive resistive elements. However, some solutions do exist to overcome the lack of a p-type transistor. This paper then presents a comparison analysis of two high-gain single-stage amplifier topologies using only n-type enhancement transistors. In these circuits, high gain is achieved using positive feedback for the load impedance. The comparison is carried out in terms of bandwidth, power consumption and complexity under identical bias conditions. Further, the same load impedance is used to develop a novel high-gain multiplier. All the circuits are simulated using a 0.35 μm CMOS technology, as it is easy to test the reliability of the methods, since CMOS transistors have trustworthy models.	amplifier;bandwidth (signal processing);cmos;characteristic impedance;input impedance;positive feedback;semiconductor;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display;transistor	Pydi Bahubalindruni;Vítor Grade Tavares;Pedro Barquinha;Rodrigo Martins;Elvira Fortunato	2013	Eurocon 2013	10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6625261	transistor count;field-effect transistor;electronic engineering;transistor model;thin-film transistor;high impedance;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;amplifier;integrated circuit;control theory;integrated injection logic;cmos;integrated circuit design	EDA	62.59285425139372	46.50675247078011	128518

Linearity, frequency and noise measurements are reported. The notch frequency of the 8th order filter can be tuned over almost two decades. Its attenuation exceeds 70dB for the target frequency range of 20-60Hz and its dynamic range (for THD<4%) amounts to 89dB while consuming 8@?W from a 2V power supply level. For an increased power consumption of 74@?W its dynamic range (for THD<4%) exceeds 100dB.	cmos	Evdokia M. Kardoulaki;Kostas N. Glaros;Patrick Degenaar;Andreas G. Katsiamis;Henry M. D. Ip;Emmanuel M.

This has been achieved by utilizing BiCMOS nonlinear transconductor cells and an appropriate set of complementary operators for transposing the corresponding equations into the sinh domain. An attractive benefit of the proposed filter topologies is their capability for operating in a low-voltage environment.

In this study, we focus on the performance of ECG-based heart rate estimation as an example to demonstrate our proposed strategy. Utilizing the consistency and quasi-periodicity of the ECG waveform, two regions are pre-defined based on the prediction of the R peak by a normalized least mean square (NLMS) adaptive filter. The power consumption and performance of the AFE is dynamically reconfigured accordingly. Experimental evaluations show the system can measure heart rate variability (HRV) with an error of 0.5-4 beats/min with the sampling rate reduced from 488 sps to 100 sps and 40 sps for the two regions respectively, bit resolution reduced from 10-bit to 6-bit and noise tolerance substantially relaxed, offering an estimated 62% total power saving.	adaptive filter;analog front-end;front and back ends;heart rate variability;least mean squares filter;maxima and minima;mean squared error;power management;quasiperiodicity;reconfigurability;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;waveform	Chengzhi Zong;Somok Mondal;Drew A.

The digital interpolation filter consists of cascaded half band filter (HBF) which is followed by a 32timesdigital sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit. Optimization is also performed so that the filter requires no multipliers, with the registers in the filter decreasing by a half. No multiplier requirement and limited storage demand make it an economical alternative to the conventional implementation for audio application. The result shows that the interpolator achieves 66dB stop-band rejection and 0.008dB pass-band ripple when the coefficients are truncated to 16bit.

This is achieved through an architecture that allows extraction of multiple harmonics above  $f_{\mathrm {max}}$  with simultaneous amplitude and phase control. Signal synthesis is achieved through controlled interference of multiple traveling waves with rich harmonic components and delays. The first example, presented in this paper, is where the signal synthesis is achieved on-chip demonstrating a pulse train at the output with a measured pulsewidth of 2.6 ps and a 0.46-mW output power. The second example is a four-element array with integrated antennas, which allows signal synthesis in space and is demonstrated to show reconfigurable radiation of pulse trains with a 2.6-ps pulsewidth, pure tones at a fundamental frequency of 107.5 GHz with an effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 4.6 dBm and a second harmonic of 215 GHz with EIRP of 5.0 dBm, as well as any combination of these two harmonics with arbitrary amplitudes and delays. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper demonstrates the sharpest on-chip and radiated pulses with dynamic waveform shaping in any integrated circuit technology.

Nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloys are the most commonly used shape memory alloy (SMA) and have been widely used for bio-medical, electrical and mechanical applications. The proposed NiTi based antenna can be placed across the width of the handset chassis, which can be considered as part of the radiating structure. An accurate electromagnetic model of the antenna is developed using FIT for numerical analysis. Good agreement between the computed and measured results has shown for both copper-based and NiTi SMA Antennas and their performance was compared. It is shown that by keeping the length constant and varying the pitch angle (height) of the antenna, the frequency of operation can be tuned to switch between various frequency bands to cover all the standard WiFi, 3G and 4G bands required for the next generation of mobile handsets. Thus, the dispersion characteristics of the NiTi helix antenna make it very promising for wideband communication systems.	british informatics olympiad;chassis;frequency band;mobile phone;next-generation network;nickel titanium;numerical analysis;sma*	Adnan Kaya;Cem Baytore;Irfan Kaya;E.

Two specific circuits were selected as case studies, both designed in IBM 130nm technology. By means of SPICE simulation, the electrical equivalent effects of Total Ionizing Dose (TID) were simulated, corresponding to a total dose of 500krad. A worst case simulation of Single Event Transients (SET) was also performed. Results indicate a better behavior under radiation (TID) for low power voltage references than the observed for the ultra-low power counterpart. The temperature of operation affects the ultra-low power circuits changing the circuit response for the simulated SETs, while for low power circuits the results are not affected. The particularities of low power circuit that make them vulnerable to radiation effects are pointed out and possible mitigation strategies are discussed.	best, worst and average case;spice;simulation	Daniel Fusco;Tiago R.

Measured results show that the circuit is able to interface various sensors within the overall capacitance range of 0.6–550pF and resistance range of 3.7kΩ–5.1MΩ, while consuming only 0.39–3.56μW, from a 1.2V supply.	cmos;capacitive sensing;sensor;switched capacitor	Mohammad Mehdi Moayer;Jarno Salomaa;Mika Pulkkinen;Kari Halonen	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351091	capacitor;capacitive sensing;electronic engineering;computer science;resistive touchscreen;wide dynamic range;internet of things;cmos;capacitance	EDA	58.132351333833505	47.216488055739944	129812

The proposed circuit consists of a reduced implementation of a multiplier based on differential amplifiers with decreased need for parameter matching compared with a conventional structure, thus reducing the power consumption and silicon area. It includes an exponential current scaling scheme to provide a large multiplication factor. Additionally, the differential input stage offers the capability to implement a floating realization for bidirectional applications. The circuit operates with a minimum supply of a gate-source voltage and two saturation voltages of a transistor, making it suitable for low-voltage applications. Experimental results from a fabricated prototype in 0.5-μm technology show the operation of the grounded and floating realizations, as well as their performance when implemented in a second-order low-pass analog filter.	analogue filter;capacitance multiplier;differential amplifier;differential signaling;image scaling;low-pass filter;prototype;time complexity;transistor	Ivan Padilla-Cantoya;Paul M.

The filter is capable of processing both 5 GHz narrowband (NB) and ultra wideband (UWB) services by switching mode dynamically. The design uses the mainstream 0.18 mum CMOS technology. In the UWB mode, the filter behaves as an LNA, however, when the NB interference is detected, the filter notches the NB frequency and provides gain for the UWB signals. Under this operation, the filter has an input matching of 10 dB, again of at least 5.6 dB, a narrowband rejection of 9.8 dB for a BW of 100 MHz and a 1 dB compression point of -15.1 dB. The filter performs better if it operates as a sole UWB LNA. In the NB mode, the filter is used for bandpass channel selection. It exhibits an input matching of 20.5 dB, a gain of 23 dB at 100 MHz BW, a noise figure of 7.1 dB and a 1 dB compression point of -26.8 dB. The circuit consumes less than 27 mW of power at 1.8 V supply.

8ab714e2dd2015bbc69ed7017cdabbe5b63225e1	analysis and demonstration of an iip3 improvement technique for low-power rf low-noise amplifiers		This paper describes a linearization method to enhance the third-order distortion performance of a subthreshold common-source cascode low-noise amplifier (LNA) without extra power consumption by using passive components. An inductor between the gate of the cascode transistor and the power supply in combination with a digitally programmable capacitor between the gate and the drain of the cascode transistor enable to improve the third-order intermodulation intercept point (IIP3) of a subthreshold LNA. The theoretical mechanisms that underlie the linearity improvement are analyzed comprehensively under the consideration of the LNA’s input stage, cascode stage, reverse isolation, and stability. A 1.8-GHz LNA was designed and fabricated using 0.11- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS technology to prove the concept. Measurement results reveal that the linearized low-power LNA has a 14.8-dB voltage gain, a 3.7-dB noise figure, and a −3.7-dBm IIP3 with a power consumption of 0.336 mW.	cmos;dbm;distortion;electronic circuit;launch numerical aperture;low-noise amplifier;low-power broadcasting;noise figure;nonlinear system;power supply;prototype;radio frequency;third-order intercept point;transistor;visual intercept	Chun-hsiang Chang;Marvin Onabajo	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2017.2781369	intermodulation;electronic engineering;cascode;transistor;logic gate;amplifier;subthreshold conduction;mathematics;noise figure;cmos	EDA	61.72567528618678	48.834965208206214	131100

In this paper a double pulsewidth modulated (PWM) scheme for nonlinear analog-to-digital conversion is presented. Calibration or auto-calibration data stored in the smart sensor's memory define the nonlinear profile characteristic of the transducer and provide the required data to obtain the inverse function of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) transfer curve. Basically, as a function of the transducer's nonlinearity degree, the input voltage range of the ADC is segmented in a continuous set of subintervals and, for each of these subintervals, a second-order correction term based on a PWM A/D conversion is used to obtain a linear characteristic for the smart sensor. Additional advantages of this method result from its easy implementation in low-cost microcontrollers that include generally comparator inputs and PWM outputs. A flexible and programmable A/D conversion solution can be dynamically adapted to variations of the transducer's nonlinearity profile, and an increased resolution can be achieved at the expense of a lower conversion rate.

However, the non-linearity of a synthesizable VCO requires digital postprocessing to obtain good performance. We propose another solution where the input analog signal is pre-coded into a delta-modulated pulse stream which is used to drive a VCO-based converter. This causes the oscillator to operate at two distinct frequencies thereby eliminating the VCO non-linearity from the converter transfer function. A circuit is proposed that consists of a synthesized digital block realizing all the active parts of the circuit and a passive RC net used as an integrator. Spectre simulation of the netlist synthesized using a 65 nm standard cell library shows a performance of 8.2 bit ENOB over a 3 MHz bandwidth without using any digital post-processing.	analog signal;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;delta modulation;effective number of bits;logic synthesis;netlist;nonlinear system;passive optical network;simulation;standard cell;three-state logic;transfer function;triangular function;video post-processing;voltage-controlled oscillator	Vishnu Unnikrishnan;Mark Vesterbacka	2015	2015 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)	10.1109/ECCTD.2015.7300003	control engineering;electronic engineering;voltage-controlled oscillator;engineering;control theory	EDA	62.55400120766875	50.04649915831472	131213

It covers the frequency range from 450MHz to 940 MHz, including the DVB-T band, the TV white space (TVWS) band, and the LTE-800 frequency band. The insertion-loss variation amounts to 0.3 dB. The filter measures 20mm by 20 mm, it can therefore be easily integrated into analog RF front-ends.

The accuracy of the presented analytical model has been examined by simulation results using finite element method as well as by the conducted experiment, showing very good consistency. The proposed dual-band filter can be used for satellite systems that require noncontiguous in frequency channels to be transmitted to the ground through one beam.	crystal oscillator;filter design;finite element method;high-κ dielectric;normal mode;simulation	Pidhurska Tetiana;Trubin Alexander;Isniuk Ruslan	2015	2015 IEEE International Black Sea Conference on Communications and Networking (BlackSeaCom)	10.1109/BlackSeaCom.2015.7185116	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	Robotics	66.40236332381335	57.696247402525685	131614

This paper proposes a new modeling method to effectively enhance such kind of receiver image-rejection performance, through an understanding of the correlation between the different image-reject functional blocks. The presented complex-IF receiver mainly consists of a Double Quadrature Down-Converter (DQDC) and an Analog-Double Quadrature Sampling (A-DQS) scheme for the frequency down-conversions. Systematic analysis of the I/Q mismatch issues will be presented first. Then, according to the analyzed results and assuming that the total required image-rejection is 70dBc, an optimum combination of allowable mismatch in the functional blocks is obtained as an example for DCS1800 application. Such combination is verified through non-ideal behavioral simulations and is further discussed in terms of its practicability in CMOS implementation.	rejection sampling	Pui-in Mak;U Seng-Pan;Rui Paulo Martins	2003		10.1109/ICECS.2003.1301864	telecommunications;computer science;radio receiver	HCI	59.62643972033344	58.7085035032976	132028

It features a gain-boosted N-path switched-capacitor (SC) network embedded into a function-reuse RF front-end, offering concurrent RF (common-mode) and BB (differential-mode) amplification, LO-defined RF filtering, and input impedance matching with zero external components. Interestingly, not only the BB power and area are nullified, but also the loading effect between the RF and BB blocks is averted, resulting in better noise figure (NF). Unlike the existing N-path filtering, the described gain-boosted topology offers: 1) double RF filtering at both input and output of the RF front-end; 2) size reduction of the physical capacitors thanks to the Miller multiplication effect, and 3) LO-power saving by decoupling the mixer's on-resistance to the ultimate stopband rejection. Together with a low-voltage LC-VCO with extensively-distributed negative-gain cells for current-reuse with the BB filters, the receiver achieves 8.1 ± 0.6 dB NF, 50 ± 2 dB gain and -20.5 ± 1.5 dBm out-of-band IIP3 at 1.15 ± 0.05 mW power at 0.5 V over the four ISM bands. The active area is 0.2 mm 2 in 65 nm CMOS.	cmos;characteristic impedance;coupling (computer programming);embedded system;impedance matching;implicit shape model;input impedance;input/output;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;matrix multiplication;noise figure;out-of-band agreement;radio frequency;rejection sampling;sfiaplus;switched capacitor;third-order intercept point;universality probability;voltage divider;voltage-controlled oscillator	Zhicheng Lin;Pui-in Mak;Rui Paulo Martins	2014	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2014.2358560	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;low-noise amplifier	EDA	61.35283856483461	52.895166805666484	132133

When the terminal functions as a general purpose input/output (GPIO), the pull device is enabled on reset or on setting a control bit. For operation as a data port, the pull device is disabled, and on reset the pull device is enabled only after any pending data transaction has completed. Upon completion of the reset period the pull device is again disabled for data port operation. In one embodiment, a terminal has a first interruptible function and a second uninterruptible function. The terminal is coupled to a pull device and control logic. If the second function is active, the control logic enables the pull device with a time delay sufficient that the second function is completed prior to the enabling of the pull device.		M. C.

The functions of quantizing and encoding the signal are performed entirely by semiconductor diodes, using transistor amplifiers where necessary to increase the signal level. The readout is obtained from a set of “and” gates, each gate having as one of its inputs an output from the encoding system, and as the other input, a pulse obtained from a time delay circuit to assure sequential operation.

Unlike many previously published low-power high-speed ADCs based on time-interleaved SAR, this ADC has only 2 clock-cycle latency (1.6ns at 1.25GS/s) and achieves 6b performance without any digital post-processing or off-line calibration, making it a plug- in replacement for conventional flash ADCs in many applications.	boolean algebra;cmos;low-power broadcasting;magnetic storage;online and offline;sampling (signal processing);successive approximation adc;ultra-wideband;very-large-scale integration;video post-processing	Zhiheng Cao;Shouli Yan;Yunchu Li	2008	2008 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2008.4523297	boolean algebra;electronic engineering;successive approximation adc;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;sampling	EDA	59.03455841024647	50.846847248193114	133720

Random projections have been widely used within the context of compressive sensing for sub-Nyquist signal acquisition. In the system we propose, we design the random sensing signals so as to filter undesired components in the signal and result in measurements equivalent to those obtained had the signal been filtered prior to acquisition. Because the random signals are digitally generated, the system is reconfigurable; the signal's components to be filtered can be changed by changing the digitally generated random signals. The system digitizes the measurements at a rate proportional to the desired bandwidth only, not the total signal bandwidth.	bandwidth (signal processing);compressed sensing	Sami Smaili;Yehia Massoud	2014	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/LWC.2014.2354354	telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	58.203731466677425	57.32533367825892	133822

A field-effect transistor (FET) is used as the nominal device under test (DUT). The feedback circuit detects the sag in drain voltage that is caused by voltage drops produced across both the inductor in the drain bias tee and any series resistance in the drain-current path. The feedback signal consists of the current injected into the drain circuit that is sufficient to minimize the change in drain voltage. The feedback circuit actively synthesizes a small driving-point impedance that is seen by the drain of the DUT and is on the order of 10/sup -2/ /spl Omega/. Larger voltages do not need to be applied to the drain circuit in order to overcome the nominal inductive and resistive voltage drops. Therefore, a low-current power supply can be used to set V/sub ds/ for low- or high-power FETs. Transient responses with and without the use of the feedback circuit are presented. Pulsed-I-V measurements using this feedback method (made less than 1 /spl mu/s after the start of the gate pulse) of a high-power FET are also presented.	feedback;semiconductor device	Albert M.

In this paper we present the design of interpolated FDS (IFDS) based filter to overcome the lower and upper limits on fc range of the existing FDS based filter. In the proposed IFDS based filter, the continuously variable fractional delay (CVFD) element is used to replace the unit delay element of the prototype filter. The CVFD element provides wider fractional delay range compared to the FDS used in the existing FDS based filter, and hence, the IFDS based filter overcomes the lower limit on fc of the FDS based filter. Due to inherent limitations of the FDS, the FDS based filter has an upper limit on fc of the FDS based filter. In the IFDS based filter, we use the CVFD element to vary fc of the filter below this limit and then use interpolation technique to obtain variable multiband response. This multiband response of the interpolated filter is used along with its complementary response to obtain lowpass responses with fc above the upper limit on fc of FDS based filter. Simulation results show that the magnitude and phase responses of the proposed IFDS based filter are not impaired by the use of FDS. No degradation is observed in the passband or the stopband of the IFDS based filter compared to that of the prototype filter. The proposed reconfigurable filter design technique can be easily extended to design reconfigurable filter banks with variable number of subbands and fine control over the subband bandwidth.	digital filter;elegant degradation;family computer disk system;filter bank;filter design;frequency band;interpolation;low-pass filter;prototype filter;simulation	Sumedh Dhabu;A.

e9eafcaddbbc678ad55d69f7512cacbd5a9b49ec	a saw-less 2.4-ghz receiver front-end with 2.4-ma battery current for soc coexistence		A 2.4-GHz receiver for short-range communications with +6 dBm out-of-band IIP3 and only 2.4-mA battery current is presented. The single-ended input is coupled through an integrated transformer to a push–pull differential low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) followed by a current mode passive mixer that drives a single-opamp biquad trans-impedance amplifier. This approach ensures sufficient linearity to enable coexistence with large out-of-band interference arising from other on-chip/on-board transceivers. An efficient block stacking technique is proposed to minimize the current drawn from a standard 1.8-V supply. The first stages of the two opamps used in the I and Q baseband Rauch filters are placed above and below the LNTA core, thereby sharing its dc current. Two active inductors isolate the RF and baseband signal paths. Several techniques are used to limit the impact of the 1/f noise of the RF blocks on the receiver and to minimize nonlinearities due to interactions between blocks sharing the same current. The entire receive signal path draws 2.4 mA from a 1.8-V supply and has a noise figure of 7.8 dB at 2.4 GHz and an out-of-band 1-dB compression point of −5 dBm. The chip, implemented in 28-nm LP CMOS, occupies an active area of 0.4 mm2.	baseband;blocking (computing);cmos;cpu power dissipation;characteristic impedance;class-d amplifier;coexist (image);dbm;decibel;interaction;interference (communication);launch numerical aperture;low-noise amplifier;low-pass filter;low-power broadcasting;noise figure;on-board data handling;operational amplifier;out-of-bag error;out-of-band agreement;pink noise;power supply;push–pull converter;radio frequency;rejection sampling;requirement;selectivity (electronic);single-ended signaling;source-to-source compiler;stacking;system on a chip;television interface adaptor;third-order intercept point;transceiver;transformer;voltage converter	Matteo Ramella;Ivan Fabiano;Danilo Manstretta;Rinaldo Castello	2017	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2017.2703828	operational transconductance amplifier;electronic engineering;control theory;operational amplifier;dbm;computer science;noise figure;amplifier;cmos;baseband;inductor	EDA	61.47455371825283	53.17573274949503	134993

Recently, mm-Wave/sub-mm-Wave transceiver and imager integrated circuits have gradually migrated to silicon platforms for low-cost consumer markets [1,2]. However, the associated SPDT switches operating beyond 110GHz are developed using advanced SOI or SiGe HBT technologies [3,4] and rarely implemented in CMOS due to the lossy substrate and poor transistor characteristics [2,5].	cmos;duplex (telecommunications);image sensor;integrated circuit;lossy compression;network switch;silicon on insulator;silicon-germanium;test-driven development;transceiver;transistor	Fanyi Meng;Kaixue Ma;Kiat Seng Yeo	2015	2015 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC) Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2015.7062852	insertion loss;electronic engineering;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;coupling;transistor	EDA	63.94311769379732	53.737807402178554	135132

Advanced CMOS wireless systems leverage the vast computation resources available in the technology, and so simple digital phase shifters are preferred. This introduces significant quantization errors in the antenna pattern. Also, the constraint for equal paths from the phase shifters to the antenna elements is relaxed, introducing further errors. Both of these error sources are mitigated allowing the problem to finally be cast as a convex optimization problem over a discrete-valued domain.	cmos;computation;convex optimization;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;radiation pattern	Sayf Alalusi;Robert W.

In time-based ADCs, the input voltage is first converted to a pulse delay time by using a Voltage-to-Time Converter (VTC) circuit, and then the pulse delay time is converted to a digital word by using a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) circuit. In this paper, an analytical model for the timing jitter and skew due to noise and process variations, respectively, is proposed for the VTC circuit. The derived model is verified and compared to Monte Carlo simulations and Eldo transient noise simulations by using industrial 65-nm CMOS technology. This paper shows how the timing jitter/skew can be reduced by using circuit design knobs such as the supply voltage and the load capacitance.	analog-to-digital converter;cmos;circuit design;clock skew;image scaling;monte carlo method;spice;simulation;time-to-digital converter;transient noise	Hassan Mostafa;Yehea I.

5d3556cc64ac5f8a8a644929b43a859942b19a4d	a compact csrr loaded monopole antenna with defected ground structure for mobile wlan and wimax applications		A physically compact dual band antenna design is presented for use in mobile WLAN and mid-band WiMAX applications. The antenna design is based on a monopole, with a combination of metamaterial inspired features, based on a defected ground structure (GDS) and a complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR). A single CSRR unit cell is placed over a pentagonal monopole antenna, producing a narrow stop-band frequency in the range from 2.40 GHz to 2.49 GHz. The second operating frequency ranges from 3.44 GHz to 6.25 GHz, the broad-banding being due to the influence of the defected ground structure. The antenna design was optimized using HFSS, paying close attention to size constraints, and ease of integration with the radio front end. Simulation results for return loss, gain and radiation pattern are analyzed and presented.		Naeem A. Jan;A. M. Saleh;Mohammed Lashab;Fathi M. Abdussalam;L. Djouablia;Raed A.

One of the main limiting components preventing on-chip integration is the Local Oscillator (LO). The phase noise performance of the LO and its switching speed are some of the most critical performance metrics for an infrastructure transceiver. The work presented here is a frequency synthesizer IC targeted at wireless infrastructure applications. Previous works on high-performance VCO design either did not address the large tuning bandwidth requirements [1] or lacked the required phase noise performance [2–3].	frequency synthesizer;local oscillator;requirement;transceiver;voltage-controlled oscillator	Shayan Farahvash;William Roberts;Jake Easter;Rachel Wei;David Stegmeir;Li Jin	2010	2010 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2010.5433944	control engineering;electronic engineering;frequency synthesizer;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;cmos;phase noise	EDA	61.26843105058389	52.15351693867434	136749

9b12e1f362ff9e00edd40f679fbba10b8359e5ab	a low-power wideband db-linear variable gain amplifier with dc-offset cancellation for 60-ghz receiver		This paper presents a two-channel (I+Q) variable gain amplifier (VGA) for low power 60-GHz wireless receiver. The VGA consists of four-stage gain cells, an efficient DC-offset cancelling circuit and an output buffer for test purposes. To achieve wide bandwidth and low power consumption, a modified Cherry—Hooper amplifier gain cell is used. With a tunable transistor and its parasitic capacitance, a dB-linear characteristic and a flat gain response are achieved without any additional exponential circuit. The DC-offset is cancelled effectively with two proposed feedback loops. The measurement results show that the VGA achieves a gain range of 6 to 44 dB, an OP1dB of 1 dBm, and a 3-dB bandwidth of over 1 GHz with an excellent flat gain response. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology, the two-channel VGA core occupies a silicon area of only 0.055 mm2 and consumes only 10 mA from a 1.2 V power supply.	cmos;dbm;feedback;power supply;time complexity;transistor;variable-gain amplifier;video graphics array	Long He;Lianming Li;Xu Wu;Zhigong Wang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2875764	computer network;transistor;dbm;computer science;variable-gain amplifier;amplifier;wideband;bandwidth (signal processing);electronic engineering;parasitic capacitance;dc bias	EDA	61.44393730578687	52.736380417051365	137001

When receiving wideband waveforms, e.g., similar to LTE signals, it is crucial for the compensation performance to be able to consider also frequency variations in the image rejection. In addition to compensating the MFI originating from inside the quadrature ΣΔ modulator (QΣΔM), the digital compensation considers also the interference generated at the preceding receiver front-end components, such as an I/Q mixer. The performance of this approach is illustrated with a 20 MHz reception bandwidth, being a practical example of requirements for modern communications waveforms. This concrete example is given with a two-stage QΣΔM giving eighth order noise-shaping.	analog-to-digital converter;bandwidth (signal processing);cognitive radio;compaq lte;delta-sigma modulation;image response;interference (communication);noise shaping;rf modulator;rejection sampling;requirement;superheterodyne receiver;transfer function;zero suppression	Markus Allén;Jaakko Marttila;Mikko Valkama	2013	2013 IEEE 78th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2013.6692458	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;software-defined radio;computer network	EDA	60.43345336471205	57.76198761333687	137379

Mainly, this work is different form the previous works concerning on-chip noise measurement in one or more of the following: First: it does not assume specific noise properties such as periodicity. Second: the requested bandwidth of the output channel can be adjusted freely, therefore, the user can avoid the effect of on-chip parasites and the need to off-chip sophisticated monitoring tools. Third: the detector is equipped with an on-chip voltage divider, which enables measuring the high swing fluctuations. Therefore, the detector is suitable to measure the non-periodic/single event noise for the purpose of reliability evaluation and performance modeling. The detector is implemented in a test chip using Hitachi 0.18 mum technology.	performance prediction;quasiperiodicity;voltage divider	Mohamed Abbas;Makoto Ikeda;Kunihiro Asada	2005	2005 12th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2005.4633453	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	57.91628146618894	48.53632812138125	137462

The PDSOI one is based on a classical LC tank VCO and uses the possibility of body contact to modulate the current core of the VCO in order to decrease the phase noise. Good performances in terms of phase noise are achieved with this technique, but we do not gain any size nor power consumption compared to a more classical bulk solution. This LC tank VCO is mandatory for such telecommunication applications. We propose to use a ring oscillator VCO to build a PLL in FDSOI technology. Despite the fact that such VCO topology exhibits a larger phase noise, this design will address aggressively the size and power consumption reduction. Indeed we are using the efficient backgate biasing offered by the FDSOI MOS transistor to compensate the mismatches between the different inverters of the ring oscillator to decrease jitter and phase noise.	biasing;bluetooth;inverter (logic gate);lc circuit;performance;phase noise;phase-locked loop;ring oscillator;silicon on insulator;transistor;voltage-controlled oscillator	Alexandre Fonseca;Gilles Jacquemod;Yves Leduc;Emeric de Foucauld;Philippe Lorenzini	2014	2014 IEEE 12th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)	10.1109/NEWCAS.2014.6934072	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	61.848686496127584	47.86544178929464	137519

We compare interdigitated photodiode geometries with edgeless structures that do not have active device regions adjacent to LOCOS. We also compare two methods for device design. One employs a polysilicon gate to block the implant in the intrinsic region of the device while the second utilizes a specific mask layer in the technology called an SDBlock mask. Our results suggests that the dark current is primarily a function of the junction width. Furthermore, polysilicon gate devices have lower dark currents than SDBlock structures. Finally, we perform noise measurements and extract flicker noise parameters for the two methods and find that polysilicon gate structures have greater levels of flicker noise than SDblock devices	cmos;dark current (physics);flicker (screen);flicker noise;locos;lateral thinking;pulse-width modulation;quantum decoherence;semiconductor;silicon on sapphire	Miriam Adlerstein Marwick;Francisco Tejada;Philippe O.

The system includes a power indicator on the transmitter card and the receiver card, with each power indicator asserting a power signal to respective switch control inputs on the transmitter and receiver cards when the respective cards are inserted into the backplane. The assertion or unassertion of a power signal to the control inputs allows for the disabling of the receiver when the transmitter is not connected to the backplane and the disabling of the transmitter when the receiver is not connected to the backplane, thereby preventing transmitter output EMI and ringing and receiver input oscillation.

4b3e9f587ce9522908617e0e6729d93cfe8febe9	a note on dual demodulator continuous transmission frequency modulation technique		The range resolution in conventional continuous time frequency modulation (CTFM) is inversely proportional to the signal bandwidth. The dual-demodulator continuous time frequency modulation (DD-CTFM) processing technique was proposed by Gough et al [1] as a method to increase the range resolution by making the output of DD-CTFM truly continuous. However, it has been found that in practice the range resolution is still limited by the signal bandwidth. The limitation of DD-CTFM has been explained using simulations and mathematically in this paper.	bandwidth (signal processing);dd (unix);modulation;simulation	Kapil Dev Tyagi;Arun Kumar;Rajendar Bahl	2017	CoRR		telecommunications;control theory;mathematics;analog transmission	ML	57.53202985534044	59.26082816181502	137777

A series of RC circuits in a cascade arrangement, uncoupled to each other, provides the first, second, third, etc., integrals or derivatives (according to the connection of the RC circuits) of the input function. The theory establishes that if the outputs of each are fed to an analog summing amplifier, its output becomes arbitrarily close to the ideal integral or derivative of the input function as the number of RC stages is raised indefinitely. A device has been developed according to this idea to perform one of these operations (integration) and to check the results obtained in theory. Mathematical proofs of the theory are given in the paper.		Mauricio A. Thomae	1960	IRE Trans.

In spite of their popularity, their use has been traditionally limited to input sinusoidal waves with symmetric power supplies. This paper presents an algorithm that enables single-supply analog LIAs to properly process input square waves. Formed by linear equations, its computational implementation is much simpler than that of the traditional sinusoidal algorithm. Moreover, applied to battery-operated microcontrolled systems where square signals can be generated by the embedded microcontroller, it presents intrinsic advantages such as simplicity, versatility, and reduction in power and size. Experimental results validate the proposed algorithm, confirming its enormous possibilities in sensing applications.	algorithm;amplifier;arnold tongue;distributed control system;embedded system;iso/iec 10967;linear equation;lock-in amplifier;low-power broadcasting;microcontroller;power supply;scroll lock;sensor;software verification;symmetric algebra	Javier Aguirre;Daniel García-Romeo;Nicolás Medrano;Belén Calvo;Santiago Celma	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2300054	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;current sense amplifier;amplifier;control theory;analog multiplier	EDA	66.54103327135077	49.20131610510068	138338

Quantitative ultrasound is utilized to allow an ultrasound signal to be sent from a transmitter to multiple receivers. This received signal is analyzed for echogenic and echolucent tumors to differentiate between the two along with non-tumor sample and also studied for the delay to determine the size/location of the tumor. The proposed system utilizes Low Transient Pulse (LTP) technique and is implemented using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Digital Signal Processor (DSP) technologies. In this co-design architecture, DSP carries out the analysis of received demodulated signal at a lower speed while FPGA runs at a higher one to generate LTP signal and demodulate bandpass ultrasonic signal. This work elaborates the implementation of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) receiver on FPGA for the received signal from an ultrasound detector. LTP is applied to the tumor samples through the transmitter and the received signal at an ultrasonic receiver is passed through QAM to obtain different maxima that are then further used to compute the location and the size of the tumor using DSP. This dual platform co-design demonstrates a good application of a FPGA/DSP platform for the LTP generation and received signal processing.	digital signal processor;field-programmable gate array;handy board;linux test project (ltp);maxima;medical imaging;modulation;signal processing;transducer;transmitter	Ashish R.

The sampling rate is high due to the reduced number of clock phases and switches connected to each capacitor. Also, this scheme decreases the filter nonlinearity. Verified by simulations, the noise analysis of the filter shows superior performance compared to active SC filters. These features, and a wide frequency tuning range, make the filter suitable for high-speed, low noise, and low power applications.

By implementing a real-time, adaptive algorithm to determine an effective threshold for robustly detecting a spike, the need for calibration and/or external monitoring is eliminated. The input signal is first pre-processed by utilising a non-linear energy operator (NEO) to effectively boost the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the spike feature of interest. The spike detection threshold is then determined by tracking the peak NEO response and applying a non-linear gain to realise an adaptive response to different spike amplitudes and background noise levels. The proposed algorithm and its implementation is shown to achieve both accurate and robust spike detection, by minimising falsely detected spikes and/or missed spikes. The system has been implemented in a commercially available 0.18μm technology requiring a total power consumption of 1.5μW from a 1.8 V supply and occupying a compact footprint of only 0.03 mm2 silicon area. The proposed circuit is thus ideally suited for highchannel count, calibration-free, neural interfaces.	action potential;adaptive algorithm;autonomous robot;cmos;energy operator;nonlinear system;real-time clock;sensor;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial variability;the spike (1997)	Ermis Koutsos;Sivylla E.

These characteristics were linearized by removing the fixed time delay unit in the original time delay tanlock loop (TDTL) and using a modified DCO (digital controlled oscillator). The modified DCO incorporates lookup tables to generate two outputs with quadrature relationship. The two outputs control the circuit blocks used to sample the loop input signal. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated using various input signals to assess its acquisition speed. The simulation results using Simulink/MATLAB indicate an improvement in the acquisition performance of the proposed system compared to the original TDTL. In addition, the implementation complexity of the proposed system is also improved as the realization of two DCO outputs lends itself to FPGA implementation which may be readily achieved using only one direct digital synthesizer (DDS) with two lookup tables to stores both values of sine and cosine waveforms which are used for the sampling of the input signal.	broadcast delay;device configuration overlay;direct digital synthesizer;field-programmable gate array;linear phase;lookup table;matlab;phase detector;sampling (signal processing);simulation;simulink	Omar Al-Kharji Al-Ali;Nader Anani;Mahmoud Al-Qutayri;Saleh R.

Based on GaAs E/D pHEMT process, a serial-to-parallel converter is introduced to decrease the control pads of the chip. In the 16 dB attenuation bit, a switched-path-type topology is employed in order to extend the bandwidth and achieve low insertion phase shift. The attenuator has 0.5 dB resolution and 0∼31.5 dB attenuation range. Measurement shows less-than-2.3 dB insertion loss at reference state, and larger-than-14 dB return loss at all states. An rms attenuation error of less-than-0.3 dB and phase-shift-variations less than 2 deg are achieved.

The proposed RCC receiver adopts a signal transmitted technique via amplitude modulation (AM) principle. This I/Q DPS adopts a multi-phase sampled technique using a multi-phase ring oscillator. The decoding circuit can amplify the input signal and filter the noise signal to achieve high quality signal source. The low noise amplifier (LNA) circuit can receive the smaller input power. The operational frequency of all-digital clock generator (ADCG) is programmable for the broadcast frequency of local communication systems, such as the DCF77 (Germany), WWVB (US), JJY (Japan), BPC (CN), and MSF (UK). The digital loop filter of ADCG adopts a successive-approximation register (SAR) algorithm for fast locking time. This RCC receiver is implemented in a 0.18 um CMOS process and the core area of RCC receiver is 1152 × 1572 μm2. The accuracies of operational frequencies of ADCG are less than ±264 ppm for all radio broadcasting frequencies. The voltage gain of LNA is 24.44 dB to achieve the lower input power. The measured environment of clock/alarm application is set and verified for the test chip of RCC receiver.	algorithm;cmos;clock generator;core (optical fiber);decibel;display resolution;lock (computer science);low-noise amplifier;microsoft solutions framework;modulation;pictbridge;radio broadcasting;radio clock;radio control;ring oscillator;successive approximation adc;unified model	Jen-Chieh Liu;Huan-Ke Chiu;Jia-Hung Peng;Yuan-Hua Chu;Hong-Yi Huang	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2014.6865723	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;clock domain crossing;computer science;radio receiver design	EDA	60.5357313143714	53.777350379069325	140727

It achieves a delay resolution of 4 ns and a maximum delay range of 768 ns. It has a focal-point based architecture, which consists of 7 sub-analog beamformers (sub-ABF). Each sub-ABF performs a RX focusing operation for a single focal point. Seven sub-ABFs perform a time-interleaving operation to achieve the maximum delay range of 768 ns. Phase interpolators are used in sub-ABFs to generate sampling clocks with the delay resolution of 4 ns from a low frequency system clock of 5 MHz. Each sub-ABF samples 32 echo signals at different times into sampling capacitors, which work as analog memory cells. The sampled 32 echo signals of each sub-ABF are originated from one target focal point at one instance. They are summed at one instance in a sub-ABF to perform the RX focusing for the target focal point. The proposed ABF chip has been fabricated in a 0.13- μm CMOS process with an active area of 16 mm 2. The total power consumption is 287 mW. In measurement, the digital echo signals from a commercial ultrasound medical imaging machine were applied to the fabricated chip through commercial DAC chips. Due to the speed limitation of the DAC chips, the delay resolution was relaxed to 10 ns for the real-time measurement. A linear array transducer with no steering operation is used in this work.	analog;applications-by-forms;beamforming;cmos;clock rate;decade (log scale);digital data;emulator;focal (programming language);forward error correction;low-pass filter;medical imaging;medical ultrasound;megahertz;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;radio frequency;real-time clock;relaxation;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;scientific publication;series and parallel circuits;short interspersed nucleotide elements;software propagation;transducer;ultrasonic waves;decitabine	Ji-Yong Um;Yoon-Jee Kim;Seong-Eun Cho;Min-Kyun Chae;Byungsub Kim;Jae-Yoon Sim;Hong-June Park	2015	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TBCAS.2014.2325851	embedded system;electronic engineering;transducer;engineering;electrical engineering;particle detector;physics	EDA	57.266543229535785	51.75126367890091	140847

By adjusting coupling element, impedance matching for RF input 50 ohm can be obtained. By tuning the length of the resonant strip, resonant frequency at 2.4 GHz can be easily controlled. In addition, a novel end-shorting between the end of the resonant strip and the ground plane provide a half wavelength current loop for EM compatibility and small clearance area on main circuit board. The whole dimension of the proposed antenna occupied just only a small area of 16.5 × 2 mm2. The proposed antenna design has excellent performances in bandwidth of 140 MHz @ 10 dB, radiation efficiency of > 50% and omni-like radiation patterns. For the viewpoints in practical WSN application, user's effects including user's head and body tissue were discussed and explained. For radiation power absorption, user's head plays a key role to affect the EM power distribution in radiation efficiency and front/back ratio in free space. As for impedance detuning, body tissue and user's head both lead to resonant frequency shifting. Further detailed discussions and explanations for the proposed antenna will be explained in Sects. 2 and 3.

The proposed system integrates a radio system on chip and a magnetic antenna on a glass substrate within a total dimension of 1 × 1 × 10 mm3. We demonstrate energy-efficient active near-field wireless communication between the millimeter-scale sensor node and a base station device through an RF energy-absorbing tissue. The wireless transceiver, digital baseband controller, wakeup controller, on-chip baseband timer, sleep timer, and MBUS controller are all integrated on the SoC to form a millimeter-scale sensor node, together with a 1 × 8 mm2 magnetic antenna fabricated with a 1.5-μm-thickness gold on a 100 μm-thickness glass substrate. An asymmetric link is established pairing the sensor antenna with a codesigned 11 × 11 cm2 base station antenna to achieve a link distance of up to 50 cm for sensor transmission and 20 cm for sensor reception. The transmitter consumes a 43.5 μW average power at 2 kb/s, while the receiver power consumption is 36 μW with a -54 dBm sensitivity at 100 kb/s.

1e52829ea8cd960f33f8b4c862bafbbf318e7a94	dual-band full-duplex tx/rx antennas for vehicular communications		This paper proposes a novel dual-band full-duplex antenna/array for intelligent transport systems applications. Different from traditional single-port single-band antennas, the two ports of the antenna are highly isolated and designed to operate at different frequency bands simultaneously. Such a property could support the full-duplex operation-mode, which significantly simplifies the complexity of the RF frontend subsystem. The other contribution of this work is that multiple functions such as filtering, duplexing, and radiation are combined into one single device, resulting in a simplified RF frontend. This co-design multifunctional device could also remove the separate filters, duplexers, and interfaces between them, resulting in the reduction of the size, weight, and cost. In addition, cross-coupling is investigated and employed to generate additional transmission zeros so as to improve the channel isolation and out-of-band interference. To verify the concept, an antenna element and two 2 × 2 arrays at C-band are designed, prototyped, and tested. All the measurements agree well with the simulations, showing two full-duplex channels of 4.58–4.83 GHz and 5.86–6.2 GHz for transmitting and receiving, respectively. The proposed antennas also exhibit excellent performance in terms of channel isolations, frequency selectivity, out-of-band rejections, and gains.	duplex (telecommunications);frequency band;interference (communication);multi-function printer;out-of-band agreement;rx microcontroller family;radio frequency;selectivity (electronic);simulation;transmitter	Chunxu Mao;Steven Gao;Yi Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2789250	duplex (telecommunications);electronic engineering;filter (signal processing);radio frequency;radio spectrum;resonator;computer science;interference (wave propagation);multi-band device;communication channel	Mobile	64.99273538135036	57.70962743753713	142021

Previously [2], [3] have theoretically established that FTN can provide improved bandwidth efficiency. However, this comes at the cost of higher decoding complexity at the receiver. Our work has evaluated multicarrier FTN signaling for its implementation feasibility and complexity overhead compared to the gains in bandwidth efficiency. The work carried out in this research project includes a systems perspective evaluating performance, algorithm hardware tradeoffs and a hardware architecture leading to a silicon implementation of the decoder for FTN signaling. From the systems perspective, co-existence of FTN and OFDM based multicarrier system has been evaluated. OFDM being a part of many existing and upcoming broadband access technologies such as WLAN, LTE, DVB, this analogy is motivated. On the hardware aspect, the proposed architecture can accommodate both OFDM and FTN systems. The processing blocks in transmitter and receiver were designed for reuse and carry out different functions in the transceiver. Furthemore, the hardware could be configured to operate at varying bandwidth efficiencies (by FTN signaling) to exploit the channel conditions. The decoder implementation also considered block sizes and data rates to comply with the 3GPP standard. The decoding is carried out in as few as 8 iterations making it more practical for implementation in power constrained mobile devices. The decoder is implemented in 65nm CMOS process and occupies a total chip area of 0.8mm2.	algorithm;cmos;codec;compaq lte;digital video broadcasting;interference (communication);internet access;iteration;mobile device;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;overhead (computing);spectral efficiency;transceiver;transmitter	Deepak Dasalukunte;Fredrik Rusek;John B.

The antenna is developed for a Zigbee platform for Child Indoor Localization purposes. It is to operate at 2.4 GHz, with a linearly polarized radiation. For the wearable antenna, a conductive textile was used, namely Shieldit, and for the substrate layer, a 3.5 mm felt fabric was used. The multislots-loading technique was utilized, resulting in a 62% size reduction of the patch size compared to the size of a regular rectangular patch antenna. The reduced size design achieved a fractional bandwidth of 1.4%. Furthermore, investigations were conducted on different antenna bending and the antenna's performance in proximity to human body.	bandwidth (signal processing);microstrip;phone connector (audio);polarizer;wearable computer	Effat O.

The proposed phase noise cancellation technique estimates the phase noise using an RF delay-line-discriminator (DLD), digitizes the DLD output, performs proper digital signal processing (DSP) and then compensates for the phase noise at the digital baseband. This new technique is applicable to both transmitter and receiver and is independent of the modulation and waveform. As part of the DSP, an adaptive linear prediction filter (ALPF) is applied to compensate the analog delay associated with the DLD, low-pass filters, and data conversion. Such delay compensation enhances the phase noise cancellation bandwidth. 30 dB of phase noise cancellation is achieved in simulation using realistic phase noise and component models.	analog delay line;baseband;digital signal processing;discriminator;dld (software);hd radio;low-pass filter;mathematical model;modulation;phase noise;phase-locked loop;radio frequency;simulation;transmitter;waveform	Sam Gharavi;Babak Daneshrad	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS2013)	10.1109/ISCAS.2013.6572050	adaptive filter;computer vision;noise;electronic engineering;data conversion;low-pass filter;telecommunications;noise temperature;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;group delay and phase delay;noise;control theory;phase noise	EDA	59.76368061578772	57.46210931369817	142649

Extensive simulations demonstrate that, if a proper value of beta is chosen, high accuracy can be obtained by resorting to a very simple self-calibration algorithm. This is true, even in the case of large tolerance values for the resistors that make up the ladder network. Such a result may allow the design of a high-accuracy very low cost converter. The effect of the offset of the comparator needed for the self-calibration algorithm is also discussed.	algorithm;comparator;electronic filter topology;simulation	Graziella Scandurra;Carmine Ciofi;Giuseppe Campobello;Gianluca Cannatà	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2009.2021236	resistor;control engineering;electronic engineering;voltage;calibration;error detection and correction;data conversion;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;physics;statistics	Mobile	67.4826579216364	49.98524691721844	142774

New techniques and devices, such as the wireless capsule endoscope and the telemetry capsule, that are able to measure the various signals of the digestive organs (temperature, pH, and pressure), have been developed for the observation of the digestive organs. In these capsule devices, there are no methods of moving and grasping them. In order to make a swift diagnosis and to give proper medication, it is necessary to control the moving speed of the capsule. This paper presents a wireless system for the control of movements of an electrical stimulus capsule. This includes an electrical stimulus capsule which can be swallowed and an external transmitting control system. A receiver, a receiving antenna (small multi-loop), a transmitter, and a transmitting antenna (monopole) were designed and fabricated taking into consideration the MPE, power consumption, system size, signal-to-noise ratio and the modulation method. The wireless system, which was designed and implemented for the control of movements of the electrical stimulus capsule, was verified by in-vitro experiments which were performed on the small intestines of a pig. As a result, we found that when the small intestines are contracted by electrical stimuli, the capsule can move to the opposite direction, which means that the capsule can go up or down in the small intestines.

As a measure of the speed of operation of comparator-type converters, the minimal number of comparison operations of the signal and the threshold required for reaching the specified sensitivity and dynamic range is used. As a measure of the speed of operation, the number of averagings required for reaching the specified sensitivity is used for gated converters.	comparator;dynamic range;ultra-wideband;zero suppression	Karlis Kruminsh;V.

These include capacitor dielectric absorption/relaxation, incomplete stage reset at high clock rates, and parasitic capacitance effects when opamps are shared between subsequent pipeline stages. This paper describes these sources of memory errors and the effect they have on overall ADC linearity. It is shown how these errors relate to and differ from interstage gain errors. Two new calibration algorithms are proposed that correct for memory errors by digital post-processing of the ADC output. Both algorithms operate in the background and so do not require conversion to be interrupted in order to track changes due to temperature and supply variations.

Here, RF channel selection, as opposed to band selection that removes all interferers, even those in band, and passes only the desired channel, is key to substantial potential increases in call volume with simultaneous reductions in power consumption. The relevant MEMS technologies most conducive to RF channel- selecting front-ends include vibrating micromechanical resonators that exhibit record on-chip Qs at gigahertz frequencies; resonant switches that provide extremely efficient switched-mode power gain for both transmit and receive paths; medium-scale integrated micromechanical circuits that implement on/off switchable filter-amplifier banks; and fabrication technologies that integrate MEMS together with foundry CMOS transistors in a fully monolithic low-capacitance single-chip process. The many issues that make realization of RF channel selection a truly challenging proposition include resonator drift stability, mechanical circuit complexity, repeatability and fabrication tolerances, and the need for resonators at gigahertz frequencies with simultaneous high Ω (>30,000) and low impedance (e.g., 50 W for conventional systems). Some perspective on which resonator technologies might best achieve these simultaneous attributes is provided.	amplifier;autonomous robot;cmos;characteristic impedance;circuit complexity;cognitive radio;low-power broadcasting;microelectromechanical systems;network switch;power gain;radio frequency;repeatability;spectrum analyzer;transistor	Clark T.-C.

These standards are defined using half anechoic chambers (HAC). Studies have already been conducted to compare trans electromagnetic (TEM) cell and HAC, or far-field emissions, and the test results show a limited correlation between TEM cells and the free space field or HAC. In this paper, it is shown that the correlation between the measurements made in a GTEM cell and HAC can be good enough in allowing us to use the GTEM facility during the research and development (R&D) phase (considering the facts that the HAC facility is often quite overloaded and of a high cost), that knowledge of the electromagnetic compatibility behavior of the integrated circuit is important for predicting the whole system's results as well as how to use an integrated circuit electromagnetic model to make the prediction of emissions.

The knee-point calibration method using a nonfully depleted photodiode by controlling the transfer voltage is proposed, without any modification of the pixel structure or addition of circuit components. The prototype sensor is fabricated using a 0.13 µm CIS process. The chip includes a 320 × 240 pixel array with a 2.25 µm pixel pitch.

Different kind of UWB radiators like monopole and printed single side dipoles have received more attention compared to double side structures. In this paper, a set of different shape antennas fed with parallel-strip transmission lines (UWB-PS antennas) are proposed and studied, taking into account the return losses metric. The geometrical parameters have been computed using a genetic optimizer linked to a method of moment (MoM) simulator like IE3D Zeland. The main advantage of the designed geometries lie in the fact they do not include ground plane, radiating in almost the whole space. Measurements of two candidates with circular and exponential profiles have been carried out, showing a good frequency behaviour in the frequency band from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz.	frequency band;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;printing;requirement;time complexity;transmission line;ultra-wideband	Pedro Luis Carro;Jesus de Mingo	2007	2007 IEEE 66th Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECF.2007.430	electronic engineering;genetic algorithm;electronic design automation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	Visualization	66.46835564111483	59.19335526282195	144419

Several tuning techniques have been proposed in the literature, which can be grouped in two basic schemes: master-slave and self-calibrationarrangements. Here we propose a novel tuning approach which can be applied to both tuning schemes. The tuning algorithm is based on the application of a pseudo-random input Test Pattern Signal and on the evaluation of a few samples of the input-output cross-correlation function. The key advantages of the proposed technique are basically the use of a pseudo-random pattern signal which can be generated by a very simple circuit in a small diearea and the simple circuitry required to sample the filter output and to perform the cross-correlation operation.Some experimental results of the application of the proposed tuning technique to a benchmark filter are given in order to assess its effectiveness.	algorithm;align (company);benchmark (computing);cross-correlation;electronic circuit;frequency response;master/slave (technology);pseudorandomness;signal processing	Francesco Corsi;Cristoforo Marzocca;Gianvito Matarrese;Andrea Baschirotto;Stefano D'Amico	2004	Proceedings Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition		control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;cross-correlation;signal processing;control theory;statistics	EDA	63.06700959299833	49.46206148543102	144432

In order to apply this threefold phase compensation scheme to realize a high gain and high frequency 3-stage amplifier with enough phase margin, the small signal equivalent circuit model with stray capacitors at the output of each stage of amplifier is newly developed and the small signal transfer function including those stray capacitors are formulated. The transfer function is factorized into poles and zeros so that their relationship and influence on the frequency characteristics can be examined. The 3-stage amplifier is actually circuit designed by using 0.18μm CMOS devices.

The triangular patch antenna is axially fed by a probe at its center, exciting both its TM<sub>10</sub> and TM<sub>11</sub> modes. Comparing with the traditional circular patch, the triangular patch can not only minimize the patch size but also can generate a radiation null at the upper band edge. A ring slot and a series of shorting vias are introduced into the patch to merge the two modes, enhancing the bandwidth of the passband. The combination of the two elements simultaneously generates a radiation null at the lower band edge. Consequently, a compact filtering patch antenna with quasi-elliptic bandpass response is obtained without involving specific filtering circuits.

The ring oscillator consists of a voltage-to-current converter, coder circuit, three-stage ring with delay cells, and current monitoring circuit to extend the tuning range of the proposed voltage-controlled oscillator. Each functional block has been designed for a minimum power consumption using the TSMC 0.18µm CMOS technology. We simulate the performances of the proposed voltage-controlled oscillator in terms of phase noise, power consumption, tuning range, and gain. Our simulation results show that the proposed oscillator has the linear frequency-voltage characteristics over a wide tuning range. At each tuning range (mode), the calculated phase noise of the proposed ring oscillator at each tuning range (mode) was -87, -85, -81, and -79dBc/Hz at a 1MHz offset from the center frequency. The DC power of the proposed voltage-controlled oscillator consumed 0.86-3mW under a 1.8V supply voltage. The monitoring circuit senses the current level in the delay cell by controlling the current level.The VCO has wide and linear tuning range.The VCO can be used as a PLL component that required the operation from low to high frequency.	embedded system;voltage-controlled oscillator	Won-tae Lee;Jaemin Shim;Jichai Jeong	2013	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2013.09.003	control engineering;frequency drift;electronic engineering;voltage-controlled oscillator;colpitts oscillator;vackář oscillator;engineering;electrical engineering;ring oscillator;grid dip oscillator;pierce oscillator;variable-frequency oscillator;control theory;rc oscillator;oscillator start-up timer;digitally controlled oscillator;oscillator sync;cmos;phase noise;delay line oscillator;local oscillator;parametric oscillator	EDA	61.014623681993065	49.212463796581275	145163

The fabricated modulator chip achieves 94-dB SFDR and 78-dB DR in 2.2-MHz BW and meets the ADSL2+ specifications.	algorithm;delta-sigma modulation;digital-to-analog converter;electronic circuit;low-pass filter;nsb/appstudio;noise shaping;nonlinear system;signal-to-noise ratio;spurious-free dynamic range	Alex Jianzhong Chen;Yong Ping Xu	2009	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008485	control engineering;computer vision;electronic engineering;low-pass filter;computer science;electrical engineering;control theory;signal-to-noise ratio	EDA	61.41627748804688	50.6805617366565	145443

This method compares the equivalent impedance of the BUTTERWORTH-VAN DYKE (BVD) model based on an electrical equivalent circuit with the impedance obtained by piezoelectric equations in one dimension for a piezoelectric structure. Using the least squares method, the three elements of the BVD model can be determined as a function of the dimensions and the properties of the piezoelectric resonator. Based on the proposed method, a ladder piezoelectric 7 pole filter can be easily optimized using an electrical synthesis. The frequency of the proposed filter is around 1.84GHz and the band pass close to 100MHz.

The architecture consists of a coarse and a fine SAR ADC. The 2-b coarse SAR presets the two MSB capacitive arrays of the fine SAR, thus avoiding the largest sources of dynamic power consumption. The use of two low-resolution comparators in the coarse converter enables compensating for the offset mismatches between the coarse and fine ADCs. The comparator of the fine SAR ADC obtains high sensitivity and very low power owing to a gain-enhanced dynamic preamplifier. A loop delay line generates all the phases for the SAR logic and permits three different modes of operation: on-demand, self-clocked, and clocked. In the clocked mode and at 200 kS/s, this converter achieves a 9.05-b effective number of bits (ENOB) while consuming 200 nW. The resulting figure of merit (FoM) is 1.88 fJ/conversion-level.	analog delay line;analog-to-digital converter;block cipher mode of operation;cmos;clock rate;comparator;effective number of bits;most significant bit;preamplifier;successive approximation adc	Yulin Zhang;Edoardo Bonizzoni;Franco Maloberti	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2016.2538139	electronic engineering;real-time computing;capacitor;successive approximation adc;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;capacitance;low-power electronics	Arch	59.17260843585921	50.507877502743234	145782

Its ability to store and reproduce timing information in an analog manner without performing quantization can be useful for a wide range of applications. For continuous-time (CT) digital filters, the power and area costly analog delay blocks, which are usually implemented as inverter chains or their variants, can be replaced by the proposed timing storage circuits to delay CT digital signals in a more efficient way, especially for low-frequency biomedical applications that require very long tap delays. In addition, the same timing storage circuits also enable the storage of CT digital signals, extending the benefits of CT digital signal processing (DSP) to applications that require signal storage. As an example, a 15-tap CT finite impulse response (FIR) Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter was designed with memristor-based delay blocks to smoothen electrocardiographic (ECG) signals accompanied with high-frequency noise.

Many mechanisms for the production of spurs have been identified, making it possible to develop appropriate strategies to minimise or eliminate them. This paper describes another spur generation mechanism which has not been reported previously. The effect becomes important when the divide ratio is small.

72d380517ce7b718461d97ea327425c7e43e7029	compact planar ultrawideband antennas with 3.5/5.2/5.8 ghz triple band-notched characteristics for internet of things applications	worldwide interoperability for microwave access wimax;slots;ultrawideband uwb antenna;band notched;wireless local area network wlan	Ultrawideband (UWB) antennas, as core devices in high-speed wireless communication, are widely applied to mobile handsets, wireless sensor networks, and Internet of Things (IoT). A compact printed monopole antenna for UWB applications with triple band-notched characteristics is proposed in this paper. The antenna has a very compact size of 10 x 16 mm2 and is composed of a square slotted radiation patch and a narrow rectangular ground plane on the back of the substrate. First, by etching a pair of inverted T-shaped slots at the bottom of the radiation patch, one notched band at 5-6 GHz for rejecting the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) is generated. Then, by cutting a comb-shaped slot on the top of the radiation patch, a second notched band for rejecting 3.5 GHz Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) is obtained. Further, by cutting a pair of rectangular slots and a C-shaped slot as well as adding a pair of small square parasitic patches at the center of the radiating patch, two separate notched bands for rejecting 5.2 GHz lower WLAN and 5.8 GHz upper WLAN are realized, respectively. Additionally, by integrating the slotted radiation patch with the narrow rectangular ground plane, an enhanced impedance bandwidth can be achieved, especially at the higher band. The antenna consists of linear symmetrical sections only and is easy for fabrication and fine-tuning. The measured results show that the designed antenna provides a wide impedance bandwidth of 150% from 2.12 to 14.80 GHz for VSWR < 2, except for three notched bands of 3.36-4.16, 4.92-5.36, and 5.68-6.0 GHz. Additionally, the antenna exhibits nearly omnidirectional radiation characteristics, low gain at the stopbands, and flat group delay over the whole UWB except at the stopbands. Simulated and experimental results show that the proposed antenna can provide good frequency-domain and time-domain performances at desired UWB frequencies and be an attractive candidate for portable IoT applications.	antenna device component;bands;characteristic impedance;dimensions;distortion;embedded system;embedding;exhibits as topic;group delay and phase delay;internet of things;interoperability;low back pain;microwave;mobile phone;pnma2 gene;parasites;performance;printing;quantitative impedance;semiconductor device fabrication;ultra-wideband;sensor (device)	Jian Dong;Qianqian Li;Lianwen Deng	2017		10.3390/s17020349	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;patch antenna	Mobile	66.1117417030672	58.29780639506507	146452

The content of this article is a sub-proposal to the IEEE 802.15.7r1 Task Group (TG7r1) aimed at Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) using an image sensor as the receiver. The compatibility support is indispensable for Image Sensor Communications (ISC) because the rolling shutter image sensors currently available have different frame rates, shutter speeds, sampling rates, and resolutions. However, focusing on unidirectional communications (i.e., data broadcasting, beacons), an asynchronous communication prototype is also discussed in the paper. Due to the physical limitations associated with typical image sensors (including low and varying frame rates, long exposures, and low shutter speeds), the link speed performance is critically considered. Based on the practical measurement of camera response to modulated light, an operating frequency range is suggested along with the similar system architecture, decoding procedure, and algorithms. A significant feature of our novel data frame structure is that it can support both typical frame rate cameras (in the oversampling mode) as well as very low frame rate cameras (in the error detection mode for a camera whose frame rate is lower than the transmission packet rate). A high frame rate camera, i.e., no less than 20 fps, is supported in an oversampling mode in which a majority voting scheme for decoding data is applied. A low frame rate camera, i.e., when the frame rate drops to less than 20 fps at some certain time, is supported by an error detection mode in which any missing data sub-packet is detected in decoding and later corrected by external code. Numerical results and valuable analysis are also included to indicate the capability of the proposed schemes.	algorithm;clock rate;concatenated error correction code;data rate units;datacasting;digital zoom;error detection and correction;experiment;frame (networking);frequency band;image sensor;medical device incompatibility problem;missing data;modulation;movie projector;network packet;numerical analysis;numerical method;optical wireless;oversampling;part dosing unit;prototype;sampling (signal processing);shutter device component;structure of right lower lobe of lung;systems architecture;transmitter (medical device);twice (numerical qualifier);undersampling;brightness;sensor (device)	Trang Nguyen;Mohammad Arif Hossain;Yeong Min Jang	2016	Sensors	10.3390/s16050736	frame;embedded system;residual frame;electronic engineering;real-time computing;error detection and correction;telecommunications;computer science;asynchronous communication	Mobile	53.86836504161838	51.90463949919464	146852

This device could be especially useful in optical networks applications based in both Coarse and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing technology (CWDM/DWDM). The enabling component is a Ferro-electric Liquid Crystal (FLC) Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) where dynamic holograms are implemented in real time. As a consequence, the device will be able to carry out different functions according to the hologram recorded on the SLM. The great advantage of this device is a polarization insensitivity operation, allowing low cross-talk and simple handling. Also some topics on Computer Generated Holograms (CGHs) design process are commented and general guidelines also are done.

An integrated 250 μm diameter non-SML NW/P-sub photo detector is adopted to allow efficient light coupling. The theory of applying a fully-differential pre-amplifier with a single-ended photo current is also examined and a super-Gm transimpedance amplifier has been proposed to drive a C PD of 14 pF to multi-gigahertz frequency. Both differential and common-mode operations of the proposed super-Gm transimpedance amplifier have been analyzed and a differential noise analysis is performed. A digitally-controlled linear equalizer is proposed to produce a slow-rising-slope frequency response to compensate for the photo detector up to 3 GHz. The proposed POF receiver consists of an illuminated signal photo detector, a shielded dummy photo detector, a super-Gm transimpedance amplifier, a variable-gain amplifier, a linear equalizer, a post amplifier, and an output driver. A test chip is fabricated in TSMC's 65 nm low-power CMOS process, and it consumes 50 mW of DC power (excluding the output driver) from a single 1.2 V supply. A bit-error rate of less than 10-12 has been measured at a data rate of 3.125 Gbps with a 670 nm VCSEL-based electro-optical transmitter.	biasing;bit error rate;cmos;data rate units;dbm;decibel;dummy variable (statistics);equalization (communications);frequency response;gigabit;incremental funding methodology;johnson–nyquist noise;low-power broadcasting;netware;optical fiber;preamplifier;reliability engineering;sensor;single-ended signaling;television interface adaptor;transimpedance amplifier;transmitter;uncompressed video;variable-gain amplifier;x.690	Yunzhi Dong;Kenneth W.

Such applications require ADCs with high absolute accuracy and linearity, as well as high resolution. Moreover, since the signals of interest are typically near DC, such ADCs must employ robust offset and 1/f noise-reduction techniques. Fulfilling these requirements often results in ADCs with poor energy efficiency, thus preventing their use in systems powered by batteries or energy scavengers. This paper describes a micro-power incremental ADC that achieves 20b resolution, 1μV offset and 6ppm INL, while dissipating more than an order of magnitude less energy than ADCs with comparable precision [3-6]. This is achieved by the use of a 2-step or zoom ADC architecture [1,2], an inverter-based integrator, and various dynamic error-correction techniques.	analog-to-digital converter;error detection and correction;high-resolution scheme;pink noise;power inverter;requirement;sensor;transducer	Youngcheol Chae;Kamran Souri;Kofi A.

e504365f544743e4a15815ed4ed6b60ec00d74af	area/energy-efficient gammatone filters based on stochastic computation		This paper introduces area/energy-efficient gammatone filters based on stochastic computation. The gammatone filter well expresses the performance of human auditory peripheral mechanism and has a potential of improving advanced speech communications systems, especially hearing assisting devices and noise robust speech-recognition systems. Using stochastic computation, a power-and-area hungry multiplier used in a digital filter is replaced by a simple logic gate, leading to area-efficient hardware. However, a straightforward implementation of the stochastic gammatone filter suffers from significantly low accuracy in computation, which results in a low dynamic range (a ratio of the maximum to minimum magnitude) due to a small value of a filter gain. To improve the computation accuracy, gain-balancing techniques are presented that represent the original gain as the product of multiple larger gains introduced at the second-order sections. In addition, dynamic scaling techniques are proposed that scales up small values only on stochastic domain in order to reduce the number of stochastic bits required while maintaining the computation accuracy. For performance comparisons, the proposed stochastic gammatone filters are designed and evaluated on taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company (TSMC) 65-nm CMOS technology. As a result, the proposed filter achieves an area reduction of 90.7% and an energy reduction of 91.8% in comparison with a fixed-point gammatone filter at the same sampling frequency and a comparable dynamic range.	cmos;computation;digital filter;dynamic range;filter bank;hardware description language;high dynamic range;high-dynamic-range rendering;image scaling;infinite impulse response;logic gate;peripheral;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor device fabrication;signal processing;speech recognition;verilog	Naoya Onizawa;Shunsuke Koshita;Shuichi Sakamoto;Masahide Abe;Masayuki Kawamata;Takahiro Hanyu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2687404	computer science;transfer function;dynamic range;very-large-scale integration;electronic engineering;gammatone filter;computation;sampling (signal processing);digital filter;multiplier (economics)	Robotics	54.19569910656798	53.3956470477887	147450

The design of the RF transceiver and the digital control of the tag IC are based on the EPCglobal ultrahigh-frequency Gen-2 protocol. A new design technique for the power management of the tag IC is presented, which includes a low-voltage bandgap, a low-dropout regulator with a bias-boosted gain stage, and an adaptive dc limiter. With the proposed design technique, we achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 47% at a low input power of -12 dBm. To support data security, we use one-time programmable (OTP) memory for nonvolatile data storage. The 4-kb (256 × 16 b) OTP memory array is based on a two-transistor (2-T) gate-oxide antifuse that can be programmed with a voltage of less than 6 V. The tag chip was fabricated in a 1-poly 6-metal standard 0.13- μm CMOS process. The power consumption levels of the tag IC are 29.2 and 71.2 μW for the read and programming modes, respectively.

Compressive sensing enables sub-Nyquist sampling for low-energy data reduction on such nodes. The reconstruction cost, however, is severe, typically pushing signal analysis to a base station. We present a seizure-detection processor that directly analyzes compressively-sensed electroencephalograms (EEGs) on the sensor node. In addition to alleviating communication costs while also circumventing reconstruction costs, it leads to computational energy savings, due to the reduced number of input samples. This provides an effective knob for system power management and enables scaling of energy and application-level performance. For compression factors of 2-24×, the energy to extract signal features (over 18 channels) is 7.13-0.11μJ, and the detector's performance for sensitivity, latency, and specificity is 96-80%, 4.7-17.8 sec, and 0.15-0.79 false-alarms/hr., respectively (compared to baseline performance of 96%, 4.6 sec, and 0.15 false-alarms/hr.).	baseline (configuration management);brain implant;compressed sensing;computation;control knob;image scaling;low-power broadcasting;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;power management;sampling (signal processing);sensitivity and specificity;sensor node;signal processing	Mohammed Shoaib;Niraj K.

7c3cab8f707f22c4045c422d81858eac36e6dd9f	a broadband antenna array using full-wave dipole		This work introduces a bandwidth broadening technique for full-wave dipole (FWD) antennas and arrays, which are realized by introducing gaps in both two arms of the dipole. Several parameters are analyzed to illustrate the change of input impedance of the proposed FWD and the moving of resonant modes. The proposed FWD array antenna shows advantages in terms of impedance bandwidth, 3-dB gain bandwidth and the complexity of the feeding network, when the four-unit FWD array antenna compares with the eight-unit half-wave dipole array antenna. The impedance bandwidth of the proposed FWD array antenna is up to 67.8% with the reflection coefficient <−10 dB from 3.9 to 7.9 GHz. The 3-dB gain bandwidth of the proposed antenna array is 51.4% with the maximum gain of 14.2 dBi and unidirectional radiation property across the entire operating bandwidth. The proposed methodology is good for a high-gain antenna array design through the reduction of antenna elements so as to minimize the complexity of power distributed network to the array. The ultimate goal of this work is to devote a low-cost and high-efficiency antenna array to broadband wireless communication systems.	array data structure;characteristic impedance;coat of arms;dipole antenna;input impedance;reflection coefficient	Guang-Hua Sun;Sai-Wai Wong;Hang Wong	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2717483	collinear antenna array;computer network;antenna (radio);computer science;antenna measurement;electronic engineering;antenna noise temperature;reflective array antenna;antenna array;dipole antenna;telecommunications;antenna rotator	Mobile	65.7830968050622	57.686479201258244	148153

The proposed system overcomes the deficiencies of a previously reported converter and can operate about 20 times faster. To validate this FVC and show its usefulness, it was used in the design of a frequency locked loop. For the design of this loop, it was found that existing analytical models were incomplete in that they neglect the delay associated to frequency measurements. We proposed a new model which, unlike previous work, shows that frequency locked loops can potentially be unstable. Simulations confirm this fact and also show that the proposed implementation can operate at 5 GHz. To validate the results, a prototype circuit has been fabricated in a 0.18-mum CMOS technology. Tests performed on the prototype show that it runs reliably at 3.84 GHz and consumes 77.4 mW with a 1.8-V power supply when biasing circuitry is included.	algorithm;biasing;broadcast delay;cmos;computer simulation;control theory;discrepancy function;electronic circuit;fingerprint verification competition;first-order predicate;frequency-locked loop;local oscillator;order of approximation;phase-locked loop;power supply;prototype;voltage converter	Hung Tien Bui;Yvon Savaria	2008	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2008.916397	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;cmos	EDA	66.83616034336956	50.141779192940106	148289

Two types of the ET-MSA are proposed in this paper; they are ET-MSA with closed folded slots and open folded slots with an embedded bridge. The antenna prototypes presented in this paper assume four folded slots in which a metal strip is inserted to realize a good multi-band performance. In addition, the open folded slots, in which the metal strip inside the folded slot is connected to the ET-MSA by the embedded metal bridge, leads to miniaturize the antenna. The proposed antennas are printed on the top layer of a PTFE substrate while the L-probe is printed on the bottom one. The L-shaped probe is utilized due to its tremendous performance in providing a wideband impedance matching. Five resonant frequencies of the ET-MSAs with closed folded slots and with open folded slots are predicted by the electromagnetic simulator (IE3D) based on the method of moment, respectively. Some parametric studies have been also investigated to meet an appropriate multi-band performance. A broadside radiation pattern and gain of 3.0-7.0dBi have been confirmed by the measurement for the entire observed frequencies. Measured results agree well with the prediction. Thus, these antenna systems are demonstrated to be useful models for a multi-band planar antenna.	microstrip	Ridho Chayono;Yuichi Kimura;Misao Haneishi	2006	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietele/e89-c.12.1896	folded inverted conformal antenna;electronic engineering;microstrip antenna;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;physics	Visualization	66.58363687675217	58.42976916726919	148857

Gate signal jitter in power electronic converters, which introduces wideband noise to the power output, originates mainly from the signal isolators that are required to provide the galvanically isolated gate driver control signals. A low-jitter gate control signal is produced by employing a digital flip-flop, which uses a low-jitter isolated clock, to resynchronize the jittery gate control signal. By utilizing the clock-enable input of the flip-flop, the gate driver can be rendered immune to high-speed common-mode transients, which is important as the Class-D power amplifier demonstrator system employs fast-switching GaN E-HEMT transistors, where the 400 V switching transients exceed 300 <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$\text{k V}\, \mu \text{s}^{-1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>.

When these filters use low gain amplifiers or voltage followers instead of high gain opamps, this task becomes even more complex due to the loss of the virtual ground node, requiring the compensation of the parasitic capacitances during the design phase. This paper proposes an automatic procedure for the design of SC filters using low gain amplifiers, including the automatic compensation of the parasitic capacitances. This design methodology is based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) using hybrid cost functions. The cost function first uses equations to estimate the filter transfer function, the gain and settling-time of the amplifier and the RC time constants of the switches. This reduces the computation time, thus allowing to use large populations to cover the entire design space. Once all specifications are met, the GA uses transient electrical simulations of the circuit in the cost functions, thus resulting in a high accuracy in the determination of the filter's transfer function and allowing to accurately compensate the parasitic capacitances and obtain the final design solution within a reasonable computation time.	approximation algorithm;circuit design;computation;genetic algorithm;loss function;mathematical optimization;network switch;operational amplifier;population;settling time;simulation;software release life cycle;switched capacitor;time complexity;top-down and bottom-up design;transfer function;virtual ground	Hugo Serra;Rui Santos-Tavares;Nuno F.

843d3df42ab77c6763fa654204d2d41f039559cf	on the use of body biasing to improve linearity in low lo-power cmos active mixers	linearity;body biasing;low power;mixer;cmos	In a radio-frequency (RF) transceiver, the linearity of the mixer has a profound effect on the overall transceiver performance. In many RF transceivers, active mixers are used due to their higher gain which also improves the overall receiver noise figure. In a typical RF active mixer where the transistors in the LO stage switch abruptly, most of the nonlinear distortions come from the transconductance or RF stage and thus the linearity of the mixer can be enhanced by proper design of the RF stage. In low-power receivers, however, to reduce the power consumption of the local oscillator (LO) circuit, the amplitude of LO signal is low and thus the switching of the transistors in the LO stage of the mixer is gradual. In this paper, we propose a technique to improve the linearity of such low-power mixers by enhancing the linearity of the LO stage. In particular, body biasing is utilized in the LO stage to improve the linearity. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, two proof-of-concept double-balanced down-conversion active mixers have been designed and fabricated in 0.13-@?m CMOS. The maximum IIP3 of +2.7dBm and -4.9dBm at a conversion gain of 13dB and 16dB are achieved for the first and second prototype respectively. For a 2.4GHz RF input signal and an intermediate-Frequency (IF) of 50MHz, the first prototype consumes 2.4mW from a 1.2V supply while the second one consumes only 780@?W from a 0.7V supply.	biasing;cmos	Hooman Rashtian;Amir Hossein Masnadi Shirazi;Shahriar Mirabbasi	2014	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2014.05.001	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;linearity;cmos	Vision	61.604380928642605	51.957180986724936	149921

However, while the achievable speed has been improved significantly, the reported effective resolutions are usually limited below 12 bits. This is mostly caused by the limited accuracy of the common implementation of the internal digital-to-analog converter (DAC) as charge redistribution switched-capacitor DAC. To remove this limitation, this paper proposes a novel approach to build the internal DAC in a SAR ADC as an incremental Sigma-Delta modulator (SDM). With its simple and low cost design the proposed scheme for the feedback DAC enables the design of power and cost efficient, high resolution SAR ADCs. The proposed DAC incorporates an incremental digital SDM followed by a semi-digital reconstruction filter, which approximates the ideal reconstruction filter for a third order digital SDM, with relaxed matching requirements. The proposed architecture is compared to other common high resolution ADC topologies.	1-bit architecture;16-bit;analog-to-digital converter;cost efficiency;delta-sigma modulation;digital-to-analog converter;electronic circuit;filter bank;finite impulse response;image resolution;image scaling;lambda calculus;reconstruction filter;requirement;semiconductor industry;successive approximation adc;switched capacitor	Ahmad AlMarashli;Jens Anders;Maurits Ortmanns	2014	2014 21st IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems (ICECS)	10.1109/ICECS.2014.7049939	electronic engineering;integral nonlinearity;successive approximation adc;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory	EDA	60.98081286274655	50.55050882645607	149983

In order to deploy such full-duplex relays, it is necessary to efficiently mitigate the inherent self-interference stemming from the strong transmit signal coupling to the sensitive receive chain. In this article, we present novel state-of-the-art antenna solutions as well as digital self-interference cancellation algorithms for compact MIMO full-duplex relays, specifically targeted for reduced-cost deployments in local area networks. The presented antenna design builds on resonant wavetraps and is shown to provide passive isolations on the order of 60-70 dB. We also discuss and present advanced digital cancellation solutions, beyond classical linear processing, specifically tailored against nonlinear distortion of the power amplifier when operating close to saturation. Measured results from a complete demonstrator system, integrating antennas, RF cancellation, and nonlinear digital cancellation, are also presented, evidencing close to 100 dB of overall self-interference suppression.

For the first time, tags are embeddable inside plywood by direct inkjet-printing tag antennas on pure birch veneer. The use of passive UHF RFID technology in the applications of plywood industry is discussed, two tag antenna designs for plywood are presented and the tag fabrication procedures are described. Furthermore, results from tag performance measurements performed in the authentic application environment as well as in anechoic conditions are presented and discussed. Measurements show that tags printed on veneer and embedded inside 2 mm thick plywood board exhibited theoretical read ranges from 7.9 to 10.1 meters. The read ranges obtained meet the demands of the plywood industry and offer reliable identification even in challenging environments.	embedded system;global positioning system;human-readable medium;maximal set;printing;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;requirement;tag (metadata);tag system;thickness (graph theory);ultra high frequency	Juha Virtanen;Johanna Virkki;Lauri Sydänheimo;Manos M.

The effort is presently toward compact and low-power solutions in view of integrating several transceivers on the same chip enabling phased array systems. In this paper we present a 24 GHz receiver, based on a subharmonic direct conversion architecture, designed in a 65 nm node. The local oscillator takes advantage of the half frequency operation proving significantly lower power consumption when compared to conventional solutions running at received frequency. Stacked switches for subharmonic down-conversion are passive to save voltage room, current driven and loaded by a transresistance amplifier. Optimum biasing of the switches allows maximizing linearity while saving power in the baseband. The integrated LNA matching network is the bottleneck toward low sensitivities. The LNA design trades-off power consumption, gain and sensitivity. Detailed insights into implementation issues, critical in a single-ended topology where both forward and return signal paths have to be supported, are provided. The chip consumes 78 mW and occupies 1.4 mm2 of active area. Experiments show: 30.5 dB gain, 6.7 dB NF, -13 dBm IIP3.	baseband;biasing;cmos;dbm;impedance matching;local oscillator;low-noise amplifier;low-power broadcasting;network switch;new foundations;operational amplifier;phased array;single-ended signaling;third-order intercept point;transceiver	Andrea Mazzanti;Marco Sosio;Matteo Repossi;Francesco Svelto	2011	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2010.2071711	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;cmos	Arch	63.06203477508401	53.13745111992852	150322

Synchronization must be strictly maintained across a large number of parallel data streams, from A/D conversion, through operations such as beamforming, to dataset recording. FPGAs supporting multigigabit serial I/O are ideally suited to this application. We describe a recently-constructed radio telescope called ETA having all-sky observing capability for detecting low frequency pulses from transient events such as gamma ray bursts and primordial black hole explosions. Signals from 24 dipole antennas are processed by a tiered arrangement of 28 commercial FPGA boards and 4 PCs with FPGA-based data acquisition cards, connected with custom I/O adapter boards supporting InfiniBand and LVDS physical links. ETA is designed for unattended operation, allowing configuration and recording to be controlled remotely.	analog-to-digital converter;beamforming;black hole;computer cluster;data acquisition;field-programmable gate array;infiniband;input/output;low-voltage differential signaling;requirement;sampling (signal processing);sensor	Cameron D.

Recently, new challenges have emerged for current sensing in the upcoming era of nanosensors. Nanowires, carbon nanotubes and nanopores are emerging devices that have been proven to be effective in sensing ultra-low concentrations of target molecules [1]. For those devices, current sensing becomes challenging since outputs consist of signals in the pA range or less, in the kHz band. To measure these values, very low-noise front-end amplifiers are needed such as the one in [2]. It achieves a noise floor as low as 20fArms at 1kHz and it is designed for electrophysiology experiments, such as in patch clamp techniques, where single-ion channel recordings from cell membranes are required. However, the instrument is bulky and needs a cooled headstage to boost performance. An integrated solution offering quad current-input 20b analog-to-digital converters is reported in [3]. However, its measured equivalent input noise is above 700fArms at 1kHz.	amplifier;analog-to-digital converter;characteristic impedance;clamping (graphics);equivalent input;experiment;noise floor;sensor	Marco Bennati;Federico Thei;Michele Rossi;Marco Crescentini;Gennaro D'Avino;Andrea Baschirotto;Marco Tartagni	2009	2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977451	correlated double sampling;electronic engineering;capacitor;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;amplifier;noise reduction;nanosensor;infrasound;room temperature;bandwidth;biosensor	EDA	54.95004761941241	47.81411883331404	150580

Compared to other push-pull output buffers, the proposed output buffer has a smaller area and lower power consumption. Two complementary push-pull output buffers driving a pair of column lines realise a rail-to-rail driver. The output buffer has strong driving capability with push-pull function by the current positive feedback (CPF). Therefore the source driver can drive the pixel with two-dot inversion to decrease power consumption. On the other hand, the proposed output buffer with CPF can integrate the offset average to reduce the offset voltage. The performance is experimentally verified with a prototype chip that occupies a silicon area of 1700 x 260 μm 2  in a 0.35-μm 2P4M CMOS process.

The proposed architecture uses an integral sliding mode controller with a novel on-chip continuous current sensor. A full-bridge output stage is used to increase the output power, and an adaptive nonoverlapping-clock generation technique is presented to eliminate the short circuit current. Moreover, the switching frequency is chosen to achieve the highest possible linearity without efficiency degradation. The proposed architecture contains the minimum number of loop amplifiers to reduce quiescent current consumption. The proposed class-D audio amplifier has been implemented using 65-nm CMOS technology and operated from a single 2.7-V voltage supply (using thick oxide transistors) while occupying an active area of 0.31 mm2. Post-layout simulations show that the proposed architecture achieves a total harmonic distortion of 0.002% for a 2.2 Vpp 1-kHz input signal. It achieves a peak efficiency of 96% and a maximum output power of 400 mW at an 8-Ω differential load.	audio power amplifier;biasing;cmos;class-d amplifier;clock rate;elegant degradation;low-power broadcasting;network on a chip;short circuit;simulation;total harmonic distortion;transistor	Ahmed I.

Traditionally, negative capacitors and inductors have been implemented using negative-impedance converters (NICs) and negative-impedance inverters (NIIs). However, these NIC and NII circuits are prone to instabilities and excessive noise. In this article, we highlight a new perspective in realizing non-Foster reactive elements using negative-group-delay (NGD) networks. The underlying NGD networks are completely passive and thus stable. However, NGD are associated with some kind of loss (resistive or reflective) which can be compensated using amplifiers. The stable operation of these elements can lead to interesting antenna applications discussed in this paper.	amplifier;bode plot;characteristic impedance;group delay and phase delay;image noise;inverter (logic gate);national information infrastructure;network interface controller	Hassan Mirzaei;George V.

5bd01efdae848583f1cb68559fbc8ea742650d63	an overview of digital low drop-out regulator design		Digital Low Drop-out Regulator (D-LDO) has recently drawn significant attention due to its process scalability and application to low supply voltage operation. However, the response of a conventional D-LDO is determined by the sampling clock, and thus proportional to the power consumption. Hence recent trends for D-LDO design is to break this power-speed tie.

Including the most positive jitter and the most negative jitter, the worst case jitters can be calculated through the proposed approach. In a case-study, by applying the proposed TDC circuit with 4-bit flash ADC and the accumulated period N=8, the frequency range of the measured signal, resolution and linearity error are 0.7-1.4GHZ, 44ps and 1.25%, respectively.

4daf57e42e20da99f35f4ca79ca48d0ce5e67d71	a fully electronically controllable schmitt trigger and duty cycle-modulated waveform generator	cidita;triangular square wave generator;sawtooth wave generator;schmitt trigger	SummaryrnThe paper introduces a new Schmitt trigger consisting of only one multiple-output current inverting differential input transconductance amplifier with no passive element. The proposed circuit is simple and usable up to 100 MHz with the advantage of electronically controlled threshold levels and amplitude of the output. The circuit is also little sensitive to temperature and benefits from low power dissipation (0.5 mW). The amplitude of the output current is tunable electronically from 5 nA to 500 μA, which is a wide tunable range. The effects of transistors mismatch on proposed Schmitt trigger have also been explored. The utility of the proposed circuit is further justified through its application as a triangular/square wave generator, with a maximum frequency of 75 MHz. Duty cycle modulation through electronic means is also shown for the generator circuit, where duty cycle results for 80, 20, and 95% have been included, by varying external control current. The cadence VIRTUOSO simulation results by using generic process design kit 90-nm technology are shown to confirm the proposed theory. The proposed circuits are also verified through experimental results by using commercial integrated circuits: AD844 and LM13700. All the simulated and experimental results promise potential applications of the proposed circuits in instrumentation and communication systems.

The present mixer employs an anti-parallel diode pair (APDP) to fulfill a sub-harmonic mixing mechanism. Quasi-lumped components are employed to broaden the operational bandwidth and minimize the chip size to 1.5 0.77 mm. The conversion gain is optimized by a quasi-lumped 901 phase shift stub. Experimental results show that from 50 GHz to 70 GHz, the conversion gain varies between 12.1 dB and 15.2 dB with a LO power level of 10 dBm and 1 GHz IF. The LO-to-RF, LO-to-IF and RF-to-IF isolations are found to be greater than 19.5 dB, 21.3 dB and 25.8 dB, respectively. The second harmonic component of the LO signal is suppressed. The proposed mixer has an input 1 dB compression point of -2 dBm and exhibits outstanding figure-of-merits. & 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike conventional temperature sensors based on bandgap reference and ADC that consume large amount of power, the proposed sensor exploits the temperature dependence of the threshold voltage and carrier mobility of MOS transistors that affect the frequency of a ring oscillator. In order to maximize the temperature sensitivity and dynamic range, a supply voltage of 0.3V is used, which allows the oscillator to operate in subthreshold, near-threshold and above threshold region under different temperature conditions. In order to handle process variation, the frequency of the oscillator can be digitally trimmed by both a capacitor bank and stacked transistors. Measured data from 0.13-µm CMOS test chips indicate that the proposed temperature sensor has a resolution of 0.4°C/LSB with a 10-bit digital output code over a temperature range of 8°C to 85°C. At 10Hz of sampling frequency, the proposed sensor consumes 95nW and occupies 0.04mm2.	cmos;dynamic range;electron mobility;gnu nano;least significant bit;performance per watt;radio-frequency identification;ring oscillator;sampling (signal processing);sensor;transistor	Sunghyun Park;Changwook Min;Seonghwan Cho	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117965	radio-frequency identification;frequency drift;electronic engineering;voltage-controlled oscillator;telecommunications;vackář oscillator;engineering;electrical engineering;oscillation;local oscillator;quantum mechanics	EDA	59.10651989863572	47.48573394278482	152539

This proposal allows the converter to increase the resolution only introducing minor circuit modifications when processing input signals in the extended band or even in both bands concurrently is needed for different applications. The technique consists of boosting the signal in the extended band by modifying the signal transfer function of the converter and keeping the noise transfer function unaffected. An improvement of 6dB in the Signal-to-Noise Ratio is reached, which allows to maintain the order of the loop filter or the resolution of the quantizer, thus saving power consumption and silicon area.	algorithm;clock rate;coefficient;differential evolution;feedforward neural network;frequency band;full scale;human body weight;image scaling;instability;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);oversampling;quantization (signal processing);requirement;signal transfer function;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;smart data compression	Laura Conesa-Peraleja;Susana Patón;Dietmar Straeussnigg;Andreas Wiesbauer	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems (ICECS)	10.1109/ICECS.2016.7841273	electronic engineering;signal transfer function;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory	EDA	61.45144071082209	50.131674199329645	153181

Most conventional control algorithms cause numerical problems where data is collected at sampling rates that are substantially higher than the dynamics of the equivalent continuous-time operation that is being implemented. This is of relevant interest in applications of digital control, in which high sample rates are routinely dictated by the system stability requirements rather than the signal processing needs. Considerable recent progress in reducing the sample frequency requirements has been made through the use of non-uniform sampling schemes, so called ‘alias-free’ signal processing. The approach prompts the simplification of complex systems and consequently enhances the numerical conditioning of the implementation algorithms that otherwise, would require very high uniform sample rates. Such means of signal representation and analysis presents a variety of options and thus is being researched and practiced in a number of areas in communications. However, the control communities have not yet investigated the use of intentional non-uniform sampling, and hence the ethos of this research project is to investigate the effectiveness of such sampling regimes, in the context of exploiting the benefits. Digital control systems exhibit bandwidth limitations enforced by their closed-loop frequency requirements, the calculation delays in the control algorithm and the interfacing conversion times.

The Clapp architecture and its characteristics are reviewed, and the location of critical portions of the circuit such as the LC-tank and varactors is discussed. The use of a Clapp VCO topology allows a larger voltage swing, which improves spectral purity and phase noise. The use of a symmetrical inductor for differential operation results in a higher Q with lower area, while providing common-mode noise rejection. The VCO achieves a simulated phase noise of -98dBc/Hz @ 100kHz & -123.1dBc/Hz @ 1MHz offsets, and draws 5mA from a 1.8V power supply. A high tuning range of 18% and FOM of 189dBc/Hz are reported. Finally, system-level simulations of a frequency synthesizer for the IEEE 802.11a bands using the Clapp VCO are presented	cmos;clapp oscillator;frequency synthesizer;noise reduction;phase noise;power supply;purity (quantum mechanics);rejection sampling;simulation;voltage-controlled oscillator	Sudip Shekhar;Sankaran Aniruddhan;David J.

Supply voltage is aggressively scaled to reduce power, and the speed penalty resulting from low-voltage operation is overcome by multiplexing transmitter/receiver synchronized by low-rate multi-phase clocks. Phase spacing errors incurred by device mismatches are corrected using a self-calibration scheme. The proposed phase calibration method uses a single digital DLL to calibrate all the phases, which makes it insensitive to offsets in the calibrating DLL. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, energy efficiency and data rate of the prototype transceiver vary from 0.29 to 0.58 pJ/bit and 1 to 6 Gb/s, respectively, as the supply voltage changes from 0.45 to 0.7 V.	analog-to-digital converter;cmos;central processing unit;data rate units;dynamic voltage scaling;dynamic-link library;gigabyte;image scaling;low-power broadcasting;multiplexing;parallel computing;prototype;source-synchronous;transceiver;transmitter	Woo-Seok Choi;Guanghua Shu;Mrunmay Talegaonkar;Yubo Liu;Da Wei;Luca Benini;Pavan Kumar Hanumolu	2018	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2017.2786716	electronic engineering;control theory;voltage;transmitter;phase-locked loop;threshold voltage;transceiver;source-synchronous;computer science;cmos;multiplexing	Mobile	58.93868178830902	52.09250463472296	153493

It locks onto a 37-GHz input over a locking range of about 1.6 GHz (4.3%) and outputs a frequency of approximately 1GHz, which is sufficiently low for further division by a programmable divider. The high division ratio is realized by time-gating the superharmonic input signal and injecting it into a 9-stage ring VCO at 9 feeding points. Nine gating signals are generated by the ring VCO itself by logic operation such that the input signal is injected only during the correct time slice for each of the feeding points. The ILFD was fabricated using a 55-nm deeply depleted channel (DDC) CMOS process, occupies an area of 0.020 mm2, and consumes a power of 9.1 mW.

We show that the same implementation structure, as in the author's prior work but with modified gain values to account for the effect of flicker noise, can be used to achieve near-ideal jitter performance. A frequency domain analysis of the observer-controller loop filter is presented to provide a more intuitive understanding of the loop filter operation. The analysis shows that a system zero is introduced at dc to filter out the flicker noise and that the observer-controller based digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) remains effectively a second-order system regardless of the transport delay in the digital feedback loop. A comparison with conventional DPLL loop filter is also provided, which shows that in the presence of flicker noise, the jitter performance is even further improved than in the author's prior work.	arnold tongue;dpll algorithm;device configuration overlay;domain analysis;feedback;flicker noise;phase-locked loop	Won Namgoong	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2010.2048478	control engineering;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;delay-locked loop;control theory;phase noise;second-order logic	Visualization	64.40072499444328	49.82230073027259	155049
ebd86c29d131b970def4af7276753616ce8ea757	a 6.75–8.25-ghz −250-db fom rapid on/off fractional-n injection-locked clock multiplier		A rapid ON/OFF LC-based fractional-N injection-locked clock multiplier (ILCM) is presented. The proposed architecture extends the merits of ILCMs to fractional-N operation. It employs a high-resolution digital-to-time converter to align the injected pulses to the oscillator’s zero crossings. An all-digital frequency-tracking loop continuously tunes the oscillator free-running frequency toward the target output frequency. The proposed clock multiplier can be powered ON from a completely OFF state almost instantaneously. Background calibration techniques ensure that robust operation across process, voltage, and temperature. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS process with an active area of 0.27 mm2, the prototype ILCM generates output clock in the range of 6.75–8.25 GHz using a 115-MHz reference clock. It achieves integrated jitter performance of 109 fsrms (integer-N) and 177 fsrms (fractional-N), while consuming only 2.65 (integer-N) and 3.25 mW (fractional-N). This translates to the best-reported FoMJ of −255 (integer-N) and −250 dB (fractional-N). The turn-on time is less than 4 ns in both the integer- and fractional-N modes, illustrating almost instantaneous settling.	align (company);block cipher mode of operation;cmos;cpu multiplier;digital delay generator;electronic oscillator;ftl: faster than light;image resolution;infinite loop;instantaneous phase;lock (computer science);normalized frequency (unit);power cycling;prototype;settling time	Ahmed Elkholy;Ahmed Elmallah;Mostafa Gamal Ahmed;Pavan Kumar Hanumolu	2018	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2018.2810184	control theory;architecture;computer science;phase noise;injection locking;phase-locked loop;electronic engineering;cpu multiplier;jitter;frequency synthesizer;cmos	EDA	60.33263918097221	50.17249597440642	155096

While previous works focused on analog and hybrid digital/analog solutions, herein we consider fully digital solutions. Driven by the fact that at high frequencies energy consumption increases rapidly as a function of the analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converter resolution, we study the effectiveness at millimeter-wave frequencies of low-resolution implementations, where the converters are realized with only 2 or 3 bits. We carry out both an analytical and a simulation-based performance assessment, with both perfect and realistic channel estimation. Moreover, we compare the proposal with state-of-art analog and hybrid digital/analog schemes. The results show the effectiveness of the low-resolution converter approach, in particular in the low-SNR region, that is typical of millimeter-wave transmissions.	analog signal;analog-to-digital converter;beamforming;channel state information;digital-to-analog converter;hd radio;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation	N.

The event-based image sensor features a 64 × 64 pixel array and can also report standard analog intensity images. An ultra-wide-band radio channel allows to transmit digital temporal difference images wirelessly to a receiver with high rates and reduced power consumption. The sensor can wake up the radio when it detects a specific number of pixels intensity modulation, so that only significant frames are communicated. The prototype chip was implemented using a 2-poly 3-metal AMIS 0.5 μ m CMOS process.

Prior linearization schemes use the receiver chain to feed data to the baseband processor that adaptively adjusts the predistortion coefficients. The procedure is iterative, requires many test applications, is sensitive to receiver quality, and is not suitable for RF communication front ends in which the mixer, LNA and PA are dynamically reconfigured to adapt to changing operating conditions. In the proposed scheme, a single multi-sine diagnostic test is applied from the baseband, and the response of the transmitter is captured via a response envelope detector. A novel unified methodology for co-tuning predistortion coefficients along with the PA bias voltage based on response diagnosis is proposed, thereby, enabling the transmitter to operate at high efficiency and linearity.	audio power amplifier;baseband processor;biasing;coefficient;envelope detector;iterative method;low-noise amplifier;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;nonlinear system;radio frequency;transmitter	Rajarajan Senguttuvan;Abhijit Chatterjee	2007	25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)	10.1109/VTS.2007.12	transmitter;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;communications system	Arch	57.05753612900911	53.67392758330431	155532

6f9fc7f749b77f489a6fbee69efdf3c346da683c	a new cds structure for high density fpa with low power		Being an essential part of infrared readout integrated circuit, correlated double sampling (CDS) circuits play important roles in both depressing reset noise and conditioning integration signals. To adapt applications for focal planes of large format and high density, a new structure of CDS circuit occupying small layout area is proposed, whose power dissipation has been optimized by using MOSFETs in operation of subthreshold region, which leads to 720 nW. Then the noise calculation model is established, based on which the noise analysis has been carried out by the approaches of transfer function and numerical simulations using SIMULINK and Verilog-A. The results are in good agreement, demonstrating the validity of the present noise calculation model. Thermal noise plays a dominant role in the long wave situation while 1/f noise is the majority in the medium wave situation. The total noise of long wave is smaller than medium wave, both of which increase with the integration capacitor and integration time increasing.

It relies on the measurement of the average voltage drop across the PMOS-NMOS or dual-NMOS power stage. The average voltage drop is measured by a simple RC filter, as a difference between the power-stage average output voltage and the average output voltage of an auxiliary “ideal” power stage. Obtained voltage drop is applied to an element labeled as “composite load”. This approach allows to remove the dominant errors originating from the use of a standard sense-FET circuit. Obtained output current image exhibits very low linearity error <;1% in 10 mA to 2.1 A range, and high ±4% accuracy of the conversion gain over supply voltage, temperature and statistical chip-by-chip variations.

ce919af2f895f92dac7fabe57b3e15e5ee1061ff	pv cell characteristic extraction to verify power transfer efficiency in indoor harvesting system		A method is proposed to verify the efficiency of low-power harvesting systems based on Photovoltaic (PV) cells for indoor applications and a Fractional Open-Circuit Voltage (FOCV) technique to track the Maximum Power Point (MPP). It relies on an algorithm to reconstruct the PV cell Power versus Voltage (P-V) characteristic measuring the open circuit voltage and the voltage/current operating point but not the short-circuit current as required by state-of-the-art algorithms. This way the characteristic is reconstructed starting from the two values corresponding to standard operation modes of dc-dc converters implementing the FOCV Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technique. The method is applied to a prototype system: an external board is connected between the transducer and the dc-dc converter to measure the open circuit voltage and the voltage/current operating values. Experimental comparisons between the reconstructed and the measured P-V characteristics validate the reconstruction algorithm. Experimental results show the method is able to clearly identify the error between the transducer operating point and the one corresponding to the maximum power transfer, whilst also suggesting corrective action on the programmable factor of the FOCV technique. The proposed technique therefore provides a possible way of estimating MPPT efficiency without sampling the full P-V characteristic.	algorithm;cell (microprocessor);dc-to-dc converter;electronic circuit;goodyear mpp;low-power broadcasting;maximum power transfer theorem;operating point;page view;prototype;sampling (signal processing);series and parallel circuits;solar cell;transducer;while	Luca Perilli;Matteo Pizzotti;Eleonora Franchi;Roberto Canegallo	2018	2018 IEEE 23rd International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)	10.1109/CAMAD.2018.8515002	voltage;real-time computing;computer science;open-circuit voltage;operating point;low-power electronics;maximum power principle;photovoltaic system;electronic engineering;maximum power transfer theorem;maximum power point tracking	EDA	59.51447361439282	46.58346596673205	156095

Compared with the conventional compensation scheme, the proposed circuit can greatly boost the effective current multiplication factor by at least one order of magnitude without increasing any power consumption. Hence, the proposed circuit can generate an internal lower frequency zero and push parasitic poles toward extremely high frequency such that the loop bandwidth can be extended drastically. The required on-chip capacitance is reduced to 0.4 pF, comparing to 5 pF in the conventional compensation scheme. The slew rate at the gate drive of the LDO is also improved by the proposed error amplifier. Implemented in a 0.35 mum 2P4M CMOS process, the LDO with the proposed active-frequency compensation circuit consumes 27 muA ground current at 150-mA maximum output current with a dropout voltage of 200 mV. Experimental results show that the proposed LDO structure has achieved only 10% settling time of the conventional compensation scheme.	biasing;cmos;dropout (neural networks);error amplifier (electronics);frequency compensation;rc circuit;settling time;voltage regulator	Hung-Chih Lin;Hsiang-Han Wu;Tsin-Yuan Chang	2008	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2008.924366	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;cmos	EDA	62.04499418122521	48.065757549544706	156199

This result was achieved by using multi-stage cascode topology and a thin-film microstrip line based design. In addition, the frequency of operation can be easily adjusted within a wide range by changing the length of the matching network (by using focused ion beam or ultrasonic manipulator).

The proposed implementation exploits a non-linear voltage-controlled-oscillator (VCO) based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to perform the gamma correction during the analog-to-digital conversion. As a result, the quantization noise does not increase while the same high dynamic range of logarithmic image sensor is preserved. Moreover, by combining the gamma correction with the analog-to-digital conversion, the silicon area and overall power consumption can be greatly reduced. The proposed gamma correction scheme is validated by the reported simulation results and the experimental results measured for our designed test structure, which is fabricated with 0.35 μm standard complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process.	alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive cdisc version questionnaire;analog;analog-to-digital converter;approximation algorithm;biologic preservation;cmos;converter device component;gamma correction;high dynamic range;image sensor;nonlinear system;oscillator device component;quantization (signal processing);semiconductor;signal-to-noise ratio;silicon;simulation;very-large-scale integration;voltage-controlled oscillator;physical hard work;sensor (device);voltage	Yuan Cao;Xiaofang Pan;Xiaojin Zhao;Huisi Wu	2014		10.3390/s141224132	embedded system;electronic engineering;text mining;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;electrical engineering;image sensor;physics	EDA	57.04890650169068	49.8351196559845	156600

Trends in device technology and in packaging have necessitated a revision in conventional delay models. In particular, simple scalable models are needed to predict delays in the presence of uncorrelated power and ground noise. In this paper, we analyze the effect of such noise on signal propagation through a buffer and present simple, closed-form formulas to estimate the corresponding change of delay. The model captures both positive (slowdown) and negative (speedup) delay changes. It is consistent with short-channel MOSFET behavior, including carrier velocity saturation effects. An application shows that repeater chains using buffers instead of inherently faster inverters tend to have superior supply level-induced jitter characteristics.	integrated circuit;inverter (logic gate);scalability;software propagation;speedup;velocity (software development);very-large-scale integration	Lauren Hui Chen;Malgorzata Marek-Sadowska;Forrest Brewer	2002		10.1145/513918.514131	electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;signal processing;very-large-scale integration	EDA	64.80212395901415	49.11233019002311	156620

The precision of a filter bank depends on both the signal-path precision (i.e., dynamic range) and also the parameter precision (e.g., accuracy of the center frequencies). This brief presents a new bandpass filter for audio-frequency filter banks and provides a procedure for designing this filter. The filter is used in a 16-channel filter bank which has been fabricated in a 0.35- CMOS process. This filter bank has a dynamic range exceeding 62 dB and consumes only 63.6 when biased for speech frequencies. The filter bank's parameters are set via floating-gate current sources.

The injection-locking digitally-controlled oscillator (IL-DCO) replaces the crystal oscillator (XO), which leads to reduce energy consumption and system cost. It can detect whether injection locking occurs or not, and calibrates the frequency drift of DCO within 100 kHz accuracy over 100 degrees C temperature variation. The scalable divider-based double-FSK transmitter eliminates the necessity of power-consuming voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and direct digital synthesizer (DDS). The frequency calibration with IL-DCO and transmitter consumes 1 mW and 2 mW, respectively, with a data rate of 10 Mb/s, corresponding to energy consumption of 0.2 nJ per transmitted bit.	cmos;crystal oscillator;data rate units;device configuration overlay;digitally controlled oscillator;direct digital synthesizer;frequency drift;injection locking;lock (computer science);mebibyte;olpc xo;performance per watt;power inverter;scalability;transceiver;transmitter;virtual actor;voltage-controlled oscillator	Joonsung Bae;Kiseok Song;Hyungwoo Lee;Hyunwoo Cho;Hoi-Jun Yoo	2011	IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference 2011	10.1109/ASSCC.2011.6123632	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	59.75705793695074	52.60743503736112	157295

This paper reports the design and characterization of a highly linear THA fabricated in 90nm SiGe Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor technology with Effective Number of Bits>4.9. Improved linearity is achieved through feed-through cancelation techniques, peak cutoff frequency biasing and a differential layout. The circuit is tested over a wide input frequency range of 1-19GHz with a fixed clock frequency of 40GS/s. It exhibits Spurious Free Dynamic Range as high as 78dB, Total Harmonic Distortion less than -31dB and peak Input-referred 3rd order Intercept Point of 11.1dBm. The circuit has an input-referred 1dB compression point of 6dBm and consumes 560mW of power while occupying 0.03mm2 of active die area. The SFDR3 and THD3 performance is better than similar circuits published in Silicon, and comparable to InP circuits, which consume more DC power. These results are promising for future designs of fully integrated ultra high speed transceivers in Silicon technologies.	amplifier;biasing;clock rate;dynamic range;frequency band;heterojunction;secure digital;silicon-germanium;total harmonic distortion;transceiver;transistor	Deeksha Lal;Morteza Abbasi;David S.

Overall power and communication strategies depend largely on size constraints of the implant site. For extremely small implants, these systems generally call for permanently powering the implanted recording system without the use of a battery. Such systems are primarily based on low frequency and close proximity inductive links for power and communication [1]. Alternatively, in scenarios where the implant site is less constrained, the use of small batteries can provide increased communication range [2]. In this paper, we present a 20µW neural recording tag architecture that can be either remotely powered using a transponder-reader link or operated from a small battery for increased communication range. The key features that enable this increased system flexibility are the use of a supply current modulation strategy, minimizing average power consumption of the analog-front end (AFE) and allocating larger instantaneous power levels for amplification, processing, and communication, and an uplink communication scheme based on far-field backscattering or near-field load modulation with compatibility for both battery and remotely powered systems.	analog front-end;analog-to-digital converter;cmos;electroencephalography;experiment;modulation;telecommunications link;transponder;video-in video-out	Zhiming Xiao;Chun-Ming Tang;Christopher M.

The frequency response characteristics of DMS filters are governed primarily by their geometrical structures: the configurations of interdigital transducers (IDTs) and grating reflectors fabricated on piezoelectric substrates. For deciding suitable structures of DMS filters based on the computer simulation, the equivalent circuit models of IDT and grating reflector, which include several uncertain constant parameters, are usually used. In order to cope well with the designing imperfections caused by the inevitable dispersion of these constant parameters, the robust engineering, or the Taguchi method, is employed to evaluate the robustness of DMS filters. Then, because there is a trade-off relationship between the robustness of DMS filters and their ideal functions, the robust optimum design of DMS filters is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Furthermore, an efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, or revised NSGA-II, is used to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions of the problem.	acoustic cryptanalysis;computer simulation;equivalent circuit;evolutionary algorithm;frequency response;genetic algorithm;genetic operator;interdigital transducer;interrupt descriptor table;moea framework;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;numerical analysis;optimal design;optimization problem;pareto efficiency;piezoelectricity;robust optimization;signal-to-noise ratio;taguchi methods	Kiyoharu Tagawa;Norihiko Kojima	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation	10.1109/CEC.2006.1688580	equivalent circuit;computer simulation;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;computer science	Robotics	67.67681543152862	48.59143487440546	157804

This architecture guarantees a similar environment for all transistors in the array, while requiring a small number of pads for measurement. Moreover, the influence of the multiplexer switches can be evaluated: their unwanted contribution to the measurement can therefore be compensated. An experimental study to evaluate the influence of this multiplexer on measurement and the efficiency of the compensation is conducted.

The proposed power stage enables the regulator to maintain high power efficiencies under different input voltages caused by coupling variations. A fixed on-time regulation scheme is developed to minimize the switching power loss and to achieve small output ripple voltages of the regulator. Implemented in a standard 0.35-µm n-well CMOS process, the proposed regulator delivers a maximum output current of 10 mA and achieves the peak power efficiency of 82%. When the input voltage varies by 1.6 V, the power efficiency of the proposed regulator can be improved by 40% compared to that of the fixed-ratio 4× counterpart. The output ripple reaches 0.5% of the output voltage.	and gate;cmos;dc-to-dc converter;electronic circuit;performance per watt;power semiconductor device;ripple effect;switched capacitor;transistor;voltage regulation	Xiwen Zhang;Hoi Lee	2011	2011 IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC)	10.1109/CICC.2011.6055340	power supply rejection ratio;control engineering;voltage regulator;electronic engineering;electrical efficiency;switched capacitor;switched-mode power supply applications;power factor;power transmission;power control;engineering;78xx;electrical engineering;power supply unit;control theory;switched-mode power supply;low-dropout regulator;cmos;voltage optimisation;power optimizer	EDA	61.45166137826023	46.97629997468126	158053

To date, it has been difficult to achieve high resolution with pipelined ADCs operating at low voltages due to gain and nonlinearity constraints. Digital means of calibration have been suggested to correct opamp nonlinearity, relying on weakly nonlinear transfer functions with coefficients that may need a long time to measure accurately. Alternative types of ADCs that use no opamps, such as successive-approximation, time-domain, and comparator-based designs, have been gaining in popularity. In this paper we implement an inherently exact residue pipelining scheme that is not impaired by opamp gain and nonlinearity. Unlike other calibration methods that sort out errors after they occur, the proposed circuit performs no post analog or digital signal processing, as gain and nonlinearity errors are eliminated entirely at their very sources.	analog-to-digital converter;approximation;coefficient;comparator;digital signal processing;nonlinear system;operational amplifier;pipeline (computing);switched capacitor;transfer function	Yuichi Miyahara;Mitsuhiro Sano;Kazuo Koyama;Toshikazu Suzuki;Koichi Hamashita;Bang-Sup Song	2013	2013 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487736	operational amplifier;control engineering;electronic engineering;calibration;computer science;engineering;delta-sigma modulation;control theory;transfer function;integrated circuit design	EDA	60.91102954473496	50.137367575340726	158211

Three possible configurations are proposed: a simple circular array with one element driven and the others short-circuited, and two implementations of double-ring array. In the latter case, an inner ring of parasitic elements is added. Electronic steering is achieved through switching of the elements by circular permutation. The aim of the design is to obtain a desired radiation pattern, and to achieve impedance matching of the single active element. The arrays are simulated with the SuperNEC2.4 package and the induced emf method. Double-ring arrays offer better patterns and more accurate impedance matching than simple circular arrays at 1.8 GHz. The designed arrays achieve SWR values below 2.5 from 1.7 to 1.9 GHz. The radiation patterns remain satisfying in an average bandwidth equal to 6.5% of the carrier frequency.	genetic algorithm	Pantelis K. Varlamos;Panagiotis J. Papakanellos;Christos N.

Among all performance degradation contributors, phase noise and time jitter are particularly troublesome since they cause random errors which are difficult to compensate. The local oscillator in the receiver front end is a major contributor of phase noise, while the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) introduces time jitter. It is desired to know the accumulated effect of individual phase noise sources and time jitter. The total effect of all phase noise and jitter can be represented by an accumulated phase noise term at the ADC's output, called total phase noise (TPN) in this brief. The focus of this work is on measuring and modeling TPN in the RF receiver by applying optimization techniques. In contrast to traditional phase noise measurement that typically requires a high-quality tunable downconverter, a digital approach using the data captured directly by the RF receiver is proposed. In addition, iterative optimization-based TPN spectral model fitting and statistic modeling are introduced. The model is examined using the measured TPN. It is confirmed that the RF receiver TPN can be viewed as a wide-sense stationary zero-mean Gaussian process with certain spectral profile.	analog-to-digital converter;curve fitting;elegant degradation;gaussian process;heterodyne;iterative method;local oscillator;mathematical optimization;phase noise;radar;radio frequency;stationary process	Terry N.

Proper signal and clock distribution along the multiple channels are utilized to mitigate interchannel bandwidth and timing mismatches. A digitally assisted calibration is introduced to remove the interchannel offset, gain, and timing mismatch. The T-type bootstrapped sampling switches minimize the interchannel crosstalk among top-plate sampling SAR channels and the signal-dependent leakage current during SAR conversion cycles. The power efficiency of this ADC is significantly improved by many design techniques. The merged capacitor switching algorithm leads to high switching efficiency and a smaller area. The modified reference voltage scheme optimizes input common-mode voltage of the comparators. The optimal subradix-2 capacitive DAC results in low-power reference buffers and higher conversion speed. This ADC achieves 49-dB SNR, 52-dB THD, and 42-dB SNDR up to Nyquist frequency at 5 GS/s, consumes 76 mW from 1 V supply, and occupies 0.57 mm $^{{ {2}}}$  in 28 nm CMOS technology. The implemented architecture also demonstrates high scalability to advanced CMOS technology nodes and has even higher power efficiency potential.	algorithm;cmos;comparator;crosstalk;die shrink;low-power broadcasting;network switch;nyquist frequency;performance per watt;roland gs;sinadr;sampling (signal processing);scalability;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;successive approximation adc;symmetric multiprocessing;total harmonic distortion	Jie Fang;Shankar Thirunakkarasu;Xuefeng Yu;Fabian Silva-Rivas;Chaoming Zhang;Frank Singor;Jacob A.

10111f65b815ae82096137594a9e52b67cf38acd	a flexible printed radio frequency direction finder using carbon nanotube field effect transistors		An inkjet printed radio frequency direction finder is presented in this paper for use in wearable electronics. The device is used to receive an alert signal from a high frequency source in its immediate proximity. The goal is to alert the person of a sudden accident or alert that could be dangerous and requires a quick response. Two loop antennas were used in a Watson-Watt configuration to receive the wave forms. The angle of arrival was estimated using a differential amplifier. This amplifier was used to compare the amplitude of two input channels. The differential amplifier was fabricated by printing two carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNTFET) on a flexible substrate. Measurement of the circuit showed that a 90° change in the angle of arrival created a 10 mV amplitude change in output.	angle of arrival;differential amplifier;field effect (semiconductor);polyethylene terephthalate;printing;radio direction finder;radio frequency;thomas j. watson research center;transistor;wearable computer	Reza Kamali-Sarvestani;Brandon Wright;James Voorheis	2018	2018 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2018.8351779	field-effect transistor;oscilloscope;electronic engineering;radio frequency;amplitude;computer science;carbon nanotube field-effect transistor;differential amplifier;amplifier;electrical engineering;angle of arrival	Arch	62.76417391103111	55.23784654182412	159112

Still, if using the charge-sharing principle, a SAR ADC may employ MOS transistors used as capacitors (MOSCAPs) as DAC elements, benefiting from their higher capacitance density and broader availability. In this work, we exploit the body terminal of these MOSCAPs to adjust their capacitance and correct process mismatches. A background self-calibration scheme is presented and validated in a 12-bit 10 MSps SAR ADC. Post-layout simulations show that the algorithm is able to increase the effective-resolution of the ADC to 11.7 bits, in average. With a power consumption of 210 μW, the ADC achieves a figure of merit of 6.3 fJ/conversion-step. The presented ADC uses only 240 × 120 μm2 of active area, including the calibration logic. Still, the deterministic calibration algorithm converges in less than 30k conversions. The achieved results make the proposed architecture very competitive for the range of moderate-resolution moderate-speed ADCs.	12-bit;algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;biasing;charge sharing;simulation;successive approximation adc;transistor	Taimur Gibran Rabuske;Jorge R.

The analysis and implementation of the CA-TIA are experimentally validated.	cmos;certificate authority;characteristic impedance;experiment;feedforward neural network;input impedance;optical wireless;television interface adaptor;transimpedance amplifier	Roger Yubtzuan Chen;Zong-Yi Yang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2365462	video feedback;fully differential amplifier;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;noise;electrical engineering;transimpedance amplifier;cmos;direct-coupled amplifier;radio frequency;bandwidth;wireless	Visualization	61.64964089082954	53.441160336867135	159556

Mobile battery-operated devices require small-size tuners that consume low power and are amenable to single-chip integration with the baseband demodulator. Following an overview of the system and circuit-level implementation challenges of mobile TV standards such as DVB-H and T-DMB, this article presents a dual-band direct conversion tuner for DVB-H. Architecture and circuit trade-offs are discussed, and detailed measurements are presented. The tuner occupies 9.7 mm2 and achieves a 4 dB NF at both UHF and L-band, eliminating the need for an external LNA. By using a fractional-TV synthesizer both 470-890 MHz and 1.4-1.8 GHz bands are supported, while achieving an integrated phase noise of less than -41 dBc.

The DVFM control system monitors the external clock and changes the supply voltage and the body bias so as to achieve a significant reduction in energy. The behavioral model of the proposed DVFM control system algorithm is described and simulated in HDL using delay and energy parameters obtained through SPICE simulation. The frequency range dictated by an external controller is 100 MHz to I GHz. The supply voltage of the complete memory system is varied in steps of 50 mV over the range of 500 mV to IV. The threshold voltage range of operation is plusmn100 mV around the nominal value, achieving 83.4% energy reduction in the active mode and 86.7% in the stand-by mode. This paper also proposes a energy replica that is used in the energy monitor subsystem of the DVFM system.	algorithm;behavioral modeling;control system;erewhon;frequency band;hardware description language;spice;simulation;sleep mode;static random-access memory	I Shareef MohammedShareef;Pradeep R.

By using a traditional β multiplier reference to detect the signal envelope, followed by a Schmitt trigger and a load driver, the large off-chip capacitor in traditional ASK demodulators is not required any more. Therefore, the proposed circuit possesses small area to be integrated in an SOC chip. Besides, due to the lack of the large capacitor, the proposed circuit can operate with a higher data rate using lower frequency carriers. The proposed circuit is integrated in an implantable micro-stimulator on silicon using 0.35 μm 2P4M CMOS process. The area of the proposed circuit occupies merely 0.039 mm2 with a maximum power dissipation of less than 12 mW (including the power consumption of the analog circuits of the micro-stimulator) by measurement results on silicon. Moreover, the measurement results verify that the proposed ASK demodulator can detect the ASK modulated signal up to 570 kbps data rate at 2 MHz carrier frequency when the modulation index is 10%.	amplitude-shift keying;analogue electronics;british informatics olympiad;cmos;carrier frequency;data rate units;maximum power transfer theorem;modulation;schmitt trigger;system on a chip	Chua-Chin Wang;Tzung-Je Lee;U.

The characteristic property of less operations per second of the polyphase structure is exploited in the design of NMDFB. Besides this, the inherent property of zero folding noise, makes NMDFB as an ideal choice for all high resolution wideband radio astronomy signal processing. It is shown that the proposed channelizer offers significant reduction in the number of multipliers, number of operations per second and low power consumption when compared to the existing VLBI channelizer.	flops;filter bank;image resolution;polyphase quadrature filter;signal processing	Sudhi Sudharman;T.

Thereby a field programmable transistor array (FPTA) is used as the analog substrate for testing the candidate solutions. The FPTA features 256 programmable transistors, whose channel geometry and routing can be configured to form a large variety of transistor level analog circuits. A series of experiments reveals that variations of the output voltage range influence evolution's success more severely than varying the amount of available electronic resources or the geometrical setup. Although a considerable number of runs yield converters with a nonlinearity of less than 1 bit, no DAC is found to maintain a nonlinearity of less than 0.5 bits under worst case conditions, as required for a true 6-bit resolution. While the evolved circuits work comparably well at different time scales as well as on different dice, they lack the ability to abstract from the analog voltage levels of the digital input signals. It is experimentally verified that this can be remedied by inserting digital buffers at the circuits' inputs.	1-bit architecture;analogue electronics;best, worst and average case;cmos;die (integrated circuit);digital data;digital rights management;digital-to-analog converter;evolution;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;field-programmable gate array;fitness function;flaw hypothesis methodology;microsoft outlook for mac;nonlinear system;randomness;routing;transistor array	Jörg Langeheine;Karlheinz Meier;Johannes Schemmel;Martin A Trefzer	2004	Proceedings. 2004 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware, 2004.	10.1109/EH.2004.1310804	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	63.55928441423171	49.04310211949133	160900

476dde19d20aa04cc8342957faa85963f6b2e877	a sftd algorithm for optimizing the performance of the readout strategy of residence time difference fluxgate	rtd fluxgate;noise reduction algorithm;time–frequency transformation	Residence time difference (RTD) fluxgate sensor is a potential device to measure the DC or low-frequency magnetic field in the time domain. Nevertheless, jitter noise and magnetic noise severely affect the detection result. A novel post-processing algorithm for jitter noise reduction of RTD fluxgate output strategy based on the single-frequency time difference (SFTD) method is proposed in this study to boost the performance of the RTD system. This algorithm extracts the signal that has a fixed frequency and preserves its time-domain information via a time⁻frequency transformation method. Thereby, the single-frequency signal without jitter noise, which still contains the ambient field information in its time difference, is yielded. Consequently, compared with the traditional comparator RTD method (CRTD), the stability of the RTD estimation (in other words, the signal-to-noise ratio of residence time difference) has been significantly boosted with sensitivity of 4.3 μs/nT. Furthermore, the experimental results reveal that the RTD fluxgate is comparable to harmonic fluxgate sensors, in terms of noise floor.

8bce888cb2ac7093e4c5fcd7874cc3dc8caa0a6f	a low-power, high-accuracy capacitance-to-time converter for differential capacitive sensors		A low-power and high-accuracy switched-capacitor (SC) capacitance-to-time (C/T) converter used as an interface for differential capacitive sensors is presented. The propagation delays of the comparator do not directly have effect on the accuracy, but the difference between rising propagation delays of the comparator for two reference voltages does. Lower power consumption can be attained without causing the reduction of conversion accuracy, because of the design constraints on the operational speed of a comparator can be relaxed. Performances of the proposed circuit are simulated by HSPICE using 0.18 micrometers CMOS process parameters. Simulated results have demonstrated that the gain error is 0.0087 % and the maximum nonlinear error is 0.027 % of the full scale. The power consumption of the proposed circuits is 25.6 microwatts for 1.8 V supply voltage. The proposed circuit is suited for co-integration with MEMS-type sensors and microcontroller-based measurement system.	analog-to-digital converter;cmos;comparator;full scale;global serializability;integrated circuit;low-power broadcasting;microcontroller;microelectromechanical systems;nonlinear system;performance;propagation delay;prototype;spice 2;sensor;software propagation;switched capacitor;system of measurement	Satomi Ogawa	2017	2017 IEEE 8th Latin American Symposium on Circuits & Systems (LASCAS)	10.1109/LASCAS.2017.7948041	electronic engineering;control engineering;comparator;capacitive sensing;electronic circuit;propagation delay;computer science;full scale;comparator applications;capacitance;cmos	EDA	59.25949114428954	47.43387087975674	161195

The geometries are complex, narrow conductor cross-sections and long loops located close to materials sensitive to electromagnetic interaction, when integrated, make the application of analytical coupling formulations inapplicable, even when it comes down to non-linear relations forced by ferrite shielding. Commercial finite element (FEM) solvers are powerful, but they do not serve the needs of NFC applications due to complexity, inadequateness and code obscuration. An intensive open source code investigation has identified one alternative solver which is capable to deal with all NFC RFID related coupling effects one can imagine. Automated scripts, the tool-chain, and geometry macros have been developed for rapid prototyping of such. Amongst other open source tools listed, the ElmerFEM solver is the most promising solver for linear and non-linear quasi-static electro-magnetic (EM) NFC problems. The solver has a powerful interface and delivers results close to reality even when computational complexity is a trade of physical resolution and memory capacity of standard commercial workstations.	computational complexity theory;computer-aided design;ferrite (magnet);finite element method;linux;maxima and minima;microsoft windows;near field communication;nonlinear system;open-source software;rapid prototyping;simulation;solver;toolchain;video post-processing;workstation	Ulrich Muehlmann;Michael Gebhart;Markus Wobak	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on RFID-Technologies and Applications (RFID-TA)	10.1109/RFID-TA.2012.6404553	embedded system;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;ferrite;operating system;finite element method;cad;near field communication;computational complexity theory;public domain software	Robotics	64.65037985772521	59.23080408272775	161362

The achieved linearity (IIP3) for the whole down-conversion chain is better than 11.06dBm for 5.8dB gain at 60GHz. Gain can be adjusted from -15dB to 11dB in 1dB steps depending on the signal level. By adjusting phase matching at RF input and the common-mode impedance of the mixer with a variable transmission line, the input phase imbalance can be corrected and the second-order distortion (HD2) can be reduced. The LO/RF isolation is 43dB and the LO/IF isolation is better than 82dB. The down-converter occupies 1.38mm2 in 32nm CMOS SOI and consumes 19.2mW from 1V supply. The power consumption of the mixer itself is 4mW @ 1V supply.	cmos;characteristic impedance;distortion;radio frequency;signal-to-noise ratio;silicon on insulator;third-order intercept point;transmission line	Mihai A.

The VCO is sampled by the reference clock without using a frequency divider and an amplitude controlled charge pump is used which is inherently insensitive to mismatch. The main remaining source of the VCO reference spur is the periodic disturbance of the VCO by the sampling at the reference frequency. The underlying VCO sampling spur mechanisms are analyzed and their effect is minimized by using dummy samplers and isolation buffers. A duty-cycle-controlled reference buffer and delay-locked loop (DLL) tuning are proposed to further reduce the worst case spur level. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spur reduction techniques, a 2.21 GHz PLL is designed and fabricated in 0.18 μm CMOS technology. While using a high loop-bandwidth-to-reference-frequency ratio of 1/20, the reference spur measured from 20 chips is <; -80 dBc. The PLL consumes 3.8 mW while the in-band phase noise is -121 dBc/Hz at 200 kHz and the output jitter integrated from 10 kHz to 100 MHz is 0.3psrms.	arnold tongue;best, worst and average case;cmos;charge pump;charge sharing;delay-locked loop;dummy variable (statistics);duty cycle;frequency divider;modulation;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;phase detector;phase noise;phase-locked loop;ps (unix);ripple effect;sampling (signal processing);voltage-controlled oscillator;waveform	Xiang Gao;Eric A.

In this paper, we show that this conventional method suffers from artifacts due to quantization noise which adversely affects the real-time and precise convergence to the desired parameters. We propose a ΣΔ based gradient-descent learning that can noise-shape the quantization noise during the adaptation procedure and in the process achieve faster convergence compared to the conventional quantized gradient-descent approach. We also show that when the analog circuits suffer from non-linearities and non-monotonic response of the calibration DACs, the proposed algorithm is still able to find the optimal system solution without getting trapped into local minima. Using measured results obtained from prototype fabricated in a 0.5-μm CMOS process, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm for the task of: (a) compensating and tracking of offset parameters; and (b) calibration of the center frequency of a sub-threshold gm-C biquad filter.	algorithm;analogue electronics;cmos;digital signal processor;digital-to-analog converter;electronic filter topology;emoticon;gradient descent;integrated circuit;maxima and minima;prototype;quantization (signal processing);real-time clock	Ravi Krishna Shaga;Shantanu Chakrabartty	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271916	mixed-signal integrated circuit;frequency modulation;control engineering;electronic engineering;calibration;convergence;telecommunications;analogue electronics;analog signal;computer science;control theory;cmos	EDA	63.58086872114215	49.96763162908666	162921

The variable inductor, consisting of a transformer and a variable resistor, is tunable by adjusting its resistor. By employing the proposed frequency tuning scheme, wide-tuning range as well as multi-band operation are achieved without sacrificing their operating frequencies. To verify the operation principles, the VCO and DCO are both fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology. The tuning range of VCO is from 52.2 GHz to 61.3 GHz. The measured phase noise from a 61.3-GHz carrier is about - 118.75 dBc/Hz at 10-MHz offset, and the output power is -6.6 dBm. It dissipates 8.7 mW from a 0.7-V supply, and the chip size is 0.28×0.36mm2. On the other hand, the DCO is capable of covering frequency range from 37.6 GHz to 43.4 GHz.

The stability prediction for the maximum stable input limits for eighth- and tenth-order (i.e., effective fourth- and fifth-order) inverse-Chebyshev- and Butterworth-based BP Σ-Δ modulators for different stopband attenuation and bandwidths are established. The theoretical results are shown to be in good agreement with the simulation results for a variety of input amplitudes, bandwidths, and modulator orders. The proposed mathematical models of the quantizer will immensely help speed up the design of higher order BP Σ-Δ modulators.	1-bit architecture;butterworth filter;chebyshev filter;mathematical model;modulation;numerical stability;quantization (signal processing);rf modulator;simulation	Gunes D.

The theory was further investigated by doing experiments using mu A741 and TL071 as op-amps and CA3096 transistors as the current mirrors of the CMIA. Both theoretical and practical investigations proved that both the dc and ac performances of CMRR depend on the matching status of parameters such as CMRR, open-loop gain A, gain-bandwidth product GB, and the output resistance R O of the input op-amps of the CMIA. It has also been shown that, in the CMIA, unlike the voltage-mode instrumentation amplifier, voltage gain is independent of the bandwidth.	experiment;gain–bandwidth product;instrumentation amplifier;output impedance;performance;power supply;rejection sampling;transistor	Seyed Javad Azhari;Hossein Fazlalipoor	2009	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2008.2005559	common-mode rejection ratio;electronic engineering;current mirror;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory	Visualization	63.28251180197699	50.884208854336286	163335

The die area consumption of commonly used ADC architectures is surveyed. Based on trends observed in a large set of empirical data, the area normalized to number of effective quantization steps is proposed as a generic measure of area efficiency. It is seen that state-of-the-art absolute area has a strong correlation with resolution and CMOS node, whereas the proposed measure does not. The state-of-the-art envelopes for normalized area vs. speed, resolution and noise-floor are extracted for each analyzed architecture.

The previous wave-pipeline technique bypasses the portion of feedback loop, and thereby relaxes the timing restriction of the critical path up to two shifting clock periods. While the generator operates at the 48% higher frequency (4- Gb/s) than the conventional one (2.7-Gb/s), there is a low operating frequency limit. Therefore, we propose an improved wave-pipeline technique which enables to operate in the extended frequency range from 0 ~ 1.85-Gb/s and 2.56 ~ 3.57- Gb/s by function of detecting a sequence error and switching from the normal mode to the wave-pipeline mode. Thus, the generator has achieved the 32% higher maximum operating frequency (3.57-Gb/s) than the conventional one.	bitstream;cmos;clock rate;critical path method;feedback;frequency band;gigabyte;low-power broadcasting;normal mode;pseudorandom binary sequence;sensor	Masahiro Sasaki;Makoto Ikeda;Kunihiro Asada	2007	2007 14th IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ICECS.2007.4511044	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	EDA	59.099465917020744	51.634790621650595	163413

The DAC has been designed in 0.18 μm CMOS n-well technology provided by National Semiconductor. The 10-bit DAC is segmented as 5+5, where the 5-LSB bits are implemented in binary and the 5-MSB bits are implemented in unary architecture. The matching of the unit current sources plays an important role in determining the overall linearity of the DAC. Static linearity of the DAC can be improved by using larger area of the current source transistors, sacrificing the dynamic performances. At high frequency the spectral performance of the DAC degrades due to the increased parasitic. In this work the current sources are designed with optimum sizes to achieve improved static as well as dynamic performances. In simulation, the DAC achieves a maximum DNL of 0.248 LSB and a maximum INL of 0.440 LSB. The DAC achieves a maximum spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of 59.79 dB for 5.37 MHz signal in mismatch environment at 500 MSPS sampling rate. The DAC shows a Nyquist SFDR of 57 dB at 500 MSPS sampling rate with mismatch. The DAC consumes only 17.85 mW of power for Nyquist signal at 500 MSPS sampling rate with 1.8 V supply.	bitwise operation;cmos;current source;digital-to-analog converter;least significant bit;noise reduction;nyquist rate;performance;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor;simulation;spurious-free dynamic range;transistor;unary operation	Santanu Sarkar;Swapna Banerjee	2015	2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI	10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.87	embedded system;differential nonlinearity;electronic engineering;integral nonlinearity;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	59.3572825665164	50.840653911340986	163429

6abfb6fc7a8e130c14152b9f8b9c07ed3d234cc5	mismatch resilient 3.5-bit mdac with mcs-cfcs		Modern data converters architectures like pipeline ADC and Current steering DAC depend on component matching to achieve desired resolution. They consist of large arrays of capacitors/current sources that are highly susceptible to systematic effects arising from process variations and temperature gradients. On top of it, 3D integration of mixed signal ICs adjacent to digital chips makes the arrays are prone to local gradients and hot spots. This makes incorporation of certain error compensation schemes at a layout level a priority. In this work, we have proposed an arraying technique that simultaneously compensates for systematic effects and perform significantly better in the presence of rotated parabolic gradients and localized hotspots. We further propose a modified switching scheme that enables realization of 3.5-bit CFCS decoder circuit with minimum logic gates and delay. The performance of the proposed array integrated with the modified switching scheme is verified on the model of a 16-bit 10Msps pipelined ADC using Matlab. The simulation results show significant improvement of linearity (~6-12 dB) over the existing techniques. The various design challenges and strategies to overcome them are discussed in detail.	16-bit;analog-to-digital converter;current source;digital signal processing;gradient;hotspot (wi-fi);logic gate;matlab;mixed-signal integrated circuit;multi categories security;parabolic antenna;pipeline (computing);simulation;three-dimensional integrated circuit	Satyajit Mohapatra;Hari Shanker Gupta;Nihar Ranjan Mohapatra	2018	2018 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)	10.1109/ISVLSI.2018.00041	capacitor;mixed-signal integrated circuit;parabola;linearity;decoding methods;logic gate;electronic engineering;computer science	EDA	54.49928403386996	50.434376528362236	163861

Unlike conventional phase-locked loop closed-loop modulation, very wide-bandwidth arbitrary phase modulation can be synthesized at the phase-locked loop output by selecting the desired phases that are generated by a phase generator. To further reduce the phase quantization noise due to the finite number of available phases, a phase quantization noise cancellation path is proposed through a second VCO control port. At least 7 dB phase noise cancellation was demonstrated using a prototype 0.18 μm CMOS 2.4 GHz GFSK transmitter integrated circuit. Measurements on the prototype show that out-of-band phase quantization noise is 49 dB lower than the signal when transmitting 20 Mb/s GFSK signal and that the rms error is only 3.2%. The current consumption is 34.5 mA excluding the transmitter output buffer.	arnold tongue;audio power amplifier;cmos;distributed bragg reflector;emoticon;integrated circuit;mebibyte;modulation;out-of-band agreement;phase noise;phase-locked loop;prototype;quantization (signal processing);transmitter;voltage-controlled oscillator	Pin-En Su;Sudhakar Pamarti	2011	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2010.2099450	transmitter;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;quantization;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	62.468384114630574	53.20865290923414	164129
60c085ad0b6d2804ab0d7e6690f0c4a822dcb22e	effect of different varactor models on antenna tunability		This paper explains why antennas can achieve limited frequency tunability by mounting varactor diodes across slots. The reason is that majority of varactors have a resistance in parallel to the variable capacitor. Resistance mainly acts as a short and thereby the varactor loses its capacitive behavior at low frequencies ∼ 2 GHz. At higher frequencies, the varactor retains its capacitive effect. Simulations and calculations are done for various configurations of the varactor to investigate the effect of capacitance, resistance and series inductance on tunability and on the capacitive impedance of the varactor. A cedar shape antenna [1] is used in simulations, as it possesses many possibilities for placing the varactors.	capacitive sensing;characteristic impedance;computer simulation;diode;mesa	Mervat Madi;Karim Y.

It utilizes the supply-boosting technique (SBT) in order to reduce power consumption and allow ultra low-voltage operation. The pixel supply voltage as well as the pixel reset and select signals were boosted to achieve wider and extended linear operating ranges. A CMOS image sensor containing a 54 × 50 array of 3T CMOS APS pixels was fabricated in a standard 2P3M 5-V 0.5- μm CMOS process to confirm the effectiveness of each boosting operation. Theory, simulation, and measurement results are presented. The boosting pixel supply voltage during pixel readout provides additional 31% dynamic range improvement on top of the seven times (7×) expansion attained by boosting the pixel reset signal. It was shown that the proposed boosted readout does not increase the number of transistors in the 3T CMOS APS pixels nor degrade the image quality.	active pixel sensor;cmos;dynamic range;image quality;image scaling;image sensor;input/output;intel matrix raid;low-power broadcasting;session-based testing;simulation;transistor	Suat U.

b47aae835002f5bf91cf63e918626f1a317bb63e	a k-band low-noise bipolar class-c vco for 5g backhaul systems in 55nm bicmos technology		Abstract The development of 5G communication systems is underway. When employing 64 QAM, very low phase noise levels are required to limit EVM - i.e. less than −117 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset from f = 20 GHz. In this paper, the challenges of achieving such a low phase noise are discussed in detail. The choice between CMOS vs BJT devices is investigated and the impact of the base resistance intrinsic in BJT-based VCOs is addressed. BJT-based VCO shows ∼2 dB better phase noise when compared to CMOS-based VCO and low supply is employed. When higher supply is leveraged, BJT-based VCO advantage is kept while CMOS-based VCO is not able to reach the targeted tuning range due to thick-oxide devices parasitics. Emphasis is on the minimization of L/Q inductor versus quality factor ratio, to further minimize phase noise. Prototypes in a 55 nm BiCMOS technology were operated at 2.5 V supply with the largest amplitude allowed by reliability constraints. Measurements show a phase noise as low as −119 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz from a 20 GHz carrier offset with a tuning range (TR) of 19% and FoM = −187 dBc/Hz. Power consumption is 56 mW. To the best of authorsu0027 knowledge, the presented VCO shows the lowest reported phase noise among state-of-the-art BiCMOS VCOs with TRu003e10%.	backhaul (telecommunications);bicmos;cmos;modulation;phase noise;voltage-controlled oscillator	Niccolo Lacaita;Matteo Bassi;Andrea Mazzanti;Francesco Svelto	2017	2017 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting (BCTM)	10.1016/j.vlsi.2018.04.009	computer science;electronic engineering;quadrature amplitude modulation;bicmos;bipolar junction transistor;amplitude;phase noise;parasitic extraction;voltage-controlled oscillator;cmos	EDA	63.21883172900538	52.70472496105217	164851

We detail the first investigative attempt on the CMOS analog VLSI implementation of a recently proposed network formalism, which introduces time-derivative ‘diffusion’ between CNN cells for nonseparable spatiotemporal filtering applications—the temporal-derivative CNNs (TDCNNs). The reported circuit consists of an array of Gm-C filters arranged in a regular pattern across space. We show that the state–space coupling between the Gm-C-based array elements realizes stable and linear first-order (temporal) TDCNN dynamics. The implementation is based on linearized operational transconductance amplifiers and Class-AB current mirrors. Measured results from the investigative prototype chip that confirms the stability and linearity of the realized TDCNN are provided. The prototype chip has been built in the AMS 0.35 m CMOS technology and occupies a total area of 12.6 mm sq, while consuming 1.2 W per processing cell. Copyright 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

At the same time, optimum power consumption points can be chosen from different biasing schemes. The detector has small area overhead with low frequency output. The sampled output waveform is analyzed using an FFT. The low frequency measurements are directly used to calculate the circuit specifications, without requiring learning steps. The technique was used to measure the performance parameters of a 940 MHz to 40 MHz down conversion mixer in a RF receiver front-end test chip, fabricated in a commercial 0.18$\mu$m CMOS process. The tuning algorithm was implemented in the Labview environment, and tuning knobs on board were used for biasing and control optimization. Results show that the approach can provide accurate calibration of specifications and power for real RF chips.	algorithm;biasing;cmos;canonical account;fast fourier transform;feedback;labview;linear model;machine learning;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;online and offline;overhead (computing);power optimization (eda);radio frequency;waveform	Chaoming Zhang;Ranjit Gharpurey;Jacob A.

Two complementary differential amplifiers to drive a pair of column lines are used to realize a rail-to-rail drive. The circuit achieves the large driving capability by employing a simple comparator to sense the transients of the input to turn on an auxiliary driving transistor, which is statically off in the stable state. This increases the speed without increasing static power consumption.

The newly designed charge-pump circuit is composed of two differential inputs, the signals of UP and DN from the PFD, and an op-amp that matches between the upper current and the lower current. If the two currents are matched in charge-pump there is a low ripple voltage, which is VCO control voltage. The new charge pump circuit has a good immunity from MOSFET width and length variation. Also, we build the differential current driving output buffer for high speed signal processing on a chip. In the newly designed output buffer circuits, the push-pull source follower is added to the previous differential current driving output buffer. As the result, the jitter characteristic has been improved. The PLL with current matching charge-pump has been designed by 0.18͘m one-poly four metal CMOS technology and simulated by HSPICE. From the simulation results, it is shown that the VCO control voltage is at least 0.6mV.	cmos;charge pump;operational amplifier;phase frequency detector;phase-locked loop;ripple effect;spice 2;signal processing;simulation;transmitter;voltage-controlled oscillator	Jaehong Ko;Wookwan Lee;Soo-Won Kim	2005		10.1145/1057661.1057691	chip;control engineering;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;charge pump;jitter;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;signal processing;control theory	EDA	63.08921128013221	48.75627158083065	165661

The accuracy of a Flash ADC is mainly limited by the random offsets of preamplifiers and comparators. This paper presents a 5-b Flash ADC with a digital random offset calibration scheme. For calibration, programmable resistive devices are used as the loading devices of the second-stage preamplifiers. By adjusting the calibration resistors, the input-referred offset voltage of each comparator is reduced to be less than 1/2 LSB. Fabricated in a 0.13-¿m CMOS process, experimental results show that the ADC consumes 120 mW from a 1.2-V supply and occupies a 0.18- mm2 active area. After calibration, the peak differential non-linearity (DNL) and integral non-linearity (INL) are 0.24 and 0.39 LSB, respectively. At 3.2-GS/s operation, the effective number of bits is 4.54 b, and the effective resolution bandwidth is 600 MHz. This ADC achieves figures of merit of 3.07 and 4.30 pJ/conversion-step at 2 and 3.2 GS/s, respectively.	analog-to-digital converter;bandwidth (signal processing);cmos;comparator;differential nonlinearity;effective number of bits;effective resolution bandwidth;flash adc;integral nonlinearity;least significant bit;noise reduction;nonlinear system;preamplifier;roland gs;sampling (signal processing)	Ying-Zu Lin;Cheng-Wu Lin;Soon-Jyh Chang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2013628	resistor;stochastic process;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;preamplifier;comparator;flash adc	EDA	60.78716481541421	49.138810241722965	166456

However, there are many sources of noise that affect touch detection, and some of these noise sources, such as charger noise, significantly affect the capacitance variation needed to detect touch input and lead to inaccurate touch detection [1-2]. For example, as shown in Fig. 11.6.1, common-mode supply noise results in large peak-to-peak noise injection over 10Vpp and deteriorates touch-detection performance. Although rejection of display noise using the differential sensing method [3] has been investigated, sufficient attenuation of the injected noise through a touch object remains a problem. In this paper, we present an analog front-end (AFE) with noise immunity of up to 20Vpp for a large TSP controller. To improve the immunity to the injected noise, the proposed AFE employs the following techniques: a) TX/RX dual modulation, b) differential sensing, c) high-order noise filtering, and d) multiple TX driving frequency support. Further, to cope with various usages and advanced touch-detection modes, the proposed AFE provides a configurable frame rate from 85 to 385Hz.	analog front-end;battery charger;emoticon;front and back ends;modulation;rejection sampling;smartphone;tablet computer;touchscreen;xfig	Jun-Eun Park;Jiheon Park;Young-Ha Hwang;Jonghyun Oh;Deog-Kyoon Jeong	2016	2016 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2016.7417981	frequency modulation;embedded system;image noise;effective input noise temperature;noise;electronic engineering;telecommunications;noise temperature;computer science;engineering;sensor;electrical engineering;noise;low-noise amplifier;noise;band-pass filter;capacitance;noise figure;noise floor;signal-to-noise ratio	EDA	57.470933457515486	50.277383079768974	166477

This circuit is modeled using both small and large signal analysis, in order to evaluate mismatch effects and to support design robustness to process variations. Effect of various design parameters on offset are studied and reported. It is shown that load capacitance has a profound effect on the sense amplifier offset. Design optimization is then proposed thanks to this analysis, resulting to an input-referred offset (simply called offset in the rest of the paper) down to about 200 Ohms for one sigma variation with 20fF applied load capacitance.	large-signal model;mathematical optimization;multidisciplinary design optimization;oral history metadata synchronizer;resistive touchscreen;sense amplifier;signal processing	Salmen Mraihi;El Mehdi Boujamaa;Cyrille Dray;Jacques-Olivier Klein	2017	2017 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)	10.1109/ISVLSI.2017.64	capacitor;signal processing;input offset voltage;sense amplifier;logic gate;offset (computer science);engineering;capacitance;resistive touchscreen;electronic engineering	EDA	63.17081214305362	47.80803019676227	166513

82cceac6c5cc622e8911c6633f68de53913bed83	signal multiplexing techniques for gnss: the principle, progress, and challenges within a uniform framework		Signal multiplexing techniques are those that enable the efficient transmission of multiple signals through a single modulator, up converter, power amplifier chain, and antenna aperture, without mutual interference. In the construction of new-generation global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), signal multiplexing has encountered many challenges as the number of signals to be multiplexed increases and signal elements become more diverse and complex. In the past 15 years, many novel and advanced constant envelope multiplexing (CEM) techniques have been proposed. However, increased requirements for adaptability and flexibility of signal multiplexing techniques for future evolutional GNSSs have resulted in the need for further improvement in generalized CEM design theory. The uniform CEM mathematical framework and more general CEM design approaches can offer a good starting point to meet these challenges. In this article, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on the important concepts, recent advances, representative applications, and the remaining challenges of GNSS signal multiplexing techniques. To provide readers with a global overview of multiplexing techniques in GNSS and to foster new research ideas, a mathematical cornerstone and intrinsic conceptual relationship of assorted multiplexing techniques along with the high adaptability and high flexibility challenges of CEM design will be two key discussions.	audio power amplifier;interference (communication);modulation;multiplexing;requirement;satellite navigation	Zheng Yao;Mingquan Lu	2017	IEEE Signal Processing Magazine	10.1109/MSP.2017.2713882	adaptability;theoretical computer science;spread spectrum;computer science;modulation;constant envelope;designtheory;electrical engineering;amplifier;electronic engineering;multiplexing;gnss applications	Networks	57.85172741041833	59.57171393543833	167214

However, the VT-shift issue in thin-film transistors (TFT) has to be addressed to enable wide deployment [1]. Voltage programming and current programming are well-known VT-shift-compensation techniques for analog driving. However, they all need more than 4 TFTs per pixel, which increases the panel complexity and decreases yield and aperture ratio. Recently, a VT-shift compensation technique that uses a 2TFT-1C pixel in an analog driving AMOLED has been reported [2]. However, it requires OLED supply voltage programming, and shows a 14% variation in OLED current after VT-shift compensation, which is not enough for high-definition applications. Digital driving has been proposed as an alternative to mitigate the VT-shift issue with a simple pixel structure and to provide flexibility to the driver design. Figure 15.4.1 shows the pixel structures for voltage programming, current programming and digital driving. While the gate of the driving TFT (M2) is in the high state, the voltage across M2 is very small due to the large current-driving capability of a TFT as compared with an OLED. Hence, the current through the OLED is dominated by the supply voltage (PVDD), and minimally affected by the variations in TFT characteristics [3]. Digital driving is also useful for true dark-level expression since the OLED can be completely turned off for black gray levels.	amoled;active matrix;graphics display resolution;grayscale;hdmi;modulation;oled;pixel;software deployment;thin-film transistor;thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display	Jae Hyuk Jang;Minho Kwon;Edwin Tjandranegara;Kywro Lee;Byunghoo Jung	2009	2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977412	electronic engineering;thin-film transistor;oled;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;optoelectronics	EDA	53.76115277436854	48.72087881071617	167570

An experimental realization of a bidirectional half-duplex link that uses near-field inductive coupling between the implanted system and an external transceiver is described. Our system minimizes power consumption in the implanted system by using impedance modulation to transmit high-bandwidth information in the uplink direction, i.e., from the implanted to the external system. We measured a data rate of 2.8 Mbps at a bit error rate (BER) of <10-6 (we could not measure error rates below 10-6 ) and a data rate of 4.0 Mbps at a BER of 10-3. Experimental results also demonstrate data transfer rates up to 300 kbps in the opposite, i.e., downlink direction. We also perform a theoretical analysis of the bit error rate performance. An important effect regarding the asymmetry of rising and falling edges that is inherent to impedance modulation is predicted by theory and confirmed by experiment. The link dissipates 2.5 mW in the external system and only 100 muW in the implanted system, making it among the most power-efficient inductive data links reported. Our link is compatible with FCC regulations on radiated emissions.	accidental falls;bit error rate;characteristic impedance;data rate units;duplex (telecommunications);emission - male genitalia finding;implants;inductive coupling;nominal impedance;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;pulse-width modulation;quantitative impedance;regulation;telecommunications link;telemetry;transceiver device component;uncompressed video;x.690;ziziphus mauritiana	Soumyajit Mandal;Rahul Sarpeshkar	2008	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TBCAS.2008.2005295	electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;wireless	Mobile	62.70982712996958	59.49648632854409	167615

The proposed approach allows the systematic sizing of the compensation network in order to reach the best closed-loop op-amp settling behavior. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology and the correctness of the analysis, the examined three-stage op-amp topologies are designed in a commercial 0.35-¿m CMOS technology. Circuit simulations show that the proposed design approach, for each investigated topology, guarantees a significant settling time reduction with respect to the compensation network sizing strategies proposed in the past. An ad-hoc figure of merit, which evaluates the trade-off between the settling time, the load capacitance and the total op-amp stage transconductances, is also defined in order to estimate the op-amp efficiency in terms of time-domain performances.	cmos;correctness (computer science);hoc (programming language);operational amplifier;performance;settling time;simulation	Andrea Pugliese;Francesco A.

14967c60ffc3f7db694a3692d2dffff1fc602794	temperature sensor using a multiwavelength erbium-doped fiber ring laser		Multiwavelength erbium-doped fiber (EDF) lasers operating in the third communications window, with wavelengths around 1550 nm, are very attractive today because of their different applications in telecommunications, fiber sensors, and spectroscopy [1, 2]. Due to the homogeneous gain broadening of the EDF at room temperature, it is necessary to improve the inhomogeneity and suppress the mode hopping between the adjacent modes. Thus, many techniques have been proposed to obtain stable dual-wavelength oscillations, for example, by using highly nonlinear photonic crystal fibers [3], using saturable absorbers [4], or including a semiconductor optical amplifier in the ring cavity [5]. Fiber Bragg Gratings are suitable for use as spectrally narrowband reflectors for creating cavities for fiber lasers [6]. They represent one of themost exciting developments in the area of fiber optic communications and have also been used as strain or temperature sensors. In this paper, we demonstrate a stable multiwavelength EDF laser at room temperature by incorporating three Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) as the wavelength selecting filters. Experimental characterization has been performed, and a multiwavelength laser with oscillations at 1547 nm, 1550 nm, and 1555 nm has been achieved. Experimental results of the output power variation with temperature, as well as an output power and wavelength stability analysis with the temperature for the three FBGs, were carried out, showing the good performance of this laser as temperature sensor. Finally, the application of this system for remote temperature sensingwas demonstrated.	doping (semiconductor);earliest deadline first scheduling;fiber to the x;fiber-optic communication;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;nonlinear system;optical amplifier;optical fiber;semiconductor;sensor	Silvia Diaz;Noe San Fabian;Abian B.

A new switching scheme is proposed that exhibits special properties: it cancels the linear and quadratic gradient errors at the MSB level. We explain why this scheme has those properties and how to construct it. This scheme excels at reducing edge-effects occurring at the side of the array. No extracted information from the error profile is required. This increases the robustness of the scheme and reduces the need for reprocessing. The effectiveness of this scheme is demonstrated by applying it to the measured error profile of a 14-b current-steering converter without dummies. This shows that 14-b current-steering converters can be constructed without any dummy rows or columns at all.	column (database);digital-to-analog converter;dummy variable (statistics);gradient;least significant bit;most significant bit;routing;via (electronics)	Jurgen Deveugele;Geert Van der Plas;Michiel S.

The circuit is auto-referenced, thus saving the cost of an extra power supply for reference and making measurement on a real platform convenient. It is also capable of selectively detecting noises from different bands of frequency spectrum, each due to a different resonance peak in the power delivery network, thus allowing characterization of the noises. The circuit is implemented in a 0.13/spl mu/m process as part of a PCI-Express link. The noise measurement range is /spl plusmn/105mV with measured 15-mV resolution, and 1ns pulse bandwidth.	cmos;pci express;power supply;pulse-width modulation;resonance;sensor;spectral density;system of measurement;telecommunications link	Chaiyuth Chansungsan	2005	Proceedings of the IEEE 2005 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, 2005.	10.1109/CICC.2005.1568602	flicker noise;power supply rejection ratio;effective input noise temperature;frequency spectrum;noise;electronic engineering;cost-effectiveness analysis;telecommunications;noise temperature;computer science;engineering;noise measurement;electrical engineering;low-noise amplifier;noise;switched-mode power supply;noise figure;noise floor;phase noise;carrier-to-receiver noise density;noise generator	EDA	63.93045557272188	53.38711437774876	168195

The result is a simple DSM with no need for DACs, allowing straightforward multi-bit quantization. Without the FM oscillator , the modulator becomes a F/D converter with delta-sigma noise shaping.	delta-sigma modulation;electronic engineering;fm broadcasting;informatics;ka band;noise shaping;quantization (signal processing)	Mats Erling Høvin;Alf Olsen;Tor Sverre Lande;Christofer Toumazou	1995		10.1109/ISCAS.1995.521479	frequency modulation;control engineering;delta modulation;electronic engineering;voltage-controlled oscillator;telecommunications;computer science;delta-sigma modulation;control theory;mathematics;oscillation	DB	65.65152112252056	51.151105085613835	168264

This generic solution has advantages over previously published solution since the phase shifts of all the carriers can be made arbitrary. This feature gives a high degree of freedom for evaluating the harmonic structure of a multilevel SPWM inverter with different carrier phase combinations. A multilevel SPWM \vaveform is decomposed into a series of positive and negative DC biased PWM (DBPWM) waveform. A 3-dimensional modcl for describing each individual DRPWM is first derived. After applying the double Fourier series to each waveform, the multilevel SPWM output is then obtained by summing all the DBPWM outputs. The validity of the solution is verified using Pspice simulations.	power inverter;pulse-width modulation;simulation;waveform	C. M.

The derivative-based dynamic distortion model is extended to linearize the ADC frontend including the input buffer and the T/H. A low sampling rate auxiliary ADC is included on chip to acquire real-time, high-linearity reference samples to enable continuous background calibration. The digital post-distortion (applied off chip) enables SFDR improvements of 10 dB for 2.5 GHz inputs.

Microring-based links, however, require active tuning to counteract process and thermo-optic variations. Here, we present a bit-statistical tuner that decouples tracking of optical one and zero-levels to realize non-dc-balanced data transmission, an “eye-max”-locking controller, and self-heating cancellation without need for a high-speed sensing frontend. We implement the tuner on a 45 nm CMOS-SOI process with monolithically integrated photonic devices and circuits. The tuner consumes 0.74 mW in the logic while achieving a record 524 GHz (> 50 K temperature) tuning range at 3.8 μW/GHz heater efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the highest range and heater efficiency reported by an on-chip closed-loop thermal tuner to date. The tuner integrates with a 5 Gb/s 30 fJ/bit monolithic microring transmitter, achieving wavelength-lock and immunity to both tracking failures and self-heating events caused by arbitrary, nondc-balanced bitstreams. In addition, the tuner provides critical functionality for an 11-λ DWDM transmitter macro capable of 11 × 8 Gb/s bandwidth on a fiber. Together with the transmitter, a 10 Gb/s on-chip monolithic optical receiver with 10-12 BER sensitivity of 9 μA at 10 Gb/s enables a sub-pJ/bit 5 Gb/s optical chip-to-chip link, with the bit-statistical tuner providing thermally robust microring operation.	cmos;fiber-optic communication;gigabyte;input/output;modulation;optimal control;tv tuner card;transmitter;very-large-scale integration;wavelength-division multiplexing;x.690	Chen Sun;Mark T.

This amplifier provides a gain as high as 30dB, but using only 15m depressed cladding erbium-doped fiber (EDF) and 130mW of 980nm pump power. Compared to the single-pass configuration, this amplifier shows a gain enhancement of about 14dB for pump powers above 120mW. However, noise figures penalties of about 0.5 ∼ 0.9dB are obtained for these pump powers. The proposed double-pass amplifier will play an important role in the development of a practical S-band EDFA from perspective of economical usage of EDF and pump power.	doping (semiconductor);optical amplifier	Sulaiman Wadi Harun;Nor Kamilah Saat;Harith Ahmad	2005	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.2.182	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;optics;power-added efficiency	Robotics	65.68212571535734	57.186159969746484	168618

This invention provides improved performance and reduced cost relative to conventional carrier phase tracking systems. The invention improves the performance of the communication system by rapidly acquiring and reliably tracking the carrier signal with substantially digital hardware. The invention has no reverse slope null characteristic and therefore does not suffer from hangup. As such, acquisition time is independent of phase error. These solutions are provided without the added expense and calibration problems of a crystal filter or the performance compromise of the dual phase detector phase locked loop. The invention includes circuitry which removes the carrier from the received data signal and converts the signal to a complex baseband signal. The baseband signal is subsequently sampled to provide a plurality of complex samples. The phase of each sample is extracted and compared to the phase of an adjacent sample to provide phase difference signals. The phase difference signals are then applied to phase shifting circuitry which substantially compensates for the phase offset in the received data signal.		Francisco P.

Through simulations, we clarify the effects of PFL length, switch speed, and switch resistance on the output pulses. We model and analyze CMOS pulse generators with on-chip transmission lines (TLs) as PFLs and CMOS transistors as switches. In a 0.13- μm CMOS process with a 500- μm long PFL, post-layout simulations show that pulses of 10.4-ps width can be obtained. High-voltage and high-power outputs can be generated with other pulsed power circuits, such as Blumlein PFLs with stacked MOSFET switches. Thus, the PFL circuit significantly extends short and high-power pulse generation capabilities of CMOS technologies. A CMOS circuit with a 4-mm-long PFL is implemented in the commercial 0.13- μm technology. Pulses of ~116-ps duration and 205-300-mV amplitude on a 50-Ω load are obtained when the power supply is tuned from 1.2 to 1.6 V. Measurement connection setup is the main reason for the discrepancies among measurements, modeling, and simulation analyses.	cmos;network switch;power supply;pulse generator;simulation;transistor;transmission line	Yongtao Geng;Huan Zou;Chaojiang Li;Jiwei Sun;Haibo Wang;Pingshan Wang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2160103	chip;system on a chip;pulse generator;embedded system;electronic engineering;network switch;computer science;engineering;high voltage;electrical engineering;integrated circuit;transmission line;modeling and simulation;electric power system;resistance;cmos	EDA	63.67372294077715	48.495213542838414	169587

The switched-capacitor band-pass filter is employed to improve the matching between the chopping frequency and the center frequency of the band-pass filter, resulting in higher CMRR and lower offset. The combination of the band-pass filter and the peak-signal sampling approach eliminates the need for the anti-aliasing filter of the subsequent ADC and allows the sampling rate of the ADC to be reduced by a factor of 16 with minimal increase in high-frequency aliased noise. The prototype chip is fabricated in a 0.7 /spl mu/m CMOS process and has an overall gain of 60.6 dB with a 5.5 kHz bandwidth and a minimum in-band CMRR of 137 dB. The input-referred noise and input offset are 17.2 nV//spl radic/(Hz) and 88.7 /spl mu/V respectively.

The IC consists of a current-to-voltage (I-V) converter, a buffer, a sample-and-hold circuit, a second-order continuous-time low-pass filter (CT-LPF), a comparator, and a timing circuit that is used to pulse the external light-emitting diode with a very low duty cycle to reduce its power consumption. The current steering technique is employed in the design of the CT-LPF to meet the requirement for very low cutoff frequency. The circuit operates from a 3-V lithium battery, occupies a core area of 0.46 mm/sup 2/ and has a power consumption of 4.5 mW. The measurement results corroborate with simulation results and show that the CT-LPF can achieve a cutoff frequency of as low as 0.25 Hz. This demonstrates the feasibility of current steering technique in the design of filter for low-frequency application.	cmos;ct scan;comparator;core (optical fiber);diode;duty cycle;low-pass filter;sample and hold;simulation	Alex K.

This single-transistor (1T) APS can realize the functions of the conventional 3T CMOS image sensor. The device operation mechanism, optimization methods, and transient behavior measurements will be discussed. Because the floating junction of this device is connected to the floating gate, special behaviors such as floating gate voltage pinning effects were observed. The transient time measurement emulating the exposure procedure also confirmed the light sensing function as a single-transistor image sensor.

In this paper the realization of voltage transfer functions based on canonical current-mode follow-the-leader-feedback (FLF) OTA-C structures are investigated. Two new structures are presented, which use only single-ended-input OTAs and grounded capacitors. The first structure has a single voltage input and multiple voltage outputs taken from different nodes, which enables it to provide simultaneous outputs of different filter functions. The second structure has a single voltage output and single voltage input distributed to different circuit nodes for a universal realization. The authors not only propose such filter structures, but also show how analytical synthesis can be used to produce filter circuits that have less active elements than those recently reported voltage-mode structures which are based on differential-input OTAs. This represents another attractive feature from chip area, and power consumption point of view. Simulation results verifying the theoretical analysis of the proposed filter structure are included.	operational transconductance amplifier;power supply unit (computer);simulation;single-ended signaling;transfer function;verification and validation	Chun-Ming Chang;Bashir M.

This method is based on the concept which converts the divider into multi-section stepped impedance transformer. In addition to this scheme, lumped inductors and capacitors are incorporated in isolation networks to enhance the isolation bandwidth of the divider. In/Output reflection and isolation characteristic of the divider can be analyzed with the superposition of divider's excitation modes and its equivalent circuit characteristics. Due to additional inductors and capacitors, divider's isolation bandwidth has increased about 30% compared to resistor only divider.	beamforming;characteristic impedance;equivalent circuit;power dividers and directional couplers;transformer	Dooheon Yang;Minyoung Yoon;Sangwook Nam	2016	2016 10th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)		frequency divider;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering;current divider;wilkinson power divider	EDA	64.81894056832974	54.916704807566575	170320

A novel bias circuit is proposed to generate the gate voltage for zero 3rd-order nonlinearity of the FET transconductance. The measured data show that a peak in IIP/sub 3/ occurs at a gate voltage slightly different from the one predicted by the dc theory. The origins of this offset are explained based on a Volterra series analysis and confirmed experimentally. The technique was used in a 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS cellular-band CDMA LNA. At the optimum bias, the amplifier achieved a NF of 1.8 dB, an IIP/sub 3/ of +10.5 dBm, and a power gain of 14.6 dB with a current consumption of only 2 mA from 2.7 V supply.	amplifier;biasing;cmos;dbm;decibel;experiment;launch numerical aperture;new foundations;nonlinear system;power gain;radio frequency	Vladimir Aparin;Gary Brown;Lawrence E.

The periodically recurring interval is modulated between a first width and a second smaller width respectively representing complementary logic states of a data bit. The first width of the width modulated interval preferably extends between two points respectively located within the non-viewable, overscan portions of the video signal immediately adjacent and on either side of a horizontal blanking interval of the television signal. The transmitted signal is received by a decoder which includes a phase modulation detector for detecting the width modulated intervals and a pulse width discriminator responsive thereto for deriving the data bits.	description logic	Yu Jia;Yuqing Gu	2001			overscan;discrete mathematics;phase response;computer science;interval temporal logic;data transmission;phase modulation;detector;horizontal blanking interval;acoustics;pulse-width modulation	AI	56.93372871034005	54.31743898705289	170499

aaedfcfbf30d505ff07fd3cb64561654e396b5e2	rf front-end architecture for 5g		With the development of millimeter wave communication technologies in 5G mobile communication systems, a large number of small cells will be deployed to form 5G high-capacity ultra-dense networks. Therefore the energy efficiency should be a main design target for 5G RF front-ends (RFFEs) in order to achieve a low network operation cost. In this work we investigated the effect of the Tx signal processing architecture on RFFE total DC power consumption and the quality of the transmitted signal in terms of ACLR and EVM. We show that for the most practical cases of power amplifiers for high-capacity ultra-dense small networks with low output power, the PAPR reduction (PAPR-R) does not improve the efficiency of the RFFE. Thus, PAPR-R can be successively excluded from the Tx signal processing chain in order to increase RFFE efficiency and simplify the hardware design. Thus, with the proposed architecture, the RFFE total DC power consumption can be reduced approximately twice. However, it is desirable to use the predistorter in order to maintain the required ACLR and EVM levels in the PA output signal. Finally, we make practical recommendations regarding RFFE architecture that depend on the PA operating class and FPGA DC power consumption.		Alexander N.

This dithering renders the digital phase detector, realized as a time-to-digital converter (TDC), free from any phase domain spurious tones generated as a consequence of an ill-conditioned sampling of the feedback variable oscillator phase. In modern nanoscale technologies, TDC has a time quantization of 5 to 30 ps. This deadband can potentially result in spurious tones, whenever a near integer-N relationship arises between the oscillator frequency and the TDC sampling process. This work proposes injection of a spectrum-friendly short sequence dither into the reference clock signal to overcome the quantization introduced limit-cycles. This results in robust phase tracking performance and spurious-free operation of the ADPLL, which was verified in a 65-nm CMOS GSM/EDGE transmitter.	arnold tongue;cmos;clock signal;condition number;device configuration overlay;dither;elegant degradation;experiment;phase detector;phase-locked loop;rendering (computer graphics);sampling (signal processing);simulation;time-to-digital converter;transmitter	Khurram Waheed;Robert Bogdan Staszewski;Fikret Dulger;Muhammad S.

The thermistors are incorporated in a Wien-bridge RC filter, which, in turn, is embedded in a frequency-locked loop. The loop's output frequency is then determined by the filter's temperature-dependent phase shift, thus realizing an energy-efficient and high resolution temperature sensor. After a 3-point calibration, the sensor achieves an inaccuracy of less than ±0.12<sup>°</sup>C (min-max) from -40<sup>°</sup>C to 85<sup>°</sup>C. This translates into a frequency stability of better than ±2 ppm from -40<sup>°</sup>C to 85<sup>°</sup>C when the sensor is used to temperature compensate the quartz-crystal oscillator of a 32 kHz real-time clock. The 0.09 mm<sup>2</sup> sensor also achieves 2.8 mK (rms) resolution in a 32 ms conversion time while dissipating only 31 μW.	cmos;crystal oscillator;electronic circuit;embedded system;frequency drift;frequency-locked loop;image resolution;johnson–nyquist noise;linear model;lock (computer science);low-power broadcasting;maxima and minima;minimax;prototype;quantization (signal processing);rc circuit;real-time clock;ring oscillator;sensor;wien bridge	Pyoungwon Park;David Ruffieux;Kofi A.

For inter-symbol interference (ISI) cancellation, half-rate decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) with unrolled first tap [1–3] is widely used to avoid noise amplification and to relax timing for data sampling/feedback. However, tap-unrolling increases slicer count and entails half-rate multiplexers eating into timing margin. To remove reflection-induced ISI due to impedance discontinuities in the media, the DFE must cover tap positions higher than 30UI which is beyond tap range of the DFEs reported in previous work [1–4]. Fig. 1 shows an example of bumpy channel with reflection energy up to 40UI.	backplane;cmos;characteristic impedance;crosstalk;equalization (communications);half rate;information sciences institute;interference (communication);multiplexer;sampling (signal processing);transceiver	Shaolei Quan;Freeman Zhong;Wing Liu;Pervez M.

In the proposed driver, an adaptive timing difference compensation (ATDC) is developed to adaptively adjust the off-time of the low-side power switch to enable the driver to achieve high accuracy of the average LED current over a wide range of input voltages and number of output LED loads, fast settling time, and high operation frequency. The power efficiency benefits from the capabilities of using synchronous rectifier and having no sensing resistor in the power stage. The synchronous rectification under high input supply voltage is enabled by a proposed high-speed and low-power gate driver with pseudo-digital level shifters. Implemented in a 0.35 μm 50 V CMOS process, experimental results show that the proposed LED driver can operate at 1 MHz and achieve peak power efficiency of 93% to support a wide range of series-connected output LEDs from 1 to 10 and a wide input range from 10 to 40 V. The proposed LED driver has only 2.8% current error from the average LED current of 345 mA and settles within 8.5 μs after triggering the dimming condition, improving the settling time by 14 times compared with the state-of-the-art LED drivers.	active rectification;cmos;experiment;gate driver;low-power broadcasting;performance per watt;rectifier;settling time;solid-state lighting;switch	Dongkyung Park;Zhidong Liu;Hoi Lee	2013	Proceedings of the IEEE 2013 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference	10.1109/JSSC.2014.2320951	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;driver circuit	Arch	61.233431163139734	46.83607546730844	172093

With range overlap and redundant bit at each pipelined stage, the sub-ADC can tolerate large comparator offsets, thereby, leaving the linearity and accuracy requirements for the DAC and the residue gain stage. Typically, the multiplying DAC (MDAC), which is the combination of a DAC and a gain stage, requires a high-gain wide-bandwidth opamp and is the most critical building block. The opamps draw static currents from their power supplies and consume most of the power in a pipelined ADC. Many techniques have been reported to achieve a low-power design by avoiding the high-gain opamp, such as zero-crossing based circuits [1, 2], dynamic source-follower amplification [3], and capacitive charge-pump [4]. These techniques replace the conventional opamps with other low-power dynamic circuits to minimize the static power consumption, but in these alternative structures the conversion gain is not as well-predicted as the opamp-based design. Therefore, additional calibration circuits are typically required to compensate the conversion gain error. Another low-power pipelined ADC is presented in [5] and uses high-performance analog MOS transistors which are not easily obtained in a standard digital CMOS process.	analog-to-digital converter;cmos;charge pump;comparator;crossing-based interface;digital-to-analog converter;dynamic circuit network;image resolution;low-power broadcasting;operational amplifier;power supply;requirement;time-sharing;transistor;zero crossing	Yen-Chuan Huang;Tai-Cheng Lee	2010	2010 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - (ISSCC)	10.1109/ISSCC.2010.5433927	operational amplifier;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory	EDA	59.70837878590164	49.16765204911715	172137

They have two main objectives: first, to teach basic electronic circuit design concepts and, second, to motivate the students to learn more about analog circuit design. The two projects are: 1) the design of an audio power amplifier, and 2) the design of an amplitude-modulated optical link with a pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) at the emitter and a photodiode and a transimpedance amplifier at the receiver. An audio signal is used to modulate the oscillator that drives the LED, and the receiver demodulates this signal to produce an audio signal (music, for example) that can be sent to a loudspeaker. The intent of this optical communication system was to allow students to design and build various electronic circuits that have an overall objective and a clear practical application. Students are motivated by using this system to transmit, receive, and listen to their own music.	analogue electronics;audio power amplifier;diode;electrical engineering;electronic circuit design;lambert's cosine law;loudspeaker;modulation;optical wireless;transimpedance amplifier	Luís Bica Oliveira;Nuno Paulino;João P.

Alternatively, an edge can be transmitted through the new generateand-reset delay stages if properly reset in time. A new delay-based clock generator adopting the delay stages is proposed on that account. It is attractive in that the maximum operating frequency can be comparable to that of the ring oscillator. Furthermore, the reset of the pulse in the delay stage cleans out the random noise as well, inhibiting any noise residue phenomenon.	clock generator;clock rate;clock signal;codel;noise (electronics);ring oscillator;tree accumulation	Hyunsun Mo;Daejeong Kim	2014	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.11.20140573	electronic engineering;delay calculation;clock domain crossing;computer science;electrical engineering;ring oscillator;oscillator start-up timer;transmission delay;delay line oscillator;cpu multiplier	EDA	60.08159355725232	54.95241095293113	172733

The integrate and dump topology is known to be power efficient, but depends on a external clock signal. Here, we introduce a topology that auto generates the dump signal and hence can be used as a clock receiver. The proposed architecture is of special interest for clock channels as it accepts short pulses, instead of a 50 % duty cycle clock, as input signal. This allows big power savings by using pulsed lasers for clock generation in place of continuous wave lasers and optical modulators. The proposed receiver includes inherent duty cycle control and outputs, independent of the input, a 50 % duty cycle clock signal. Finally, the proposed topology is compared to classical approaches and is found to be the most power efficient solution in terms of overall optical link power consumption.	clock rate;clock signal;duty cycle;molecular clock;quasiperiodicity	Robert Polster;Jose-Luis Gonzalez Jimenez;Eric Cassan	2015	2015 IEEE 13th International New Circuits and Systems Conference (NEWCAS)	10.1109/NEWCAS.2015.7182078	optical power budget;optical transport network;electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;clock domain crossing;engineering;clock gating;digital clock manager;optical transistor;optical performance monitoring;optical modulation amplitude;optical cross-connect	EDA	60.04225692555641	54.31951215009091	173050
7b31a473abda453407f465527c47fc0aace1cc76	session 19 overview: sensors and interfaces: analog subcommittee		This session highlights the advances in state-of-the-art temperature, current, physical and chemical sensors. Three energy-efficient CMOS temperature sensors with the best figures of merit down to 34fJ·K 2 are reported. Two current sensors (Papers 19.4 and 19.5) are presented, one demonstrating a high room-temperature gain accuracy with a ±4A input range, while the other shows a 160dB DR biosensor readout with 7ppm INL. An energy-efficient pressure-sensing system (Paper 19.6) and a high-resolution readout IC (Paper 19.7) are also reported. An energy-efficient CO2 sensor achieving 2x better resolution (94ppm) and u003e10x lower energy consumption (12mJ/meas) than the prior art is also described (Paper 19.8).	sensor	Man-Kay Law;Taeik Kim;Kofi Makinwa	2018		10.1109/ISSCC.2018.8310311	computer science;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;energy consumption;biosensor;carbon dioxide sensor;cmos;figure of merit	EDA	55.703575254167596	46.88974241764948	173135

The toolbox includes a library with the main RF circuit models that are needed to implement wireless receivers, namely: low noise amplifiers, mixers, oscillators, filters and programmable gain amplifiers. There is also a library including other blocks like the antenna, duplexer filter and switches, required to implement reconfigurable architectures. Behavioral models of building blocks include the main ideal functionality as well as the following non-idealities: thermal noise, characterized by the noise figure and the signal-to-noise ratio, and nonlinearity, represented by the input-referred secondorder and third-order intercept points, IIP2 and IIP3, respectively. In addition to these general parameters, some blockspecific errors have been also included, like oscillator phase noise and mixer offset. These models have been incorporated into the SIMULINK environment making an extensive use of C-coded S-functions and reducing the number of library block elements. This approach reduces the simulation time while keeping high accuracy, what makes the proposed toolbox very appropriate to be combined with an optimizer for the automated high-level synthesis of radio receivers. As an application of the capabilities of the presented toolbox, a multi-standard direct-conversion receiver intended for 4G telecom systems is modeled and simulated considering the building block requirements for the different standards.	amplifier;behavioral modeling;bluetooth;duplexer;high- and low-level;high-level synthesis;johnson–nyquist noise;matlab;mathematical optimization;network switch;noise figure;nonlinear system;oscillator (cellular automaton);oscillator phase noise;radio frequency;reconfigurable computing;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;simulink;third-order intercept point;visual intercept	Alonso Morgado;V.

In order to optimize the performance VS cost factor, multi-channels architecture that enhances commonalities as well as maximum redundancies in the use of planar Schottky diode is adopted. The performance of each component is close if not at the state-of-the-art. For these receivers, broadband high power and high efficiency mutlipliers, and also high sensitivity subharmonic mixers are required. These developments are also possible thanks to the availability of novel test equipment systems such as VNA and Spectrum Analyser extenders up to 750 GHz in order to characterize fully each component.

Each channel implements a biomimetic, asymmetric bandpass-like One-Zero-Gammatone-Filter (OZGF) transfer function, using class-AB log-domain techniques. Each channel's quality factor and suppression are controlled by means of a new low power Automatic Gain Control (AGC) scheme which is coupled across the neighboring channels and emulates lateral inhibition (LI) phenomena in the auditory system. Detailed measurements from a five-channel silicon IC prototype fabricated in a 0.35 μm AMS technology confirm the operation of the coupled AGC scheme and its ability to enhance contrast among channel outputs. The prototype is characterized by an input dynamic range of 92 dB while consuming only 28 μW of power in total ( ∼ 6 μW per channel) under a 1.8 V power supply. The architecture is well-suited for fully-implantable cochlear implants.	ablepharon-macrostomia syndrome;acoustic cryptanalysis;amplifier;analog;auditory perception;automatic gain control;biomimetics;british informatics olympiad;cns disorder;capacitor device component;cascade device component;cochlear implant;cochlear structure;compression;digital-to-analog converter;dynamic range;electric capacitance;embolic protection filters;emulator;filter bank;frequency band;frequency response;hertz (hz);image scaling;integrated circuit;ion implantation;kilohertz;large;lateral thinking;low-power broadcasting;mandibular right second molar tooth;microphone device component;power supply;preamplifier device component;preprocessor;prototype;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;relative biological effectiveness;signal processing;silicon;small;test scaling;transfer function;transistor;transistors;vhdl-ams;very-large-scale integration;zero suppression;lateral inhibition	Guang Yang;Richard F.

The transmission zeros are chosen so that the resulting pulse outperforms the raised-cosine pulse in terms of the least-mean-square (LMS) timing error and timing jitter. The resulting transfer function is realizable as a ladder LC network with low component sensitivity. Practical design examples show that the generated pulse has negligible energy outside the mainlobe and better LMS timing error and jitter performance than the raised-cosine pulse.	butterworth filter;imaginary time;lc circuit;least mean squares filter;nyquist rate;polynomial;transfer function	Saleh S.

Considering noise (switches' and op-amps' thermal noise), clock jitter, nonidealities of integrators and op-amps including finite dc-gain (DCG) and unity gain bandwidth, slew-limiting, DCG nonlinearities and the input parasitic capacitance, quantizer hysteresis, switches' clock-feedthrough, and charge injection, exhaustive behavioral simulations that are close models of the transistor-level ones can be performed. The DCG nonlinearity of the integrators, which is not considered in many /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulators' modeling attempts, is analyzed, estimated, and modeled. It is shown that neglecting this parameter would lead to a significant underestimation of the modulators' behavior and increase the noise floor as well as the harmonic distortion at the output of the modulator. Evaluation and validation of the models were done via behavioral and transistor-level simulations for a second-order modulator using SIMULINK and HSPICE with a generic 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. The effects of the nonidealities and nonlinearities are clearly seen when compared to the ideal modulator in the behavioral and actual modulator in the circuit-level environment.	behavioral modeling;cmos;clock feedthrough;definite clause grammar;delta-sigma modulation;distortion;hysteresis;johnson–nyquist noise;network switch;noise floor;nonlinear system;operational amplifier;quantization (signal processing);rf modulator;spice 2;simulation;simulink;switched capacitor;transistor	Hashem Zare-Hoseini;Izzet Kale;Omid Shoaei	2005	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2005.851085	behavioral modeling;control engineering;correlated double sampling;electronic engineering;jitter;switched capacitor;nonlinear system;hysteresis;engineering;electrical engineering;delta-sigma modulation;noise;control theory;total harmonic distortion;second-order logic	EDA	64.55629863744826	49.281252153455256	174108

0256040a365464793ae4cd727db209925e9da12a	silicon chip-scale space-division multiplexing: from devices to system		Space-division multiplexing (SDM) technique has attracted increasing attentions recently, because it provides an effective way to increase transmission capacity. With the continuous and exponential increase in data demands, high-density integration of silicon photonic components is of significant interest in terms of link price, performance and power consumption. The multimode/mutlicore devices applied to achieve diverse functionalities are key building blocks to construct a chip-scale SDM system based on a silicon on insulator (SOI) platform. This study reviews the recent progress of multimode/multicore devices, which enable coupling, multiplexing/demultiplexing, transmitting switching, as well as modulation and detection. Based on these devices, a complete on-chip SDM system is constructed and discussed.

The key challenge in such sensors is the significant signal degradation caused by the parasitic capacitance at the MEMS-CMOS interface. Therefore, a novel capacitive read-out circuit with parasitic-cancellation mechanism is developed; the equivalent input capacitance of the circuit is negative and can be adjusted to cancel the parasitic capacitance. Chip results prove that the use of parasitic-cancellation is able to increase the sensor sensitivity by 35 dB without consuming any extra power. In general, the circuit follows a low-degradation low-amplification approach which is more power-efficient than the traditional high-degradation high-amplification approach; it employs parasitic-cancellation to reduce the signal degradation and therefore a lower gain is required in the amplification stage. Besides, the chopper-stabilization technique is employed to effectively reduce the low-frequency circuit noise and DC offsets. As a result of these design considerations, the prototype chip demonstrates the capability of converting a 7.5 fF capacitance change of a 1-Volt-biased 0.5 pF capacitive sensor pair into a 0.745 V signal-conditioned output at the cost of only 165.2 μW power consumption.	addresses (publication format);cmos;capacitive sensing;chopper (electronics);cochlear structure;electric capacitance;elegant degradation;equivalent input;interface device component;laser therapy, low-level;medication event monitoring system;microelectromechanical systems;parasites;parasitic diseases;parasitic oscillation;prosthesis;prototype;self-stabilization;specification;very-large-scale integration;xfig;sensor (device)	Shiwei Wang;Thomas Jacob Koickal;Alister Hamilton;Enrico Mastropaolo;Rebecca Cheung;Andrew Abel;Leslie S.

d1a7cfd7f9ffa6a8aa115359e35f56acdfb85644	spin-torque sensors for energy efficient high-speed long interconnects	current density;anisotropic magnetoresistance	In this paper, we propose a spin-torque (ST)-based sensing scheme that can enable energy efficient multibit long distance interconnect architectures. Current-mode interconnects have recently been proposed to overcome the performance degradations associated with conventional voltage-mode copper interconnects. However, the performance of current-mode interconnects are limited by analog current sensing transceivers and equalization circuits. As a solution, we propose the use of ST-based receivers that use magnetic tunnel junctions and simple digital components for current-to-voltage conversion, and do not require analog transceivers. We incorporate spin-Hall metal in our design to achieve high-speed sensing. We show both single and multibit operations that reveal major benefits at higher speeds. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique consumes only 3.93-4.72 fJ/b/mm energy while operating at 1-2 Gb/s, which is considerably better than existing charge-based interconnects. In addition, voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) can reduce the required current at the sensor. With the inclusion of VCMA, the energy consumption can be further reduced to 2.02-4.02 fJ/b/mm.	analog signal;analog-to-digital converter;copper interconnect;digimon world;digital-to-analog converter;electrical connection;experiment;gigabyte;simulation;transceiver;transformer	Zubair Al Azim;Abhronil Sengupta;Syed Shakib Sarwar;Kaushik Roy	2016	IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices		magnetoresistance;electronic engineering;telecommunications;electrical engineering;physics;current density;quantum mechanics	EDA	64.32927082932243	53.43433800246513	175314

The goal of this architecture is to reach low jitter, fractional operation, and FSK modulation capability with low architecture complexity for small area, low power, and minimal design effort. The architecture is based on the bang-bang phase detector, so that usage of time-to-digital-converter circuits is avoided, with no need for any background calibration. The key enabling blocks are a phase interpolator-based exact fractional frequency divider, and a multi-output bang-bang phase detector. The prototype implemented in 130 nm reaches 1-psrms absolute jitter while operating in integer mode and 1.9 psrms absolute jitter while operating in full fractional mode, with an output frequency of 1 GHz and reference frequency of 25 MHz, consuming 7.4 mW from a supply of 1.3 V.

Utilizing the S-parameter and the ABCD parameters of a two-port network is for the analysis of shortcircuited and open-circuited resonators with various combinations of series and shunt sequences. By controlling the impedance ratio of the resonators, both center frequencies of the two passbands then are determined. Moreover, a global synthesis approach is also discussed on miniaturization. A simplified architecture based on bent SIR offers the 50% area reduction of layout. Technology of matching circuit creates higher performance multi-band filter. We adjust impedance and electrical length of transmission line (TL) to compensate multi-band and bending for matches and highly improve the insertion and reflection loss.

Due to the dense structure of memories, they are especially vulnerable to scaling effects such as process variation. These effects (hardware errors) become more pronounced when aggressive voltage scaling is used due to the reduced voltage overhead. To address this issue, we present an error resilient MIMO detector. First, we derive a combined distribution of the received data in a MIMO-OFDM receiver that includes both the noise incurred by the wireless channel and errors introduced at the receiver buffering memory due to aggressive voltage scaling. Using the derived distribution, a modified MIMO detection algorithm based on the tree-searching structure is presented. A case study is presented showing that the proposed approach can achieve near-optimal performance in the presence of both channel noise and memory error, while 40% to 50% of memory power savings are realized.	algorithm;compaq lte;download;dynamic voltage scaling;embedded system;image scaling;mimo;mimo-ofdm;noise (electronics);overhead (computing);ram parity;side effect (computer science)	Muhammed S.

The two integration operations, which are characteristic for a second-order system are accomplished by multiplexing two integration capacitors CU and CV onto a single operational amplifier. The two feedback loops are implemented utilizing two capacitors CA and CB, which are charged and discharged periodically. Crosstalk between the two integration capacitors CU and CV due to parasitic capacitances introduces additive white noise. However, the influence can easily be limited using standard SC technology. A mismatch between CA and CB introduces a dc-offset and a gain error, as derived quantitatively. As a consequence, the robustness to component imperfections, which is typical for second-order delta-sigma modulators, is maintained. It is shown that in principle, integrator multiplexing can be generalized for higher order delta-sigma modulators	additive white gaussian noise;certificate authority;crosstalk;delta-sigma modulation;feedback;multiplexing;operational amplifier;sampling (signal processing);switched capacitor;tip (unix utility);utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelength-division multiplexing;white noise	Clemens M.

Experimental and simulated results show that the proposed quasi-Yagi antenna has a wide bandwidth and good unidirectional radiation characteristics. Compared with conventional printed quasi-Yagi antennas, the bandwidth is wider, from 2.9GHz to 10.1 GHz with a ratio of about 3.48∶ 1, and it's front-to-back ratio greater than 10 dB.

6b3eaa6f1c110ee670bb83e90e353f5e625429b7	a novel compact dual-band antenna based on composite right/left hand transmission line (crh-tl) for wlan application		A novel dual-band antenna by using CRLH-TL structure is proposed for the wireless local area network (WLAN) application. The dual-band behavior is achieved by loading shorted meander lines and interdigital capacitor to form unit-cell CRLH-TL loaded antenna. The bandwidth enhancement of proposed antenna can be achieved by merging the two extended-bandwidth resonances. The dual-band version exhibits two distinct resonances at 2.4GHz and 5.5GHz, with measured −10 dB bandwidths of 500MHz and 2.1GHz. The lowest resonance at 2.4GHz corresponds to a 47% reduction in the resonant frequency compared to a reference unloaded monopole. The size of proposed antenna is 30 × 20 × 1.6mm3. The measured gain reaches −1.6 dBi at 2.4Hz and 2.6 dBi at 5.5GHz, respectively. The measurement and simulation results show good agreement.	decibel;perl dbi;resonance;simulation;tandy 1000;transform, clipping, and lighting;transmission line	Hua Zhu;Xiuping Li;Yawen Dong;Jun Xiao	2017	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.14.20170490	transmission line;electronic engineering;metamaterial;optics;computer science;multi-band device;composite number	Mobile	66.01593242652345	57.62551489771951	176472

The algorithms are written in C++ and the tools compose a user friendly environment for design automation of filters, filter pairs and filter banks. It is possible to design in this environment not only classical structures like Butterworth, Chebyshev, and Cauer (elliptic) filters. The lossless nonreciprocal prototype circuit allows to design more complex filters, including allpass sections necessary to improve filter phase characteristics. However, the most important possibility is to design multiport circuits, especially in the case of not fully determined filter specifications. On each stage of the design process VHDL-AMS is used to describe the circuits. The obtained prototype gyrator-capacitor circuit can be implemented in OTA-C, SC (switched-capacitor) or SI (switched-current) techniques to realize the filter in CMOS technology. In the paper SI technique is used for layout generation of an image filter in order to illustrate the elaborated synthesis algorithms and tools.	algorithm;automation;composite image filter;digital electronics;display resolution;expert system;filter bank;filter design;genetic programming;gyrator;lossless compression;mathematical optimization;prototype;usability	Andrzej Handkiewicz;Piotr Katarzynski;Szymon Szczesny;Mariusz Naumowicz;Michal Melosik;Pawel Sniatala;Marek Kropidlowski	2014	Expert Syst.

The suitability of the scheme for calibrating high-end ADCs has been demonstrated. An extra ADC and the associated switching and postprocessing DSP circuitry along with some memory for storing the data to be processed, are the overhead in this scheme.

The proposed BGR circuit consists of two BGR cores and a curvature correction circuit, which includes a current mirror and a summing circuit. Two BGR cores adopt conventional structures with the curvature-down characteristics. A current-mirror circuit is proposed to implement one of the BGR cores to have the curvature-up characteristic. Selection of the appropriate resistances in the BGR cores results in one reference voltage with a well balanced curvature-down characteristic and another reference voltage with an evenly balanced curvature-up characteristic. The summation of these reference voltages is proposed to achieve a high-order curvature compensation. This curvature correction circuit causes the proposed BGR circuit without any trimming to show a measured temperature coefficient (TC) as low as 4.2 ppm/°C over a wide temperature range of 160 °C (-40 ~ 120 °C) at a power supply voltage of 1.2 V. The average TC for 8 random samples is approximately 9.3 ppm/°C. The measured power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of -30 dB is achieved at the frequency of 100 kHz.

3cbe077f3706adb6e1c512d5abc91a73b0d24739	zero-power feed-forward spur cancelation for supply-regulated cmos ring plls		A new reference-spur cancelation technique is presented for supply-regulated ring-oscillator-based integer-N phase-locked loops (PLLs). A passive RC filter is used to implement a feed-forward (FF) spur-coupling path to perform spur cancelation at the PLL control signal. The proposed technique achieves a simulated spur cancelation of about 22 dB at the first spur harmonic. The simulated postcancelation spur value is −79 dBc for an oscillator gain of 0.1 GHz/V and −46 dBc for an oscillator gain of 6 GHz/V. Spur cancelation is also robust against large process, voltage, and temperature variations in the gain and bandwidth of the FF path. A 1-GHz integer-N PLL prototype in a 65-nm CMOS process has a measured cancelation of 19.5 and 13 dB at the first and the second spur harmonic, respectively, with  $320~\mu \text{W}$  of total power consumption. The PLL prototype has an oscillator gain of 1.5 GHz/V, which results in a postcancelation spur of −53 dBc. The proposed zero-power technique is suitable for low-power PLLs as it achieves a large spur cancelation without requiring any additional power consumption or calibration.	cmos;feed forward (control);low-power broadcasting;pll multibit;passive optical network;phase-locked loop;prototype;rc circuit;ring oscillator	Pawan Agarwal;Jonghoon Kim;Partha Pratim Pande;Deukhyoun Heo	2018	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2788882	dbc;electronic engineering;phase-locked loop;computer science;phase frequency detector;frequency modulation;harmonic;cmos;bandwidth (signal processing);low-pass filter	Visualization	61.46971902676987	50.064751710928356	177019

Both twoand four-finger devices were investigated and analyzed. The experimental results show that the noise of 0.35 μm gate-length nMOSFET possesses lower 1/f component than the 0.18 μm one, whereas the four-finger devices reveal less 1/f noise than those of with two-finger ones. Furthermore, we used time domain measurement of drain current and also the statistical analysis of wafer level on the random telegraph signals (RTS) tests, and the results showed that RTS noise is higher in devices with a 0.35 μm gate-length, and devices with a smaller gate finger width produce more RTS noise than devices with a larger gate finger width. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is applied to a continuous-time modulator realised with active-RC integrators and with a folded-cascode operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). Based on a detailed circuit analysis of the integrator and the OTA, key expression are derived relating the biasing current of the OTA to the noise requirements of the integrator. In the optimization the corner frequency of the modulator loop filter and the number of quantizer levels are swept. Based on the results of the circuit analysis, for each modulator combination the summed current consumption of the 1st integrator and quantizer of the ADC is determined. By also sweeping the partitioning of the noise power for the different circuit parts, the optimum modulator and circuit solution that fulfils a predefined set of performance requirements at minimum current is found. A design example is provided for a 3rd order modulator, achieving for the OTA of the 1st integrator and the quantizer a summed current consumption of 28 μA. An SNR of 84.3 dB in the 20 kHz audio band was achieved, when considering the noise from the 1st integrator and the quantizer.	analog-to-digital converter;biasing;coefficient;delta-sigma modulation;folded reed–solomon code;mathematical optimization;network analysis (electrical circuits);noise power;operational transconductance amplifier;quantization (signal processing);requirement;signal-to-noise ratio	Niels Marker-Villumsen;Erik Bruun	2014	2014 NORCHIP	10.1109/NORCHIP.2014.7004723	electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;integrating adc	EDA	63.109203004553606	50.678014588875435	177172

The oscillator is scaled to operate at a higher frequency and is followed by a fixed-ratio divider. It maintains the same power consumption and performance for a given wanted output frequency while occupying a much smaller area. In principle, by scaling up the oscillation frequency N times, a factor of 1/N 2 can be obtained in inductor area reduction. Simulated results show that with uniformly scaled inductors, the figure of merit (FoM) of the scaled oscillators at 1, 2, 4, and 8 GHz can be within a 1-dB difference, whereas the figure of merit normalized for area (FoMA) improves with the oscillation frequency.	cmos;image scaling;reduction (complexity);transistor	Shih-An Yu;Peter R.

ac96ec2cf2a077687049d76c56f5260968dd2797	optical fabry-perot filters using hybrid periodic, fibonacci and cantor photonic structures		In this numerical investigation, the design of new optical Fabry-Perot filters according to hybrid Periodic/Non-Periodic, one-dimensional photonic structures are proposed. The purpose of the paper is to design and optimize new Fabry-Perot filters to be used in optical systems and instruments. The hybrid structures studied are Periodic/[Fibonacci]/Periodic and Periodic/[Cantor]/Periodic, where P is the repetitive number of Fibonacci or Cantor sequence. The materials constituting the layers of the hybrid structure are the SiO2 and the TiO2. The transmission spectra are. determined using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). We show that the number, the position of the transmission peaks, the finesse coefficient (F) and the quality factor (Q) depend on the repetitive number (P), the lightincidence angle ( ) and the Polarization modes (TE and TM). All of these parameters are optimized to obtain a Fabry-Perot filters with high finesse coefficient (F), high quality factor (Q), minimum number of layers and minimum thickness. By comparing with other research works, the hybrid Periodic/Cantor structure is the best one which permits to obtain a Fabry-Perot filter with high Finesse coefficient F= 17300. On the other hand, the hybrid Periodic/Fibonacci structure makes it possible to achieve the best high quality factor Q= 311600.	cantor;coefficient;display resolution;incidence matrix;matrix method;numerical analysis;polarization (waves);quasiperiodicity;scientific literature;test engineer;thickness (graph theory);transfer matrix	Naim Ben Ali	2017	Nano Comm.

Each receive processor includes a first decimator, time delay memory, second decimator, and complex multiplier. The receive beamformer is a computationally efficient system which is programmable to allow processing mode trade-offs among receive frequency, receive spatial range resolution, and number of simultaneous beams received. Each local control receives focusing data from a central control computer and provides final calculation of per-channel dynamic focus delay, phase, apodization, and calibration values for each receiver signal sample. Further, this invention includes a baseband multi-beam processor which has a phase aligner and a baseband filter for making post-beamformation coherent phase adjustments and signal shaping, respectively.

The proposed amplifier is based on the bulk-driven approach, which brings a possibility to operate with low supply voltage (i.e. 0.6 V). Since the supply voltage of only 0.6 V is used for the amplifier to operate, there is no latchup risk that usually represents the main drawback of the bulk-driven approach. As an input stage, bulk driven transistors are used, which makes possible to operate in the rail-to-rail input voltage range. Achieved simulation results indicate that gain of the proposed VGA can be varied in a wide range, which together with the low supply voltage feature make the proposed amplifier useful for low-voltage and low-power applications.	cmos;distortion;high dynamic range;latch-up;low-power broadcasting;rejection sampling;requirement;signal processing;simulation;transistor;variable-gain amplifier;video graphics array	Daniel Arbet;Martin Kovác;Lukás Nagy;Viera Stopjaková;Juraj Brenkus	2016	2016 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)	10.1109/DDECS.2016.7482439	operational amplifier;power supply rejection ratio;control engineering;charge amplifier;operational amplifier applications;fully differential amplifier;electronic engineering;automatic gain control;input offset voltage;common base;engineering;electrical engineering;transimpedance amplifier;mathematical model;log amplifier;op amp integrator;open-loop gain;instrumentation amplifier;resistance;operational transconductance amplifier;fet amplifier;direct-coupled amplifier;transistor;power-added efficiency;rf power amplifier;common source;common emitter;differential amplifier	EDA	61.95870795891426	48.462027278705975	178261

However, continuous monitoring of a wide frequency band with high sensitivity and spectral resolution can generate unmanageable amounts of data. By applying an adaptive compression algorithm to measured ultrawideband spectral data we show that it is possible to obtain spectral data compression ratios of 10, 000 or more, allowing the datarate to be reduced below 1 Mbps, sufficient for streaming to disk, broadcasting over a wireless link, or performing further processing. A key aspect of the approach is the fidelity with which the spectral signals are preserved. We show compression results applied to measured data, and discuss an architecture for implementing the data compression algorithms in real-time.	adaptive compression;algorithm;cognitive radio;data compression;data rate units;frequency band;programming paradigm;real-time transcription;ultra-wideband	John Matthews;Leonid Bukshpun;Ranjit D.

068c05778953cd6240e3416a1f6994accc918a97	design of high frequency ultrasonic array transducers for medical imaging	qa75 electronic computers computer science;qd chemistry;r medicine general	Ultrasonic transducers have been widely used in the medical applications. High frequency array transducers have recently attracted many research interests, since it provides not only the electronic beamforming but also the very fine image resolution. The transducers are usually either annular or linear arrays. This study concentrates on the design of both types of array in high frequency applications.  The annular array is firstly investigated, and an optimized design of array geometry is developed including the kerfs influence which is usually neglected in the design of high frequency arrays. The improved imaging performance is found by this optimized design. More interestingly, the conventional annular array with element having the same surface area has a relatively large sidelobe closest to the main lobe. Two methods are applied to suppress the sidelobe. The method of using high-impedance single matching to enlarge the element bandwidth only shows very limited lobe suppression, however, a novel matching approach is found. Another method of changing the array geometry from equal area elements to equal width ones successfully suppressed the sidelobe. The imaging results suggest that the novel equal width array shows a good improvement.  The linear array is then analyzed. The kerfs influence again is found to be significant for the array especially for high frequency. It is essential to use a high attenuated kerfs material in the linear array design. More importantly, the limitation of current fabrication techniques forces the linear array to concede a high grating lobe in the imaging field if it operates in a relatively high frequency. A novel linear array is developed to suppress the grating lobe without using advanced fabrication techniques. The imaging results show that the novel linear array has a general reduction of -6dB for the lobe suppression. The novel design made the linear array operate in a very high frequency without strong grating lobe, and the array can be fabricated by current techniques.	medical imaging;transducer	Yichen Qian	2011			electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;optics;array gain;sensor array	HPC	66.40721564024192	57.35782647544571	178874

With the same topology and circuit elements, without W/L modification which is impossible after circuit fabrication, these circuits can produce different behaviors, similar to the biological neurons, both for a single neuron as well as a network of neurons just by tuning reference current and voltage sources. The models are investigated, in terms of analog implementation feasibility and costs, targeting large scale hardware implementations. Results show that, in order to gain the best performance, area and accuracy; these models can be compromised. Simulation results are presented for different neuron behaviors with CMOS 350 nm technology.

It is however desirable to find such way of filter realization which can be arbitrary modified through adding reactances among filter and termination as additional physical connection to obtain simplest possible recalculations of the networks. This paper presents analytical method of synthesis for BPF with consideration of arbitrarily reactance-parts entered into the real terminations - called coupled-reactances. Presented method gives opportunity to apply any immittances of resonators and coupled-reactances inserted in such way that J0,1/Jn,n+1-admittance end-inverters remain unchanged. Therefore, considered filter networks employ novel asymmetric inverters with single shunt negative element proposed by Zaradny & Rymarz, which are more effective than widely known symmetrical inverters. Calculations and measurements of S21-responses with novel inverters confirm theoretical assumptions. One example of laboratory model of filter with favorable results confirming the theory has been presented experimentally in the paper. The method at present has applications in thick-film MIC's to several GHz.	experiment;inverter (logic gate);power inverter	Marek Bogdan Zaradny	2016	2016 MIXDES - 23rd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/MIXDES.2016.7529752	control engineering;network synthesis filters;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;prototype filter;m-derived filter	EDA	66.74174048723138	46.89250133604735	179274

This design is effective in reducing power consumption from managing the supplied current and clock frequency for the structurally dynamic varying systems. The VFA supplied electrical current amount and voltage level are automatically adjusted from sensing the voltage drop of the fanout load. This adjustment mechanism controls the activated power switch quantity to allow a structure varied design that can obtain a stable fanin voltage level, regardless of the designed module that is dynamically added or removed from the system. Compared to the conventional dynamic voltage frequency scaling technique, the VFA is cost effective and can be easily integrated with the target design as a single chip. The experimental results show that the combination of VFA chips and an H.264 video decoder is successfully validated with 49%~68% power reduction compared to the case that the H.264 video decoder directly uses an outer power supply.	clock rate;fan-in;fan-out;frequency scaling;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;ibm power systems;image scaling;low-power broadcasting;power supply;scalability;switch;video decoder	Ching-Hwa Cheng;Sheng-Wei Hsu;Jiun-In Guo	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS2013)	10.1109/ISCAS.2013.6571928	embedded system;electronic engineering;codec;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;operating system;low-power electronics;integrated circuit design	Arch	60.781984916206845	46.80074247053276	179504

PR non-maximally decimated analysis/synthesis chains are used for performing resampling, channelization and filtering in very wideband software defined radios. Digital wideband filtering is currently limited by the hardware clock speed which constrains the maximum signal bandwidth that can be processed digitally. Polyphase channelizers decrease the sample rate of the input signals and parallelize the wideband filtering process at cost of a single filter. In this paper we show how to assemble multiple-tier PR analysis/synthesis channelizer chains for implementing, in a very efficient way, variable bandwidth digital filters and multi-resolution systems operating on very wideband signals. When an internal tier analysis channelizer is applied to a single output channel of a first external tier analysis channelizer it decomposes this channel in multiple narrower subchannels and, by applying appropriate complex processing elements to those sub-channels we can modify the designed filter bandwidth as desired.	bandwidth (signal processing);channelization (telecommunications);clock rate;decimation (signal processing);digital filter;embedded system;filter (signal processing);filter bank;multiresolution analysis;multitier architecture;polyphase matrix;resampling (statistics);sampling (signal processing);transceiver	Fred Harris;Behrokh Farzad;Elettra Venosa;Xiaofei Chen	2014	2014 19th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing	10.1109/ICDSP.2014.6900809	electronic engineering;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Visualization	57.57893495182257	57.52881160960459	179930

2e8a9d871310fd3cc1e77581680bd358915830f3	a highly linear squarer design for energy-detection rf receivers	volterra series;squarer;energy detection;linearization;rf	A highly linear Gilbert cell squarer is designed using a modified derivative superposition (MDS) technique, which employs a pair of NMOS-PMOS auxiliary transistors in weak inversion and an auxiliary PMOS transistor in moderate inversion. This technique reduces the inherent sensitivity of derivative superposition linearization schemes to bias voltage level. The Volterra series analysis of the squarer is reported to examine the effectiveness of the new technique. Simulation result using TSMC 0.13@mm CMOS technology, demonstrates that MDS gives rise to 15dB improvement in IIP2 and 5dB improvement in IIP3 of squarer. Moreover, Bias voltage of squarer can be tolerated within 0.45-0.6V with acceptable IIP2 and IIP3 performances. The new linearization technique is applicable to RF modules in many wireless communications.	radio frequency	Mostafa Yargholi	2013	Microelectronics Journal	10.1016/j.mejo.2013.05.003	electronic engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;linearization;radio frequency;physics	EDA	63.32908725990652	48.765407445581346	180155

We describe techniques for injection of random and deterministic jitter in controlled and programmable fashion, including a novel data-dependent jitter (DDJ) generation method that eliminates the need for bulky and difficult-to-control DDJ injection filters. These techniques can be employed for a wide range of applications with different bit rates and patterns in a single setup. We also introduce the concept of continuous time interval analyzer (CTIA) and demonstrate how it can be used for fast and accurate jitter measurement without any trigger signal. Subsequently, we present jitter measurement methodologies and results using the real-time and equivalent-time sampling oscilloscopes, which are used as benchmarks for verification of the CTIA measurement accuracy.	algorithm;ctia and gtia;data dependency;data rate units;embedded system;fibre channel;pci express;real-time clock;registered jack;sampling (signal processing);serial ata;serial communication;x.690	Sassan Tabatabaei;Michael Lee;Freddy Ben-Zeev	2004	2004 International Conferce on Test	10.1109/ITC.2004.111	chip;embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;jitter;telecommunications;computer science;oscilloscope	Embedded	56.92423269744057	56.140131072116255	180288

As a high density transmission line structure of diagonal-pair differential TR line is described. Also, a circuit and TR line is introduced for above 10 Gbps signal propagation. The on-chip inductor which is a key passive component in RF application of Si CMOS technology is discussed. We examine some on-chip inductors that have been developed in our group: small area inductor, high performance inductor using WL-CSP (Wafer-Level Chip-Size-Packaging) technology.
