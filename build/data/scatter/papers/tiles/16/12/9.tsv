7c811c5e328bc14a58a3aff06feda0d214471b4f	the constrained rayleigh quotient with a general orthogonality constraint and an eigen-balanced laplacian matrix: the greatest lower bound and applications in cooperative control problems		Mathematically, the Rayleigh quotient is defined as the quadratic function of a symmetric matrix and a nonzero (usually unconstrained) variable vector. In this paper, we consider the constrained Rayleigh quotient, in which the variable vector has the orthogonality constraint, i.e., it is constrained to be orthogonal to a nonzero vector, this nonzero vector is called the orthogonality-constraint vector (or abbreviated as the OC-vector) for the variable vector. The matrix for the Rayleigh quotient is an eigen-balanced (EB) Laplacian matrix. A tighter lower bound of the constrained Rayleigh quotient has many implications in mathematics as well as in cooperative control problems. The main contributions in this paper are as follows: First, we provide the greatest lower bound (or the infimum) of the constrained Rayleigh quotient with respect to a general OC-vector and the EB Laplacian matrix, whose results are novel and better than the existing results. Then, we interpret the physical meaning of our results in an insightful geometric form and characterize the properties of the results. Finally, as an example to illustrate the merit of the tighter lower bound of the constrained Rayleigh quotient, we consider the scale of the agents driving by a fundamental consensus protocol, and show that the convergence rate of the agents’ scale is characterized by the greatest lower bound of the constrained Rayleigh quotient.	consensus dynamics;difference quotient;eigen (c++ library);laplacian matrix;quadratic function;rate of convergence;rayleigh–ritz method;the matrix	Wei Li	2018	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2018.2815179	mathematical optimization;infimum and supremum;quadratic function;laplacian matrix;matrix (mathematics);mathematics;rayleigh quotient;upper and lower bounds;symmetric matrix;orthogonality	Theory	66.72767810519532	20.844823519307937	66228

An expression ak is called a hypergeometric term (or closed form), if ak/ak-1 is a rational function with respect to k. Typical hypergeometric terms are ratios of products of powers, factorials, &Gamma; function terms, binomial coefficients, and shifted factorials (Pochhammer symbols) that are integer-linear in their arguments.The package covers further extensions of both Gosper's and Zeilberger's algorithm which in particular are valid for ratios of products of powers, factorials, &Gamma; function terms, binomial coefficients, and shifted factorials that are rational-linear in their arguments.A similar MAPLE package is described elsewhere [2].	algorithm;coefficient;gosper curve;maple;reduce	Wolfram Koepf	1995	ACM SIGSAM Bulletin	10.1145/216685.216687	arithmetic;rational function;discrete mathematics;mathematics;binomial coefficient;gamma function;algebra	Web+IR	59.7448851409217	28.653601145595463	66261

However, in the case of sampling rate decrease the Farrow structure can only implement filters with poor anti-aliasing properties because the transfer zeros are clustered around the integer multiples of the input sampling rate and not around the multiples of the output sampling rate where aliasing components appear. This problem can be overcome by using the transposed Farrow structure with the transfer zeros clustered around the integer multiples of the output sampling rate. The aliasing components are attenuated using the same polynomial function as for the Farrow structure. The main difference is that this polynomial is determined using the output sampling period as the basic interval, instead of the input sampling period. This paper gives overview and compares two alternative implementation forms for the transposed Farrow structure.	aliasing;polynomial;sampling (signal processing);spatial anti-aliasing	Djordje Babic;Jussi Vesma;Tapio Saramäki;Markku Renfors	2002		10.1109/ISCAS.2002.1010374	pole–zero plot;sampling;computer vision;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;digital filter;interpolation;computer science;electrical engineering;digital signal processing;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;frequency domain;polynomial	PL	60.056428456361246	18.330875519555597	66463
9dc2c71ebff3e612aa079690df0a64ca70192593	sparse fast fourier transform for exactly and generally k-sparse signals by downsampling and sparse recovery		Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is one of the most important too ls in digital signal processing. FFT costs O(N logN) for transforming a signal of length N . Recently, researchers at MIT have proposed Sparse Fast Fou rier Transform (sFFT) [1][2] as a breakthrough with computational complexity O(K logN) andO(K logN log N K ) for exactlyK-sparse signal (with onlyK non-zero frequency grids) and generally K-sparse signal (withK significant frequency grids), respectively, to outperform classic FFT. In this paper, a new sparse Fast Fourier Transform by downsam pling in the time domain (sFFT-DT) is proposed for both exactly and generallyK-sparse signals, based on the assumption that the distribut ion of the non-zero frequency grids is uniform. The idea behind sFFT-DT is to downsample the original input s ignal at the beginning; then, subsequent processing operat es under downsampled signals, where signal lengths are proportiona l t O(K). Downsampling, however, possibly leads to “aliasing”. By t he shift property of DFT, we recast the aliasing problem as a “mo ment-preserving problem (MPP),” which is solvable. We prov e two theorems related to initializing the downsampling factors under different conditions to have computational complexi ty, O(K logK) andO(K 5 4 logK). Moreover, for generallyK-sparse signals, solutions to the MPP are inaccurate due to i nterference from nonsignificant frequency grids. We observe that significant fre quency grids in aliasing are “sparse”. This property is expl oited, and a new sparse signal recovery algorithm in the context of comp ressive sensing is presented to refine the solution to MPP. Th e computational complexity still costs O(K logK) but requires a larger Big-O constant compared to the case of e xactly K-sparse signals. We conduct theoretical complexity analyses and si mulations to demonstrate that our method (sFFT-DT) outperf orms classic FFT and MIT’s sFFT.	algorithm;aliasing;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;decimation (signal processing);decision problem;detection theory;digital signal processing;fast fourier transform;goodyear mpp;sparse matrix	Sung-Hsien Hsieh;Chun-Shien Lu;Soo-Chang Pei	2014	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;speech recognition;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	ML	56.08523132632579	21.5563710373562	67126

The obtained algorithm is highly fine-grain parallelizable and its computational complexity grows logarithmically with respect to the condition number of the system of linear equations. When the parallelism is fully exploited, the algorithm is shown to be more efficient in terms of computational speed in comparison to other popular methods for solving a positive definite system of linear equations, especially for large and ill-conditioned problems.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;condition number;dynamical system;linear equation;parallel computing;sampling (signal processing);system of linear equations;the matrix;time complexity	Ammar Hasan;Eric C.

In this paper, we apply a polynomial eigenvalue decomposition obtained by the sequential best rotation algorithm to decompose a parahermitian matrix into a product of two paraunitary, i.e. lossless and easily invertible matrices, and a diagonal polynomial matrix. The inversion of the overall parahermitian matrix therefore reduces to the inversion of auto-correlation sequences in this diagonal matrix. We investigate a number of different approaches to obtain this inversion, and and assessment of the numerical stability and complexity of the inversion process.	algorithm;array processing;autocorrelation;lossless compression;mimo;numerical stability;polynomial matrix	Stephan D.

This linear modelling leads to decoder structures realizing approximately a linear rectangular filter. However, due to the low resolution quantizer the /spl Sigma//spl Delta/M is an inherently nonlinear system. This might mean that a nonlinear analysis could yield more effective decoder structures including better linear filters. In this paper a new linear filtering approach for decoder design is proposed. It achieves a decoding performance superior to rectangular filtering.	algorithm;decoding methods;delta-sigma modulation;filter (signal processing);image resolution;noise generator;nonlinear system;quantization (signal processing);utility functions on indivisible goods;white noise	Ingo Wiemer;Wolfgang Schwarz	2004	2004 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (IEEE Cat.

The coefficients of the quadratic spline functions are determined by minimizing the mean-square error (MSE). Based on the obtained approximative quadratic spline functions, the design for companding quantizer for Gaussian source is done. The support region of proposed companding quantizer is divided on segments of unequal size, where the optimal value of segment threshold is numerically determined depending on maximal value of the signal to quantization noise ratio (SQNR). It is shown that by the companding quantizer proposed in this paper, the SQNR that is very close to SQNR of nonlinear optimal companding quantizer is achieved. 18	academy;approximation;coefficient;companding;electronic engineering;maximal set;mean squared error;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;quantization (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;signal-to-quantization-noise ratio;spline (mathematics)	Lazar Velimirovic;Zoran H.

In generalizing to vector-valued functions f, Chartres has solved Formulation II only for rational f which satisfy a linear system of equations, while this paper presents a solution for arbitrary non-degenerate rational vector-valued f.	image;linear system;system of linear equations	Paul L.

The paper considers the so called unbalanced thee-phase optimal power flow problem (TOPF) for smart grids, which involves multiple quadratic equality and indefinite quadratic inequality constraints to model the bus interconnections, hardware capacity and balance between power demand and supply. The existing Newton search based or interior point algorithms are often trapped by a local optimum while semidefinite programming relaxation (SDR) even fails to locate a feasible point. Following our previously developed nonsmooth optimization approach, computational solution for TOPF is provided. Namely, an iterative procedure for generating a sequence of improved points that converges to an optimal solution, is developed. Simulations for TOPF in unbalanced distributed networks are provided to demonstrate the practicability and efficiency of our approach.	algorithm;computation;computer simulation;etsi satellite digital radio;flow network;iterative method;linear programming relaxation;local optimum;mathematical optimization;newton;semidefinite programming;social inequality;unbalanced circuit	Y.

For processing such as filtering and compression it would be useful to have approximations to eigenfunctions of the operator. It has been shown that discrete-time complex exponentials are asymptotic pseudomodes (i.e., approximate eigenvectors) of sequences of Toeplitz matrices. In this letter we show that complex exponentials over the observation interval are pseudomodes of LTI operators, corresponding to pseudoeigenvalues that are samples from the operator's frequency response, and how the level of approximation depends on the ratio of the impulse response duration to observation interval length. This implies that the Fourier Series basis for the observation interval can be used as an orthonormal set of approximate eigenfunctions.	approximation algorithm;frequency response;language technologies institute;radar;time-invariant system;toeplitz hash algorithm	Patrick A.

It implies that polynomials up to degree p - 1 are in the space spanned by the scaling function(s). In the scalar case, the scalar sum rules determine the approximation order or the left eigenvectors of the infinite down-sampled convolution matrix H determine the combinations of scaling functions required to produce the desired polynomial. For multi-wavelets the condition for approximation order is similar to the conditions in the scalar case. Generalized left eigenvectors of the matrix Hf; a finite portion of H determines the combinations of scaling functions that produce the desired superfunction from which polynomials of desired degree can be reproduced. The superfunctions in this work are taken to be B-splines. However, any refinable function can serve as the superfunction. The condition of approximation order is derived and new, symmetric, compactly supported and orthogonal multi-wavelets with approximation orders one, two, three and four are constructed.	b-spline;order of approximation;wavelet	Hüseyin Özkaramanli;Asim Bhatti;Bülent Bilgehan	2002	Signal Processing	10.1016/S0165-1684(02)00212-8	mathematical analysis;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;calculus;signal processing;mathematics;geometry;statistics	Robotics	54.85899530985433	21.539301785053883	72846

d810a63832cf6efcbdda819b440ee4261bb8aff1	a new approach to laplacian solvers and flow problems		This paper investigates message-passing algorithms for solving systems of linear equations in the Laplacian matrices of graphs and to compute electric flows. These two problems are fundamental primitives that arise in several domains such as computer science, electrical engineering, operations research, and machine learning. Despite the extensive literature on approximately solving these problems in quasi-linear time, the algorithms that have been proposed are typically centralized and involve multiple graph theoretic constructions or sampling mechanisms that make them difficult to implement and analyze. On the other hand, message-passing routines are distributed, simple, and easy to implement. In this paper we establish a framework to analyze message-passing algorithms to solve voltage and flow problems. We characterize the error committed by the algorithms in d-regular graphs with equal weights. We show that the convergence of the algorithms is controlled by the total variation distance between the distributions of non-backtracking random walks that start from neighbor nodes. More broadly, our analysis of message-passing introduces new insights to address generic optimization problems with constraints.	algorithm;backtracking;centralized computing;computer science;electrical engineering;laplacian matrix;linear equation;machine learning;mathematical optimization;message passing;operations research;regular expression;sampling (signal processing);system of linear equations;theory;time complexity	Patrick Rebeschini;Sekhar Tatikonda	2016	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;algorithm;statistics;algebra	Theory	54.220202219615274	23.786879715965426	73865

The structure is derived from a real variable FD FIR filter and is constituted by a set of fixed real linear-phase FIR filters and two multiply-accumulate chains containing variable multipliers. In this way the implementation complexity and delay may be reduced in comparison with the cascade approach which hitherto has been used for the same purpose. A design example is included to demonstrate the benefits of the new structure.	butterworth filter;central processing unit;data structure;existential quantification;finite impulse response;general-purpose markup language;least squares;linear phase;minimax;multiply–accumulate operation	Ewa Hermanowicz;Håkan Johansson	2007	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2007.900349	control engineering;computer vision;electronic engineering;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics	Visualization	59.98511875139429	18.595503454492256	74075

In this case, the model is expressed by using Fourier coefficients instead of the effect of each factor. As there is an abundance of software for calculating the Fourier transform, such a system allows for a straightforward implementation of the procedures for estimating the Fourier coefficients by using Fourier transform. However, Fourier coefficients themselves do not provide a direct representation of the effect of each factor, and the relation between the Fourier coefficients and the effect of each factor has not yet been clarified. In this paper, we present theorems of the relation between the Fourier coefficients and the effect of each factor. By using these theorems, the effect of each factor can be easily obtained from the computed Fourier coefficients. Therefore, with the aid of an orthonormal system, it is possible to easily implement the estimation procedures as well as to understand how each factor affects the response variable in the model.	coefficient;design of experiments;motion estimation	Yoshifumi Ukita;Toshiyasu Matsushima	2011	2011 8th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing	10.1109/ICICS.2011.6173126	computer simulation;fourier transform;sine and cosine transforms;mathematical optimization;discrete-time fourier transform;mathematical analysis;harmonic wavelet transform;short-time fourier transform;fourier sine and cosine series;fractional fourier transform;calculus;discrete fourier transform;fourier inversion theorem;discrete fourier series;mathematics;uses of trigonometry;discrete fourier transform;fourier analysis;least-squares spectral analysis;parseval's theorem;design of experiments;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;phase correlation;fourier series;statistics;fourier transform on finite groups	Robotics	55.2741451891372	19.610148161634157	74097

In this paper, frequency estimation of two-dimensional (2-D) sinusoids is addressed. With the use of the periodogram in frequency domain, the required harmonics are first located coarsely. The characteristics of the 2-D spectrum is then analyzed, and the accurate estimates of the parameters are retrieved using an interpolation method iteratively. It is proved that at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio conditions, the harmonic estimates are asymptotically unbiased, and their variances are also analyzed. Furthermore, when only part of the data is observed, the proposed algorithm is tailored to get fast and accurate estimation results. Computer simulations are also included to compare the proposed approach with conventional 2-D harmonic retrieval schemes in terms of root mean square error performance and computational complexity.

Based on a filter bank consisting of two FIR filters combined with an 8 point DCT, we investigate how the quantization of filter coefficients and twiddle factors in different algorithms affects the quality of the filter bank. It is found that a DCT based on the Stasinksi algorithm with twiddle factors of only 5 bits together with FIR filter coefficients of 10 bits, gives a filter bank with high coding gain, no blocking artifacts and limited ringing. The VLSI complexity is comparable to that of DCT transforms.	algorithm;blocking (computing);coding gain;coefficient;discrete cosine transform;fast fourier transform;filter bank;finite impulse response;ringing (signal);sub-band coding;twiddle factor;very-large-scale integration	Ingil Sundsbo;Tor A.

In order to achieve high accuracy to its corresponding theoretical transform, the rounding number should be as low as possible. At the same time, the matrix factorization for reversible integer mapping should be handled with care, especially when the processing block length is high (N>16). In this correspondence, a new method for realizing reversible integer discrete cosine transform type IV (DCT-IV) is proposed that is a key component used in audio compression. The proposed method exhibits low rounding number (2.5N) and low complexity O(Nlog/sub 2/N) as well as well as accurately represents its counterpart floating-point DCT-IV transformation.	approximation;block code;data compression;lossless compression;modified discrete cosine transform;rounding;signal compression;the matrix	Haibin Huang;Susanto Rahardja;Rongshan Yu;Xiao Lin	2006	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2005.862942	arithmetic;discrete mathematics;nearest integer function;computer science;theoretical computer science;signal processing;mathematics;matrix decomposition	Vision	57.923006952495875	21.073038598543306	77488

Designing of the piecewise linear optimal compander is conducted for signals modeled with the Gaussian probability density function (PDF) and signals modeled with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The slopes of the piecewise linear optimal compressor function are optimized for each quantization segment from the support region. The optimization is performed with a goal of obtaining minimal mean-squared error introduced with the proposed approximation, in this manner affecting the number of the uniform cells within each segment. The obtained numerical results show that signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) of so obtained piecewise linear optimal compander overreaches SQNR of the uniform quantizer, whereas approaches to the SQNR of the nonlinear optimal compander for higher number of quantization segments. Features of the proposed quantizer indicate great possibilities for its widespread application in quantization of signals modeled by Gaussian PDF and GMM.

In this paper, a brief review of past work is given and a study of the effects of the characteristics of the employed filter banks is presented. It is shown that an increase in filter length and an increase in the degree of overlap between neighboring channels contribute independently to a better performance. Also, it is shown that near-perfect reconstruction filter banks are limited by their reconstruction error but yield good results at a low bitrate. This is supported by both theoretical and experimental results.	filter bank;noise shaping;overlap–add method;oversampling;reconstruction filter	Tania Leppert;Fabrice Labeau;Peter Kabal	2005	2005 13th European Signal Processing Conference		adaptive filter;electronic engineering;speech recognition;kernel adaptive filter;telecommunications;engineering;root-raised-cosine filter;filter bank;filter design	Robotics	59.35902458597098	18.689811043088344	77857

It parameterizes the twiddle factors in conventional radix-2/sup n/ or split-radix FFT algorithms as certain rotation-like matrices and approximates the associated parameters using the sum-of-powers-of-two (SOPOT) or canonical signed digits (CSD) representations. The ML-FFT converges to the DFT when the number of SOPOT terms used increases and has an arithmetic complexity of O(Nlog/sub 2/ N) additions, where N=2/sup m/ is the transform length. Design results show that the ML-FFT offers flexible tradeoff between arithmetic complexity and numerical accuracy in approximating the DFT. Using the polynomial transformation, similar multiplier-less approximation of 2D FFT is also obtained.	coefficient;fast fourier transform	Shing-Chow Chan;P. M.

This algorithm amounts to transforming a polynomial matrix to upper triangular form by application of a series of paraunitary matrices such as elementary delay and rotation matrices. It is shown that this algorithm can also be used to formulate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a polynomial matrix, which essentially amounts to diagonalizing a polynomial matrix again by application of a series of paraunitary matrices. Example matrices are used to demonstrate both types of decomposition. Mathematical proofs of convergence of both decompositions are also outlined. Finally, a possible application of such decompositions in multichannel signal processing is discussed.	algorithm;authorization;coefficient of determination;hermite polynomials;ieee xplore;isometric projection;mimo;numerical analysis;polynomial matrix;qr decomposition;signal processing;singular value decomposition;the matrix;triangular matrix;truncation	Joanne A.

The Banach space duality structure of the problem is characterized in terms of tensor product spaces. This complements the prior study undertaken by the authors, where the dual and pre-dual formulations were in terms of abstract spaces. Here, we show that these spaces together with the pre-annihilator and annihilator subspaces can be realized explicitly as specific tensor spaces and subspaces, respectively. The tensor space formulation leads to a solution in terms of an operator given by a tensor product. Specifically, the optimal distributed control performance for spatially invariant systems is equal to the operator induced norm of this operator. The results obtained in this paper bridge the gap between control theory and the metric theory of tensor product spaces.	control theory;distributed control system	Seddik M.

cde50eaef63ced3d63f9f2de4e0d46eb5be51334	on the set of solutions of the nonnegative matrix factorization problem		The nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem D = XY T for a given nonnegative matrix D and with nonnegative factors X and Y can have many solutions aside from trivial permutations or positive multiples of the columns of X and Y . The set of feasible solutions (SFS) is a low-dimensional representation of all possible columns of either X or Y in any NMF of D. The SFS provides important information on the possible ambiguity of the NMF. This paper conveys the SFS concept as developed in chemometrics to mathematics. Various properties of the SFS are proved. Numerical algorithms for the SFS computation are reviewed and tested for an application model problem from analytical chemistry.	algorithm;analytic signal;chemometrics;classical xy model;clustered file system;column (database);computation;mathematical structure;matrix multiplication;mind;non-negative matrix factorization;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;simple features;stochastic matrix	Klaus Neymeyr;Mathias Sawall	2018	SIAM J.

The implementation is based on the lattice structure of the polyphase lters. The lattice coe cients, representing rotations, are approximated by a small number of simple -rotations each of which can be realized by some shift and add operations instead of a multiplication. Since the lattice structure is robust against coe cient quantization we do not loose the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of the lter bank when doing this approximation. Frequency responses of the original and approximated prototype lters are compared in terms of complexity and stopband attenuation.	approximation algorithm;crystal structure;filter bank;modulation;polyphase matrix;polyphase quadrature filter;prototype filter;very-large-scale integration	Tanja Karp;Alfred Mertins;Truong Q.

The recursion transforms LAPACK level-2 algorithms into level3 codes. For this and other reasons recursion usually speeds up the algorithms. Recursion provides a new, easy and very successful way of programming numerical linear algebra algorithms. Several algorithms for matrix factorization have been implemented and tested. Some of these algorithms are already candidates for the LAPACK library. Recursion has also been successfully applied to the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms). The ATLAS system (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) uses a recursive coding of the BLAS. The Cholesky factorization algorithm for positive definite matrices, LU factorization for general matrices, and LDL factorization for symmetric indefinite matrices using recursion are formulated in this paper. Performance graphs of our packed Cholesky and LDL algorithms are presented here.	atlas;algorithm;automatic variable;blas;blocking (computing);cholesky decomposition;code;lapack;lu decomposition;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;qr decomposition;recursion (computer science);subroutine	Bjarne Stig Andersen;Fred G.

d7af1f1acdf77a7ba7bb941d6e8ea2e295bd372c	guest editorial: low-power digital filter design techniques and their applications	digital filter design;low power	Welcome to this Special Issue on Low-Power Digital Filter Design Techniques and Their Applications. Digital filters are essential elements of many signal processing systems and everyday electronics such as radios, cell phones, and biomedical devices. With the ever-increasing popularity of portable devices in communication, medical, and audio/video systems, the computational efficiency and power consumption of digital filters have become increasingly a matter of concern, as digital filters usually involve a large number of arithmetic operations, especially for the finite impulse response (FIR) filters. While FIR filters do have merits in stability, linear phase property, and low coefficient sensitivity, they consume more power than their infinite impulse response (IIR) equivalents in general. There has been consistent effort to develop low-power techniques for FIR filters in the past half century, such as multirate filtering, subfilter approaches, and multiplierless filtering. In multirate filtering, arithmetic units are shifted to the lower frequency end, resulting in reduced power at low operation frequencies. In subfilter approaches, filters are connected in series and/or parallel to form a network, where the frequency responses of different frequency intervals are taken care of by different filters or filter pairs. The overall number of non-trivial coefficients can be significantly reduced by cleverly arranging the subfilters. A very successful subfilter structure is the frequency-response masking (FRM) structure, which was first proposed in 1986 by Y.C. Lim. In 1979 Lim pioneered multiplierless filter-	care-of address;coefficient;digital filter;expanded memory;filter design;finite impulse response;frequency response;infinite impulse response;linear phase;low-power broadcasting;mobile device;mobile phone;series and parallel circuits;signal processing;texture filtering	Yong Lian;Ya Jun Yu	2010	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-009-9110-y	control engineering;electronic engineering;electrical engineering;mathematics	EDA	61.59086870921112	21.421141390436627	81759

In particular, the arguments for the trigonometric functions are always used in a well-defined “modified” bit-inverted order. The first four arguments within any pass yield reductions of multiplications via trigonometric identities. Further, by placing the trigonometric parameters in a look-up table in the same modified order, the minimum number of multiplications for a radix-2 FFT is performed by a simplified algorithm termed the EFFT (Efficient Fast Fourier Transform). This algorithm requires no reference to a bit-inversion procedure or look-up table until the output points are “unscrambled” at the conclusion. The feasibility of performing reasonably-large sized EFFT's on personal computers is examined. It is shown that using standard programming practices and currently available hardware, the execution time for the EFFT may he reduced to few seconds for complex transforms up to 2048 double-precision points. On an IBM Personal Computer, this transform may be performed in as little as 4.4 s.	algorithm;fast fourier transform	Robert Skarjune	1986	Computers & Chemistry	10.1016/0097-8485(86)85012-4	fourier transform;fast fourier transform;twiddle factor;computer science;analytical chemistry;calculus;mathematics;prime-factor fft algorithm;algorithm	EDA	60.57199778741358	27.88240199778067	81918

The work rests on a previous architecture realizing PWA functions with uniform resolution. By using PWA mapping that can be implemented through a few simple functional blocks, it is possible to extend the representation capabilities of the architecture to PWA functions with nonuniform resolution. After defining the mapping and the corresponding functional blocks, the proposed architecture is implemented in a field-programmable gate array, and a simple example is shown.	digital electronics;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;picasa web albums	Tomaso Poggi;Francesco Comaschi;Marco Storace	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2010.2040316	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;computer science;control system;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network;fuzzy control system;field-programmable gate array	EDA	62.15183785318621	19.170390735391365	82153

The classic Newton, Quasi-Newton, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Linear Programming (LP) based methods are discussed and implemented to attack the problem. These various techniques have been compared for their computation effort, accuracy and robustness based on the simulation results for a 6-bus power system. Two full sets of erred data with different variances are generated to provide the basis for this comparison. The linear programming method minimizes the norm-1 objective function and has the advantage of rejecting bad measurements or topological errors. The SQP method is an effective method to solve the problem if the estimation is required to satisfy further equality and inequality constraints.	computation;effective method;ibm power systems;linear programming;loss function;newton;nonlinear system;optimization problem;sequential quadratic programming;simulation;social inequality	Fahimeh Kazempour;Shahab Poshtkouhi	2012	2012 25th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2012.6334858	control engineering;mathematical optimization;linear-fractional programming;nonlinear programming;linear programming;power system simulation;control theory;mathematics;sequential quadratic programming;active set method;newton's method;electric power system;quadratic programming;robustness	EDA	64.60906742235808	31.698810521215908	83660
e0086d2ce9cf21abcad015441cffbbb638c11f66	an analysis of the velocity updating rule of the particle swarm optimization algorithm	swarm intelligence;continuous optimization;particle swarm optimization;rotation matrices	The particle swarm optimization algorithm includes three vectors associated with each particle: inertia, personal, and social influence vectors. The personal and social influence vectors are typically multiplied by random diagonal matrices (often referred to as random vectors) resulting in changes in their lengths and directions. This multiplication, in turn, influences the variation of the particles in the swarm. In this paper we examine several issues associated with the multiplication of personal and social influence vectors by such random matrices, these include: (1) Uncontrollable changes in the length and direction of these vectors resulting in delay in convergence or attraction to locations far from quality solutions in some situations (2) Weak direction alternation for the vectors that are aligned closely to coordinate axes resulting in preventing the swarm from further improvement in some situations, and (3) limitation in particle movement to one orthant resulting in premature convergence in some situations. To overcome these issues, we use randomly generated rotation matrices (rather than the random diagonal matrices) in the velocity updating M. R. Bonyadi (B) · Z.

But the exact module boundaries are often blurred by the uncertainty whether given matrix elements are module members or outliers. This paper provides an algorithm to determine module sizes. As a consequence the algorithm also decides which matrix elements are outliers. Matrix elements are weighted by their Affinity — an exponential function of the off-diagonality. The module size is given by the positive consecutive elements of the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of this weighted symmetrized Modularity Matrix. By means of case studies, we illustrate the idea that outliers not only indicate the need for system redesign, but explicitly point out to problematic design spots. This work extends the applicability of linear algebra spectral methods to Modularity Matrices, at higher software abstraction levels than previously shown.	modularity (networks)	Iaakov Exman	2015	International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering	10.1142/S0218194015500308	eigendecomposition of a matrix;defective matrix;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;computer science;modularity;machine learning;decoupling;function composition;diagonalizable matrix;cluster analysis;programming language;modal matrix;block matrix;diagonal matrix;spectral method	SE	66.29237680597623	26.733051856620737	84088

The proposed scheme adopts appropriate formats for representing the filter coefficients and the data. It also employs a scaled representation for the stepsize that has a time-varying mantissa and also a time-varying exponent. Using these and an upper bound on the step-size mantissa, update relations for the filter weight mantissas and exponent are developed, taking care so that neither overflow occurs, nor are quantities which are already very small multiplied directly. Separate update relations are also worked out for the step size mantissa. The proposed scheme employs mostly fixed-point-based operations, and thus achieves considerable speedup over its floatingpoint-based counterpart.	algorithm;application-specific integrated circuit;coefficient;computation;dynamic range;field-programmable gate array;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point arithmetic;performance per watt;significand;simulation;speedup	Mrityunjoy Chakraborty;Rafiahamed Shaik;Moon Ho Lee	2007	EURASIP J.

These errors are corrected in the comment. It is shown that the correct values of radial moments can be computed from numerical integration as exact computation of radial moments is not possible when the difference between moment order and repetition is odd.	computation;pattern recognition letters;radial (radio)	Ekta Walia;Chandan Singh;Rahul Upneja	2012	Pattern Recognition Letters	10.1016/j.patrec.2012.07.026	velocity moments;mathematical optimization;method of moments;mathematics;geometry;statistics	Vision	54.84663883792972	31.916095013919964	85137

In several applications, there is the need of either decreasing the sampling rate of a signal preserving part of its spectrum or increasing the sampling rate with minimum spectrum degradation. In this paper, we will develop a method based on cosine-modulated filterbanks to accomplish this task. An analysis filterbank is used to divide the spectrum into subbands. Another filterbank, with a different number of channels, is used to reconstruct the spectrum contained in part of (or all) the subbands. The ratio between the input and output sampling rates is equal to the ratio between the analysis downsampling and synthesis upsampling factors. The problem becomes that of designing the prototypes of the analysis and synthesis filterbanks. Several numerical examples of filterbanks design are presented.	modulation	Fabrizio Argenti	2002	Signal Processing	10.1016/S0165-1684(01)00189-X	signal reconstruction;spectrum;frequency spectrum;electronic engineering;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;filter bank;mathematics;sampling;modulation	Vision	58.93711496416127	18.253352838095278	85807

Multichannel FIR filters with different number of delay elements for each input channel are allowed. The first algorithm uses two terms Levinson type recursions. The later utilizes Schur type formulas for updating the pertinent parameters, thus being suitable for parallel implementation. Multichannel FIR filters are described by a multi-index [ m  1 ,  m  2 ,…,  m   κ  ] where  m   i   equals the number of delay elements associated with the  i -input channel,  i  = 1, 2, …,  k . The novel feature of the proposed algorithms is that they employ updates of the form [ m  1 ,  m  2 , …,  m   i  , …,  m   k  ] → [ m  1 ,  m  2 , …,  m   i   + 1, …,  m   k  ]. Therefore, and in contrast to existing methods, they offer the greatest possible maneuverability in the index space. This flexibility can be taken into advantage when the true index is not known, except from being an element of a set. Computationally efficient paths that search for the true index are described. If the true filter order [ p  1 ,  p  2 , …,  p   k  ] is known, the filter coefficients are computed at  P  = ( p  1  +  p  2  + … +  p   k  ) steps, by a repetitive application of single step recursions. The computational complexity of the method is O( kP  2 ), while execution time could be reduced to O(1) or O( P ) if the Schur type algorithm is implemented in a parallel processing environment on a rectangular or on a linear array, respectively. The final filter can be approached by  P !/( p  1 ! p  2 !… p   k  !) distinct order updating paths, each time passing through different lower dimension filters. This feature can be utilized for the efficient determination of the  order  of a multichannel process, accelerating the exhaustive searching procedure required by most of the order determination criteria. Finally, the mean squared error is considered with potential applications to the optimal two-dimensional (2-D) FIR filtering and 2-D system identification.	algorithm;finite impulse response;recursion (computer science)	George-Othon Glentis;Nicholas Kalouptsidis	1994	Signal Processing	10.1016/0165-1684(94)90011-6	mathematical optimization;computer science;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics;algorithm	Robotics	59.59051352299163	20.59558965012374	86393

By using kernel transforms and Taylor expansions, a DWT is approximated by a linear sum of discrete moments. This enables us to use computational techniques developed for computing moments to compute DWTs efficiently. The amount of multiplications used in our method is O(Nlog/sub 2/N/log/sub 2/log/sub 2/N) and is superior to the O(Nlog/sub 2/N) in the conventional DWT. The proposed algorithm achieves a simple computational structure and naturally deals with any sequence lengths.	approximation algorithm;computation;discrete wavelet transform	Jianguo Liu;Y. Z.

It has been shown that the approximate quantum Fourier transform can be successfully used for the phase estimation instead of the full one. The lower bound for the probability to get a correct result in a single run of the algorithm has been obtained. The validity of the results is demonstrated by simulation of the algorithm in case of the phase shift operator using the QuantumCircuit package written in the Wolfram Mathematica language. All relevant calculations and visualizations are done with the Wolfram Mathematica system.		Alexander N.

By using our proposed technique, the external input-output behavior of the DSP remains linear, and identical to that of the prototype, despite the nonlinear behavior of its internal signals. We explore the specific application of our technique to instantaneous companding, in which the introduced nonlinearities compress the dynamic range of the internal signals, so that the latter span most of the available bits in the system, thus improving the signal-to-noise-plus-distortion-ratio at the output, for low to medium input signal levels. We discuss the choice of nonlinear functions for this companding application, and we present an efficient hardware implementation for the standard 15-segment piecewise-linear approximation to the 255-μ law. We compare the performance and hardware overhead of our technique with that of other companding architectures.	bit error rate;companding;digital signal processor;distortion;dynamic range;linear approximation;linear time-invariant theory;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);prototype;quantization (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;time complexity;time-invariant system	Aaron E.

The output parameters D1 and D2 are normally distributed on the interval ( ~ , + oo). The method is exact even in the tails. This algorithm is one of a class of normal deviate generators, which we shall call """"chi-squared projections"""" [1, 2]. An algorithm of this class has two stages. The first stage selects a random number L from a x~-distribution. The second stage calculates the sine and cosine of a random angle 0. The generated nornlal deviates are given by L sin (0) and L cos (0). The two stages can be altered independently. In particular, as better x22 random generators are developed, they can replace the first stage. (The negative exponential distribution is the same as that of x~2.) The fastest exact method previously published is Algorithm 267 [4], which includes a comparison with earlier algorithms. It is a straight chi-squared projection. Our algorithm differs from it by using van Neumann rejection to generate sin (¢) and cos (¢), [4, = 20], without generating ¢ explicitly [3]. This significantly enhances speed by eliminating the calls to the sin and cos functions. The author wishes to express his gratitude to Professor George Forsythe for his help in developing the algorithm. REFERENCES 1. Box, G., AND MULLER, M. A note on the generation of normal deviates.

A new computationally efficient alternative is presented to the Levinson recurrence on either the Hermitian or skew-Hermitian polynomial spaces. This approach also leads to an entirely new algorithm for solving systems of linear equations when the coefficient matrix is Hermitian Toeplitz or real symmetric Toeplitz. Analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithms presented is also performed, and it is shown that these algorithms lead to significant improvements in the computational complexity as compared to the previously best-known recursive algorithms. They also provide further insight into the mathematical properties of the structurally rich Toeplitz matrices.	levinson recursion;linear equation;recurrence relation;system of linear equations;time complexity;toeplitz hash algorithm	Hari Krishna;Salvatore D.

For systems where an exact convolution is too complex we propose an approximation using a partitioned truncated singular value decomposition (PTSVD) filter. In this method the filter is first partitioned into P segments of length N, the singular value decomposition is performed on the N × P matrix, and only the largest M singular values and associated vectors are used to reconstruct the filter. We show an efficient real-time implementation utilizing a filter bank and tapped delay line and then further simplify the structure utilizing an IIR model. Finally, we show an application of the method in a simulated reverberation engine and compare complexity and memory load to state of the art methods.	approximation;complexity;convolution;filter bank;infinite impulse response;real-time clock;real-time locating system;signal processing;singular value decomposition	Joshua Atkins;Adam Strauss	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6637632	overlap–add method;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;reverberation;mathematics;convolution;singular value decomposition;approximation theory	Robotics	59.00421174641979	21.410541009248796	92122

However, when the graph signal is time-varying, the state of the art FIR graph filters do not capture the time variations of the input signal. In this work, we propose an extension of FIR graph filters to capture also the signal variations over time. By considering also the past values of the graph signal, the proposed FIR graph filter extends naturally to a 2-dimensional filter, capturing jointly the signal variations over the graph and time. As a particular case of interest we focus on 2-dimensional separable graph-temporal filters, which can be implemented in a distributed fashion at the price of higher communication costs. This allows us to give filter specifications and perform the design independently in the graph and temporal domain. The work is concluded by analyzing the proposed approach for stochastic graph signals, where the first and second order moments of the output signal are characterized.	connectivity (graph theory);finite impulse response;signal processing	Elvin Isufi;Geert Leus;Paolo Banelli	2016	2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)	10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7905873	mathematical optimization;frequency response;electronic engineering;linear filter;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;infinite impulse response;frequency domain	ML	54.15380439421554	18.652430934206897	92649

Let m, n and r be the number of various λs, the matrix order and the number of repeated loops in the SVD algorithm, respectively. Due to the large amount of overlap between subarrays, the time complexity of our solution is O(3mn) whereas the straightforward systolic implementation requires O(⌈7/2mn⌈+4rm) times steps. The number of PEs and delays is O(⌈cn2⌈), where c = 37/8 for our solution and c = 5/8 for the straight forward solution.	computation;systolic array	Gabriel Oksa	1999		10.1007/3-540-49164-3_6	computer simulation;time complexity;combinatorics;parallel computing;systolic array;matrix calculus;computer science;mathematics;geometry;parallel algorithm;singular value decomposition;algorithm	Theory	60.81616554901625	25.480573454633547	93312

We make extensive use of the discrete Fourier transform in doing so. Our approach computes the object sample values directly as a linear combination of the projections sample values. The well-known ill-posedness of the limited angle tomography problem manifests itself in some very large coefficients in these linear combinations; these coefficients (which are computed off-line) provide a direct sensitivity measure of the reconstruction samples to the projections samples. The discrete nature of the problem implies that the projections must also take on integer values; this means noise can be rejected. This makes the formula practical.	discrete tomography	Andrew E.

In contrast to previously proposed FrNTT, our approach does not require the construction of any number-theoretic transform (NTT) eigenvectors set. This allows us to obtain an FrNTT matrix by means of a closed-form expression corresponding to a linear combination of integer powers of the respective NTT matrix. Fractional Fourier, Hartley, cosine and sine number-theoretic transforms are developed. We show that fast algorithms applicable to ordinary NTT can also be used to compute the proposed FrNTT. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between fractional Fourier and Hartley number-theoretic transforms, and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed FrNTT to a recently introduced image encryption scheme.	fractional fourier transform;hartley (unit);theory	Paulo Hugo E.

However, due to the irrational-number distances between wavelets, its calculation amount is very large. In this paper, based on the real-valued tight wavelet frame, a practical design of a real-valued discrete wavelet transform (DWT) having PTI is proposed. In this transform, all the distances between wavelets are multiples of 1/4, and its transform and inverse transform are calculated fast by decomposition and reconstruction algorithms at the sacrifice of a tight wavelet frame. However, the real-valued DWT achieves an approximate tight wavelet frame.	discrete wavelet transform	Hiroshi Toda;Zhong Zhang;Takashi Imamura	2014	IJWMIP	10.1142/S0219691314600054	wavelet;constant q transform;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;harmonic wavelet transform;second-generation wavelet transform;continuous wavelet transform;cascade algorithm;mathematics;geometry;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;discrete wavelet transform;fast wavelet transform;lifting scheme;wavelet transform	EDA	56.09932541141654	20.716909637776197	96534

Radiu-r signed-digit number representation and periodically time-varying (PTV) coefficients are used to obtain multiplier-free realizations. The PTV coefficients, together with one hold-and-scale unit at the input and one scale-adddownsample unit at the output, are utilized effectively to distribute the required computations to the extent that coefficients are highly simplified. The coefficients in the realizations are designed to take values from either the ternary set (0 , fl} or the quinary set (0, fl, f2}. Their values can be easily obtained by mapping from the target filter coefficients using a radix-r signed-digit number representation. We show that fairly high precision can be achieved by these realizations.	coefficient;computation;finite impulse response;radix tree;scale space	Sachin P. Ghanekar;Sawasd Tantaratana	1995	IEEE Trans.

In any transform coding scheme, the central operation is the reduction of correlation and thereby, with appropriate coding of the transform coefficients, allows data compression to be achieved. The objective of data encoding is to transform a data array into a statistically uncorrelated set. This step is typically considered a ‘‘decorrelation’’ step, because in the case of unitary transformations, the resulting transform coefficients are relatively uncorrelated. Most unitary transforms have the tendency to compact the signal energy into relatively few coefficients. The compaction of energy thus achieved permits a prioritization of the spectral coefficients, with the most energetic ones receiving a greater allocation of encoding bits. The transform efficiency and ease of implementation are to a large extent mutually incompatible. There are various transforms such as KarhunenLoeve, discrete cosine transforms, etc., but the choice depends on the amount of reconstruction error that can be tolerated and the computational resources available. We apply an approximate Fourier series expansion (AFE) to sampled one-dimensional signals and images, and investigate some mathematical properties. Additionally, we extend the expansion to an approximate cosine expansion (ACE) and show that, for the purpose of data compression with minimum error reconstruction of images, the performance of ACE is better than AFE. For comparison purposes, the results are also compared with a discrete cosine transform (DCT). © 1997 SPIE and IS&T.

[1] and [2], though in [1], a different nomenclature was used. “Cyclic filter banks” is a superset of the traditional non-cyclic filter banks, and readily suggest implementation of subband filtering through DFT. In this paper we show that the DFT implementation is also advantageous for the conventional FIR filter banks. The discussions in this paper concentrate on the more frequently used 2-band decompositions. However, extensions to M bands is not difficult.	filter bank;finite impulse response	Mahalingam Ramkumar;G. V. Anand;Ali N.

This sparse factorization represents a fast algorithm for the matrix–vector multiplication withM. The factorization method consists of two essential steps. First, a combinatorial search is used to compute a suitable symmetry of M in the form of a pair of group representations. Second, the group representations are decomposed stepwise, which yields factorized decomposition matrices and determines a sparse factorization of M. The focus of this article is the first step, finding the symmetries. All algorithms described have been implemented in the libraryAREP. We present examples for automatically generated sparse factorizations—and hence fast algorithms—for a class of matrices corresponding to digital signal processing transforms including the discrete Fourier, cosine, Hartley, and Haar transforms. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

4bccb479af78bf5db31447bc38a58659d0b8a14d	a survey of distributed optimization and control algorithms for electric power systems		Historically, centrally computed algorithms have been the primary means of power system optimization and control. With increasing penetrations of distributed energy resources requiring optimization and control of power systems with many controllable devices, distributed algorithms have been the subject of significant research interest. This paper surveys the literature of distributed algorithms with applications to optimization and control of power systems. In particular, this paper reviews distributed algorithms for offline solution of optimal power flow (OPF) problems as well as online algorithms for real-time solution of OPF, optimal frequency control, optimal voltage control, and optimal wide-area control problems.	augmented lagrangian method;distributed algorithm;ibm power systems;lagrange multiplier;lagrangian relaxation;mathematical optimization;online algorithm;online and offline;online optimization;physical security;privacy;program optimization;real-time clock	Daniel K.

The standard inversion procedure for such transforms is a finite expansion in terms of the analyzing wavelet. While this approximation works quite well for many signals, it fails to achieve good accuracy or requires an excessive number of scales for others. This paper proposes several algorithms that provide more adequate inversion and compares them in the case of Morlet wavelets. In the process, both practical and theoretical issues for the inversion of nonorthogonal wavelet transforms are discussed.	algorithm;approximation;discrete wavelet transform;signal processing	Mark J.

Savoie, France, 1995; Ocadis, Ph.D. Thesis, Univ. Grenoble, France, 1985). These have to be decorrelated so that each component of the colour image can be studied separately. The Karhunen}Loève transformation provides optimal decorrelation of these colour data. However, this transformation is related to the colour distribution in the image, i.e. to the statistical properties of the colour image and is therefore dependent on the image under analysis. In order to enjoy the advantages of direct, independent and rapid transformation and the advantages of the Karhunen}Loève properties, this paper presents the study of the approximation of the Karhunen}Loève transformation. The approximation is arrived at through exploitation of the properties of Toeplitz matrices. The search for eigenvectors of a Toeplitz matrix shows that complex or real orthogonal mappings such as the discrete Fourier transform and its decompositions approximate the Karhunen}Loève transformation in the case of """"rst-order Markov processes.

However in many practical situations of interest, models are constrained structurally so that they only have a few degrees of freedom relative to their ambient dimension. This paper provides a general framework to convert notions of simplicity into convex penalty functions, resulting in convex optimization solutions to linear, underdetermined inverse problems. The class of simple models considered are those formed as the sum of a few atoms from some (possibly infinite) elementary atomic set; examples include well-studied cases such as sparse vectors (e.g., signal processing, statistics) and low-rank matrices (e.g., control, statistics), as well as several others including sums of a few permutations matrices (e.g., ranked elections, multiobject tracking), low-rank tensors (e.g., computer vision, neuroscience), orthogonal matrices (e.g., machine learning), and atomic measures (e.g., system identification). The convex programming formulation is based on minimizing the norm induced by the convex hull of the atomic set; this norm is referred to as the atomic norm. The facial structure of the atomic norm ball carries a number of favorable properties that are useful for recovering simple models, and an analysis of the underlying convex geometry provides sharp estimates of the number of generic measurements required for exact and robust recovery of models from partial information. These estimates are based on computing the Gaussian widths of tangent cones to the atomic norm ball. When the atomic set has algebraic structure the resulting optimization problems can be solved or approximated via semidefinite programming. The quality of these approximations affects the number of measurements required for recovery, and this tradeoff is characterized via some examples. Thus this work extends the catalog of simple models (beyond sparse vectors and low-rank matrices) that can be recovered from limited linear information via tractable convex programming.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;computer vision;convex hull;convex optimization;linear algebra;machine learning;mathematical optimization;semidefinite programming;signal processing;sparse matrix;system identification;well-posed problem	Venkat Chandrasekaran;Benjamin Recht;Pablo A.

With the advent of power system monitoring and communication technology collectively known as the “smart grid,” an opportunity exists to apply signal processing techniques to monitoring and control of PV arrays. In this paper a monitoring system which provides real-time measurements of each PV module's voltage and current is considered. A fault detection algorithm formulated as a clustering problem and addressed using the robust minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator is described; its performance on simulated instances of arc and ground faults is evaluated. The algorithm is found to perform well on many types of faults commonly occurring in PV arrays.	algorithm;cluster analysis;fault detection and isolation;magnetic circular dichroism;real-time clock;real-time computing;signal processing;system monitor	Henry Braun;Santoshi T.

The length of lines and their segments is derived jirst from equations based on semiempirical formulas and these values of length are used as initial values for AWEbased simulation. For the simulated length of line, the delay at receivers is presented by multivariable Taylor series with respect to length of segments for multi-pin nets. Partial derivatives for this representation are computed numerically on AWE simulation step. Resulting linear delay functions are used in linear programming formulation to find maximal lengths consistent with timing bounds. This work will help to reduce a number of iterations in PCB and MCM design and thus influence a length of design cycle and quality of solutions.	computation;iteration;linear programming formulation;maximal set;multi-chip module;numerical analysis;printed circuit board;semi-empirical quantum chemistry method;simulation	Jaebum Lee;Eugene Shragowitz;David J.

We assume that the values of a linear operator may be elements of an infinite dimensional space G. It seems reasonable to look for an approximation as a linear combination of some elements gi from the space G and compute only the coefficients ci of this linear combination. We study the case when the elements gi are fixed and compare it with the case where the gi can be chosen arbitrarily. We show examples of linear problems where a significant output data compression is possible by the use of a nonlinear algorithm, and this nonlinear algorithm is much better than all linear algorithms. We also provide an example of a linear problem for which one piece of information is enough whereas an optimal (minimal cost) algorithm must use information of much higher cardinality. 2000	algorithm;approximation;coefficient;data compression;information-based complexity;linear programming;nonlinear system;system of linear equations	Erich Novak;Henryk Wozniakowski	2000	J.

82d133c0c5939b1fc3a208eaaea808e3e5e355c1	convex optimization as a tool for correcting dissimilarity matrices for regular minimality		Fechnerian scaling as developed by Dzhafarov and Colonius (e.g., Dzhafarov and Colonius, J Math Psychol 51:290–304, 2007) aims at imposing a metric on a set of objects based on their pairwise dissimilarities. A necessary condition for this theory is the law of Regular Minimality (e.g., Dzhafarov EN, Colonius H (2006) Regular minimality: a fundamental law of discrimination. In: Colonius H, Dzhafarov EN (eds) Measurement and representation of sensations. Erlbaum, Mahwah, pp. 1–46 ). In this paper, we solve the problem of correcting a dissimilarity matrix for Regular Minimality by phrasing it as a convex optimization problem in Euclidean metric space. In simulations, we demonstrate the usefulness of this correction procedure.	convex optimization	Matthias Trendtel;Ali Ünlü	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-00035-0_16	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	Logic	68.04591071815216	21.049952623891823	106902

The user m~y supply his own definitiml of simple numbers. Applications are to the construction of scatter diagrams, histograms and t, ables. A suggested formula for the number of interwfls is given which depends on the number of items to be displayed. Basic goals in the preparation of """"packaged"""" computer programs for general-purpose use by nonprogrammers are: (1) simple input to the program, and (2) simple and easy-to-read output. In the plotting of scatter diagrams and histograms, and in the formation of ¢.ross tabulations from such programs, one encounters the problem of determining """"reasonable"""" scales. Such scales should be as close as possible to tim scale one would use if preparing a plot by hand and should require 8 minimmn of specification and effort. Traditional rules for the choice of origin and scale for graphical presentation 8re fairly similar throughout various scientific fields. It is usual to find that the chosen scale (or its continuation) will have the origin (or zero) as a major division point on the scale and, in most cases, a number of major pohits along the plotting ~,xis are labeled and finer subdivisions are indicated. This paper provides a simple and efficient computational procedure for pro-riding scale subdivisions and for determining appropriate numbers of intervals for histograms, scatter diagrams and tables. We first define what we mean by a """"reasonable"""" scale. We ask that a scale have the following properties: (1) the scale marks or division points should be simple numbers; and (2) the plotted points of the function should be positioned centrally, entirely within the borders of a rectangular frame, and should ap-proximatdy fill this frame. This definition is similar to that of T. Giamno [1].

The M-D DCT and IDCT are first converted into condensed one-dimensional (1-D) DCT and discrete sine transform (DST) with a regular preprocessing procedure. The recursive filters for condensed 1-D DCT/DST are then derived by using Chebyshev polynomials to compute M-D DCT/IDCT without data transposition. The proposed structures require fewer recursive loops than traditional 1-D recursive structures, which are realized in M passes and (M-1) data transposition by the so-called row-column approach. With advantages of fewer recursive loops and no transposition memory, the proposed structures attain more accurate results and less power consumption than traditional row-column structures. The proposed recursive M-D DCT/IDCT structures are suitable for very large-scale integration implementation due to regular and modular features.	chebyshev polynomials;discrete cosine transform;discrete sine transform;integrated circuit;moore–penrose pseudoinverse;polynomial;preprocessor;recursion;very-large-scale integration	Che-Hong Chen;Bin-Da Liu;Jar-Ferr Yang	2005	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2005.852935	multidimensional signal processing;chebyshev polynomials;mathematical optimization;recursion;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;discrete sine transform;discrete cosine transform;mathematics;very-large-scale integration;approximation theory	Visualization	58.085703757407984	21.51219527995901	108887

However, in many applications, one requires nonuniform sampling in the frequency domain, i.e., anonuniform FT. Several papers have described fast approximations for the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper presents a method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal in a minmax sense. The proposed method minimizes the worst-case approximation error over all signals of unit norm. Unlike many previous methods for the nonuniform FT, the proposed method easily generalizes to multidimensional signals. We are investigating this method as a fast algorithm for computing the Radon transform in 2D iterative tomographic image reconstruction.	algorithm;approximation error;best, worst and average case;computation;fast fourier transform;interpolation;iterative method;iterative reconstruction;maxima and minima;minimax;nonuniform sampling;sampling (signal processing);signal processing	Bradley P.

The algorithms are based on concepts from fast methods of complex multiplication in which a surrogate is used for the square root of minus one. Previous methods imposed the structure of a finite ring or field on the problem. The new algorithms also use a surrogate, but do not require the imposed structure and its inherent rounding. The number of real matrix multiplications required can be reduced from four to two for even dimension, and to 2 + l / N z for odd dimension N . The disadvantage of the new algorithms is the imposition of a requirement on the structure of one of the two complex matrices being multiplied. The 2 x 2 case of the algorithm can be adapted to computing Givens rotations, resulting in a 17 percent savings in real matrix multiplications over previous fast algorithms requiring three multiplications.

The second procedure is able to reduce not only the leakage effects due to windowing but also the distortion that appears when the rotation frequency changes slowly. This second method uses an additional sensor, giving one pulse per revolution, to transform the input (asynchronous) signal into a synchronous signal having a fixed number of samples per revolution. The performance and effectiveness of both procedures are illustrated by means of simulation examples.	acoustic lobing;distortion;quantum phase estimation algorithm;simulation;spectral leakage	Ignacio Santamaría;Carlos Pantaleón;Jesús Ibáñez-Diaz;Enrique Gomez-Cosio	1998	IEEE Trans.

This version is well adapted for use in a special-purpose computer designed for the purpose. It is shown that only three operators are needed. One operator replaces successive pairs of data points by their sums and differences. The second operator performs a fixed permutation which is an ideal shuffle of the data. The third operator permits the multiplication of a selected subset of the data by a common complex multiplier. If, as seems reasonable, the slowest operation is the complex multiplications required, then, for reasonably sized date sets—e.g. 512 complex numbers—parallelization by the method developed should allow an increase of speed over the serial use of the Fast Fourier Transform by about two orders of magnitude. It is suggested that a machine to realize the speed improvement indicated is quite feasible. The analysis is based on the use of the Kronecker product of matrices. It is suggested that this form is of general use in the development and classification of various modifications and extensions of the algorithm.	algorithm;data point;embedded system;fast fourier transform;fink protocol;parallel computing;parallel processing (dsp implementation);statistical classification	Marshall C.

b91309a463348be0ac845dd4a137f66b6f36c7ab	complexity reduction algorithm for optimum quantizer design based on amplitude sparseness		The design of an optimum quantizer can be formulated as an optimization problem that finds the quantization indices that minimize the quantization error. One solution of the optimization problem is DP quantization, an approach based on dynamic programming. It is known that a quantized signal does not always contain signal values that can be represented with a given bit-depth. This property is called amplitude sparseness. Because quantization is the amplitude discretization of signal value, amplitude sparseness is closely related to the design of the quantizer. Since signal values with zero frequency do not affect quantization error, there is the potential to reduce complexity when designing the optimum quantizer by skipping the processing of signal values that have zero frequency. However, conventional methods on DP quantization do not design for amplitude sparseness and so are unduly complex. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that yields an optimum quantizer that minimizes quantization error with reduced complexity given the existence of amplitude sparseness.	algorithm;amplitude-shift keying;discretization;dynamic programming;mathematical optimization;neural coding;optimization problem;quantization (signal processing);reduction (complexity);sentinel value	Yukihiro Bandoh;Seishi Takamura;Atsushi Shimizu	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462516	probability density function;reduction (complexity);mathematical optimization;dynamic programming;quantization (signal processing);amplitude;quantization (physics);discretization;algorithm;optimization problem;computer science	Robotics	62.08274528654789	19.626092745165117	113950

We also demonstrate that this enables us to solve many important problems in the max algebra and the max-min-plus algebra such as matrix decompositions, construction of matrices with a given characteristic polynomial, state space transformations and the (minimal) state space realization problem.	algebraic equation;algorithm;characteristic polynomial;complementarity theory;computation;heuristic;linear complementarity problem;maxima and minima;requirement;state space	Bart De Schutter;Bart De Moor	1996	Discrete Event Dynamic Systems	10.1007/BF01797235	companion matrix;mathematical optimization;polynomial matrix;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;homogeneous polynomial;alternating polynomial;state space;stable polynomial;state-space representation;degree of a polynomial;mathematics;monic polynomial;factorization of polynomials;matrix polynomial;characteristic polynomial;matrix decomposition;minimal polynomial;reciprocal polynomial;polynomial remainder theorem;square-free polynomial;polarization of an algebraic form;algorithm;polynomial	DB	66.86651703704625	21.779790700835154	113974

First, although only the Ruritanian mapping is used for input indexing, it requires to perform a series of complicated tests and additions which even outweigh the computational effort of the PFDCT. Second, the additions mentioned above are not carried out in an in-place form. This implies that an auxiliary data array is required to buffer the temporary results generated during the additions. Otherwise, erroneous results will be obtained. We propose an efficient indexing scheme for the computation of the PFDCT. By suitably swapping the data, all the additions can be carried out in an in-place form. Furthermore the number of tests required to perform on the indices of the data is greatly reduced. They are achieved by considering the special properties of the Ruritanian mapping. >	discrete cosine transform	Daniel Pak-Kong Lun	1994		10.1109/ICASSP.1994.389989	arithmetic;fourier transform;search engine indexing;discrete mathematics;computer science;theoretical computer science;digital signal processing;discrete cosine transform;mathematics;software testing;computational complexity theory	Crypto	57.41817343330102	21.580285393393506	114604

Fractional wavelet decomposition is based on two-channel unbalanced lifting structures whereby it is possible to decompose a given discretetime signal x[n] sampled with period T into two sub-signals x1[n] and x2[n] whose average sampling periods are pT and qT , respectively. Fractions p and q are rational numbers satisfying the condition: 1/p+1/q = 1. Filters used in the lifting structure are designed using the Lagrange interpolation formula. 2-d separable and non-separable extensions of the proposed fractional wavelet transform are developed. Using a non-separable unbalanced lifting structure, directional subimages for five different directions are obtained.	data structure;fast wavelet transform;fractional wavelet transform;interpolation;lagrange multiplier;lagrange polynomial;lifting scheme;sampling (signal processing);unbalanced circuit	Furkan Keskin;A.

However, most works assume graph signals that are static with respect to time, which is a limitation even in comparison to classical DSP formulations where signals are generally sequences that evolve over time. Several earlier works on adaptive networks have addressed problems involving streaming data over graphs by developing effective learning strategies that are well-suited to dynamic data scenarios, in a manner that generalizes adaptive signal processing concepts to the graph domain. The objective of this paper is to blend concepts from adaptive networks and graph signal processing to propose new useful tools for adaptive graph signal processing.	adaptive algorithm;coefficient;dynamic data;experiment;semantics (computer science);signal processing;stream (computing)	Roula Nassif;Cédric Richard;Jie Chen;Ali H.

c4dcff5ddf6d153760c553a6a8d0a63b4075d4ee	sequency-based mapped real transform: properties and applications		Transforms are tools that decompose a signal into alternate representation. Fourier transform is very popular for frequency domain analysis, and the computations are performed in the complex domain. Mapped real transform (MRT), whose basis functions are rectangular in nature, was evolved by modification of discrete Fourier transform and involves real additions only. But it is expansive and redundant. Unique MRT was developed to remove the redundancies present in MRT. Visual representation of unique MRT coefficients was explored to establish a transform, according to sequency, entitled sequency-based MRT (SMRT). It is a sequency ordered, addition oriented, integer-to-integer transform, whose basis functions are orthogonal. This paper gives an insight into the visual representation, transform kernel and placement of the (N^2) unique MRT coefficients corresponding to an (N times N) data, for N a power of 2. Different properties of SMRT, computation of statistical parameters from transform coefficients are also included. Scope of the proposed transform in pattern generation is also investigated in addition to the established applications.		V. L. Jaya;R.

The injector coefficients are optimized for finite wordlength performance while the tapped coefficients synthesize the transfer function of the filters. For an N th-order digital filter, the proposed “tapped numerator” and “injected numerator” hybrid lattice structure, after optimization, has only 2N+1 multipliers. It is not only canonic in the number of multipliers but also possesses much improved finite wordlength properties such as very low parameter sensitivity and very uniform signal powers across signal nodes. The excellent finite wordlength performance of the proposed structure is demonstrated with a design example and compared with those of traditional structures, including several well-known lattice structures.	coefficient;crystal structure;digital filter;expanded memory;infinite impulse response;lattice network;lattice phase equaliser;mathematical optimization;transfer function	Gang Li;Yong Ching Lim;Chaogeng Huang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2077635	signal processing;control theory;mathematics;transfer function	Visualization	60.85273837202581	18.8718592257064	116965

Its mechanisms have been also extended by both adapting the sensing stage to the actual class of input signals, and granting it the ability to reject disturbances. Regrettably, the resulting design flow entails the solution of two optimization problems with a potentially huge number of variables. This work overcomes this impasse by proposing a Project-Gradient-Descend method algorithm that drastically reduces the required CPU time to obtain a solution.

The algorithms are called 2∗1 output algorithms if two output values of one function (variable identification) are specified by the system of recurrence equations for each index point in the algorithm. The algorithm is in free form if the indexes of these two values are not dependent. Two standard classes are determined by this criteria: the nearest neighbour and the all pair form. For example the sorting algorithm can be expressed in the all pair form i.e., the linear insertion algorithm or in the nearest neighbour form i.e., the bubble sort algorithm. However these algorithms are different in their nature. A procedure to eliminate the computational broadcast for the all pair 2∗1output algorithm has been proposed by the authors in [1]. The result obtained by implementing this procedure was a localized form of the algorithm and a system of uniform recurrence equations by eliminating the computational and data broadcast....	algorithm;digital signal processor;very-large-scale integration	David J.

In addition, we study some newproperties of the Hadamard product and explore the inverse problem associated with the established connection, which facilitates diverse applications. Furthermore, we propose a matrix-variate generalized Birnbaum–Saunders (GBS) distribution. Three representations of the matrix-variate GBS density are provided, one of them by using the mentioned connection. The main motivation of this article is based on the fact that the representation of the matrixvariate GBS density based on element-by-element specification does not allow matrix transformations. Consequently, some statistical procedures based on this representation, such as multivariate data analysis and statistical shape theory, cannot be performed. For this reason, the primary goal of this work is to obtain amatrix representation of thematrixvariate GBS density that is useful for some statistical applications. When the GBS density is expressed by means of a matrix representation based on the Hadamard product, such a density is defined in terms of the original matrices, as is common for many matrix-variate distributions, allowing matrix transformations to be handled in a natural way and then suitable statistical procedures to be developed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

To resolve these flaws of the existing methods, two new methods (named as Mehar method and Keerat method) are proposed for solving the same systems of fuzzy complex linear equations.	coefficient;complex system;finite element method;fuzzy number;linear equation;system of linear equations	Jeevan Jot Kaur;Amit Kumar	2016	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/JIFS-16134	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;membership function;defuzzification;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;fuzzy subalgebra;fuzzy number;fuzzy measure theory;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system	AI	55.341145360642905	28.69321425199399	122093

Direct computation of CWT via FFT requires O(Nlog/sub 2/N) operations per scale, where N is the data length. This paper compares two fast algorithms that compute CWT at a cost of O(N) per scale. One is a trous algorithm and the other is Shensa algorithm. Although both are based on the multiresolution analysis structure, their accuracy in computing CWT is quite different. Theoretical error expression is derived and simulation results are presented for comparison.

One is to employ matrix factorization through revealing the intrinsic relationship among several existing famous algorithms, which is regarded as an effective guide for exploring new algorithms. The other is to make use of the orthogonal property of the DCT matrix. As long as the recursive kernel of an algorithm is orthogonal, there must be a twin fast DCT algorithm of it. Matrix factorization is applied through the research and can be used to show how data flows and compute the computational complexity easily. At the end of this paper, we also present a new fast algorithm for DCT.

c11aaf0f83d9f6366e8fc1dca92ec97de33bd9ff	sine and cosine calculations		Finding the answer to any transcendental equation, however simple (e.g.y = sin x), using computing methods is always a lengthy and diff icult process: the difficulty arises from trying to choose the method that minimizes execution time and memory occupation whilst maximizing the accuracy. Computing solutions have in the past generally revolved around table-driven methods or other interpolative techniques, but these have usually suffered from an extensive use of memory and sometimes a considerable solution time. The 18th-century Scottish mathematician, Maclaurin, invented a method for calculating coefficients for series (usually infinite) which represented surds of many types, including sin, cos, Iogx, e x and many more. Whilst working with these series recently, the author developed inversions of the sine and cosine sequences which can be used to calculate very rapidly the values of these functions for any primary value x. As might be expected, the resulting summations still involve terms from zero to infinity, but it is a happy accident that the terms of the inversion converge so rapidly that only three or four such terms are required to provide accuracy to eight or more decimal digits. Furthermore, the summations work for all values of x, even outside the 0-2~r (360 °) segment: for example, the absurd value 1200 could be substituted for x, but several more terms than the four previously mentioned would be required to attain the accuracy normally found in the 0-2~r segment.	coefficient;converge;decision table;diff utility;emoticon;inversion (discrete mathematics);run time (program lifecycle phase);while	Richard Helyer	1978	Microprocessors	10.1016/0308-5953(78)90165-4	fourier sine and cosine series;discrete sine transform;discrete cosine transform	Web+IR	64.40556678713065	27.336625431894277	123940

A special control vector is defined to redistribute the compute expensive between a network analysis and a parametric optimization. This approach generalizes the design process and generates a set of the different optimization strategies that serves as the structural basis to the optimal design strategy construction. The principal difference between this new methodology and before elaborated theory is the more general approach on the definition of the system parameters and more broadened structural basis. The main equations for the system optimization process were elaborated. These equations include the special control functions that generalize the total system optimization process. Numerical results that include as passive and active nonlinear networks demonstrate the efficiency and perspective of the proposed approach.	control function (econometrics);control theory;mathematical optimization;network theory;nonlinear system;numerical method;optimal design;program optimization;systems design	Alexander Zemliak;Ricardo Peña-Marí;Eduardo Rios;Fernando Reyes	2011	CONIELECOMP 2011, 21st International Conference on Electrical Communications and Computers	10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2011.5749332	control engineering;probabilistic-based design optimization;mathematical optimization;test functions for optimization;design process;network analysis;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;optimal design;mathematical model;control theory;vector optimization;structured systems analysis and design method;transistor;statistics;systems design	EDA	65.58288522206061	23.460051594087556	124442

The Fourier transform and the Laplace transform are certainly the best known and most commonly used integral transforms.  However, the Fourier transform is just one of many ways of signal representation and there are many other transforms of interest.  In the past 20 years, other analytical methods have been proposed and applied, for example, wavelet, Walsh, Legendre, Hermite,  Gabor, fractional Fourier analysis, etc. Regardless of their particular merits they are not as useful as the classical Fourier  representation that is closely connected to such powerful concepts of signal theory as linear and nonlinear convolutions,  classical and high–order correlations, invariance with respect to shift, ambiguity and Wigner distributions, etc. To obtain  the general properties and important tools of the classical Fourier transform for an arbitrary orthogonal transform we associate  to it generalized shift operators and develop the theory of abstract harmonic analysis of signals and linear and nonlinear  systems that are invariant with respect to these generalized shift operators.

It is demonstrated, through simulation examples, the advantage of considering the Kronecker structure together with the block-sparsity property obtaining faster and more precise sparse representations of tensors compared to the case of applying the classical OMP (Orthogonal Matching Pursuit).	coefficient;greedy algorithm;matching pursuit;openmp;simulation;sparse approximation;sparse matrix	Cesar F.

Our figure of merit is the sampling efficiency, which is defined as a ratio of the degrees of freedom required to represent a band-limited signal in harmonic domain to the number of samples required to accurately compute the FT. The proposed sampling scheme is asymptotically as efficient as the most efficient scheme developed very recently. For the computation of FT and inverse FT, we also develop fast algorithms of complexity similar to the complexity attained by the fast algorithms for the existing sampling schemes. The developed algorithms are stable, accurate and do not have any pre-computation requirements. We also analyse the computation time and numerical accuracy of the proposed algorithms and show, through numerical experiments, that the proposed Fourier transforms are accurate with errors on the order of numerical precision.	bandlimiting;computation;discretization;experiment;gaussian quadrature;gauss–jacobi quadrature;gauss–legendre algorithm;numerical analysis;precomputation;requirement;sampling (signal processing);time complexity;transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation	Zubair Khalid;Salman Durrani;Rodney A.

Computation of these transforms can be formulated as evaluation of dimension-reducible sums on sparse grids. We introduce a fast algorithm for evaluating such sums and prove that the total number of operations needed in the algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of components along each coordinate direction of the data set. We then use it to develop fast algorithms for computing the discrete Fourier transform on the sparse grid and the discrete backward Fourier transform on the hyperbolic cross index set. We also show that if the given data set is sampled from a function having regularity of order s, then its discrete Fourier transform has the optimal approximation order O(n−s).

Such data may be considered as a type of signal defined on the group of permutations of n objects, denoted Sn. There exists a Fourier transform for Sn obtained from group representation theory, which is well known in the mathematics literature. However, previous work has not approached the transform from a signal processing perspective: in particular, there is no discussion of what constitutes “magnitude” and “phase,” nor any analysis of what phase information might tell us beyond a well-known connection to group translation. This paper explores the properties of the phase spectrum of ranking data; in particular, a novel contribution is the formulation of the bispectrum for ranking data, which may be used for studying phase linearity. Analysis of two well-known ranking data sets shows that they are surprisingly well fit by linear phase approximations.	approximation;autocorrelation;bispectrum;fourier analysis;linear phase;signal processing;spectral density;triple correlation;web search engine	Ramakrishna Kakarala	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2104145	fourier transform;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;calculus;signal processing;mathematics;group theory	ML	55.32322681736462	19.3031507476697	127750

Under satisfactory average error performance, we determine that the new filter structure requires less multiplier wordlength than the previously published Type-1 filter structure. With the features of less numerator multiplier wordlength and shorter critical path, the proposed diagonal and four-fold rotational symmetry filter architectures can result in 10.17% and 3.35% area reduction with respect to the published Type-1 IIR filter structures with diagonal and four-fold rotational symmetries in terms of synthesis results.	critical path method;digital filter;image processing;infinite impulse response;kalman filter;transfer function	Pei-Yu Chen;Lan-Da Van;Hari C.

a7f6e34aa9f997082c7dedfde16dc913a2da85a7	hankel operators and best hankel approximation on the half-plane	hankel operator	Studies of Hankel operators date back to the original work of Carath6odoryFejdr [5], Nevanlinna-Pick [18], Schur [22], Takagi [23], etc. In recent years, these classical results have found their wide applications in electrical engineering. The fundamental result on Hankel operators by Adamyan et al. [1] turns out to be an indispensable tool in solving many problems raised in systems theory and H =control, such as systems reduction, systems identification, and robust stability (cf. [3,9,11,15, 16]), for which it is commonly called the AAK theory in electrical engineering. Hankel operators can be defined in several different ways, and can be defined on different spaces. In this paper, we consider two types of Hankel operators (defined in sections 1 and 2); one is defined on the Hardy space of the unit disc, and the other on the Hardy space of the half-plane. Although a large number of papers have been published on applications of these two types of Hankel operators in signal processing, systems theory, and H=-control, we believe that this is the first paper that gives an intimate relation between them.

This scaling operation relies on a frequency warping transformation between discrete-time and continuous-time frequencies. The DLSI systems have been shown to provide synthesis of self-similar random signals such as those seen in network traffic. In this paper, we provide a more general method for DLSI system modeling based on linear kernels. The alternative expression of DLSI system provided by linear kernels has several desirable properties lacking in the earlier formulation. In particular, the new formulation (a) allows commutativity between input and system characteristic sequence and (b) permits definition of a scale domain transform operator analogous to the Fourier transform for time-invariant systems.	bilinear transform;dilation (morphology);emoticon;image scaling;linear scale;network traffic control;self-similarity;systems modeling;time-invariant system	Seungsin Lee;Raghuveer M.

We extend our earlier work on SC-OPF problem and incorporate corrective control actions emanating form the controllability of the AGC lines. This is achieved by appropriately adjusting the HVDC setpoint after a component outage. The overall problem is formulated as chance constrained optimization program. We solve it using a scenario based methodology, which offers a-priori guarantees regarding the probability of constraint satisfaction. Moreover, we exploit recent developments in sampling based optimization allowing us to identify more optimal solutions in term of cost. To demonstrate the efficiency of our approach and the improvement in terms of cost due to the controllability offered by the HVDC lines, we apply to an IEEE benchmark network.	algorithm;automatic gain control;benchmark (computing);constrained optimization;constraint satisfaction;downtime;mathematical optimization;norm (social);randomness;sampling (signal processing);setpoint (control system)	Maria Vrakopoulou;Spyros Chatzivasileiadis;Göran Andersson	2013	IEEE PES ISGT Europe 2013	10.1109/ISGTEurope.2013.6695455	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Vision	64.82830731428142	32.00818034301445	129548

The signal is approximated or represented as a superposition of """"basic"""" waveforms chosen from a dictionary of such waveforms so as to best match the signal. The matching pursuit algorithm of Mallat and Zhang is such a method and is discussed in the context of discretized Gabor functions on an interval. We describe two software implementations based on these dictionaries. Both implementations rely on functions defined on an interval to avoid edge effects. One implementation allows for users to have great flexibility in the Gabor dictionary to be used. This is a useful improvement over other implementations, which only allow for a fixed dictionary. The other implementation takes advantage of the FFT algorithm and is faster. These implementations are written in C++, and can be used in practical applications."""	approximation algorithm;c++;data dictionary;digital signal processing;discretization;fast fourier transform;gabor atom;matching pursuit;quantum superposition	Sebastian E.

The common factor technique was first proposed in [6] by Selesnick, where two corresponding scaling lowpass filters are required to satisfy the half-sample delay condition, and then was modified to improve the analyticity [9] and frequency selectivity [8]. The analyticity of complex wavelet can be improved by minimizing the phase error in the approximation band of allpass filters with given flatness condition. The frequency selectivity of scaling lowpass filters can be improved by locating a specified number of zeros at z = -1 and applying the Remez exchange algorithm to minimize the magnitude response in the stopband. How to determine the approximation band and stopband will influence the performance of DTCWT. Therefore, this paper is dedicated to how to choose the approximation band and stopband properly.	all-pass filter;approximation;greedy algorithm;image scaling;low-pass filter;remez algorithm;selectivity (electronic);wavelet	Daiwei Wang;Xi Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288668	wavelet;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;low-pass filter;computer science;finite impulse response;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;approximation algorithm;statistics;wavelet transform	EDA	61.014371619996204	18.326559028878513	131223

The QPT has the ability to analyze chirp signals in the same way as Fourier transform analyzes sinusoidal signals. In view of its practical implementation, a discrete version of the QPT, called the discrete quadratic phase transform (DQPT), is introduced. A novel fast computational procedure of the DQPT is developed. Explicit expressions for the arithmetic operation count are derived. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the DQPT.	chirp	Muhammad Z.

A highpass filter to suppress undesirable low frequency components in the input signal is replaced with a simple DC offset canceler in the time-domain combined with a frequency-domain weighting function. Frequency bins after Fourier transform are nonuniformly grouped to reduce the computations for calculating the spectral gain. A new decomposition pattern is developed for higher quality of the enhanced speech. The number of operations on typical DSP chips is 3.2 MIPS that is approximately 50% off the conventional load. Subjective evaluation results demonstrates that the low-complexity noise suppressor achieves comparable quality of the enhanced speech to that of the conventional noise suppressor	computation;digital signal processor;weight function	Masanori Kato;Akihiko Sugiyama	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing Proceedings	10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660060	fourier transform;computer vision;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;mathematics;frequency domain	Robotics	60.79389109013221	18.546076793196278	131906

Compared with other refinements, such as the dyadic or quincunx refinement, radic5-refinement has a special property that the nodes in a refined lattice form groups of five nodes with these five nodes having different x and y coordinates. This special property has been shown to be very useful to represent adaptively and render complex and procedural geometry. When radic5-refinement is used for multiresolution data processing, radic5-refinement filter banks and wavelets are required. While the construction of 2-D nonseparable (bi)orthogonal wavelets with the dyadic or quincunx refinement has been studied by many researchers, the construction of (bi)orthogonal wavelets with radic5-refinement has not been investigated. The main goal of this paper is to construct compactly supported orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelets with radic5 -refinement. In this paper, we obtain block structures of orthogonal and biorthogonal radic5-refinement FIR filter banks with 4-fold rotational symmetry. We construct compactly supported orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelets based on these block structures.	bank (environment);dyadic transformation;filter bank;finite impulse response;refinement (computing);refinement calculus;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;subdivision surface;wavelet	Qingtang Jiang	2008	IEEE Transactions on Image Processing	10.1109/TIP.2008.2004613	sampling;computer vision;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;data processing;finite impulse response;signal processing;mathematics;geometry;biorthogonal polynomial	Robotics	58.19148723757236	18.638734100123106	134578

A pertinent basis gives pertinent information. Dual functionals are a mathematical tool for basis transformation. This work presents, from the perspective of algebraic computing, a generalization of the de Boor-Fix dual functionals for the Bernstein basis functions to the case of the convolution basis functions. The convolution basis functions can be characterized as polar forms of the corresponding Bernstein basis functions. These new dual functionals can be used for computing algebraically the expansion coefficients of any polynomial over the convolution basis which has applications in computer-aided geometric design and secret information encoding.	basis function;code;coefficient;computer-aided design;convolution;geometric design;phil bernstein;polynomial basis;problem solving;relevance;wavelet transform	Lim Yohanes Stefanus	2008	ACM Comm.

We present a class of two-dimensional nonseparable rectangular sampling PR modulated filter banks. The modulation is constrained to be separable while the prototype filter is allowed to be nonseparable. This lead to considerably simplification in the PR condition and design procedure. The resulting PR condition on the prototype is equivalent to the 4 channels PR property of a set of polyphase components. A design example of a 4-channel length (8×8) orthogonal nonseparable filter is also given to illustrate the proposed method	filter bank;modulation	Shing-Chow Chan	1994		10.1109/ICASSP.1994.390070		Vision	59.07394679941473	18.395235297900197	135826

The method is applied to both one-dimensional and two-dimensional data. It is noted that the Fourier series can be used here only if the variable of interest has no discontinuities and has the same values at the end boundaries. For situations where this is not the case we introduce the idea of adding to the Fourier series sinusoids at half the fundamental frequency. The procedure is extended to two-dimensional data and applied to terrain modeling where coarse range scanning has been performed and a model of finer resolution is then obtained. Results are shown to be excellent.	interpolation;window function	Smriti Kansal;Gerald Cook	2004	IEEE Trans.

The filter is based on QBernstein polynomial, which can be adjusted attenuation in stop-band by varying three parameters of the transfer function. A coarse attenuation in stop-band is provided by adjusting two parameters (epsilon and alpha) and a fine attenuation step is determined by Q parameters. The results of simulation were shown the filter, given attenuation in stop-band better than conventional filter at a second-order. Moreover, this paper proposes the filter which provides both flat magnitude and group delay characteristics in the pass-band. Therefore, it can useful for the high quality filter network as an audio crossover network.	approximation;audio crossover;display resolution;group delay and phase delay;low-pass filter;polynomial;simulation;transfer function	Dolchai Sookcharoenphol;Vanvisa Chutchavong;Kanok Janchitrapongvej	2017		10.1145/3162957.3163040	attenuation;transfer function;stopband;group delay and phase delay;passband;magnitude (mathematics);control theory;audio crossover;mathematics;low-pass filter	Robotics	61.68142991417851	18.32161105234946	136330

Each transform is completely determined by two functions: a warping and a weight function. Therefore, the transforms can be described very efficiently and this makes them very useful in adaptive transform coding. The base vectors of the new transforms are samples of time-warped polynomials. The latter approximately equal amplitudeand frequency-modulated sine waves. The paper describes how the structure of the base vectors and the coding properties of the transforms depend on the warping and weight functions. In particular, the minimum number of coefficients for almost error-free coding is determined and the effects of quantization are investigated. ECG, image line and speech coding examples illustrate the theoretical results. Finally, the time-warped polynomial coding method is shown to have some advantages over another approach that uses a fixed base to represent a time-warped version of the signal.	approximation;coefficient;discrete cosine transform;image warping;modulation;polynomial code;quantization (signal processing);speech coding;transform coding;weight function;whole earth 'lectronic link	Wilfried Philips	1994	Signal Processing	10.1016/0165-1684(94)90105-8	combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;shannon–fano coding;mathematics;orthogonal polynomials	AI	56.912310757068475	20.31221318346523	136386

For real time operation, the compute time must be approximately constant for each sample, and the overall delay introduced by the computation must be small. We present an implementation of linear prediction coefficient calculation and fast Fourier transform computation which are """"unrolled"""" so that a small aati constant pott%oSa of the catciIlatioft is done on each sample. James A. Moorer Lucasfilm Ltd. P.O. Box 2009 San Rafael, Ca 94012 fully to prevent draining the FIFO, and thus interrupting the audio stream. The problem comes when we wish to mix block processing with real-time processing. There are certain advantages to """"block"""" forms of certain algorithms. For example, in linear prediction filter coefficient calculation, the weighting of the covariance matrix entries with time makes significant differences in the results [2, 3, 4(, The standard recursive implementation of the PARCOR calculation exhibits severe numerical difficulties for fixed-point implementations, since the error can grow unhoundedly during transient regions. The most numerically stable implementation is obtained from accumulating the covariance matrix by summing a fixed number of points, computing the reflection coefficient, then filtering the signal using the normalized lattice form. 1. Motivation At Lucasfilm, we have designed and built a general-purpose audio processing station capable of performing all aspects of professional audio production, including sound editing, synthesis, pro<ng, and mixing [i[. This station is designed to operate principally in real time, although it can also be operated in an off-line or """"batch"""" mode. Sound is stored on computer thks and may be eandosoly accessed tn real tixne. The audio signal processor (ASP) itself is a pipelined, highly parallel 24-bit integer device that operates at about 18 million instructions per second, where each instruction may start a 24x24 multiply, followed by a 48-bit shift and accumulate. It is generally agreed that the total delay in processing audio in a professional sound production environment must be kept below 2 milliseconds. This means that it is not possible, for instance, to do complicated filtering operations by fast Fourier transforms, since the """"block processing"""" nature of the FFT introduces substantial delay in the signal on the order of several times the impulse response length. All filter implementations must be in direct recursive or non-recursive form such that the total debty is m nimwed. Thia also makes it easina to realize time-variant filters, since the coefficients may be directly modified during the computation. The processor has been designed so that it starts execution at instruction zero at the beginning of each sample period and executes a nearly-constant number of instructions during the sample period. It does not have to be exactly constant, since there is a 64-sample first-in, first-out memory between the ASP and the D/A converters which permit somewhat over one millisecond of flexibility in timing. The processor does have testing, branching, and looping, but this must be care1 2B.3.1 Similarly, the FFT algorithm must be used for long convolutions since it is the only hope for doing convolutions by very long impulse responses. This arises in film making when mixing studio-recorded dialog with dialog that was obtained on the set. Reverberation must be added to the studio dialog so that the sounds appear to come from the same acoustical space. It is not just any reverberation that must be added, but it is specifically the reverberation of the environment that is being matched. Sometimes the acoustical spaces are quite """"live"""" and can produce impulse responses more than 100,000 scsmples, in length. The point of mixing real-time and non-real-time computations in the same machine is to gain the advantages of both: realtime services may still be offered while off-line calculations are simultaneously being performed without interference. One way to accomplish this might be either to install another machine for doing off-line processing, or perhaps to make the real-time computation interrupt driven so that the block processing would proceed in a kind of background mode. Our main point in this communication is that this is not necessary, since many algorithms may be conveniently modified for the real-time environment without difficulty. We will illustrate this with the PARCOFI algorithm and the radix-2 fast Fourier transform. 2.

In this letter, we propose one of the first coordinate algorithms for non-orthogonal simultaneous diagonalization of any order complex tensors. It relies on the optimization of an inverse criterion and on a particular decomposition allowing to derive each parameter in an independent way. In the framework of digital telecommunication source separation, computer simulations show the interest of using sets of high-order tensors. They also illustrate the overall interesting performances of the proposed algorithm in comparison to a Jacobi-like algorithm of matrix joint diagonalization and to a canonical polyadic decomposition algorithm.	algorithm;computer simulation;jacobi method;mathematical optimization;performance;source separation	Victor Maurandi;Eric Moreau	2017	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2017.2751038	mathematical optimization;mathematics;orthogonal diagonalization;tensor;stress (mechanics);algorithm design;matrix (mathematics);source separation;matrix decomposition	Vision	64.91315798229395	19.62250452149937	136737

Once this factorization has been constructed (with N log2 N work), we can solve linear systems with this matrix with N log N work. Kernel matrices represent pairwise interactions of points in metric spaces. They appear in machine learning, approximation theory, and computational physics. Kernel matrices are typically dense (matrix multiplication scales quadratically with N) and ill-conditioned (solves can require100s of Krylov iterations). Thus, fast algorithms for matrix multiplication and factorization are critical for scalability. Recently we introduced ASKIT, a new method, which resembles N-body methods, for approximating a kernel matrix. Here we introduce INV-IASKIT, a factorization scheme based on ASKIT. We describe the new method, derive complexity estimates, and conduct an empirical study of its accuracy and scalability.

The starting point of the new methodology is the efficient update of the Cholesky factor of the input data correlation matrix. Using the new technique, two novel fast multichannel algorithms are developed. Both algorithms comprise scalar operations only and are based exclusively on numerically robust orthogonal Givens rotations. The first algorithm assumes channels of equal orders and processes them all simultaneously. It is highly modular and provides enhanced pipelinability, with no increase in computational complexity, when compared with other algorithms of the same category. The second multichannel algorithm deals with the general case of channels with different number of delay elements and processes each channel separately. A modification of the algorithm leads to a scheme that can be implemented on a very regular systolic architecture. Moreover, both schemes offer substantially reduced computational complexity compared not only with the first algorithm but also with previously derived multichannel fast QRD schemes. Experimental results in two specific application setups as well as simulations in a finite precision environment are also included.	adaptive filter;algorithm;cholesky decomposition;computational complexity theory;least squares;numerical analysis;qr decomposition;simulation	Athanasios A.

This paper proposes a Riemannian geometry approach for optimization of a real-valued cost function T of complex-valued matrix argument W, under the constraint that W is an n times n unitary matrix. We derive steepest descent (SD) algorithms on the Lie group of unitary matrices U(n). The proposed algorithms move towards the optimum along the geodesics, but other alternatives are also considered. We also address the computational complexity and the numerical stability issues considering both the geodesic and the nongeodesic SD algorithms. Armijo step size [1] adaptation rule is used similarly to [2], but with reduced complexity. The theoretical results are validated by computer simulations. The proposed algorithms are applied to blind source separation in MIMO systems by using the joint diagonalization approach [3]. We show that the proposed algorithms outperform other widely used algorithms.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;backtracking line search;blind signal separation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;constrained optimization;gradient descent;iso/iec 11404;iteration;jade;lagrangian (field theory);loss function;mimo;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical stability;optimization problem;order of approximation;smart antenna;source separation;the matrix;time complexity;turing completeness	Traian E.

We apply this expansion to realize an FIR approximation of a given IIR structure with a number of multipliers that is proportional to the logarithm to the base 2 of the length of the FIR required. This is a fundamental reduction in the computational complexity and has far-reaching implications for other applications such as on-line convolution. Also, it now becomes feasible to realize exponentially longer FIR structures using the new method which also allows design flexibility since many of the terms involved could be realized with slow multipliers. An additional advantage of the fewer number of multipliers used is the reduction of round-off noise as we demonstrate in this work.	finite impulse response	Adly T.

First, a novel efficient secondorder digital differentiator is derived from the transfer function of the digital integrator proposed by Tseng. Then, the fractional power of the new s-to-z transform is expanded using power series expansion (PSE)-signal-modeling technique to obtain stable rational approximation of s . Simulation results show that the proposed rational approximation has better frequency characteristics in almost the whole frequency range than that of existing first-order s-to-z transforms based approximations for different values of the fractional-order α. This paper also shows the benefit of using PSE-signal-modeling approach with firstor second-order mapping functions over PSE-truncation approach that is used in recent works for rational approximation of the operator s , and highlights the major disadvantage of the latter approach that leads to undesirable rational models with complex conjugate poles and zeros.	approximation error;computation;differentiator;first-order predicate;frequency band;prony's method;real-time clock;real-time computing;series expansion;simple rational approximation;simulation;transfer function;truncation	Fouzia Leulmi;Youcef Ferdi	2015	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-014-9928-9	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;calculus;control theory;mathematics;power series	EDA	62.91556347193694	19.064823818417043	140310

PAT codes derive from an innovative design procedure and present excellent performance in terms of both merit factor and peak to side-peak ratio with respect to previously proposed sequences such as Frank, P1, P2, and Px codes. In particular, for odd lengths, the merit factor of PAT codes is larger than that of all other polyphase sequences under analysis, and the peak to side-peak ratio is as large as that of the best of these sequences (namely the Frank and P1 codes). For even lengths, the merit factor and the peak to side-peak ratio performance of PAT codes coincide with those of Px and P2 codes, which are the best polyphase sequences under analysis. PAT code synthesis is based on a rigorous analytical method in the code spectral domain and leads to a simple recursive formula for the generation of sequences of arbitrary length.	code;piecewise linear continuation;polyphase matrix;polyphase quadrature filter;recursion	Daniele Petrolati;Piero Angeletti;Giovanni Toso	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2012.2191664	block code;fourier transform;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;finite element method;linear code;mathematics;algorithm	Theory	56.964346664058276	20.13586599105657	140435

In contrast with linear-phase filter banks, the nonlinearity provides an extra degree of freedom that can be used to design a more efficient transform. We present new lattice structures of paraunitary and perfect reconstruction (biorthogonal) filter banks, which can be implemented with a lower computational complexity and/or represented by a few free parameters, through the decomposition of the lattice blocks and the displacement across the delay block. We further discuss a smooth extension method for nonlinear-phase filter banks to obtain a nonexpansive transform.

The proposed overcomplete rational DWT is implemented using self-inverting FIR filter banks, is approximately shift-invariant, and can provide a dense sampling of the time-frequency plane. A straightforward algorithm is described for the construction of minimal-length perfect reconstruction filters with a specified number of vanishing moments; whereas, in the nonredundant rational case, no such algorithm is available. The algorithm is based on matrix spectral factorization. The analysis/synthesis functions (discrete-time wavelets) can be very smooth and can be designed to closely approximate the derivatives of the Gaussian function.	approximation algorithm;continuous wavelet;dilation (morphology);discrete wavelet transform;dyadic transformation;existential quantification;filter bank;finite impulse response;gaussian blur;mexican hat wavelet;noise reduction;reconstruction filter;sampling (signal processing);triangular function;xfig	Ilker Bayram;Ivan W.

The motivation for doing so is that Schur algorithms may be efficiently implemented on linearly connected parallel computer systems (of the sort considered by Kung and Hu, or Brent and Luk), while the Levinson-Durbin algorithms may not. The algorithm of Delsarte, Genin, and Kamp for Hermitian Toeplitz matrices in the singular case is used to induce a Schur algorithm for such matrices. An algorithm due to Heinig and Rost for Hankel matrices in the singular case is used to induce a Schur algorithm for such matrices. Finally, the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm is viewed as a kind of LevinsonDurbin algorithm and so is used to induce a Schur algorithm for the minimal partial realization problem. The Schur algorithm for Hermitian Toeplitz matrices in the singular case is shown to be amenable to implementation on a linearly connected parallel processor array of the sort considered by Kung and Hu, and in fact generalizes their result to the singular case.	berlekamp–massey algorithm;computer;holographic principle;lehmer–schur algorithm;levinson recursion;linear algebra;linear system;parallel computing;processor array;randi j. rost;toeplitz hash algorithm	Christopher J.

Multi-channel signals are acquired under sub-Nyquist sampling frequency to perfectly reconstruct the original signal spectrum. A novel system design with Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation is presented in this paper. There are two main contributions in this paper. Firstly, the FPGA system uses 32-bit single precision floating point dataflow rather than conventional 16-bit fixed point to recover signals with much lower Signal-Noise Ratio (SNR). Secondly, we introduce a novel Jacobi CORDIC eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) core using parallel pivot-seeking circuit and parallel 3-CORDIC design to improve speed significantly. Hermitian matrices of dimensions from 2 to 10 are tested to compare conventional 2-CORDIC EVD and proposed EVD. The proposed EVD effectively reduces on average 36% of processing time for mesh connection system and over 50% for parallel system.	16-bit;32-bit;broadcast delay;cordic;dataflow;field-programmable gate array;fixed point (mathematics);jacobi method;noise (electronics);nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;processor register;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time operating system;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;single-precision floating-point format;spectral density;standard business reporting;systems design	Hongxu Yin;Bah-Hwee Gwee;Zhiping Lin;Achanna Anil Kumar;Sirajudeen Gulam Razul;Chong Meng Samson See	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2015.7168793	embedded system;electronic engineering;parallel computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;multiple signal classification;mathematical model;mathematics;signal-to-noise ratio;field-programmable gate array;statistics	EDA	59.82316485197878	21.97071930551019	144720

We study the direct current special case by leveraging recent developments on the zero duality gap of OPF. We study the uniqueness of the OPF solution using differential topology especially the Poincare-Hopf Index Theorem, and characterize its global uniqueness for simple network topologies, e.g., line and mesh networks. This serves as a starting point to design local algorithms with global behavior that have low complexity and are computationally fast for practical smart power grids.	algorithm;duality gap;mesh networking;network topology;numerical analysis;quadratic programming;uniqueness type;vii	Chee Wei Tan;Desmond W.

Hence, the transform can be tuned according to the oscillatory behavior of the signal to which it is applied. The transform is based on a real-valued scaling factor (dilation-factor) and is implemented using a perfect reconstruction over-sampled filter bank with real-valued sampling factors. Two forms of the transform are presented. The first form is defined for discrete-time signals defined on all of Z. The second form is defined for discrete-time signals of finite-length and can be implemented efficiently with FFTs. The transform is parameterized by its Q-factor and its oversampling rate (redundancy), with modest oversampling rates (e.g., three to four times overcomplete) being sufficient for the analysis/synthesis functions to be well localized.	algorithmic efficiency;dilation (morphology);discrete-time fourier transform;discrete-time signal;filter bank;filter design;frame (linear algebra);image scaling;neural oscillation;oversampling;redundancy (information theory);sampling (signal processing);wavelet transform	Ivan W.

A matrix with non-negative elements can be decomposed into a product of two matrices with non-negative elements by the NMF. One resulting matrix can be regarded as a basis matrix; and the other can be regarded as a coefficient matrix giving linear combinations of the basis vectors. In practical problems, there exists a case where an ideal basis is partially known. In this paper, we propose a novel method for NMF considering given vectors in an ideal basis. We introduce a criterion for the method and construct an algorithm to optimize the criterion. Moreover, we prove that the proposed algorithm surely converges. Some results of computer simulations are also given to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;basis (linear algebra);coefficient;computer simulation;experiment;non-negative matrix factorization;numerical analysis;signal processing	Yuta Amano;Akira Tanaka;Masaaki Miyakoshi	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing	10.1109/GRC.2011.6122566	computer simulation;matrix splitting;matrix function;mathematical optimization;hollow matrix;combinatorics;eigendecomposition of a matrix;sparse matrix;nonnegative matrix;matrix multiplication;single-entry matrix;computer science;generator matrix;band matrix;convergent matrix;signal processing;square matrix;mathematics;pascal matrix;state-transition matrix;matrix decomposition;singular value decomposition;block matrix;non-negative matrix factorization;matrix;symmetric matrix;algebra	Vision	64.94977234515042	19.83329756682176	149682

It uses adaptive delta modulation followed by digital processing to produce a filtered log-PCM representation of a speech signal. The simplification results from combining the delta modulation step-size expansion, integration and low-pass filtering into one operation. All multiplications are eliminated and replaced by one-bit shift-and-add operations. The resulting structure is amenable to a single chip implementation using conventional, all-digital technologies while satisfying established filter standards.	codec;speech coding	Michael J.

This approach is compared to proven techniques like the ones based on interpolation and least square approximation. Nonuniform Fourier exponentials are approximated through a set of optimum spaces obtained by modulating a single space. For a fixed precision, the space dimension is smaller with respect to the previous approaches, resulting in a computational cost reduction. Furthermore, the proposed formulation involves only real-complex multiplications rather than complex-complex ones. As a counterpart, the amount of projections to be computed is higher with respect to proven approaches. So, the proposed algorithm results to be optimum for dense nonuniformly sampled frequencies.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;computation;fast fourier transform;fixed-point arithmetic;interpolation;singular value decomposition	Salvatore Caporale;Luca De Marchi;Nicolò Speciale	2007	2007 15th European Signal Processing Conference		multidimensional signal processing;fourier transform;sine and cosine transforms;mathematical optimization;discrete-time fourier transform;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;trigonometric interpolation;harmonic wavelet transform;short-time fourier transform;interpolation;fractional fourier transform;discrete fourier transform;fourier inversion theorem;mathematics;discrete fourier transform;fourier analysis;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;phase correlation	EDA	56.760291903559924	21.074969405463303	150450

Originally raised in the construction of bandlimited wavelets, these sampling functions also possess a similar structure to the scaling functions of wavelets with adjustable bandwidth parameters. In addition, these sampling functions are infinite impulse response (IIR) filters and share all the principal advantage that the IIR type has such as computational efficiency. They are easy to compute with fast decreasing property in time domain and suitable for representing bandlimited signals with sharp cut-off. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the construction of sampling functions and properties of associated sampling series.

In this paper, we propose a novel nearly tridiagonal matrix, which commutes with the generalized discrete Fourier transform (GDFT) matrix. It doesn't has repeated eigenvalue. We can determine a unique orthonormal eigenvector set based on block diagonalization of new commuting matrix. The eigenvectors of the new nearly tridiagonal matrix are shown to be GDFT eigenvectors, which are more similar to the continuous Hermite-Gaussian functions than those developed before. The fractional transform of GDFT (GDFRFT) is defined through eigendecomposition. The new version of GDFRFT produce their transform outputs closer to the samples of the continuous fractional Fourier transform through numerical comparison.	approximation;dft matrix;discrete fourier transform;fractional fourier transform;numerical analysis	Qi-Wen Ran;Zhongzhao Zhang;Deyun Wei;Xuejun Sha	2009	2009 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	10.1109/CCECE.2009.5090192	fourier transform;discrete hartley transform;discrete-time fourier transform;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;hartley transform;s transform;harmonic wavelet transform;short-time fourier transform;continuous wavelet transform;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;dft matrix;fractional fourier transform;discrete sine transform;discrete fourier transform;mathematics;discrete fourier transform;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;fourier transform on finite groups;algebra	Vision	56.08986876979078	19.45439011511845	152364

In this paper, basic building block function is analyzed for errors while implementing the algorithm using fixed point technique. To streamline the process of converting the floating point to fixed point, Model Based Design(MBD) concept is adopted where models of the basic functions are designed and tested in MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory) environment before converting to fixed point. Hardware Description Language (HDL) coder is used to convert the model in VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) code to implement in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The work proposed in this paper is abstract function which is implemented using Taylor's approximation series as some functions are not supported by HDL code generation tool for inverse trigonometric functions like inverse sine (ARCSINE), inverse tangent (ARCTANGENT). These functions are calculated with different number of iterations in MATLAB and using HDL coder. The script is successfully converted to fixed point VHDL code and the error between floating and fixed point is calculated which is presented in this paper.	adobe streamline;algorithm;approximation;basic block;code generation (compiler);field-programmable gate array;fixed point (mathematics);hardware description language;iteration;matlab;signal processing;vhdl;vhsic	Somesh Nandi;Sunil Prasad;C.

8b6696c46a95a46f0310ea5014e8f2b70646fa3f	analysis vs synthesis with structure - an investigation of union of subspace models on graphs		We consider the problem of characterizing the ‘duality gap’ between sparse synthesisand cosparse analysis-driven signal models through the lens of spectral graph theory, in an effort to comprehend their precise equivalencies and discrepancies. By detecting and exploiting the inherent connectivity structure, and hence, distinct set of properties, of rank-deficient graph difference matrices such as the graph Laplacian, we are able to substantiate discrepancies between the cosparse analysis and sparse synthesis models, according to which the former constitutes a constrained and translated instance of the latter. In view of a general union of subspaces model, we conduct a study of the associated subspaces and their composition, which further facilitates the refinement of specialized uniqueness and recovery guarantees, and discover an underlying structured sparsity model based on the graph incidence matrix. Furthermore, for circulant graphs, we provide an exact characterization of underlying subspaces by deriving closed-form expressions as well as demonstrating transitional properties between equivalence and non-equivalence for a parametric generalization of the graph Laplacian.	circulant matrix;duality gap;incidence matrix;laplacian matrix;refinement (computing);sensor;sparse matrix;spectral graph theory;strong duality;turing completeness	Madeleine S.

In this instance blocklengths that are powers of two are possible and radix-2 fast algorithms can be used to compute the transform.	algorithm;computable function;discrete cosine transform;discrete sine transform;image processing;multiplexing;power of two;time complexity;unimodular polynomial matrix	M.

The algorithm is based on a 2-D block decomposition technique suitable for deriving the LU products of the interpolation matrix. A variation of this technique leads to an efficient solution of 2-D interpolation problems for which the interpolation points occur in complex conjugate pairs but where the coefficients of the interpolation polynomial are real. These results are applied in designing 2-D FIR filters. The algorithm proposed permits all operations to be performed by real arithmetic, guarantees real results, saves a number of operations, and produces accurate solutions, even in case of designing high-order 2-D FIR filters or when the interpolation matrix is ill conditioned. The algorithm is well suited to parallel computations and can be extended to design m-D FIR digital filters or to invert m-D interpolation matrices.	finite impulse response	Emmanuel Angelidis	1997	IEEE Trans.

More precisely, we give nine MATLAB programs that implement the binomial method for valuing a European put option. The first program is a straightforward translation of the pseudocode in Figure 10.4 of The Mathematics of Financial Derivatives, by P. Wilmott, S. Howison, and J. Dewynne, Cambridge University Press, 1995. Four variants of this program are then presented that improve the efficiency by avoiding redundant computation, vectorizing, and accessing subarrays via MATLAB’s colon notation. We then consider reformulating the problem via a binomial coefficient expansion. Here, a straightforward implementation is seen to be improved by vectorizing, avoiding overflow and underflow, and exploiting sparsity. Overall, the fastest of the binomial method programs has an execution time that is within a factor 2 of direct evaluation of the Black–Scholes formula. One of the vectorized versions is then used as the basis for a program that values an American put option. The programs show how execution times in MATLAB can be dramatically reduced by using high-level operations on arrays rather than computing with individual components, a principle that applies in many scientific computing environments.

An error analysis reveals that the usual method of fixed-point computation of FFT’s of vectors of length2 leads to an average loss of/2 bits of precision. This phenomenon, often referred to as computational noise, causes major problems for arithmetic units with limited precision which are often used for real-time applications. Several researchers have noted that calculation of FFT’s with algebraic integers avoids computational noise entirely, see, e.g., [1]. We will combine a new algorithm for approximating complex numbers by cyclotomic integers with Chinese remaindering strategies to give an efficient algorithm to compute -bit precision FFT’s of length . More precisely, we will approximate complex numbers by cyclotomic integers in [ 2 2 ] whose coefficients, when expressed as polynomials in 2 2 , are bounded in absolute value by some integer . For fixed our algorithm runs in time (log( )), and produces an approximation with worst case error of (1 2 ). We will prove that this algorithm has optimal worst case error by proving a corresponding lower bound on the worst case error of any approximation algorithm for this task. The main tool for designing the algorithms is the use of the cyclotomic units, a subgroup of finite index in the unit group of the cyclotomic field. First implementations of our algorithms indicate that they are fast enough to be used for the design of low-cost high-speed/highprecision FFT chips.	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;ct scan;coefficient;computation;error analysis (mathematics);fast fourier transform;image resolution;polynomial;radar;real-time clock;signal processing;tomography	Joe Buhler;Amir H.

e8ed83fa2d7131e03bc429fcc16e9ae031dd6acd	the qc relaxation: theoretical and computational results on optimal power flow		Convex relaxations of the power flow equations and, in particular, the Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) and Second-Order Cone (SOC) relaxations, have attracted significant interest in recent years. The Quadratic Convex (QC) relaxation is a departure from these relaxations in the sense that it imposes constraints to preserve stronger links between the voltage variables through convex envelopes of the polar representation. This paper is a systematic study of the QC relaxation for AC Optimal Power Flow with realistic side constraints. The main theoretical result shows that the QC relaxation is stronger than the SOC relaxation and neither dominates nor is dominated by the SDP relaxation. In addition, comprehensive computational results show that the QC relaxation may produce significant improvements in accuracy over the SOC relaxation at a reasonable computational cost, especially for networks with tight bounds on phase angle differences. The QC and SOC relaxations are also shown to be significantly faster and reliable compared to the SDP relaxation given the current state of the respective solvers.

1c4445a1607435edbd78117121a3c73e590cd325	improved parameter identification method for envelope current signals based on windowed interpolation fft and de algorithm		Envelope current signals are increasingly emerging in power systems, and their parameter identification is particularly necessary for accurate measurement of electrical energy. In order to analyze the envelope current signal, the harmonic parameters, as well as the envelope parameters, need to be calculated. The interpolation fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a widely used approach which can estimate the signal frequency with high precision, but it cannot calculate the envelope parameters of the signal. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved method based on windowed interpolation FFT (WIFFT) and differential evolution (DE). The amplitude and phase parameters obtained through WIFFT and the envelope parameters estimated by the envelope analysis are optimized using the DE algorithm, which makes full use of the performance advantage of DE. The simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of the harmonic parameters and the envelope parameter significantly. In addition, it has good anti-noise ability and high precision.	algorithm;fast fourier transform;interpolation;window function	Xiangfeng Su;Huaiqing Zhang;Lin Chen;Ling Qin;Lili Yu	2018	Algorithms	10.3390/a11080113	interpolation;fast fourier transform;mathematics;differential evolution;electric power system;amplitude;algorithm;harmonic	Graphics	62.294840760619635	24.114787015173473	159940

First, we explain the necessity of fast algorithms for Hankel and block Hankel tensor–vector products by sketching the algorithm for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional exponential data fitting. For proposing the fast algorithm, we define and investigate a special class of Hankel tensors that can be diagonalized by the Fourier matrices, which is called anti-circulant tensors. Then, we obtain a fast algorithm for Hankel tensor–vector products by embedding a Hankel tensor into a larger anti-circulant tensor. The computational complexity is about O.mn logmn/ for a square Hankel tensor of order m and dimension n, and the numerical examples also show the efficiency of this scheme. Moreover, the block version for multi-level block Hankel tensors is discussed.

We deal with two types of degrees of freedom referred to as (i) the total degrees of freedom DT, and (ii) the remaining degrees of freedom DR. Due to the symmetries or antisymmetries in the impulse responses of the spectral factors, DT roughly equals N=2. Some of these parameters are specifically needed to meet the Lth-band conditions because, in an Lth-band filter, every Lth coefficient is zero and the center tap equals 1=L. The remaining DR parameters can then be used to improve the stopband characteristics of the overall Lth-band filter. We derive general formulas for DR with given pairs of L and N. It is shown that for a fixed L, the choices of N, in a close neighborhood, may even decrease DR despite increasing the arithmetic complexity, order, and the delay. & 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As the fractional Fourier transform has been developed and applied in signal processing fields, it is necessary to consider the oversampling theorem in the fractional Fourier domain. In this paper, the oversampling theorem in the fractional Fourier domain is analyzed. The fractional Fourier spectral relation between the original oversampled sequence and its subsequences is derived first, and then the expression for exact reconstruction of the missing samples in terms of the subsequences is obtained. Moreover, by taking a chirp signal as an example, it is shown that, reconstruction of the missing samples in the oversampled signal is suitable in the fractional Fourier domain for the signal whose time-frequency distribution has the minimum support in the fractional Fourier domain.	chirp;digital signal processing;fractional fourier transform;oversampling;time–frequency representation	Feng Zhang;Ran Tao;Yue Wang	2009	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-009-0118-5	multidimensional signal processing;fourier transform;sine and cosine transforms;computer vision;discrete-time fourier transform;oversampling;short-time fourier transform;telecommunications;computer science;fractional fourier transform;digital signal processing;calculus;discrete fourier transform;signal processing;fourier inversion theorem;discrete fourier series;mathematics;spectral density estimation;discrete fourier transform;fourier analysis;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;chirp;frequency domain;fourier series	Theory	55.89803371637005	18.970116423921723	161710

In this paper, the PSO is parallel implemented on the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) under the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). Then, the GPU-accelerated PSO is used to solve the SHE equations with five to seven unequal dc sources and the executing efficiency gets hundreds of times faster than its CPU based counterpart.

As a representative of structural data, low rank matrix along with its restricted isometry property (RIP) has been an important research topic in compressive signal processing. Subspace projection matrix is a kind of low rank matrix with additional structure, which allows for further reduction of its intrinsic dimension. This leaves room for improving its own RIP, which could work as the foundation of compressed subspace projection matrix recovery. In this work, we study the RIP of subspace projection matrix under random orthonormal compression. Considering the fact that subspace projection matrices of s dimensional subspaces in RN form an s(N - s) dimensional submanifold in RN×N, our main concern is transformed to the stable embedding of such submanifold into RN×N. The result is that by O(s(N - s)log N) number of random measurements the RIP of subspace projection matrix is guaranteed.	algorithm;condition number;intrinsic dimension;low-rank approximation;restricted isometry property;signal processing;szemerédi regularity lemma	Xinyue Shen;Yuantao Gu	2015	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2015.2402206	estimation;combinatorics;topology;sparse matrix;manifold;signal processing;restricted isometry property;mathematics;geometry;symmetric matrix	ML	65.52538070526325	20.568062682368744	164224

We address this issue by introducing the notion of coset based multiresolution analysis (CMRA) on the symmetric group, find the corresponding wavelet functions, and describe a fast wavelet transform for sparse signals. We discuss potential applications in ranking, sparse approximation, and multi-object tracking.	continuous wavelet;fast wavelet transform;haar wavelet;multiresolution analysis;self-similarity;sparse approximation;sparse matrix	Risi Kondor;Walter Dempsey	2012			wavelet;combinatorics;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;mathematics;fast wavelet transform	ML	54.913934859165934	20.7706015915474	164830

APPLICABILITY OF THE DOMAIN PROCESSOR This algorithm uses a large number of heuristics, and it is impractical (if not impossible) to precisely define those domains for which the algorithm is intended to work. A careful reading of the companion paper [1] reveals many of the assumptions used; we list the more important ones here. (1) The domain has more than two or three interior grid points. (2) The boundary does not enter a grid element several times. (3) The boundary is fairly smooth on the scale of the grid. (4) The coordinates and parameters of the problem are all ordinary-sized numbers. (5) The parameterization of the boundary pieces is made by smooth, monotonic, and well-behaved functions. (6) There are no corners on the boundary except at the ends of boundary pieces. (7) Holes, if any, are separated so that there is always an interior grid point between boundaries of different subdomains and the main domain. (8) The interior grid points of the domain are connected through the grid. (9) The grid is reasonably uniform. Most of these assumptions are automatically satisfied if the grid is fine enough.

This task is complicated by the fact that the synthesis bank needed to ensure perfect reconstruction in such a system generally has noncausal or reverse-time filter sections. To overcome this limitation, we develop a number of unique buffering schemes that make possible the implementation of such reverse-time filters with infinite length signals. For the important special case when the polyphase subfilters are allpass, we also present a method that allows for very efficient implementation of tree-structured filter banks and wavelet transforms. We then describe a wideband coding algorithm based largely on work done by Lokhoff and Johnston. Using this algorithm, we compare the performance of IIR filter banks with that of more conventional pseudo-QMF and tree-structured QMF banks. The results of these comparisons indicate that one of our filter banks-a tree-structured allpass bank-achieves slightly better performance than equivalent FIR banks in terms of rate and distortion (both objectively and subjectively measured) while requiring lower computational complexity.

We discuss how computational efficiency can be gained by making use of a relative index array to handle indirect addressing. We report the performance of SelInv on a collection of sparse matrices of various sizes and nonzero structures. We also demonstrate how SelInv can be used in electronic structure calculations.	addressing mode;algorithm;cholesky decomposition;computation;electronic structure;sparse matrix;triangular matrix	Lin Lin;Chao Yang;Juan C.

The point location problem, which requires most of the computational effort, is solved through an orthogonal search tree, which is easily and efficiently implementable. In the case of domains partitioned into single-resolution hyperrectangles, a simpler and even faster architecture is proposed. After introducing the new architectures, their key features are discussed and compared to previous architectures implementing PWA functions with domains partitioned into different types of polytopes. Case studies concerning the FPGA implementation of so-called explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) laws for constrained linear systems are used as benchmarks to compare the different architectures.	algorithm;approximation;circuit complexity;computation;curse of dimensionality;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;game controller;linear system;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;picasa web albums;piecewise linear continuation;point location;requirement;search tree;time complexity	Francesco Comaschi;Bart A.

If standard techniques such as the fast Fourier transform are used to study the signal, the data record needs to be very long. Additionally, there would be a very large number of calculations. The rapid binary gage function was developed to quickly determine the period of the signal, and the start time of the first pulse in the data. Once these two parameters are determined, the pulsed signal can be recovered using a standard data folding and adding technique.	fast fourier transform;image noise;pseudorandom noise;row (database);signal-to-noise ratio	Colin P.

5821b530e25e14bbec00f6635014ef9e50f1d8d3	the partial fast fourier transform		An efficient algorithm for computing the one-dimensional partial fast Fourier transform fj = ∑c(j) k=0 e Fk is presented. Naive computation of the partial fast Fourier transform requires O(N) arithmetic operations for input data of length N . Unlike the standard fast Fourier transform, the partial fast Fourier transform imposes on the frequency variable k a cutoff function c(j) that depends on the space variable j; this prevents one from directly applying standard FFT algorithms. It is shown that the space–frequency domain can be partitioned into rectangular and trapezoidal subdomains over which efficient algorithms can be developed. As in the previous work of Ying and Fomel (2009), the contribution from rectangular regions can be reduced to a series of fractional-phase Fourier transforms over squares, each of which can be reduced to a convolution. In this work, we demonstrate that the partial Fourier transform over trapezoidal domains can also be reduced to a convolution. Since the computational complexity of a dealiased convolution of N inputs is O(N logN), a fast algorithm for the partial Fourier transform is achieved, with a lower overall coefficient than obtained by Ying and Fomel.	algorithm;approximation;chirp z-transform;closing (morphology);coefficient;computation;computational complexity theory;convolution;fast fourier transform;fractional fourier transform;hybrid algorithm;norm (social);power of two;quasi-quotation;recursion;subdivision surface;time complexity	John C.

Based on the author's previous work on efficient dynamic inversion using stable pole-zero cancelation and non-minimum phase zero inversion using Kurosu filter, this paper employs the use of the Delta Operator filter realization to mitigate quantization effects in fixed-point computations. The Kurosu filter based inversion, where the difference of two IIR filters are used to approximate a high order FIR filter and switches are used to perform time reversals for phase compensation, is computationally efficient and well suited for low level fixed-point realization by digital signal processors or field programmable gate arrays. However, substantial quantization noise is evident in high sampling rate implementation. The Delta Operator realization increases computational complexity only slightly while providing substantial reduction of quantization noise. The method is employed in the feedforward and repetitive control of a piezoelectric actuator and the experimental results are presented to demonstrate its effectiveness.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;central processing unit;clock rate;computation;computational complexity theory;control flow;delta operator;digital signal processing;digital signal processor;feedforward neural network;field-programmable gate array;finite impulse response;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point arithmetic;infinite impulse response;iteration;minimum phase;network switch;piezoelectricity;quantization (signal processing);sampling (signal processing);serialization;t-symmetry	Herrick L.

The denominator polynomials of these all-pole transfer functions are calculated via the sum of two Lommel polynomials Rn,μ(z) and Rn-1,ν(z) of orders n and n-1 with different indices μ and ν correspondingly. The proposed wide class of transfer functions may be considered as a generalization of Bessel transfer functions. Indeed for the particular choice of μ= 1/ 2 and ν= 3/ 2 the proposed filters are coinciding with Bessel amplifiers/filters. Using different values of μand ν allow one to modify the transfer function, obtain a desirable step-response overshoot and find the required overshoot- or rise-time-bandwidth exchange. This flexibility is especially useful for design of wideband amplifiers.	amplifier;bessel filter;lommel polynomial;overshoot (signal);rise time;step response;transfer function	Igor M.

0fad0df7e662d1655f19dd65a8b322321b45f0d2	direct inversion of the 3d pseudo-polar fourier transform		The pseudo-polar Fourier transform is a specialized non-equally spaced Fourier transform, which evaluates the Fourier transform on a near-polar grid known as the pseudo-polar grid. The advantage of the pseudo-polar grid over other non-uniform sampling geometries is that the transformation, which samples the Fourier transform on the pseudo-polar grid, can be inverted using a fast and stable algorithm. For other sampling geometries, even if the nonequally spaced Fourier transform can be inverted, the only known algorithms are iterative. The convergence speed of these algorithms as well as their accuracy are difficult to control, as they depend both on the sampling geometry as well as on the unknown reconstructed object. In this paper, a direct inversion algorithm for the three-dimensional pseudo-polar Fourier transform is presented. The algorithm is based only on one-dimensional resampling operations, and is shown to be significantly faster than existing iterative inversion algorithms.	algorithm;circulant matrix;double-precision floating-point format;embedded system;emoticon;gene expression programming;iteration;iterative method;nonuniform sampling;preprocessor;requirement;sampling (signal processing);time complexity;toeplitz hash algorithm;trigonometric polynomial	Amir Averbuch;Gil Shabat;Yoel Shkolnisky	2015	CoRR		fourier transform;constant q transform;mathematical optimization;discrete-time fourier transform;hartley transform;s transform;harmonic wavelet transform;pseudo-spectral method;short-time fourier transform;continuous wavelet transform;fractional fourier transform;discrete sine transform;discrete fourier transform;fourier inversion theorem;mathematics;geometry;discrete fourier transform;fourier analysis;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;phase correlation;prime-factor fft algorithm;cyclotomic fast fourier transform	Vision	56.57017589720131	21.401948438144412	174326

When voltage variations along the circuit are small and losses of both real and reactive powers are small compared with the respective flows, the resulting optimization problem is convex. Moreover, the cost function is separable enabling a distributed online implementation with node-local computations using only local measurements augmented with limited information from the neighboring nodes communicated over cyber channels. Such an approach lies between the fully centralized and local policy approaches previously considered. We explore protocols based on the dual-ascent method and on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs), and find that the ADMM protocol performs significantly better.	augmented lagrangian method;centralized computing;computation;constrained optimization;convex function;distributed control system;inverter (logic gate);loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;power inverter;solar inverter;times ascent	Petr Sulc;Scott Backhaus;Michael Chertkov	2014	IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion	10.1109/TEC.2014.2363196	control engineering;electronic engineering;maximum power point tracking;control theory;mathematics;voltage optimisation	EDA	65.06404102620677	31.76408778109075	176204

In this paper, a novel algorithm to perform DCT multiplierlessly is proposed. First, by modular mapping and truncating Taylor series expansion, the DCT is expressed in the form of the product of the constants and discrete moments. Second, by performing appropriate bit operations and shift operations in binary system, the product can be transformed to some additions of integers. The proposed algorithm only involves integer additions and shifts because the discrete moments can be computed only by integer additions. An efficient and regular systolic array is designed to implement the proposed algorithm, and the complexity analysis is also given. Different to other fast Cosine transforms, our algorithm can deal with arbitrary length signals and get high precision. The approach is also applicable to multi-dimensional DCT and DCT inverses.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;digital signal processing;discrete cosine transform;series expansion;truncation	Zhenbing Liu;Jianguo Liu;Guoyou Wang	2010	JCP	10.4304/jcp.5.5.725-732	arithmetic;discrete mathematics;modified discrete cosine transform;computer science;theoretical computer science;discrete cosine transform;mathematics;moment	ML	57.400873504935994	21.370562630291033	178420

bb975dc8865be1a7f129783e03ee30f04cc4f4d8	efficient multirate filter bank generation with full spectral utilization		An engine for generating FIR filters of bandwidths that are arbitrary multiplications of a particular quantity are proposed. The design is based on first replacing z by zL, where L is an integer, in a low pass filter to result in a multiband filter with arbitrarily sharp transition band. The complement of this multiband filter is also generated. The important step in the proposed design is to feed this into a polyphase filter bank structure to isolate each band. The same is done to the complement of the multiband filter using a second polyphase filter bank structure. This way we have separate bands that could be combined with perfectly flat magnitude response and linear phase. It is shown that all combinations of individual bands could be computed in minimum possible logarithmic time while using the minimum number of additions. In this way, we have a structure to generate any filter response within the smallest band in the multiband structure using few additions. The filters could be left as complex i.e. single band or could be made real with addition to their corresponding conjugates at the cost of losing half the filter bands. The proposed dual filter bank structure could result in a multicarrier communications system that achieves full spectral utilization.	filter bank;finite impulse response;linear phase;low-pass filter;polyphase matrix;time complexity	Adly T.

This lattice structure is based on Parker and Kayran‘s four-field lattice approach. Starting with given 2-D autocorrelation samples, four quarter-plane gapped functions are generated. Their linear combination is used to satisfy gap conditions and calculate 2-D lattice parameter reflection factors for the first stage. In order to determine the growing number of 2-D reflection coefficients at succesive stages, appropriately defined auxiliary gapped functions are introduced after the first order. The theory has been confirmed by computer simulations. In addition to developing the basic theory, the presentation includes a comparison between the proposed 2-D lattice structure and other existing four-field lattice structures.		Ahmet H.

4bfd8cc2dff12fffc588506be3d9452c5d3e200d	cubature formulas, discrepancy, and nonlinear approximation	nonlinear approximation;approximation theory;numerical integration;special functions	The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate connections between the following three big areas of research: the theory of cubature formulas (numerical integration), the discrepancy theory, and nonlinear approximation. In Section 1, we discuss a relation between results on cubature formulas and on discrepancy. In particular, we show how standard in the theory of cubature formulas settings can be translated into the discrepancy problem and into a natural generalization of the discrepancy problem. This leads to a concept of the r-discrepancy. In Section 2, we present results on a relation between construction of an optimal cubature formula with m knots for a given function class and best nonlinear m-term approximation of a special function determined by the function class. The nonlinear m-term approximation is taken with regard to a redundant dictionary also determined by the function class. Sections 3 and 4 contain some known results on the lower and the upper estimates of errors of optimal cubature formulas for the class of functions with bounded mixed derivative. One of the important messages (well known in approximation theory) of this paper is that the theory of discrepancy is closely connected with the theory of cubature formulas for the classes of functions with bounded mixed derivative. We have included in the paper both new results (Section 2) and known results. We included some known results with their proofs for the following two reasons. First of all we want to make the paper self-contained (within reasonable limits). Secondly, we selected the proofs which demonstrate different methods and are not very much technically involved. Section 5 contains historical notes on discrepancy and cubature formulas, some further comments and remarks. Historical remarks on nonlinear approximation are included in Section 2. We want to point out that this paper is not a complete survey in any of the above-mentioned areas. We did not even try to provide a complete list of results in those areas. We rather wanted to highlight the most typical results in This research was supported by the National Science Foundation Grant DMS 0200187 and by ONR Grant N00014-96-1-1003.

In this paper simulations of matrix inversion with numbers represented in the fixed-point and logarithmic number systems (LNS) are presented. A software framework has been implemented to allow extensive simulation of finite wordlength matrix inversion. Six different algorithms have been used and results on matrix condition number, wordlength, and to some extent matrix size are presented. The simulations among other things show that the wordlength requirements differ significantly between different algorithms in both fixed-point and LNS representations. The results can be used as a starting point for a matrix inversion hardware implementation.	algorithm;condition number;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point arithmetic;logarithmic number system;requirement;simulation;software framework	Carl Ingemarsson;Oscar Gustafsson	2011	2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)	10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043633	adaptive filter;computer vision;mathematical optimization;dynamic range;discrete mathematics;computer science;floating point;logarithmic number system;theoretical computer science;software framework;condition number;signal processing;mathematics;fixed point;fixed-point arithmetic;state-transition matrix;matrix decomposition;symmetric matrix;mimo	Metrics	59.20525232418953	19.11322744102827	181457

A unified fast (m-1)-dimensional polynomial transform [(m-1)-D PT] and 1-D DWTs algorithm for computing these two types of m-D DWTs are then proposed. By revealing the relationships among the m-dimensional discrete W transforms (m-D DWTs), the m-dimensional generalized discrete Fourier transforms (m-D GDFTs), the m-dimensional discrete cosine transforms (m-D DCTs), and the m-dimensional discrete sine transforms (m-D DSTs), the generalized fast algorithms for 14 types of the m-D discrete sinusoidal transforms including four types of m-D DWTs and the same number of types of m-D GDFTs, and three types of m-D DCTs and the same number of types of m-D DSTs are presented. The number of multiplications for all 14 types of the m-D discrete sinusoidal transforms needed by the proposed algorithm is only 1/m times that of the widely used corresponding row-column methods. The number of additions required by the proposed algorithm is also reduced considerably. Finally, with the help of the software platform Visual C++ 6.0 for Windows 98, the computation time comparisons between the proposed and the reported algorithms are given. The numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms are not only highly efficient but are also very simple in computational structure.	computation	L. Z. Cheng;Zengfu Wang;Z. H.

Based on a new proposed alternative recursive sparse matrix factorization for the MDCT (modified discrete cosine transform) matrix and a relation between the MDCT and the MDST (modified discrete sine transform), firstly a new recursive fast radix-2 MDST algorithm is derived. The corresponding fast MDCT and MDST computational structures are regular and complementary to each other. Consequently, this fact enables us by their composition to construct a fast MCLT computational structure representing the fast recursive radix-2 MCLT algorithm. The fast MCLT computational structure is regular and all its stages may be realized in parallel. Combining the proposed fast radix-2 MCLT algorithm with an existing generalized fast mixed-radix MDCT algorithm defined for the composite lengths N = 2 × qm, m ≥ 2, where q is an odd positive integer, we can compute the MCLT for the composite lengths N = 2n × qm, n, m ≥ 2, thus supporting a wider range of transform sizes compared to existing fast MCLT algorithms.	algorithm;computation;discrete sine transform;lapped transform;modified discrete cosine transform;modulation;recursion (computer science);sparse matrix	Vladimir Britanak	2012	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2012.2213082	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;sparse matrix;signal processing;mathematics	Visualization	57.78099685753775	21.03670208939955	182465

In this paper, we first highlight inherently built-in approximation errors of discrete-time signal processing techniques employing wavelet transform framework. Then, we present an overview of emerging analog signal processing applications of wavelet transform along with its still active research topics in more matured discrete-time processing applications. It is shown that analog wavelet transform is successfully implemented in biomedical signal processing for design of low-power pacemakers and also in ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communications. The engineering details of analog circuit implementation for these continuous-time wavelet transform applications are provided for further studies. We expect a flurry of new research and technology development activities in the coming years utilizing still promising and almost untapped analog wavelet transform and multiresolution signal representation techniques. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 1. Historical perspective and current status Multiresolution representation of image and video has always generated an interest in vision research due to the spectral properties andmodels of the human visual system (HVS). Burt andAdelson proposed their pyramid decomposition algorithm for multiresolution coding of image signals [1]. Their pioneering work opened the gate for a new image coding technique where better frequency localized subband transforms found their use as an alternative to the widely used discrete cosine transform (DCT) coding [2–4]. On the same track, Mallat looked into the continuous-time discrete wavelet transform as a multiresolution signal decomposition technique and its interconnections to discrete-time filter banks in his doctoral dissertation [5]. ∗ Corresponding author.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.phycom.2009.07.001 Independently, Daubechies elegantly formalized the theoretical linkage, first brought up by Mallat, between finite support orthonormal wavelet transform basis and two-band perfect reconstruction quadrature mirror filter (PR-QMF) bank in her seminal paper published in 1988 [6]. While Goupillaud, Grossmann, Morlet and other researchers in Europe made their early contributions, Daubechies’ celebrated paper was the most significant starter for wavelet related research activities in the United States [7–9]. The New Jersey Institute of Technology Wavelets Symposium and the NSF CBMS Conference on Wavelets in 1990 [10,11] were the first two technical conferences in the Unites States where Signal Processing, Mathematics and other research communities shared the same venues for interdisciplinary exchanges and crossfertilization have taken place. Most of the relevant early work in signal processing field was to show and emphasize the theoretical interconnections and linkages between wavelet and subband transforms proven by Daubechies [6,12]. There were other 2 A.N. Akansu et al. / Physical Communication 3 (2010) 1–18 research contributions that offered filter bank solutions that lead to the design of compactly supported orthonormal wavelet bases. On the other hand, the theory of wavelet transforms were better understood by signal processing engineers and several tutorial papers on the subject published in the literature. A number of well written early research monographs, lecture notes and edited books on wavelet transforms and multiresolution signal processing and filter banks were published [13–15]. Then, there were many good quality papers and books on wavelet and subband transforms, and their applications published in the signal processing literature. In addition to highlighting some novel implementation and applications of analog wavelet transforms, this review paper will describe wavelet transform approximation errors inherent in discrete-time signal processing and also some of the principle developments in wavelet theory for analog signal processing. One of the important developments in the construction, design, and implementation of wavelet (multiscale) transforms is the design of geometrically-oriented twodimensional (and higher) transforms. For example, starting with the steerable pyramid and continuing with the curvelet, contourlet, and shearlet, dual-tree complex wavelet transforms and wave atoms. These are especially important because some of the popular applications of multiscale transform are in image processing, for which these transforms make a substantial difference. In addition, these years have seen many advances in digital filter bank theory, for example in parameterizations, directional filter banks, and others. Additionally, the frequency domain design and FFT-based implementation of wavelet transforms has received new attention in the recent literature, for both one-dimensional and multidimensional non-separable geometrically-oriented transforms, because this approach overcomes limitations of FIR-filter-based designs. For example, using an FFT-implementation, orthonormal dyadic discrete wavelet transforms with symmetric filters and symmetric boundary extensions can be implemented for any signal length, including odd-lengths. In contrast, the conventional orthonormal FIR-convolution implementation cannot be simultaneously orthonormal and symmetric (excepting the Haar transform) and is furthermore usually implemented for signals whose lengths are powers of two. One of the many active application areas of wavelet transform has been of denoising. The state-of the-art has progressed significantly over the last 20 years. For applications of denoising, the noise is rarely entirely Gaussian nor signal independent. Therefore, signal processingmethods that can be applied to realistic scenarios are of continuing interest. Wavelet-based algorithms have also been developed for the problem of deconvolution. Some deconvolution and denoising algorithms can be unified into the framework of iterative thresholding. This approach has been proven to converge for certain problem formulations to a unique minimizer, and this theory serves as a foundation basis for further developments. For many years the notion of sparsity been central in the motivation and effectiveness of wavelet transforms for compression, denoising, etc. Recently, important results regarding sparsity and L1-norm minimization have been discovered and are fueling ongoing research activities. A recent issue of the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine is dedicated to Compressed Sensing [16], a sparsity-based approach to reduce the number of requiredmeasurements of signal. Some of these discrete-time signal processing applications of wavelet transforms are further discussed in Section 4 of the paper. As a multiresolution signal analysis technique, the wavelet transform offers the possibility of selective noise filtering and reliable parameter estimation, and therefore, can contribute efficiently to morphological analysis. For this reason wavelets have been extensively used in biomedical signal processing, mainly due to the versatility of the wavelet transform tools. Signal analysis methods derived from wavelet analysis carry large potential to support a wide range of biomedical signal processing applications including noise reduction, feature recognition and signal compression. In implantable medical devices, such as pacemakers and implantable cardio defibrillators, power consumption is a critical issue due to the limited energy density and the longevity of currently available portable batteries. This implies that the design of such devices has to be optimized for very low-power dissipation. Due to the great relative power required for the analog-to-digital conversion and its marginal improvement in power efficiency over the years, it is predicted that the implementation of a fully digital wavelet signal processor in implantable pacemakers will not be feasible for several decades to come. For this reason, a method for implementing wavelet transform using continuous-time analog circuitry was proposed in Ref. [17], based on the development of ultra-low-power analog integrated circuits that implement the required signal processing, taking into account the limitations imposed by an implantable device. The implementation of wavelet transform in an analog fashion is equivalent to the implementation of a filter whose impulse response is the desired (reversed) wavelet function. Hence, wavelet transform can be implemented by means of analog filters and filter banks. In implantable medical devices, minimization of the power consumption for a guaranteed performance reduces down to four important design steps as follows, 1. minimization of the total number of wavelet scales required, e.g., by introducing so-called multi-wavelets [18]; 2. minimization of the order of thewavelet filter, i.e., finding a suitable approximation to the desired wavelet by means of a low-order rational transfer function [19]; 3. optimization of the wavelet filter topology, i.e., finding the optimal state–space description implementing the wavelet filter transfer function [17,20]; and 4. optimizing the elementary wavelet filter building blocks, viz. the integrators. Other applications that benefit from implementation of wavelet transform by means of analog circuitry are those that deal with high frequencies as required in portable andwearable wireless communication devices, as here the A.N.

ULPPUFB can be viewed as generalized lapped orthogonal transforms (GenLOTs) with variable-length basis functions and are used in block transform-based image coding. ULPPUFB has long basis functions in order to avoid blocking artifacts, whereas it reserves short basis functions for high-frequency signal components like edges, thereby limiting ringing artifacts. The design of ULPPUFB has already been shown and can be expressed completely using a lattice structure. However, when it is used in image coding, the coding gain must be maximization, and then we must use non-linear optimization algorithms. When filter length or channel numbers are increased, non-linear optimization algorithms would necessitate an enormous amount of calculation. In this paper, we design each filter without using non-linear optimization, directly based on the compaction problem and implement ULPPUFB by changing these filters into lattice structures. Then, we show their validity.	coding gain;filter bank;linear phase	Akihiro Ochi;Yuhiro Kobayashi;Masaaki Ikehara	2002		10.1109/APCCAS.2002.1114911	compaction;algorithm design;computer vision;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;multidisciplinary design optimization;linear phase;digital filter;low-pass filter;image processing;computer science;crystal structure;electrical engineering;ringing artifacts;high frequency;coding gain;lattice;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;band-pass filter;symmetry	Vision	59.58248195426075	18.258826869162434	185682
fd25ce3a6a8495284558e1d16ae158eb18de79af	spatial mixing and non-local markov chains		We consider spin systems with nearest-neighbor interactions on an n-vertex d-dimensional cube of the integer lattice graph Z. We study the e ects that exponential decay with distance of spin correlations, speci cally the strong spatial mixing condition (SSM), has on the rate of convergence to equilibrium distribution of non-local Markov chains. We prove that SSM implies O(log n) mixing of a block dynamics whose steps can be implemented e ciently. We then develop a methodology, consisting of several new comparison inequalities concerning various block dynamics, that allow us to extend this result to other non-local dynamics. As a rst application of our method we prove that, if SSM holds, then the relaxation time (i.e., the inverse spectral gap) of general block dynamics isO(r), where r is the number of blocks. A second application of our technology concerns the Swendsen-Wang dynamics for the ferromagnetic Ising and Potts models. We show that SSM implies anO(1) bound for the relaxation time. As a by-product of this implication we observe that the relaxation time of the Swendsen-Wang dynamics in square boxes of Z isO(1) throughout the subcritical regime of the q-state Potts model, for all q ≥ 2. We also prove that for monotone spin systems SSM implies that the mixing time of systematic scan dynamics is O(log n(log log n)). Systematic scan dynamics are widely employed in practice but have proved hard to analyze. Our proofs use a variety of techniques for the analysis of Markov chains including coupling, functional analysis and linear algebra. ∗School of Computer Science, Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA 30332.

First, separable two-dimensional (2-D) linear filtering is decomposed into the cascade of one-dimensional filtering in the DCT domain. We investigate special characteristics of DCT domain filtering matrices when the filter coefficients are symmetric. Then we present the DCT-domain 2-D filtering method using these characteristics. The proposed method requires a smaller number of multiplications including the typical sparseness of DCT coefficients compared to previous DCT-domain linear filtering methods. Also, the proposed method is composed of simple and regular operations, which would be appropriate for efficient very large scale integration implementation.	coefficient;discrete cosine transform;integrated circuit;internationalized domain name;neural coding;round-off error;rounding;very-large-scale integration	Changhoon Yim	2004	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	10.1109/TCSVT.2004.825558	data compression;multidimensional signal processing;computer vision;discrete mathematics;transform coding;index term;image processing;image compression;computer science;theoretical computer science;discrete cosine transform;linear filter;mathematics;bilinear filtering;very-large-scale integration;trilinear filtering;algorithm	Visualization	59.24991164001971	19.79796705212922	186108

8d4291875b4a3e9aa25c403f8f5ed80e46f11ba0	implementing an integer linear approach to multi-objective phasor measurement unit placement		In this paper, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem for a model of Multi-Objective Optimal PMU Placement (MOPP) is proposed. The proposed approach concurrently deals with two objectives. The first objective is the number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) which should be minimized. The second objective function is measurement redundancy which is the number of observable buses in the case of PMU outage. In fact, whatever the amount of second objective increases, the system would be more reliable. Furthermore, some linearized formulations are defined for each nonlinear formula. In fact, the nonlinear nature of formulation related to redundancy is substituted by linear inequality and so there is no nonlinear formula such that the calculation of the problem would be simplified. Finally, a modified 9-bus test system is implemented to show how the proposed method is effective.	phasor	Amir Baharvandi;Miadreza Shafie-khah;Saber Talari;João P. S.

The proposed scheme is based on two way splitting method to use Toeplitz matrix-vector product using inner product (TMVPIP) formula. Applying the proposed TMVPIP architecture, it is shown that the computation time of proposed sub quadratic multiplier can be reduced from O(log_2 m) of the existing sub quadratic multipliers to O(log_2 log_2 m). Our proposed sub quadratic multiplier with TMVPIP formula is suitable for efficient implementation of the point multiplication in Koblitz curves.	bit-level parallelism;computation;lagrange multiplier;matrix multiplication;normal basis;polynomial;time complexity;toeplitz hash algorithm;trinomial	Chiou-Yng Lee;Pramod Kumar Meher	2011	2011 Fifth International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computing	10.1109/ICGEC.2011.62	mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;gaussian process;mathematics;elliptic curve;finite field;algebra	Robotics	58.08019538456576	21.97231038374443	189273
84622812deb71ad74b921101417fe6670e15be99	identifying and characterizing non-convexities in feasible spaces of optimal power flow problems		Optimal power flow (OPF) is an important problem in the operation of electric power systems. The solution to an OPF problem provides a minimum cost operating point that satisfies constraints imposed by both the non-linear power flow equations and engineering limits. These constraints can yield non-convex feasible spaces that result in significant computational challenges. This brief proposes an algorithm that identifies and characterizes non-convexities in OPF feasible spaces. This algorithm searches for a pair of feasible points whose connecting line segment contains an infeasible point. Such points certify the existence of a non-convexity in the OPF feasible space. Moreover, the constraint violations at the infeasible point along the connecting line segment physically characterize a cause of the non-convexity. Numerical demonstrations include a small illustrative example as well as applications to various test cases.	algorithm;computation;ibm power systems;linear programming relaxation;nonlinear system;numerical method;operating point;solver;spaces;test case;triplet state	Daniel K.

The forward transformation has been applied by taking the odd reciprocals that occur in the DHT matrix with respect to a power of 2. Specifically, the expression for a 16-point transform is provided and results of a few representative signals are provided. The inverse transform is the inverse of the forward 16-point matrix. But at this time the inverse transform is not identical to the forward transform and, therefore, our proposed number theoretic transform must be taken as a provisional result.	distributed hash table;hilbert transform;power of two;theory	Renuka Kandregula	2009	CoRR		discrete hartley transform;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;radon transform;hartley transform;s transform;hilbert transform;continuous wavelet transform;inverse laplace transform;binomial transform;laplace transform applied to differential equations;fractional fourier transform;hilbert–huang transform;discrete sine transform;discrete fourier transform;two-sided laplace transform;mathematics;discrete fourier transform;starred transform;kontorovich–lebedev transform;hilbert spectral analysis;mellin transform;algebra	Theory	56.05294917093302	19.947620752110822	189295

As our main contribution, we show that if approximate gradients and Hessians of the primal barrier can be computed, and the relative errors in such quantities are not too large, then the algorithm we analyze has polynomial worstcase iteration complexity. As a special case, we prove polynomial iteration complexity when the gradient and Hessian can be evaluated exactly. The algorithm we analyze requires no evaluation—or even approximate evaluation—of quantities related to the barrier function for the dual cone, even for problems in which the underlying cone is not self-dual.	approximation algorithm;barrier function;best, worst and average case;conic optimization;convex optimization;dual cone and polar cone;gradient;hessian;interior point method;iteration;mathematical optimization;polynomial;time complexity;trusted computer system evaluation criteria	Simon P.

This leads to significant savings in hardware components with respect to fast Fourier transform based STFTs. Furthermore, the feedforward STFT does not have the accumulative error of iterative STFT approaches. As a result, the proposed feedforward STFT presents an excellent tradeoff between hardware utilization and performance.	fast fourier transform;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;iterative method;short-time fourier transform	Mario Garrido	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2016.2534838	control engineering;constant q transform;discrete-time fourier transform;electronic engineering;speech recognition;time–frequency analysis;harmonic wavelet transform;short-time fourier transform;computer science;fractional fourier transform;discrete fourier transform;mathematical model;mathematics;iterative method;discrete fourier transform;fourier analysis;quantum mechanics;adder	Visualization	59.719890190037475	21.648722840735026	189654

The Volterra kernel can be represented as a generalized convolution. It would thus be expected that multirate architectures could be used to advantage in realizing Volterra kernels as well. The quadratic Volterra kernel may be realized in the form of an “LDL structure.” The LDL structure includes a set of FIR filters of increasing length, which may be realized in a computationally efficient manner using multirate architectures.	algorithmic efficiency;computational complexity theory;convolution;digital filter;finite impulse response;volterra's function	Vikram M.

Some of the desirable properties for VLSI realiization are regularity, local connection and pipelinability. Lattice digital filters, which have many applications in signal modeling, spectrum estimation, and adaptive filtering, exhibit' good finite word-length behavior, but cannot be pipelined to finer levels (such as bit or multi-bit levels) due to the presence of feedback loops. Although lattice filters can be pipelined by the cut-set localiza'tion procedure, it should be noted that the maximum sample rate cannot be increased by this technique. In this paper, based upon the properties of the Schur algorithm, a pipelining method in lattice digital filters is introduced, by which the sample rate can be increased at any desired level. By constraining the poles to be located at equal angular and radial spacing, the denominator of the transfer function is forced to be in scamred hk-ahead form. It is shown that this transfer function satisfies the pipelining property of lattice filters. Furthermore, based upon state variable description, new methods for scaling and output roundoff noise calculations are introduced; these can be easily applied to lattice IIR digital filters or lattice IIR digital filters conneated with other type of filters. The relationship between pipelining stages and the output roundoff noise is analyzed using first and second-order IIR filters. The use of pipelined lattice IIR digital filters in low-power applications is also demonstrated.	adaptive filter;angularjs;bit-level parallelism;digital filter;feedback;image scaling;infinite impulse response;lehmer–schur algorithm;low-power broadcasting;pipeline (computing);pipeline (software);radial (radio);sampling (signal processing);signal processing;spectral density estimation;transfer function;very-large-scale integration	Jin-Gyun Chung;Keshab K.

As a complement to classical analysis techniques for sampling in such spaces, we propose a method which is based on a simple interpolation estimate of a certain coefficient mapping. Then we use this method for deriving both new results and relatively simple proofs of some previously known results. Among these are both some results of rather general nature and some more specialized results for B-spline wavelets. The main problem under study is to find a shift x0 and an upper bound δ such that any function f ∈ V can be reconstructed from a sequence of sample values (f(x0 + k + δk))k∈Z, either when all δk = 0 or in the irregular sampling case with an upper bound supk |δk| < δ.	b-spline;coefficient;interpolation;sampling (signal processing);spline wavelet	Stefan Ericsson;Niklas Grip	2005	IJWMIP	10.1142/S0219691305000877	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;interpolation;reproducing kernel hilbert space;mathematics;statistics	Theory	54.65372568994331	20.683026481305422	191397

The frames consist of seven generators obtained from the lowpass filter using spectral factorization, with the lowpass filter obtained via a simple method using Taylor polynomials. The filters are simple to construct, and offer smooth scaling functions and wavelets. Additionally, the filterbanks presented in this paper have limited redundancy while maintaining the smoothness of underlying limit functions. The filters are linear phase (symmetric), FIR, and the resulting wavelets possess vanishing moments.	decimation (signal processing);dilation (morphology);filter bank;finite impulse response;frame (linear algebra);image scaling;linear phase;low-pass filter;polynomial;truncation;wavelet	A.

In this letter, a new method for inverting the finite Hilbert transform that requires data only on a finite interval is proposed. The new method is compared to the Jacobi-polynomial collocation method, which is employed for solving the airfoil integral equation, which is equivalent to inverting the finite Hilbert transform. Quantitative results show that the new method is more accurate and less susceptible to data noise than collocation and other methods.	algorithm;collocation method;hilbert transform;jacobi method;polynomial;signal processing	Emil Y.

In this paper, we shall investigate the mutual relations among these three properties. A characterization of Lp (1 ≤ p ≤ ∞) smoothness of multivariate refinable functions is presented. It is well known that there is a close relation between a fundamental refinable function and a biorthogonal wavelet. We shall demonstrate that any fundamental refinable function, whose mask is supported on [1 − 2r, 2r − 1]s for some positive integer r and satisfies the sum rules of optimal order 2r, has Lp smoothness not exceeding that of the univariate fundamental refinable function with the mask br. Here the sequence br on Z is the unique univariate interpolatory refinement mask which is supported on [1− 2r, 2r− 1] and satisfies the sum rules of order 2r. Based on a similar idea, we shall prove that any orthogonal scaling function, whose mask is supported on [0, 2r− 1]s for some positive integer r and satisfies the sum rules of optimal order r, has Lp smoothness not exceeding that of the univariate Daubechies orthogonal scaling function whose mask is supported on [0, 2r − 1]. We also demonstrate that a similar result holds true for biorthogonal wavelets. Examples are provided to illustrate the general theory. Finally, a general CBC (Construction By Cosets) algorithm is presented to construct all the dual refinement masks of any given interpolatory refinement mask with the dual masks satisfying arbitrary order of sum rules. Thus, for any scaling function which is fundamental, this algorithm can be employed to generate a dual scaling function with arbitrary approximation order. This CBC algorithm can be easily implemented. As a particular application of the general CBC algorithm, a TCBC (Triangle Construction By Cosets) algorithm is proposed. For any positive integer k and any interpolatory refinement mask a such that a is symmetric about all the coordinate axes, such TCBC algorithm provides us a dual mask of a such that the dual mask satisfies the sum rules of order 2k and is also symmetric about all the coordinate axes. As an application of this TCBC algorithm, a family of optimal bivariate biorthogonal wavelets is presented with the scaling function being a spline function.	algorithm;biorthogonal wavelet;bivariate data;image scaling;interpolation;iterative refinement;order of approximation;refinable function;refinement (computing);spline (mathematics)	Bin Han	2000	SIAM J.

f18680a9ee97ab38ed96435d3fb3c34c64e982fb	a matrix polynomial spectral approach for general joint block diagonalization	general joint block diagonalization;15a69;tensor decomposition;65f18;matrix polynomial	Joint block diagonalization (JBD) of a given Hermitian matrix set $\{A_i\}_{i=0}^p$ is to find a nonsingular matrix $W$ such that $W^H A_i W$ for $i=0,1,\dots, p$ are all block diagonal matrices with the same prescribed block diagonal structure. General JBD (GJBD) attempts to solve JBD without knowing the resulting block diagonal structure in advance, which is more difficult than JBD. In this paper, we reveal that GJBD of $\{A_i\}_{i=0}^p$ is strongly connected with the spectral information of the corresponding matrix polynomial $P(\lambda)=\sum_{i=0}^p\lambda^i A_i$. Under some conditions, the solutions to GJBD are characterized by the spectral information, and a necessary and sufficient condition is given for the existence of nontrivial solutions to GJBD. In addition, based on the established theory, two feasible numerical methods are proposed to solve GJBD.	matrix polynomial	Yunfeng Cai;Decai Shi;Shufang Xu	2015	SIAM J.

We show that under certain conditions Discrete Chrestenson Transform is equivalent to Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and so is Fast Discrete Chrestenson Transform equivalent to FFT under certain conditions. We also show that coefficient distribution of signal's Chrestenson transform only depends upon p in Chrestenson function instead of data samples pm, where m is any integer larger than 1 and p is any integer larger than 2. We first derive series of discrete Chrestenson Transform expressions generally, and then consider various cases for sample numbers and frequency samples number. Lastly, we also show that samples of pm do not affect coefficient distribution of signal's Chrestenson transform but can better reduce the correlations between all coefficients statistically for p-adic process.	coefficient;discrete fourier transform;fast fourier transform;s transform	Mingyong Zhou;Xiaole Shi;Zhongkan Liu	2015	2015 Third International Conference on Robot, Vision and Signal Processing (RVSP)	10.1109/RVSP.2015.57	arithmetic;fourier transform;discrete hartley transform;constant q transform;discrete-time fourier transform;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;hartley transform;s transform;harmonic wavelet transform;short-time fourier transform;split-radix fft algorithm;fractional fourier transform;discrete sine transform;discrete fourier transform;discrete cosine transform;mathematics;discrete fourier transform;rader's fft algorithm;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;prime-factor fft algorithm;fourier transform on finite groups	Vision	56.17207353663403	20.018367850479795	195106

The proposed algorithm is based on the Simultaneous Schur Decomposition (SSD) of particular matrices derived from the array to process. This CP algorithm solves some convergence problems of classical iterative techniques and its identifiability assumptions are less restrictive than those of other semi-algebraic methods. We also propose a new Jacobi-like algorithm to calculate the SSD of several complex-valued matrices. Finally the usefulness of the proposed method is illustrated in the context of fluorescence spectroscopy and epileptic source localization.	algorithm;iterative method;jacobi method;linear algebra;semiconductor industry;solid-state drive	Sepideh Hajipour Sardouie;Laurent Albera;Mohammad Bagher Shamsollahi;Isabelle Merlet	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638446	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;schur decomposition;fluorescence spectroscopy;mathematics;iterative method	Vision	64.91909390741007	19.417524155381923	195910

Faster convergence is achieved by introducing an improved noise power estimator for step-size control. This echo canceller has been implemented on V830 multimedia embedded RISC and has been integrated into a car navigation system. V830 provides performance comparable to a digital signal processor (DSP) and extended flexibility while power consumption is lower than that of a DSP. Computer simulations and measurements using a V830 board show fast convergence and robustness against disturbance such as a noise and a double-talk without double-talk detection.	automotive navigation system;computer simulation;digital signal processor;echo suppression and cancellation;embedded system;noise power;signal processing	Yutaka Hiratani;Akihim Hirano;Masaya Kanazawa	1998		10.1109/ICASSP.1998.681798	computer simulation;embedded system;digital signal processor;real-time computing;computer science;digital signal processing	EDA	62.16485850653463	22.737968425938547	196439

Four types (I-IV) are described. They are defined and used as bases for updating both the discrete Hartley and Fourier transforms sample by sample. The z-transforms solutions of running DHTs are used to design the recursive real-time DHT analysers. These serve as efficient foundations for sub-band filters, spectrum analysis, convolution and fast computation of various forms of discrete Fourier transforms. An exemplary architecture is given.

Polyphase components, of any user, are processed by a number of synthesis FB and analysis FB branches of a uniform TMUX. One branch, of the TMUX, represents one granularity band and any user occupies integer multiples of a granularity band. By adjusting the number of branches, assigned to each user, a nonuniform TMUX is obtained. This only requires adjustable commutators which add no extra arithmetic complexity. The application of both cosine modulated and modified discrete Fourier transform FBs are considered and the formulations related to the appropriate choice of parameters are outlined. Examples are provided for illustration.	blue (queue management algorithm);discrete fourier transform;filter bank;modulation;online and offline;polyphase matrix	Amir Eghbali;Håkan Johansson;Per Löwenborg	2010	Proceedings of 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2010.5537067	electronic engineering;time–frequency analysis;telecommunications;computer science;discrete fourier transform;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;prototype;frequency-division multiplexing;passband;bandwidth;modulation	Embedded	60.638161164857216	18.64005221672633	196913

Observability assessment is done by means of topological observability rules. Moreover a new rule is employed which can decrease the number of required PMUs for full network observability. In all of the investigations, the effect of zero-injection buses in the power system is considered. Developed PMU placement method is illustrated using IEEE standard systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the whole system can be observable with installing PMUs on less than 20% of system buses.	algorithm;fuzzy control system;mathematical optimization;observable;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;phasor;power management unit;simulation;turing test	Ebrahim Abiri;Farzan Rashidi	2015	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-141324	mathematical optimization;observability;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;fuzzy control system	EDA	64.51365050521281	31.942829621504373	197008

The approach presented in this paper focuses on the direct factorization of the Jacobian matrix, of the HB nonlinear equations, using a graphical processing unit (GPU) platform. The computational core of the proposed approach is based on developing a block-wise version of the KLU factorization algorithm, where scalar arithmetic operations are replaced by block-aware matrix operations. For a large number of harmonics, or excitation tones, or both, the Block-KLU (BKLU) approach effectively raises the ratio of floating-point operations to other operations and, therefore, becomes an ideal vehicle for implementation on a GPU-based platform. Motivated by this fact, we develop a GPU-based framework to implement the BKLU. The proposed approach yields speedup by up to 89 times over conventional direct factorization on CPU.	algorithm;block cipher;central processing unit;graphics processing unit;harmonic balance;jacobian matrix and determinant;nonlinear system;parallel computing;quantum harmonic oscillator;scalar processor;simulation;speedup;steady state	Bardia Bandali;Emad Gad;Miodrag Bolic	2014	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2014.2304696	acceleration;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;parallel computing;sparse matrix;computer science;theoretical computer science;steady state	EDA	58.99741412718646	22.88444483025427	197878

The classic example is the moving median smoother, but it is possible to define others which have significantly different attributes both in relation to the statistical estimation problem and in relation to hardware implications. Attributes offered in the latter category, which are especially desirable in systolic VLSI, include essentially recursive operation and elimination of the interactions between rank and temporal ordering requirements which are a feature of median smoothers. Experimental results indicate significantly improved response to noisy steps for these smoothers, in comparison to median smoothers of comparable rectangular pulse detection capabilities.		Arthur R.

They are noted for their ability to remove impulsive noise and to preserve sharp changes in the signal. However, there is a tradeoff between noise removing capability and edge retention. When impulsive noise and sharp edges in the signal coincide, edges are no longer preserved. Another tradeoff is noise removal versus computational cost. The increase in the number of operations is proportional to the noise-removal capability. The authors introduce a new filter (the decimated rank-order filter) that achieves large amount of noise removal with much less detail and edge smoothing as compared with the standard rank-order filter. Furthermore, this is possible at a reduced computational burden. The decimated median filter is a particular example of this class. The authors investigate its deterministic and statistical properties and show that it compares favorably with the standard median filter in terms of impulsive noise removal, especially in the neighborhood of edges. They extend the structure of decimated rank-order filters. They find all rank orders of the signal to obtain the decimated sorter and show that the decimated sorter is the bitonic sorter used in switching networks. They point out the connection between their research and concepts in sorting and switching structures. >	decimation (signal processing)	Lale Akarun;Richard A. Haddad	1994	IEEE Trans.

In order to circumvent the ‘curse of dimensionality’ in multivariate approximation, interpolations on sparse grids were introduced. In particular, for frequencies chosen from an hyperbolic cross and spatial knots on a sparse grid fast Fourier transforms that need only $${\cal O}(N \log^d N)$$ arithmetic operations were developed. Recently, the FFT was generalised to nonequispaced spatial knots by the so-called NFFT. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the fast Fourier transform on hyperbolic cross points for nonequispaced spatial knots in two and three dimensions. We call this algorithm sparse NFFT (SNFFT). Our new algorithm is based on the NFFT and an appropriate partitioning of the hyperbolic cross. Numerical examples confirm our theoretical results.	algorithm;approximation;curse of dimensionality;discrete fourier transform;fast fourier transform;sparse grid;sparse matrix;trigonometric polynomial	Markus Fenn;Stefan Kunis;Daniel Potts	2006	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-006-9017-7	three-dimensional space;fast fourier transform;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;curse of dimensionality;split-radix fft algorithm;fractional fourier transform;calculus;discrete fourier transform;mathematics;geometry;discrete fourier transform;non-uniform discrete fourier transform;prime-factor fft algorithm;frequency domain;algebra	ML	56.41408882175137	21.481149769758524	198901

Hence, incompatible nonuniform filter banks could achieve perfect reconstruction via LTI filters, conventional samplers and block samplers without expanding the input-output dimension of a subsystem of linear dual-rate systems or converting the nonuniform filter banks to uniform filter banks. The main advantage of the proposed representations is to avoid complicated design of the circuit layout caused by connecting subsystems with large input-output dimension or a lot of subsystems together.	circuit diagram;filter bank;language technologies institute;linear time-invariant theory;sampling (signal processing);soft-in soft-out decoder;time complexity;time-invariant system	Charlotte Yuk-Fan Ho;Bingo Wing-Kuen Ling;Peter Kwong-Shun Tam	2008	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2007.910803	control engineering;input/output;electronic circuit;electronic engineering;cascaded integrator–comb filter;digital filter;lti system theory;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;state variable filter;frequency;signal processing;filter bank;control theory;linear system	EDA	60.04410166799907	18.371912131340597	199023
53b891d07efe53844bcbc2a2387cdf9679b3a5ba	modeling the relationship between higuchi’s fractal dimension and fourier spectra of physiological signals		The exact mathematical relationship between FFT spectrum and fractal dimension (FD) of an experimentally recorded signal is not known. In this work, we tried to calculate signal FD directly from its Fourier amplitudes. First, dependence of Higuchi’s FD of mathematical sinusoids on their individual frequencies was modeled with a two-parameter exponential function. Next, FD of a finite sum of sinusoids was found to be a weighted average of their FDs, weighting factors being their Fourier amplitudes raised to a fractal degree. Exponent dependence on frequency was modeled with exponential, power and logarithmic functions. A set of 280 EEG signals and Weierstrass functions were analyzed. Cross-validation was done within EEG signals and between them and Weierstrass functions. Exponential dependence of fractal exponents on frequency was found to be the most accurate. In this work, signal FD was for the first time expressed as a fractal weighted average of FD values of its Fourier components, also allowing researchers to perform direct estimation of signal fractal dimension from its FFT spectrum.	cross reactions;electroencephalography;experiment;exponent;fast fourier transform;fractal dimension;fractional fourier transform;mathematics;population parameter;sinusoid;exponential	Aleksandar Kalauzi;Tijana Bojic;Aleksandra Vuckovic	2012	Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing	10.1007/s11517-012-0913-9	multifractal system;mathematical analysis;discrete mathematics;fractal derivative;calculus;mathematics	Theory	55.26414637431339	19.358769971299967	199361
