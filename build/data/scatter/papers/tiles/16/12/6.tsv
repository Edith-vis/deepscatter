2795425a7a268e3588f3aca6e2b838bb93f3025f	bilateral haptic teleoperation of an industrial multirotor uav		This chapter presents an intuitive laser-based teleoperation scheme to enable the safe operation of a multirotor UAV by an untrained user in a cluttered environment using a haptic joystick. An obstacle avoidance strategy is designed and implemented to autonomously modify the position setpoint of the UAV if necessary. This scheme includes a novel force-feedback algorithm to enable the user to feel surrounding environment of the UAV as well as the disturbances acting on it. The stability analysis of the whole teleoperation loop, including the nonlinear dynamics of both UAV and joystick, is provided. The implementation of the teleoperation scheme on the Flybox hexacopter platform by the company Skybotix is described. Finally, experimental results and videos are reported to demonstrate the successful implementation and the performance of the overall system.	algorithm;bilateral filter;haptic technology;joystick;nonlinear system;obstacle avoidance;setpoint (control system);unmanned aerial vehicle;workspace	Sammy Omari;Minh-Duc Hua;Guillaume Ducard;Tarek Hamel	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-03838-4_15	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.73022468640143	-22.421377320421122	50089

Contrary to other studies, the present work focuses on the practical experiment with a real humanoid biped, HUBO2. Also, hopping is focused on among various types of locomotion since hopping is simple movement but more dynamic rather than walking. Two control strategies are proposed according to the magnitude of the disturbances. The one is the posture balance control for small disturbance, which uses the ankle torque of the stance leg. The other is to use the posture balancing control and the landing position control together for large disturbance. The landing position controller changes the landing position of the swing foot to maintain stability. The closed form solution of the landing position controller is addressed with the simplified model. As this simplification, both controllers are used together since the landing position controller cannot maintain a perfect balance alone. To this end, practical experiments with HUBO2 are conducted. In the experiments, HUBO2 maintains a balance against not only small disturbance but also large disturbance such as pushing through the proposed control strategies.	control flow;experiment;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;humanoid robot;level of detail;poor posture;position-independent code	Baek-Kyu Cho;Jun-Ho Oh	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5650509	control engineering;closed-form expression;simulation;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;mathematical model;control theory;foot	Robotics	66.38116677776503	-19.26081917880616	50291

It is an appealing control methodology, but it is difficult to implement and its solution is not so performing since it unavoidably means to solve a usually large-scale, constrained, and multidimensional optimization. To increase the difficulty, this optimization problem is subject to computationally heavy differential and algebraic constraints constituting the same convolution model and the least squares nature of the objective function easily leads to narrow valleys and multimodality issues. Beyond a short review of the state-of-the-art, the paper is aimed at highlighting the possibility to exploit at best the intrinsic features of the specific system one is going to control using the NMPC. The idea is to give the NMPC the possibility to automatically select the best combination of algorithms (differential solvers and optimizers) in accordance with the specific problem to be solved. From this perspective, the NMPC could be easily extended to many scientific fields traditionally far from process systems and computer-aided process engineering and the user has not to worry about which specific differential solvers and optimizers are needed to solve his/her problem.	nonlinear system	Flavio Manenti	2011	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2011.04.009	control engineering;optimization problem;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning;process control;control theory;mathematics;least squares;model predictive control	DB	59.394387977621975	-13.896630133469204	50323

It is shown that the proposed control scheme consists of one nominal controller and one sliding mode learning compensator (SMLC) using the recently developed sliding mode learning control technique. It is established that the developed SMLC does not require any information of lumped uncertainty such that the effects of the lumped uncertainty can be effectively alleviated. The numerical simulation results of two driving cases are presented to show good steering performance and strong robustness of the closed-loop system with the proposed control regarding road uncertainties.	robust control	Huifang Kong;Xiaoxue Zhang;Hai Wang;Wei Bao;Kaiwen Jiang	2016	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2016.10001139	computer simulation;control engineering;simulation;sliding mode control;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.57555693110459	-12.408966883746675	50986

First, robust motion and force tracking is considered, where a performance criterion containing disturbance and estimated parameter attenuations is presented. Then the proposed controller utilizes an adaptive scheme and an auxiliary control law to deal with the uncertain environmental constraint, disturbances, and robotic modeling uncertainties. After solving a simple linear matrix inequality for gain conditions, the effect from disturbance and estimated parameter errors to motion/force errors is attenuated to an arbitrary prescribed level. Moreover, if the disturbance and estimated parameter errors are square-integrable, then an asymptotic motion tracking is achieved while the force error is as small as the inversion of control gain. Finally, numerical simulation results for a constrained planar robot illustrate the expected performance.	robot	Chian-Song Chiu;Kuang-Yow Lian;Tsu-Cheng Wu	2004	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2004.06.017	control engineering;mathematical optimization;adaptive control;linear matrix inequality;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.86238638645297	-14.842484728338802	51047

To control robot or teleoperated manipulators in space, the motion of the satellite (which is actually the base of the manipulator) which will move due to the force exerted by the moving manipulator, must be considered. Most of the algorithms developed to control a robot manipulator assume that the manipulator is connected to a fixed base. Since the satellite moves due to the motion of the robot manipulator, the control schemes developed for fixed-base manipulators cannot be used for space robots and telerobots. In this paper, using a modified resolved motion rate control and angular momentum conservation law, a generalized Jacobian matrix is derived to control the space manipulator. It is shown that a manipulator controlled in this manner follows a prescribed path independent of the motion of the satellite.	jacobian matrix and determinant	Osman Parlaktuna;George E. Cook;Alvin M.

It only synthesizes trunk trajectories by the hybrid intelligent system (HIS), while all the other joints' trajectories are prescribed. Based on HIS, the data fusion theory and the knowledge available, we propose two gait synthesis schemes, one is neurofuzzy-based gait synthesis, and the other is fuzzy rule extraction-based gait synthesis. The proposed gait synthesizers can integrate both linguistic rules obtained from human intuitive balancing knowledge and biomechanical studies and numerical data received from biped walking experiments for improving the biped dynamic walking performance.	robot;synergy	Changjiu Zhou;Kanniah Jagannathan;Than Myint	1999		10.1109/ROBOT.1999.772554	control engineering;computer science;engineering;control system;artificial intelligence;control theory;sensor fusion;intelligent control	Robotics	61.561350273749674	-13.179999622584797	51129
3224c19954217603d27a02196585e70610c812af	output-based control of robots with variable stiffness actuation		The output-based control of a redundant robotic manipulator with relevant and adjustable joint stiffness is addressed. The proposed controller is configured as a cascade system that allows the decoupling of the actuators dynamics from the arm dynamics and the consequent reduction of the order of the manipulator dynamic model. Moreover, the proposed controller does not require the knowledge of the whole robot state: only the positions of the actuators and of the joints are necessary. This approach represents a significant simplification with respect to previously proposed state feedback techniques. The problem of controlling simultaneously the position trajectory and the desired stiffness in both the joint and work space is investigated, and the relations between the manipulator redundancy and the selection of both the joint and work space stiffness of the manipulator are discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by simulations of a 3 degrees of freedom planar manipulator.		Gianluca Palli;Claudio Melchiorri	2011	J.

Unit motions are defined as smooth primitive motions in the hand coordinate system by employing normalized uniform B-spline functions. Complex motions are then generated as a superposition of time-shifted and weighted unit motions. Corresponding to unit motions, a concept of unit control inputs is also introduced and an entire control input is then obtained in exactly the same way as complex motions are generated from unit motions. Moreover, in order to build further complex motions from simpler ones in a systematic way, operations on motions are defined including spatial, temporal and structural ones. Based on unit motions and unit control inputs, we then develop a formal method for motion planning and control for robotic manipulators. Motions are represented formally as the time series of weight vectors, or equivalently as the so-called control polygons, and the operations on motions are then regarded as operations on control polygons. Simulation examples are included to demonstrate how to generate motions from unit motions and operations, and properties of the resulting motions are also described. >	robot	Kuniharu Takayama;Hiroyuki Kano	1995	IEEE Trans.

In thi; paper we evolve a gallop gait in a simulated rjuadruped robot a t speeds from 3.0 t o 10.0m/s. To do so, we must generate, periodic trajectories for the body and legs. An evolutionary algorithm known as set-based stochastic optimization (SBSO) is used to find the body trajectory while alternative methods are used t o find periodic leg trajectories. The focus of this paper will be to evaluate three different methods for generating periodic leg trajectories. The combined solutions for the body and legs yield biological charaeteristics that are emergent properties of the underlying high-speed dynamic running gait.	emergence;evolutionary algorithm;mathematical optimization;stochastic optimization	Darren P.

A controller is designed so that the Poincaŕ e return map associated with periodic running gaits can be computed on the basis of a model with impulse-effects that, previously, had been used only for the design of walking gaits. This feedback design leads to the notion of a hybrid zero dynamics for running, which in turn allows the existence and stability of running gaits to be determined on the basis of a scalar map. The main results are illustrated via simulations performed on models with known parameters and on models with parameter uncertainty and structural changes. Animations of the resulting running motions are available on the web.	poincaré plot;simulation	Christine Chevallereau;Eric R. Westervelt;Jessy W. Grizzle	2005	I. J.

The performance of system identification of an AAC system using Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques measured and discussed. The input - output data are collected through an experimental study using an AAC system integrated with air duct system experimental rig complete with data acquisition and instrumentation system. The single input single output dynamic model was established by using Autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model. Recursive Least Squares and Genetic Algorithms were validated using one step-ahead prediction (OSA), mean squared error (MSE) and correlation tests. The comparison results between these parameter estimation optimization techniques were highlighted. It was found that the estimated models using these two methods proposed are comparable, acceptable and possible to be used as a platform of new controller development and evaluation the performance of AAC system in the future work. Amongst all, it was found that the Particle Swarm optimization method produce the best ARX model with the lowest prediction MSE value of 8.5472×10-5 as compared to the Recursive Least Squares performance.	advanced audio coding;arx;autoregressive model;black box;box modeling;data acquisition;estimation theory;experiment;genetic algorithm;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;system identification	Md Norazlan Md Lazin;Intan Z.

On the basis of modular robot concept, an integrated dynamic modeling method is proposed, which takes both the mobile platform and the onboard modular manipulator as an integrated structure. A new obstacle avoidance algorithm is proposed which is mainly composed of two parts: a self-motion planner (SMP) and a robust adaptive neural fuzzy controller (RANFC). One important feature of this algorithm lies in that obstacles are avoided by online adjusting self-motions so that the end-effector task will not be affected unless the obstacles are just on the desired trajectory. The RANFC does not rely on exact aprior dynamic parameters and can suppress bounded external disturbance effectively. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations.	algorithm;mobile device;obstacle avoidance;robot end effector;self-reconfiguring modular robot;simulation	Yangmin Li;Yugang Liu	2005		10.1007/11539902_140	robust control;multiprocessing;simulation;adaptive control;computer science;artificial intelligence;trajectory;manipulator;control theory;obstacle avoidance;redundancy;artificial neural network	Robotics	62.06327582525249	-13.770671174772573	51915

A group of targets unpredictably moves in all three dimensions. The robot measures only the distances to the targets and also has access to a certain spatial direction and its own coordinate (termed “altitude”) along it. We present a new navigation law that drives the robot to the locus of points at a prespecified root-mean-square distance from the targets and ensures dense sweep coverage of this locus within a given range of “altitudes.” This law is rigorously justified by a nonlocal convergence result supported by recommendations on controller tuning; its applicability and performance are confirmed by extensive computer simulations.	computer simulation;locus;memory controller;mobile robot;quantum nonlocality;root-mean-square deviation of atomic positions	Alexey S.

Current literature provides analysis on the identifiability of building models. However, in practice, building models can be too large and too complex to properly identify parameter estimates. Towards that end, we present a strategy to decompose large building models into smaller building zone models so that these zone models can be individually identified. We find that the identifiability of zone models imply the identifiability of the building model, and we outline a decentralized approach to identify large building models. Finally, we demonstrate this approach with a simulated building example.	experiment;graph theory;heuristic;regular language description for xml;simulation;vii	Clarence Agbi;Bruce H.

The combination of a conventional diesel engine with a hydraulic powertrain allows for regenerative braking which results in reduced fuel consumption, reduced emissions and less brake wear. Further improvements can be achieved by numerical optimization of the energy management strategy, i.e. the distribution of the desired torque among the two propulsion systems. However, for such strategies to be efficient, a short-term prediction of the driving profile becomes necessary, which is simply assumed to exist in most previous work. For the case of garbage trucks and city buses, the assumption of repeatedly driven routes is valid. Therefore, a system that iteratively learns driving profiles has been developed. The learned driving profiles are associated with a particular vehicle location. The results of prediction and optimization are validated in a simulation study based on a standard reference cycle.	approximation algorithm;diesel;garbage collection (computer science);mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;reference counting;simulation	Frank A.

For the execution of six-degree-offreedom (DOF) tasks, both the end-effector position and orientation must be handled. The operational space control schemes typically utilize minimal representations of end-effector orientation; however, such representations do not lead to a physically meaningful definition of the rotational part of the impedance equation, and they suffer from the occurrence of representation singularities. In this work a new approach to six-DOF impedance control is proposed, where the end-effector orientation displacement is derived from the rotation matrix expressing the mutual orientation between the compliant frame and the desired frame. An alternative Euler angles-based description is proposed which mitigates the effects of representation singularities. Then, a class of angle/axis representations are considered to derive the dynamic equation for the rotational part of a six-DOF impedance at the end effector, using an energy-based argument. The unit quaternion representation is selected to further analyze the properties of the rotational impedance. The resulting impedance controllers are designed according to an inverse dynamics strategy with contact force and moment measurements, where an inner loop acting on the end-effector position and orientation error is adopted to confer robustness to unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. Experiments on an industrial robot with open control architecture and force/torque sensor have been carried out, and the results in a number of case studies are discussed.	algorithm;angularjs;apache axis;characteristic impedance;displacement mapping;euler;experiment;industrial robot;inner loop;interaction;inverse dynamics;isometric projection;nominal impedance;open control architecture;quaternions and spatial rotation;robot end effector;software propagation;velocity (software development);viz: the computer game	Fabrizio Caccavale;Ciro Natale;Bruno Siciliano;Luigi Villani	1999	IEEE Trans.

When joint velocities are available, full state fuzzy adaptive feedback control is designed to ensure the stability of the closed loop dynamic. If the joint velocities are not measurable, an observer is introduced and an adaptive output feedback control is designed based on the estimated velocities. In the proposed control scheme, we need not derive the linear formulation of robot dynamic equation and tune the parameters. To reduce the number of fuzzy rules of the fuzzy controller, we consider the properties of robot dynamics and the decomposition of the uncertainties terms. The proposed controller is robust against uncertainties and external disturbance. Further, it is shown that required stability conditions, in both cases, can be formulated as LMI problems and solved using dedicated software. The validity of the control scheme is demonstrated by computer simulations on a two-link robot manipulator. # 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The core idea is to substitute conventional simple direct adaptive control for composite model adaptive control (CMRAC). The main control structure that results in tractable responsibility is discussed in tail, in which the performance is adaptive to address the constraints of input in addition to retaining the usual transient properties and dynamic stability. To this end, a typical positive μ-mod method is developed on the basis of CMRAC frame to aim at a correct control. The formulated method supplies a convenient and intuitive interpretation to solve the control design problem, meanwhile utilizing the basic MRAC ideas. Moreover, Simulation is conducted to evaluate the control performance of longitudinal dynamics of an aerial vehicle.	aerial photography;cobham's thesis;control flow;simulation	Wenbin Wu;Qingbo Geng;Qing Fei;Qiong Hu	2014	11th IEEE International Conference on Control & Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2014.6871016	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.30883834554243	-14.095371723184515	52935

The proposed driver model is developed to specialize in limit handling, in order to be used as a validation platform of chassis control system. Thus, the proposed driver model emulates human driver's driving characteristics such as, desired path selection from varying preview area, deceleration against losing maneuverability. In high-speed cornering, steering with excessive corner-entry speed causes lateral tire force saturation readily. Sequentially, the lateral tire force saturation induces lateral instability of a vehicle. Deceleration is the most effective manipulation which driver can do. The proposed driver model is designed to utilize capability of tire force tightly, while securing lateral stability of the vehicle. The proposed driver model has been validated via comparison with an expert driver's driving data, collected on the Korea International Circuit in Yeongam, Korea.	chassis;control system;device driver;emulator;instability;lateral computing;lateral thinking;simulation	Youngil Koh;Hyundong Her;Kilsoo Kim;Kyongsu Yi	2015	2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2015.7225895	control engineering;simulation;engineering;automotive engineering	Robotics	63.03160054311585	-15.840263179534507	53395

An advantage of these hands is that they use under-constrained mechanisms and compliance, which facilitate grasping even under significant object pose uncertainties. However, for many minimal contact grasps such as precision fingertip grasps, these hands tend to move the object after a grasp is secured, to an equilibrium configuration determined by the elasticity of the mechanism and the contact forces exerted through the robot fingertips. In this paper, we present a methodology based on constrained optimization methods for deriving stable, minimal effort grasps for underactuated robot hands and compensating for post-contact, in-hand parasitic object motions. To do so, we compute the imposed object motions for different object shapes and sizes and we synthesize appropriate robot arm trajectories that eliminate them. The approach allows for the computation of these grasps and motions even for hands with complex, flexure-based, compliant members. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated using a redundant robot arm (Barrett WAM) and a two fingered, compliant, underactuated robot hand (Yale Open Hand model T42), for a series of simulated and experimental paradigms.	barrett reduction;computation;computer performance;constrained optimization;elasticity (data store);experiment;machine learning;mathematical optimization;motion compensation;robot;robotic arm;underactuation	Minas V.

To that matter, we extend a recent extremum seeking speed and heading control strategy to stabilize roll parametric resonance in ships, aiming at robustness. Based on previous results where extremum seeking was shown to be capable of effectively reducing parametrically excited roll motions by a combined variation of the ship's forward speed and heading angle, two major modifications are suggested. Firstly, the speed and heading controllers are formulated in the framework of ℒ1 adaptive control which guarantees robustness while still having fast adaptation. By doing so, robustness is increased with respect to model uncertainty, lack of knowledge, and bounded external disturbances. Secondly, the extremum seeking loop is modified towards limit cycle minimization, which replaces the objective function of the previously presented control approach, thus relaxing the assumption that the frequency range for roll parametric resonance is a priori known. In simulations, the proposed overall robustification approach is shown to effectively stabilize the roll oscillations due to roll parametric resonance.	control theory;course (navigation);frequency band;initial condition;limit cycle;loss function;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;optimization problem;parametric oscillator;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;resonance;robust control;robustification;robustness (computer science)	Dominik A.

Unique challenges inherent to BSRs include a nontrivial correlation between internal actuation, momentum, and net vehicle motion. A new method is presented for deriving reduced dynamical equations of motion (EOM) for a general class of BSRs which extends and synthesizes prior efforts in geometric mechanics. Our method is an extension of the BKMM approach [1], allowing Lagrangian reduction and reconstruction to be applied to dynamical systems with symmetry-breaking potential energies, such as those encountered by BSRs rolling on a surface. The resulting dynamical equations are of minimal dimension and vehicle motion due to actuation and momenta appear linearly in a simple first-order differential equation. The EOM of a BSR named Moball [2] [3] are derived to illustrate the approach's utility. A simple table summarizes our algorithm's application to popular BSRs in the literature, and the approach is extended to sloped terrains.	algorithm;barycentric subdivision;dynamical system;enterprise output management;first-order predicate;geometric mechanics;navier–stokes equations;robot	Matthew R.

In this paper we present a new decentral joint controller which uses low level interactions between a moving joint and its environment consisting of neighboring joints, the body and the surroundings the agent is placed in. This local joint controller is based on a Local Positive Velocity Feedback (LPVF) mechanism which exploits the elastic properties of the joint. The control strategy is inspired by biological findings in the walking system of stick insects. We will show that a closed kinematic chain consisting of several LPVF controlled joints, though lacking a central controller, can solve tasks which need a high level of inter-joint coordination. As an example, a planar manipulator turning a crank is presented. In a further step, the LPVF algorithm is extended to switched LPVF in order to improve the mechanical power conversion. The extended capabilities are proven in a second experiment in which a 3DoF test leg generates powerful stance movements.

The originality of our approach is to introduce and exploit the natural geometry induced by the presence of a gate in the environment, e.g. bundle of hyperbolae, ellipses and circles, providing stabilizing feedback control laws that steer the vehicle through the middle of the gate. Moreover, using visual servoing we prove that this geometry can be measured directly in the camera image plane. As a consequence, we provide an image-based control scheme, avoiding the use of a state observer. Simulations in a realistic scenario and experiments are provided to show the effectiveness of our feedback control laws.	computer simulation;experiment;feedback;futures studies;image plane;on-board data handling;velocity (software development);visual servoing	Paolo Salaris;Christian Vassallo;Philippe Souères;Jean-Paul Laumond	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139253	control engineering;computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;feedback;mathematics;visual servoing;robot kinematics	Robotics	64.63066528612082	-17.982585879632325	54752

In accordance with the paradigm, a nonlinear approximation for the feedforward control is used. The input to the approximation scheme are task parameters that define the trajectory to be tracked. The initial data for the approximation is obtained by performing learning control iterations for a number of selected tasks. The paper develops and implements practical approaches to both the approximation and learning control. As the initial feedforward data needs to be obtained for many different tasks, it is important to have fast and robust convergence of the learning control iterations. To satisfy this requirement, we propose a new learning control algorithm based on the on-line Levenberg–Marquardt minimization of a regularized tracking error index. The paper demonstrates an experimental application of the paradigm to trajectory tracking control of fast (1.25 s) motions of a direct-drive industrial robot AdeptOne. In our experiments, the learning control converges in five to six iterations for a given set of the task parameters. Radial Basis Function approximation based on the learning results for 45 task parameter vectors brings an average improvement of four times in the tracking accuracy for all motions in the robot workspace. The high performance of the designed approximation-based controller is achieved despite nonlinearity of the system dynamics and large Coulomb friction. The results obtained open an avenue for industrial applications of the proposed approach in robotics and elsewhere.	approximation;experiment;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;industrial robot;iteration;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;nonlinear system;online and offline;programming paradigm;radial basis function;robotics;system dynamics;workspace	Dimitry M.

However, such measurement accuracy degrades with time due to various types of errors. In this paper, a practical approach is proposed to estimate both the deterministic and random errors of an INU. The deterministic errors, which include bias and scaling errors, can be estimated through a simple experimental setup; while the random noise is modeled using Allan Variance (AV) analysis method. The empirical values of the errors are then fed into the INU's system model for error correction using Kalman filtering. Finally, the calibrated INU shows promising results in preserving long term accuracy of the motion sensor.	inertial navigation system	Lim Chot Hun;Wei Qiang Tan;Tien Sze Lim;Voon Chet Koo	2012	IEICE Electronic Express	10.1587/elex.9.772	econometrics;non-sampling error;calibration;simulation;engineering;statistics	DB	56.98798088267517	-14.876901050630572	55280

Although there have been many studies on this, most of the analysis were limited to fixed authority and its effect on stability. None of the research has discussed how to allocate the control authority in real-time. This paper presents a dynamic authority distribution method for dual master single slave Cooperative Teleoperation systems, which allocates the authority over slave to operators on the move in each DOF separately. This method observes the energy interaction in the kinesthetic coupling link between the operators, classifies the interaction into operators' leader/follower behavior and adapts the authorities accordingly. The proposed method is experimentally tested with unique set of camera views of task environment with 3DOF dual master single slave teleoperation system. Experimental results demonstrate accurate convergence of decomposition of authorities based on camera-view. The performance of proposed dynamic authority architecture is evaluated by comparing total energy generation with fixed authority setup, and is found to be more efficient in terms of less energy generation, and hence less effort is required by operators to execute the task.	cooperative mimo;experiment;real-time transcription	Naveed Ahmed Usmani;Tae-Hwan Kim;Jee-Hwan Ryu	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7354113	robot;control engineering;von neumann stability analysis;simulation;visualization;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;coupling;force	Robotics	64.5238518466194	-22.894454717977982	55347

Small signal model of the speed loop as the foundation of the framework of the controller is analyzed. The gradient rule is utilized to update the weights of the neuron inputs, and auxiliary retrain process is used to improve the dynamic performance of the controller. A comprehensive simulation was done to verify the validation of the intelligent speed controller. Comparison with the con- ventional PID controller demonstrates the outstanding performance and robustness of the proposed controller. The feasibility of implementation of the proposed speed controller on physical platforms is also covered in this paper.

This problem, which is known to be complex, often requires important runtimes, particularly if obstacles are present and if full dynamics is considered. The proposed technique is a fast variant of the random-profile approach recently applied to wheeled-mobile robots. It incorporates a trapezoidal-velocity-profile constraint that helps reduce the number of unknown parameters and that speeds up the calculation steps. Results are presented for two- and three-wheel mobile robots in free/constrained workspaces. A comparison with reference solutions, which were obtained independently, shows that the proposed variant is able to achieve almost the same quality of calculated trajectories while reducing the runtime considerably.	angularjs;cubic function;mobile device;mobile robot;reference architecture;runtime system;scott continuity;smoothing;velocity (software development);workspace	Moussa Haddad;Wisama Khalil;H.

When the system's kinematic structure changes large discontinuities may occur in the solution to its inverse dynamics problem. These discontinuities can be traced to discontinuous changes in the coefficients of the dynamics equations which describe the system's behavior. When this change occurs on the left-hand side of the equations, it corresponds to a change in the kinematic structure of the system. When the change occurs on the right-hand side, it corresponds to a collision between two constituent objects in the system. Since these systems are redundantly actuated, the solution to their inverse dynamics problem may be chosen according to an optimality criterion. Two methods are presented to specify the optimization problem to reduce the effect of the discontinuities-one introduces rate-dependent terms in the objective function while the other positively limits the rate of change of the solution. >		Meyer Nahon;Jorge Angeles	1991		10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131580	robot;control engineering;optimization problem;mathematical optimization;dynamics;kinematics;computer science;linear programming;structural change;control theory;mathematics;redundancy;inverse dynamics;robot kinematics;classification of discontinuities;collision	HCI	66.04977933511726	-21.014529292231924	55650

The distance and speed relative to the car in front are measured by a radar sensor and applied to the controller. The output acceleration or deceleration rate of the controller is based on the characteristics of the vehicles. The initial input and output membership functions and 25 rules of ANFIS are constructed by a fuzzy inference system (FIS). The design method of the reference signals, which is used to on-line update the consequent parameters of ANFIS according to recursive least square (RLS) algorithm, are proposed. The presented ANFIS controller can solve the problems of the oscillations for final distance between the leading vehicle (LV) and the following vehicle (FV) and relative speed. The required processing time to achieve safe distance between the LV and the FV is about 7–8 s, which is faster than the other models. The ANFIS controller of the car-following collision prevention system proposed in this paper can provide a safe, reasonable, and comfortable drive.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;algorithm;farmville;inference engine;input/output;logical volume management;nonlinear system;online and offline;radar;recursion;recursive least squares filter;serial ata	Jeich Mar;Feng-Jie Lin	2001	IEEE Trans.

a3cb0bce9e87672e66c44c145780a0ddf5a05763	distributed uav swarm formation control via object-focused, multi-objective sarsa		We present a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning formulation of the decentralized formation control problem for swarms of fixed-wing UAVs based on a relative state-space construction of obstacles and waypoints. Specifically, a modular state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) approach is applied to a set of behavioral swarm rules (i.e., Reynolds flocking, target seek, and obstacle avoidance). Q-tables are trained offline for each rule using a simulated model of the UAV plant over scenarios with randomized waypoints and obstacle locations. The greatest mass approach is applied to action selection for each UAV by selecting the relative heading that maximizes the weighted sum of Q-values across all Q-tables. To restrain the dimensionality of the state space, object-focused learning is applied during policy evaluation to instantiate multiple Q-tables for each detected neighbor UAV and obstacle. In comparison to existing behavioral swarm controllers, the controller learned via object-focused greatest mass SARSA (OF-GM-SARSA) is generalizable across multiple scenarios in terms of demonstrating desired swarm behaviors while providing a negliaible number of collisions.	action selection;consensus dynamics;course (navigation);decision table;flocking (behavior);game controller;high-level programming language;many-worlds interpretation;obstacle avoidance;online and offline;randomized algorithm;reinforcement learning;state space;state-action-reward-state-action;swarm;time of arrival;unmanned aerial vehicle;waypoint;weight function	Christian Speck;Donald J.

The concept relies on utilization of the novel path-following controller, recently published by Morro et al., devised for the unicycle kinematics of the last trailer (outer loop), and then on transformation of the resultant control functions along a vehicle kinematic chain to a tractor segment (inner loop). A control law proposed in the paper can be applied into all the known types of N-trailer robots (nSNT, GNT, and SNT) under the sign-homogeneity assumption for hitching offsets of trailers. The method has been examined by simulation examples.	control function (econometrics);inner loop;kinematic chain;mobile robot;optimal control;programming paradigm;resultant;scalability;simulation	Maciej Michalek	2013	9th International Workshop on Robot Motion and Control	10.1109/RoMoCo.2013.6614602	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;robot control	Robotics	64.84312812044305	-18.42818236453744	56991

The swimming of the robot fish to avoid some obstacles is viewed as potential flow around the obstacles. Then the streamlines from the robot position to the target are chosen as the desired paths for the mobile robot to move to the destination. Since there are mature algorithms with high computational efficiency to establish flow field and figure out the streamlines based on fluid mechanics theory, our approach is practical for application.

The transient behaviour of the original learning algorithm has been improved by modifying the learning rate updates. The contribution of the proposed modification has been verified via both simulations and experiments. Moreover, the performance of the proposed architecture is compared with robust RST designs performed on a similar benchmark system, to show that via adaptive nonlinear control, it is possible to obtain a fast step response without degrading the robustness of a multi-body mechanical system. Finally, the architecture is further improved so as to possess structural learning for populating the SRWNNs automatically, rather than employing static network structures, and simulation results are provided to show the performance of the proposed structural learning algorithm.	control system	Evrim Onur Ari;Erol Kocaoglan	2016	Int.

a27d329ecc503deebe2d250df7ac885740d4be83	improving operator performance through the use of a multivariable human-machine control strategy		Most of the mechatronics equipments and gadgets that we all nowadays rely on incorporate some kind of multidimensional human-machine systems. There is an increasing concern for improving the usability, performance, ergonomics and safety of such devices, and ultimately this will lead to the mass-production of next-generation intelligent machines, which will be capable to assist the human operator and to reduce the global effort by estimating and measuring its skills. This ongoing work introduces a novel human-machine multi-dynamic modeling methodology which can be applied on the development of these Human Adaptive Mechatronic (HAM) machines, able to adapt to the skill/dexterity levels of its users, and to enhance Human's proficiency. As a new strategy for model development, a number of twodimensional independent pursuit manual tracking experiments are evaluated. A human-machine state-space linear model is obtained and successfully applied to design an improved closed-loop multivariable control structure.	adaptive switching;algorithm;control flow;experiment;human factors and ergonomics;linear model;mechatronics;state space;swarm intelligence;usability;user interface	Rui Antunes;Fernando Vieira Coito;Hermínio Duarte-Ramos	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-28255-3_11	control engineering;control theory	Robotics	60.32431494579152	-12.213762440134156	57247

This problem was initially observed and analyzed by C.A. Klein and C.H. Huang (1983). T. Shamir and Y. Yomdin (1988) recently analyzed this problem using a differential geometric approach. The above papers arrived at conditions under which a cyclic path in the work space does not result in a cyclic path in the joint space. However, it was not clear that these conditions were equivalent. It is presently shown that these two criteria are indeed equivalent. A measure for the drift motion is presented. The mathematical analysis given in the present paper can determine these predictable properties of drift motion. It is shown that the Lyapunov analysis and phase portrait techniques can be used to predict the stability behavior of drift utilizing the drift density measure described here. Information about how much drift will occur and which configurations are stable can be obtained from the analysis. >	robot	Shengwu Luo;Shaheen Ahmad	1991		10.1109/ROBOT.1991.131766	robot;control engineering;motion control;phase portrait;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;stability;control theory;mathematics;data analysis	Robotics	66.18604930293566	-19.749130037774147	57339

The methodology introduced in this paper, referred to as experimentally-infused optimization, addresses several challenges faced by AWE system designers, including a strong coupling between the controller and plant design, significant modeling uncertainties (which require the use of experiments), and high costs associated with full-scale experimental prototypes. This paper presents an initial case study of the proposed experimentally-infused optimization, where experiments were conducted on a 1/100th-scale model of Altaeros Buoyant Air Turbine (BAT), which was tethered and flown in the University of North Carolina at Charlotte 1m × 1m water channel. The lab-scale experimental platform reduced the cost of evaluating flight dynamics and control by more than two orders of magnitude, while resulting in substantially improved flight performance, quantified by a 15.2 percent improvement in an objective function value, as compared to a purely numerical optimization.	airborne ranger;batch file;course (navigation);design of experiments;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;full scale;loss function;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;pitch (music)	Nihar Deodhar;Chris Vermillion;Peter Tkacik	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7171087	control engineering;atmospheric model;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering;linear programming;control theory;mathematics;prototype;mechanical engineering	EDA	57.212464219003635	-11.650334713836068	57493

This paper presents a GPC strategy for space teleoperation systems in which the master and slave manipulators are both multi-DOF and the communication network brings long time-varying delays. The nonlinear dynamics of the multi-DOF slave manipulator is linearized and described by a linear state-space equation. Meanwhile, a nonlinear compensator is used to compensate the nonlinear parts of the slave. Then, based on the equation, a state-space model based GPC controller is designed on the master side to stabilize the system and make the slave manipulator track the master position and velocity no matter whether the manipulator contacts with the environment or not. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	computer;haptic technology;nonlinear system;performance;propagation delay;simulation;state space;telecommunications network;velocity (software development)	Yanhua Yang;Fangping Yang;Jianning Hua;Hongyi Li	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378260	telerobotics;teleoperation;simulation;stability;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematical model;control theory;model predictive control;statistics	Robotics	65.25553477242141	-14.0839462443764	57680

In the automotive industry, durability experiments of vehicle axles are carried out in laboratories using multi-channel durability test rigs. The accurate load data replication of field measured data is important to obtain convincing durability results. Cross-coupling effects by channel interactions degrade the control accuracy of these rigs. Therefore, an iterative control method is applied to adapt all control inputs to compensate coupling induced disturbances. State-of-the-art processes require a high amount of test rig measurements to generate optimal control inputs which damage specimens preliminarily. In this article, a new method for disturbance compensation is presented. In the following, this method is compared to control input adaption without disturbance compensation and control input adaption with state-of-the-art disturbance compensation. All three methods are applied to an iterative control of a suspension rig and analyzed in terms of convergence speed, control accuracy and computational effort. The investigations revealed, that compensation methods generally increase the computational effort. The state-of-the-art compensation method became unstable for the considered steering maneuver while accurate control with fast convergence was achieved when applying the new compensation technique presented in this article. The significant increase of convergence speed justifies the additional computational effort compared to methods without compensation.	biological specimen;chassis;computation;control theory;durability (database systems);experiment;interaction;iteration;iterative method;new general catalogue;optimal control;replication (computing)	Tino Muller;Ulrich Vogele;Christian Endisch	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2016.7577011	control engineering;simulation;engineering;automotive engineering	Robotics	68.09201374724236	-12.11590939784633	57703

A new robust sliding mode controller (SMC) is proposed to improve the performance under internal model uncertainty and external disturbance conditions. To precisely control the attitude and position, a new SMC based on the backstepping technique is formulated to guarantee the attitude system stability. To implement this controller, an extended state observer is used to estimate the unmeasurable states and external disturbances. Moreover, a new sliding mode control method with the backstepping technique is applied to ensure that the position system is stable. In addition, the Lyapunov theory demonstrates the stability of the attitude and position loops.

In order to plan paths for pursuers to capture an evader in the pursuit-evasion game, a novel multi-step cooperative strategy is presented. Under this strategy, the pursuit-evasion game is studied in two stages. In the first stage we assume that the evader is always static in the workplace, and in the second stage the evader will move once it senses the existence of pursuers. A Daisy-Chain Formation algorithm and a sliding mode-based method are presented to control the pursuit. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the proposed algorithm is proved to be convergent.

In this paper, such a model is used at the joint level to control the manipulator along a desired trajectory. Interaction between manipulator joints is compensated for. Time schedules of the parameters of the developed feedback and compensation filters are generated off-line for the desired trajectory using a computed-torque approach. The actual values of these parameters, however, which are different from these computed values, are identified in real time using output measurements. Computation delay is compensated for using the nominal values of these parameters.

Control is designed at the boundary of the robotic manipulator based on integral-barrier Lyapunov function to suppress the vibration of the elastic deflection and track the desired angular position. With the proposed boundary control, the manipulator can be driven to the desired set-point with angular position and elastic deflection stay under the former setting constraint. Uniformed boundedness of the closed-loop system under the unknown time-varying disturbance is achieved. Stability analysis of the closed-loop system is given by employing the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed boundary controller for ensuring output constraint and suppressing vibrations.	robot	Wei He;Chen Sun	2016	Int. J.

The previous studies provide control algorithms in continuous time-domain, but ignore the performance degradation due to discretization. In order to select an appropriate task period on engagement quality, this paper analyzes the friction-involved clutch engagement dynamics in discrete domain. Models of a closed-loop control system are developed. The models consist of the powertrain with a clutch element, the clutch actuator with time delay, the classical control algorithm combining a feedback and feed-forward link, and a zero-order holder of the task period. After discretization by z-transform, the stability is analyzed, thereafter, the maximum permissible task period, which is 0.3s for the studied system, is determined in terms of stability. Furthermore, the dynamic response is tested in a dSPACE real-time environment. The results show that the maximum vehicle jerk increases rapidly when the task period falls into the unstable region, and the friction loss ceaselessly increases due to the failed synchronization. On the other hand, when the task period falls into the stable area, basically, shorter period gains less vehiclejerk, and the friction loss can be almost the same as that of the continuous system.	algorithm;automatic control;broadcast delay;coefficient;computation;control system;control theory;dspace;discretization;elegant degradation;locus;real-time clock;telecommunications link	Xiaoxuan Cheng;Cheng Cheng;Li Chen	2018	2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2018.8500412	task analysis;jerk;synchronization;actuator;clutch;control theory;powertrain;discretization;control system;computer science	Embedded	68.29958716513816	-14.177368742059992	59223

The GSMC controller is designed with the consideration of all uncertainty bounds. In the controller implementation, a high-gain velocity observer is adopted to estimate the feedback velocity from the measured position. The effectiveness of the GSMC over ordinary SMC and traditional PID control is demonstrated through simulations, while the variations of design parameters on control performances are examined as well. Results show that the GSMC can reduce the hysteresis to a negligible level and lead to a sub-micron accuracy tracking with tolerance to some degrees of external disturbances, which provides a sound base of practical control of the micropositioning system for micro/nano scale manipulation.	classical xy model;feedback;gnu nano;hysteresis;pid;performance;piezoelectricity;prototype;simulation;velocity (software development)	Qingsong Xu;Yangmin Li	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354827	pid controller;control engineering;motion control;electronic engineering;uncertainty;sliding mode control;hysteresis;engineering;trajectory;control theory;feedback;robustness;actuator	Robotics	68.1758173194727	-11.241900441445981	59327

Occupancy can also vary spatially within a zone, especially during off-design operating conditions. We complement prior work by studying the usefulness of sensing occupancy information at different spatial resolutions in large zones served by multiple AHUs. As conventional PID controllers cannot utilize this information effectively, we propose a new control strategy and study the usefulness of sensing. We observe that utility of sensing occupancy at finer spatial resolutions is higher when the actual spatial heterogeneity in occupancy is higher.	control theory;pid	Srinarayana Nagarathinam;Shiva R.

A mini scale helicopter exhibits not only increased sensitivity to control inputs and disturbances, but also higher bandwidth of its dynamics. These properties make model helicopters, as a flying robot, more difficult to control. The dynamics model accuracy will determine the performance of the designed controller. It is attractive in this regards to have a controller that can accommodate the unmodeled dynamics or parameter changes and perform well in such situations. Coefficient Diagram Method (CDM) is chosen as the candidate to synthesize such a controller due to its simplicity and convenience in demonstrating integrated performance measures including equivalent time constant, stability indices and robustness. In this study, CDM is implemented for a design of multivariable controller for a small scale helicopter during hover and cruise flight. In the synthesis of MIMO CDM, good design common sense based on hands-on experience is necessary. The low level controller algorithm is designed as part of hybrid supervisory control architecture to be implemented on an onboard computer system. Its feasibility and performance are evaluated based on its robustness, desired time domain system responses and compliance to hard-real time requirements.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);coefficient diagram method;computer;controller (computing);hands-on computing;mimo;requirement;robot;trionic	Agus Budiyono	2005	CoRR		control engineering;open-loop controller;simulation;time domain;computer science;engineering;control theory;supervisory control;time constant	Robotics	60.48831031701397	-10.891703910377128	59774

Then infinity of solutions exists to find the impulsive torques. An energy cost functional of these impulsive torques is calculated to choose a unique solution by its minimization. Numerical results show that for a given time period of the walking gait step and a length of the step, there exists an optimal swinging amplitude of arms. For this optimal motion of the arms, mentioned above cost functional is minimum.	coat of arms;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;velocity (software development)	Yannick Aoustin;Alexander M.

There is only a part of mobile robots in the multi-robot system can receive the human command via the master robot located in the local side. By exchanging information through a undirected and connected graph, mobile robots in the network have to estimate the human command and the global task function for the control of teleoperation. The control framework is more scalable and flexible that the size and formation of mobile robot network can be teleoperated. Stability analysis is presented and experimental results are illustrated to show the efficacy of the performance of the decentralized teleoperation system.	algorithm;bilateral filter;connectivity (graph theory);graph (discrete mathematics);mobile robot;scalability	Chao-Wei Lin;Yen-Chen Liu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989634	connectivity;scalability;control engineering;social robot;control theory;engineering;teleoperation;robot control;robot;mobile robot;robot kinematics	Robotics	58.72033998050947	-22.754390590926686	59913

Hybrid leg-wheel robots are recently receiving a growing interest from the space community to explore planets, since they offer an appropriate solution to gain improved speed and mobility on unstructured terrain. However, in order to fully reach the hybrid mechanismpsilas potential, it is necessary to establish an optimal way to define when to use one over the other locomotion mode, depending on the soil conditions and topology. Even though this step is crucial, little attention has been devoted to this topic by the robotic community. The switching of motion mode, that is either wheel or leg are the actions to be planned, that we are considering in this paper. We aim at generating the safest and the least energy demanding path to reach a point of scientific interest. In order to define the optimal path with the set of switching actions required for the robot to follow it, the authors developed an action planning algorithm and a path evaluation method based on a four steps approach. First, an optimal candidate path on a rough terrain is generated based on topology and specificationspsila criteria functions. Then switching actions are defined along this path depending on the hybrid robotpsilas performances in each motion mode. The next step is a dynamic simulation of the robot controlled to follow the path. Finally, the path is evaluated based on the energy profile spent by the actuators and calculated by the simulation. Demonstrations for the proposed technique are addressed along with a discussion on characteristics of the candidate path and the energy profile of the robot.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;digital elevation model;energy profile (chemistry);grayscale;loss function;moon;motion planning;performance;planetary scanner;robot;rover (the prisoner);simulation;stereo camera;system of measurement;wheels	Eric Rohmer;Giulio Reina;Genya Ishigami;Keiji Nagatani;Kazuya Yoshida	2008	2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2008.4651134	robot;control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;dynamic simulation;simulation;fast path;network switch;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;motion planning;robot kinematics	Robotics	60.058340980968055	-23.265387622889346	59926

This is at least the case if time-continuous trajectories need to be generated online. In this paper we take advantage of a simple controller structure, which reduces the motion planning to a discrete-time planning problem, in which only a small set of input parameters need to be determined for each step. We show that for a planar leg with serial elastic actuation, hopping on a ground with stairs of irregular length and height can be planned online, based on a parameter mapping which has been learned in a data-driven manner by performing hopping trials with an adaptive exploration algorithm to evenly sample the parameter space. Experiments on a planar hopping leg prototype validate the approach.

This work is useful for precise computation and fast response required by motion control in microscope's view. We propose a projection method to use planar contours or even to transfer to a one-dimensional (1-D) searching problem to quickly obtain 3-D distance vector between cylindrical or cylinder enveloped objects, and as a result 11 cases are classified in total. Using distance as the basis of the repulsion force, we present a motion controller combining forces of attraction, repulsion, stuck, and detach to generate motion in the micro-operational space.

The technological innovations in this research are focused on the identification of abnormal transient response profiles from a satellite 6-DOF attitude control platform. The identification will be made by comparing, in real time, the filtered (Kalman) measurements to a synchronized model reference system. The methodology used to accomplish this task will be software intensive and perfectly compatible with the open physical architecture of existing monitoring devices and their automated control system mechanisms. The innovations demonstrated will be (1) a real-time Extended Kaiman filter to eliminate the measurement noise; (2) the formulation and use of a dynamic threshold detection system to identify abnormal state estimates as well as covariance estimates; and (3) the generation of an intelligent fault-mode file with corrective control commands to stabilize mild detected faults. The objective of this article is to provide these technical enhancements by handling and evaluating test data differently. An example is included to demonstrate these technical innovations. The AGHMS methodology will demonstrate real-time signal detection using an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) to obtain the best estimate of measurements (i.e., the dynamic parameters of a system); to obtain precise knowledge of the attitude of a satellite or a spacecraft that has an onboard magnetometer for attitude measurements; to study and analyze the state co-variance, as well as the error co-variance of the system; and to enhance the processing capability by monitoring systems in real time, perform systems detection/diagnosis, and actively control the environment/process based on these onboard sensor readings.	real-time transcription	Rodney W Johnson;S.

The walking surface is assumed to be rigid and flat; the contact between the robot and the walking surface is assumed to inhibit yaw rotation. The studied robot has 8 DOF in the single support phase and 6 actuators. In addition to the reduced number of actuators, the interest of studying robots with point feet is that the feedback control solution must explicitly account for the robot¿s natural dynamics in order to achieve balance while walking. We use an extension of the method of virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics (HZD), a very successful method for planar bipeds, in order to determine a periodic orbit and an autonomous feedback controller that realizes the orbit, for a 3D (spatial) bipedal walking robot. The effect of output selection on the zero dynamics is highlighted and a pertinent choice of outputs is proposed, leading to stabilization without the use of a supplemental event-based controller.	autonomous robot;control theory;feedback;mobile robot;relevance;underactuation;yaws	Jessy W.

The authors address the automatic generation of actuator commands for a robot manipulator that result in the motion of a collection of rigid-body parts from disassembled initial configurations to an assembled final configuration. A simple class of tasks, 2D sphere assemblies, is examined. A primitive constructive theory for the control of this class of tasks is presented. Preliminary computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach may provide surprisingly good performance. Comments Copyright 1992 IEEE.

In practice, as the cargoes grow larger and heavier, they often need to be cooperatively delivered by two cranes. However, even with wide application, the study of such dual overhead crane system (DOCS) still fails to receive enough attention from researchers. Until now, few results have been published for DOCS, and most of them present no rigorous analysis for the overall system dynamics. Motivated to solve these issues, a precise model is first set up for DOCS by utilizing the Lagrangian modeling method. Based on that, a nonlinear control strategy is further proposed, which elaborately considers the coordination between cranes. By utilizing Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle’s invariance theorem, the desired equilibrium point of the closed-loop system is proved to be asymptotically stable, without tuning to linearization or approximations. Finally, feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method are further validated by convincing hardware experimental results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper applies these structures to Fuzzy Sliding Mode Control (FSMC). Methods are tested for robot trajectory tracking with computer simulations. Computer simulations of three link robot manipulator show that RBFNN is more efficient on FSMC for trajectory control applications.	algorithm;computer simulation;emoticon;feedforward neural network;inverse dynamics;knowledge-based systems;neural networks;radial (radio);radial basis function;robot control	Ayca Gokhan Ak;Galip Cansever	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5281060	control engineering;engineering;machine learning;control theory	Robotics	63.072496443856366	-10.670613782705377	60636
d857ae650dfc1c7fb7986165ad22bfc0ea2362d3	trajectory optimization for ceres exploration using electric solar wind sail with a refined thrust model		The electric solar wind sail (E-sail for short) is an innovative concept for spacecraft propulsion, which can generate continuous thrust without propellant by reflecting solar wind ions. In previous literatures, the thrust of E-sail is described by a classical model, which neglected the effects of E-sail attitude on the propulsive thrust modulus and direction. The aim of this paper is to reappraise the performance of E-sail in the Ceres exploration mission with a new refined thrust model in polynomial form, which considered the effect of the spacecraft attitude on both the thrust modulus and direction. By using a hybrid optimization method, the trajectory optimization of E-sail from Earth to Ceres is implemented in an optimization framework. The numerical results show that the minimal flight time with refined thrust model is longer than that with classical model.	ceres (workstation);ions;literature;mathematical optimization;modulus robot;numerical analysis;polynomial;spacecraft;thrust;trajectory optimization	Mingying Huo;He Liao;Shilei Cao;Naiming Qi	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8217149	aerospace engineering;solar wind;spacecraft propulsion;control theory;engineering;thrust;polynomial;trajectory optimization;propellant;spacecraft;trajectory	EDA	62.038297533389695	-19.415085591789722	60951

The theory is illustrated with applications to a simplified model of Raibert’s hopping machines. An added benefit is accurate control of hopping height above undulating terrain.	algorithm;control theory;feedback;frank ostrowski;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;human height;j.w. graham medal;noise shaping;nonlinear system;optimal control;poincaré plot;robot	James P.

A passivity-based adaptive cooperative control scheme carries out compensation of all uncertain inertial and dynamic friction forces to guarantee asymptotic tracking of all contact forces and joint position-orientation trajectories over orthogonal force- and position-based impedance error manifolds. Optimal internal and external force trajectories are obtained to minimize the contact forces onto the constrained object while exerting a given desired contact force onto the environment. The simulation study of two robot fingers manipulating a constrained object for combined fast and slow velocity regimes shows that when the dynamic friction compensation is turned on tracking errors decrease tenfold.

Such processes typically have integrating and nonlinear dynamics causing the performance of conventional control designs and tuning to be poor or to require significant effort in practice. The process model is derived using data of step-response test and control implementation is designed through a new state-space structure. The closed-loop control system contains both the improved predictive control and P control. The performance of the proposed control for regulatory/servo, disturbance rejection, and measurement noise problems are studied and the obtained results show that the control system is of simple implementation with more robustness and provides better responses than conventional predictive control.	control system;control theory;focal (programming language);nonlinear system;process modeling;rejection sampling;servo;state space;step response	Ridong Zhang;Zhixing Cao;Renquan Lu;Ping Li;Furong Gao	2015	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2014.2323340	control engineering;engineering;control system;automatic control;process control;control theory;fractionation	Robotics	67.236880095983	-10.642541036044003	61358
2376078d13761387cabb933798b93a706c2ea7ef	polynomial trajectory planning for aggressive quadrotor flight in dense indoor environments	article	We explore the challenges of planning trajectories for quadrotors through cluttered indoor environments. We extend the existing work on polynomial trajectory generation by presenting a method of jointly optimizing polynomial path segments in an unconstrained quadratic program that is numerically stable for highorder polynomials and large numbers of segments, and is easily formulated for efficient sparse computation. We also present a technique for automatically selecting the amount of time allocated to each segment, and hence the quadrotor speeds along the path, as a function of a single parameter determining aggressiveness, subject to actuator constraints. The use of polynomial trajectories, coupled with the differentially flat representation of the quadrotor, eliminates the need for computationally intensive sampling and simulation in the high dimensional state space of the vehicle during motion planning. Our approach generates high-quality trajectories much faster than purely sampling-based optimal kinodynamic planning methods, but sacrifices the guarantee of asymptotic convergence to the global optimum that those methods provide. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by efficiently generating trajectories through challenging indoor spaces and successfully traversing them at speeds up to 8 m/s. A demonstration of our algorithm and flight performance is available at: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/quad_polynomial_ trajectory_planning.	algorithm;computation;global optimization;kinodynamic planning;mathematical optimization;motion planning;numerical analysis;numerical stability;polynomial;quadratic programming;sampling (signal processing);shortest path problem;simulation;sparse matrix;state space	Charles Richter;Adam Bry;Nicholas Roy	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-28872-7_37	simulation;geography;aeronautics;cartography	Robotics	60.696437034328724	-20.787150767757254	61584

499ba5be5caff6c32c2f8bb64c8331729d21cc2a	a new disturbance attenuation control scheme for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles		This paper addresses a difficult problem of high-accuracy control for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to external disturbance force and unknown disturbance torque. An observer-based full control scheme is presented. In the strategy, two observer-based estimators are first designed to estimate external disturbance force and torque, respectively. With the application of the precise estimation value, a nonlinear tracking controller is then proposed with compensated disturbance. It is shown by the Lyapunov stability analysis that the entire controller–observer system is asymptotically stable. The key feature of the scheme is that it not only has the superior capability to attenuate unknown external disturbance torque and external force generated by the wind, but also it is able to achieve full control (i.e., six degrees-of-freedom) of the quadrotor UAVs with position and attitude successfully controlled. The effectiveness of the approach is verified on a quadrotor UAV example.	aerial photography;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;six degrees of separation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Bing Xiao;Shen Yin	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2017.2682900	attenuation;estimator;control engineering;computer science;control theory;attitude control;lyapunov stability;torque;observer (quantum physics);stability theory;control theory	Robotics	65.68392854723415	-12.14033908468223	61996
417640d389fc60c2593fe8e319ea244baabbfcf1	artificial intelligence algorithms in behavioural control of wheeled mobile robots formation		The paper presents an innovative approach to the problem of the wheeled mobile robots formation behavioural control with use of artificial intelligence algorithms. The control task is solved by application of adaptive dynamic programming algorithms in the hierarchical control system, that generates the collision free trajectories in the unknown 2D environment for all agents in the formation, and realises generated trajectories using tracking control algorithms. The hierarchical control system consists of three layers: the trajectory generator, the wheeled mobile robots formation control system and tracking control systems for individual agents. The trajectory generator presents the new approach to the behavioural control, where one neural dynamic programming algorithm generates the behavioural control signals that make possible to compute the trajectory for realisation of the complex task, which is a composition of two individual behaviours: “goal-seeking”and “obstacle avoiding“. Computer simulations have been conducted to illustrate the path planning process.	artificial intelligence;robot	Zenon Hendzel;Andrzej Burghardt;Marcin Szuster	2012		10.1007/978-3-319-11271-8_17	control engineering;simulation;artificial intelligence	AI	58.77502666824967	-23.418479164372762	62243

In this paper, a modified lever displacement amplifier is proposed for the mechanism design of a novel compliant two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) nanopositioning stage, which can be selected to drive in dual modes. Besides, the modified double four-bar parallelogram, P (P denotes prismatic) joints are adopted in designing the flexure limbs. The established models for the mechanical performance evaluation of the stage, in terms of kinetostatics, dynamics, and workspace, are validated by the finite-element analysis. After a series of dimension optimizations carried out through the particle swarm optimization algorithm, a novel active disturbance rejection controller, including the nonlinearity tracking differentiator, the extended state observer, and the nonlinear state error feedback, is proposed to automatically estimate and suppress plant uncertainties arising from the hysteresis nonlinearity, creep effect, sensor noises, and unknown disturbances. The simulation and prototype test results indicate that the first natural frequency of the proposed stage is approximated to be 831 Hz, the amplification ratio in two axes is about 4.2, and the workspace is 119.7 μm × 121.4 μm, while the cross coupling between the two axes is kept within 2%. All the results prove that the developed stage possesses a good property for high-performance AFM scanning.	amplifier;approximation algorithm;atomic-force microscopy;differentiator;displacement mapping;finite element method;hysteresis;instruction creep;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;particle swarm optimization;performance evaluation;prototype;rejection sampling;simulation;workspace	Hui Tang;Yangmin Li	2013	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2013.2248536	control engineering;motion control;creep;electronic engineering;atomic force microscopy;engineering;amplifier;finite element method;control theory	Robotics	67.94465641749716	-14.922144811664651	62353

The raw material is a plastic film that passes through a process to make holes. The success of the company is closely linked to the high and permanent quality control of its products. The amount of holes on the film (i.e. the percentage of open area) is the principal criterion that guarantees the quality of the final product. The film must be perforated so that the open area stands between 25% and 30% for a good absorption. The requirements from our industrial partner was to develop a low cost automatic system to inspect the perforated film on the production lines i.e. based on a personal computer architecture. The challenge was to implement algorithms on a PC based system, with high efficiency computational time and of course a good robustness versus different kinds of perturbations. From the images acquired by a CCD line scan camera, we compute the percentage of open area by the estimation of the cyclic ratio.	conformity;visual inspection	Luc Duvieubourg;J.

The control scheme targets on unknown off-set in the fuel path of individual cylinder which represents the effect of the cylinder-to-cylinder imbalance caused by the perturbations in each injector gain or other disturbances in the dynamics of fuel injection path. The fueling-to-exhaust gas mixing system is treated as single-input single-output (SISO) periodic time-varying system where the input is fuel injection command for each cylinder and the output is the exhaust bottom dead center (BDC) scaled air-fuel ratio sampling. Then, an observer-based iterative learning strategy is proposed to provide estimation of the unknown off-set in each cylinder. The effectiveness of the learning algorithm will be demonstrated with the experiment results conducted on a commercial car-used engine with six cylinders. Furthermore, as an application of the learning algorithm, feedback control with feedforward compensation is also demonstrated with experiment validation.	algorithm;binary delta compression;cylinder seal;feed forward (control);feedback;feedforward neural network;flexible-fuel vehicle;iterative method;mixing (mathematics);sampling (signal processing);soft-in soft-out decoder;test bench	Tomohiro Hara;Tielong Shen;Yasuhiko Mutoh	2012	2012 6th IEEE International Conference Intelligent Systems	10.1109/IS.2012.6335152	control engineering;engineering;automotive engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.82925094137943	-12.202357219102273	62462

Autonomous driving on this two-lane urban road includes interaction with traffic, behavior at intersections, lane change maneuvers at speeds up to 60 km/h as well as merging into moving traffic. The demanding terms of the surroundings require an extremely high precision of all modules. Compared to former research activities in autonomous driving, the width of the ring road's roadway varies significantly and has both narrow curves close to the turn radius of the vehicle and straight roads. Therefore, a new approach for trajectory planning having the comprehensive treatment of path-planned sections as its distinctive feature has been realized and the first major success within the context of the “Stadtpilot”-Project. Curvature optimized trajectories are generated over the whole roadway that are independent from the way driving decision are found, resulting in a safe, smooth and comfortable driving behavior. This paper introduces the algorithm and shows its potential on the basis of a typical driving maneuver on the ring road.	algorithm;augmented reality;autonomous car;autonomous robot;mathematical optimization;stadtpilot	Jörn-Marten Wille;Falko Saust;Markus Maurer	2010	13th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2010.5625155	simulation;engineering;operations management;transport engineering	Robotics	55.46486944593283	-21.284207466201295	62487

Achieving optimal robot energy consumption is only possible if robot control parameters and morphology are tuned simultaneously. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are well suited for this purpose. In this application, however, GAs converge slowly because of the high dimensionality of the fitness landscape, the limited number of successful designs within this landscape, and the significant computational cost of evaluating the fitness function using dynamics simulations. To accelerate GA convergence for design applications involving biomimetic robots, a new physics-based preprocessing methodology is proposed. This preprocessing strategy was applied to develop gaits for a biomimetic caterpillar robot. Convergence speeds were observed to increase significantly through the application of the physics-based preprocessing.	algorithmic efficiency;biomimetics;converge;fitness function;galaxy morphological classification;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;preprocessor;robot control;simulation;software release life cycle	Frank Saunders;John Rieffel;Jason Rife	2000	2009 4th International Conference on Autonomous Robots and Agents	10.1109/ICARA.2000.4803935	dynamic simulation;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	58.53458299826996	-19.790211454106675	62502

For optimum performance of a controller, the appropriate selection of its parameters is of utmost importance. Furthermore, when the initial conditions of the system change, the controller with the previous parameters would be not optimum in the new conditions. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper, an online optimal Decoupled Sliding Mode Control (DSMC) approach is introduced. Firstly, to determine the optimum parameters of DSMC, an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied. Next, to adapt the optimal controller to any initial condition, the Moving Least Squares (MLS) approximation is utilized. Finally, the proposed online optimal DSMC is successfully applied to a ball and beam system. The comparative studies are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.	mathematical optimization;moving least squares;particle swarm optimization	Mohammad Javad Mahmoodabadi;S.

These controllers use a new non-singular Terminal Sliding Mode (TSM) manifold, as being a non-linear integral mapping of the second order with respect to the task space tracking error. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, Jacobian transpose control schemes proposed are shown to be finite-time stable provided that some reasonable assumptions are fulfilled during the manipulator movement. The performance of the proposed control strategies is illustrated through computer simulations for a planar non-redundant manipulator of two revolute kinematic pairs which accomplishes trajectory tracking by the end-effector in a two-dimensional task space.	algorithm;computer simulation;ibm spectrum protect (tivoli storage manager);interaction;jacobian matrix and determinant;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;robot end effector	Miroslaw Galicki	2015	2015 10th International Workshop on Robot Motion and Control (RoMoCo)	10.1109/RoMoCo.2015.7219708	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.31166875699638	-17.896010619911316	62713

The main idea is that artificial networks provide accurate inter-sampling data estimation in dual-rate systems, allowing controlling the process at the fastest possible rate. In addition to this, the paper compares the performance with other approaches taking into account the ideal but non-feasible closed loop at high frequency. For that purpose, the paper considers metrics such as mean square error and settling time to measure the overall performance. The proposed dual-rate non-linear holds have been tested in both, simulation and real processes, and particularly, in an industrial robot within an image-based visual servoing application. The new approach improves with respect to the conventional single-rate behavior and showing higher stability margin than conventional dual-rate holds.		J.

The robot arms and the carried object construct a 6-link closed chain. The path planning problem for the 6-link closed chain is solved by using two major algorithms: the collision-free feasible configuration finding algorithm and the collision-free path finding algorithm. The collision-free feasible configuration finding algorithm finds all collision-free feasible configurations (CFFCs) of the 6-link closed chain in each discrete interval of two joint angles. The collision-free path finding algorithm builds a connection graph by CFFCs and the transitions between any two groups of CFFCs at adjacent joint intervals. Then a graph search method is used to find a collision-free path for each joint of the robots.	automated planning and scheduling;motion planning;robot	Qing Xue;Phillip C.-Y.

The aim is to search for an optimal control action for the follower vehicle in the admissible control command space. Relative information is used as a metric in the search space and for evaluating the expected performance of vehicle following. With this metric, and based on the assumption that both vehicle pose (position and orientation) distributions are Gaussian functions, the K-L distance of the vehicle following system can be computed. With a series of admissible actions, such as steering and velocity commands, for the follower vehicle at each pose prediction step, and by minimizing the K-L distance, an optimized action for the follower vehicle can be obtained. The proposed vehicle following algorithm has been tested and the performance of the follower vehicle when the leader undergoes various kinds of maneuvers has been analyzed. Results using this new method, as compared to classical methods, have shown the advantages of this method.	algorithm;automotive navigation system;information theory;kullback–leibler divergence;mathematical optimization;optimal control;optimization problem;pose (computer vision);velocity (software development)	Teck Chew Ng;Martin David Adams;Javier Ibanez Guzman	2008	2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2008.4650858	control engineering;mobile robot;optimization problem;mathematical optimization;pose;optimal control;computer science;control theory;gaussian process;mathematics;kullback–leibler divergence;statistics	Robotics	61.30886460429293	-18.88465814935593	63053

The new designed neural network contains the key mechanisms of a typical fuzzy CMAC network and a brain emotional learning controller network. First, the input values of the new network are delivered to a receptive field structure that is inspired from the fuzzy CMAC. Then, the values are divided into a sensory and an emotional channels; and the two channels interact with each other to generate the final outputs of the proposed network. The parameters of the proposed network are on-line tuned by the brain emotional learning rules; in addition, stability analysis theory is used to guaranty the proposed controller's convergence. In the experimentation, a “Duffing-Holmes” chaotic system and a simulated mobile robot are applied to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control system. By comparing with the performances of other neural network based control systems, we believe our proposed network is capable of producing better control performances of complex uncertain nonlinear systems control.	adaptive grammar;artificial neural network;chaos theory;control system;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;inference engine;linear approximation;lyapunov fractal;mobile robot;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;one-key mac;online and offline;performance;robust control;simulation	Dajun Zhou;Fei Chao;Chih-Min Lin;Longzhi Yang;Minghui Shi;Changle Zhou	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2017.8015410	neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;control theory;fuzzy logic;control theory;artificial neural network;artificial intelligence;network simulation;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;adaptive control;computer science;control system	Robotics	62.26317938420967	-10.144548241610856	63127

This paper addresses the two issues on the surge detection approach for magnetically suspended centrifugal compressors (MSCCs) utilizing the signal monitoring capabilities of magnetic bearings. An adaptive frequency estimator is proposed to extract the surge signal, and a judgment criterion is establish to the surge state. First, the derivation of a surge disturbance transfer model for the fluctuating pressure and rotor displacement was presented, and the characteristics of surge signal in the MSCC system is analyzed. Then, a conventional notch filter (NF) is used to eliminate the synchronous disturbance in the surge signal, and a modified adaptive notch filter (ANF) method is used to estimate the frequency of surge signal. The convergence analysis of the modified ANF shows that the linearized system is asymptotically stable. The mild surge detection technology and judgement criterion are also discussed. Experimental results on both the 100 kW and 315 kW MSCC systems show that the proposed method can rapidly detect the surge before the MSCC systems develops into the modified surge.	a-normal form;centrifugal governor;displacement mapping;industrial pc;r.o.t.o.r.;surge protector;the 100;zero suppression	Yin Zhang;Shiqiang Zheng;Qi Chen;Jiancheng Fang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2774728	control engineering;control theory;estimator;band-stop filter;surge;stability theory;engineering;rotor (electric);magnetic bearing;magnetic levitation;vibration	Robotics	67.79916967152495	-10.098949062997578	63138

Clipping-off conjugate gradient method is adopted to solve the bounded optimal control problem, whereas penalty function is employed to relax the state constraint. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to clarify the effectiveness of the optimal control system. The proposed scheme can be directly applied to transfer the payload to desirable skew orientation without any residual oscillation, or it can be utilized as a reference trajectory planner of the skewing control module for a 2-DOFs controller in either overhead or rotary crane systems.	actuator device component;conjugate gradient method;control system;control unit;controllers;crane equipment;entity name part qualifier - adopted;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;immunostimulating conjugate (antigen);mathematical concepts;mathematical model;mathematics;nonlinear system;optimal control;overhead (computing);penalty method;rotary nystagmus;rotary system;servo device component;simulation;velocity (software development)	Ho Duc Tho;Ryosuke Tasaki;Takanori Miyoshi;Kazuhiko Terashima	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	10.1109/CCTA.2018.8511443		Robotics	65.76224862766693	-18.52023288085266	63376

It elaborates the work to employ the ANFIS architecture to  model linear function for creating a closed loop system. It tests the comparative performance with simple and hybrid controllers  with respect to ‘Pre-trip plan assistance system with vehicle health monitoring’. The system calculates safest traveling distance  based on six inputs. The approach is an extension to design of pre trip plan assistance with open loop fuzzy and hybrid fuzzy  using genetics [1-3]. This paper mainly proposes performance of ANFIS for calculating safest distance that can be traveled  by a vehicle under pre trip plan assistance system with vehicle health monitoring. ANFIS is used in the current work to create  a closed loop system and to test comparative performance with simple and hybrid controllers. Nearly 5-8% improvement in the  results is obtained if we incorporate hybrid (Mamdani Sugeno) model and neural fuzzy closed loop controller gives further  4% improvement.

b6233c6aec2e051c6e85158b4f16209175cfbdc4	field sensing and target tracking using mobile sensors	mobile sensors;potential field;target tracking	We investigate the problem of gathering of sensory data from a non-convex area (without a hole) using mobile sensors when certain regions of the area are under attacks from intruders. The theory of sensing and tracking targets is based on the idea of a potential field wherein the sensors move towards the areas of intrusion due to the existence of mutually attractive forces between intruders and sensors, and move away from each other due the existence of mutually repulsive forces between themselves. A set of algorithms have been proposed on the basis of the fore-mentioned potential field theory which accomplishes the twin objectives of field sensing and target tracking efficiently.	sensor	Parchand Amit Madhukar;R.

The kinematic model we use is that of a mobile platform with two degrees of freedom. The mobile robot is subject to a kinematic constraint, the number of its degrees of freedom being less than the dimension of its Configuration Space.  The problem posed here is then essentially to control the number of backing-up maneuvers along a path. Addressing first the local problem of turning in a corridor, we show that sliding continuously on the outer wall in a turn constitutes a canonical contact trajectory, in the sense that if it is not safe, there cannot be another safe trajectory with no backing-up maneuver. In the case no smooth trajectory exists, we propose some simple maneuvers.      A heuristic path planning algorithm based on a decomposition of Free Space into cones connected by turns is then presented. Finally we discuss how this can apply within the more realistic framework of a real mobile robot at work, by implementing these results as a set of rules of behaviour for the robot.    	mobile robot;motion planning	Pierre Tournassoud	1988		10.1007/3-540-51683-2_29	bang-bang robot;pfaffian constraint;inverse kinematics;motion planning;robot kinematics	Robotics	61.99336351613179	-21.584195212451196	63863

This approach not only avoids the solution of differential-algebraic equations but also leads to a completely decoupled dynamic model that is ideal for directly inverse dynamic analysis, real-time dynamic simulation and control. To verify this approach, an underactuated 3-joint finger has been brought forward. Simulation results from Matlab/Simulink are consistent with those obtained from ADAMS grasp simulations. For the hand real-time dynamic control, the velocity observer has been established based on the dynamic model, the adaptive curve fitting with the observer has obtained precise velocity signals, made up the uncertain parameters such as torsion spring, inertial, damps, etc. and achieved ideal results. By applying dynamics model and observer, the force-based impedance control can realize more accurate and stable force control during grasp.	autonomous robot;biological system;characteristic impedance;curve fitting;differential algebraic equation;dynamic language runtime;dynamic simulation;kinematic chain;matlab;mathematical model;nl (complexity);numerical aperture;pid;real-time clock;real-time transcription;simulink;time-scale calculus;torsion (gastropod);underactuation;unified model;velocity (software development)	Hai Huang;Yong-Jie Pang;Jiang Li;Shaowei Fan;Xinqing Wang;Hong Liu	2010	I.

The main idea is to define gait trajectories for hip and ankle so that motions of other joints can be regulated simultaneously. Because stability is one of the most common concerns requested for HRs, a self-learning control strategy of improving dynamic stability based on the zero moment point (ZMP) criterion is developed. As hip motion plays the most important role of dynamic stability, a dynamic fuzzy Q-learning (DFQL) controller is proposed to define the hip motion trajectory. A salient feature of the proposed approach is that the DFQL controller can self generate fuzzy rules without a priori knowledge and it is capable of dealing with dynamic systems. The DFQL controller can automatically generate the structure as well as parameters of the fuzzy system. Simulation results show that the DFQL controller is capable of improving dynamic stability as the actual ZMP trajectory becomes very close to the ideal case.	control theory;dynamical system;fuzzy control system;gait analysis;q-learning;robot;simulation;speech synthesis;zero moment point	Meng Joo Er;Yi Zhou;Chiang-Ju Chien	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384799	simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory;fuzzy control system	Robotics	61.61775074986147	-12.863121293333391	64063

A special gear train was developed to have omnidirectional mechanism using conventional tire wheels. Several control laws are provided by considering the robot as a redundantly actuated wheeled mobile robot (WMR) on the plane. Since the robot has three degrees of freedom (DOF) in motion, failure in any one of the motor can be compensated by the other two motors in posture control although the omni-directional mobility is lost. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the e ectiveness of the proposed omni-directional mechanism.	computer simulation;experiment;fault tolerance;mobile robot;poor posture;scroll wheel;wheels	Myung-Jin Jung;Jong-Hwan Kim	2001		10.1109/ROBOT.2001.933138	control engineering;mobile robot;bang-bang robot;cartesian coordinate robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot control;robot kinematics;robot calibration	Robotics	65.88425841577393	-18.748375582340568	64173

The Fastron allows iterative updates to account for a changing environment through a combination of a novel formulation of the kernel perceptron learning algorithm and an active learning strategy. Our simulations on a 7 degree-of-freedom arm indicate that proxy collision checks may be performed at least 2 times faster than an efficient polyhedral collision checker and at least 8 times faster than an efficient high-precision collision checker. The Fastron model provides conservative collision status predictions by padding C-space obstacles, and proxy collision checking time does not scale poorly as the number of workspace obstacles increases. All results were achieved without GPU acceleration or parallel computing.	algorithm;collision detection;graphics processing unit;hardware acceleration;iterative method;kernel perceptron;parallel computing;polyhedron;scalability;simulation;workspace	Nikhil Das;Naman Gupta;Michael Yip	2017			configuration space;active learning;collision;kernel perceptron;simulation;acceleration;collision detection;real-time computing;padding;kinematics;computer science	Robotics	59.26539764844145	-18.98078831820669	64187

A non-linear dynamic model of the QRUAV, simulated in Matlab was complemented with an EKF based attitude estimator. The estimator fuses measurements obtained from simulated accelerometers and gyroscopes onboard the QRUAV. It is then shown that this estimator only results in adequate representation of the attitude when the translational velocity is large. This behavior is explained considering the dynamics of the vehicle and the onboard accelerometers. Also a possible method of exploiting this behavior for improving the estimation accuracy is suggested.	aerial photography;extended kalman filter;matlab;mathematical model;nonlinear system;process modeling;profiling (computer programming);r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	Dinuka M.

The task is to locate two different target areas, which are located near each other. Therefore we developed an individual-based NetLogo model to simulate two different agent swarms moving in a temperature gradient. Both agent swarms are controlled by the BEECLUST algorithm, which is inspired by honeybee behavior. We found out that the two cooperating agent swarms are able to locate the target areas, independent of the ratio of the agents.	algorithm;autonomous agent;autonomous robot;gradient;netlogo;simulation	Tobias Meister;Ronald Thenius;Daniela Kengyel;Thomas Schmickl	2013		10.7551/978-0-262-31709-2-ch169	simulation;artificial intelligence	AI	56.859437063431926	-23.819359385647992	64419

The robot hand is constructed as a planar hook so that the contact point, about which the robot swings, is a passive hinge. We identify the 10 most relevant degrees of freedom for this underactuated mechanical system and formulate a tractable search procedure consisting on the following steps: (a) to introduce a parametrized family of coordination patterns to be enforced on the dynamics with respect to a path coordinate; (b) to formulate geometric equality constraints that are necessary to achieve a periodic locomotion; (c) to generate trajectories from integrable reduced dynamics associated with the passive hinge; (d) to evaluate the energetic cost of transport. Moreover, we observe that a linear approximation of the reduced dynamics can be used for trajectory generation, which allows us to incorporate computation of an approximate gradient of the cost function into the search algorithm significantly improving the computational efficiency.	algorithm;robot	Stepan Pchelkin;Anton S.

First, for each vehicle, a positively invariant terminal-state region and an auxiliary controller are developed. When every vehicle lies in its terminal-state region, all the distributed control targets are achieved by the auxiliary controller. Second, the compatibility constraint, restricting the norm of the uncertain deviation between the assumed and actual predictive trajectories of each vehicle, is given, which respects both the collision avoidance and convergence guarantee. Thirdly, a robust collision avoidance constraint tolerating for the uncertain deviation is designed. By these designs, an overall control algorithm is proposed, by applying which all the control targets are achieved. Two illustrative examples are provided to show the advantage and effectiveness of the proposed approach.	algorithm;collision detection;control theory;distributed control system;recueil des historiens des croisades	Peng Wang;Baocang Ding	2014	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2014.2304175	control engineering;nickel;vehicle dynamics;simulation;convergence;engineering;trajectory;control theory	Robotics	64.1336239514714	-17.216759148791883	64558

Moreover, balance of signal cycles is considered and used to improve the algorithmic performance and its rationality is verified from theoretical view. In addition, a prototype is implemented in VC++ 6.0 environment, tested over a typical signalized traffic network, and elementary results are summarized. Finally, conclusion is brought that it is a good choice to adopt dynamic self-organization decision based on fuzzy structural model and fuzzy algorithm in large complex control systems.	algorithm;computation;consensus dynamics;control flow;control system;fuzzy associative matrix;heuristic;numerical linear algebra;prototype;rationality;real-time transcription;self-organization	Gaoshou Zhai;Jianzhong Cha	2007	Fourth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD 2007)	10.1109/FSKD.2007.609	self-organization;simulation;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;control theory;fuzzy control system;adjacency matrix	Robotics	54.20898306182175	-14.229404021488817	64666

The proposed approach combines analytical and numerical methods to solve generalized inverse kinematics problems simultaneously in both free and constrained working spaces. The method introduces a virtual repulsive torque imposed by the topological configuration of robot links, joint limits, and obstacles with motion trajectories. The method calculates the shortest distances between joint limit, links, and obstacles. Links of manipulator and obstacles are modeled in ellipsoids so as to evaluate the minimum distances between obstacles and links of a redundant robot. Virtual repulsive torques imposed on links are estimated based on the shortest distances between these ellipsoidal objects. A numerical method obtains the tendency of major joints' movements and calculates their potential velocities by composing these acting torques. In trajectory tracking, collision avoidance occurring on links can finally be achieved by utilizing the characteristics of joint redundancy. The validity and efficiency of the proposed method are measured in simulations of movement along trajectories in terms of a defined index of motion availability, by which it verifies that the method is not only feasible to constrained motions but also has better performances in free motions than inverse Jacobian techniques.	algorithm;inverse kinematics;jacobian matrix and determinant;numerical method;performance;robot;simulation	Yu-Jen Chen;Ming-Yi Ju;Kao-Shing Hwang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2548439	classical mechanics;control engineering;kinematics;trajectory;inverse kinematics;control theory;mathematics;ellipsoid;torque;physics	Robotics	68.09627798718009	-21.161563733470132	64859

In this paper, Linear Programming (LP) is applied to search for the train braking trajectory with the maximum Regenerative Braking Energy (RBE). LP takes the advantages of simplicity in modelling, efficiency in computation, flexibility in applications. Compared with the previously proposed model in [1], the proposed LP optimisation model takes into account the speed limit constraints during the braking operation. Four case studies have been performed with different speed limits and initial braking speeds. While the maximum allowed braking time takes a key role for the RBE recovery, a threshold exists when the impact of maximum allowed braking time starts to become negligible. It has been demonstrated in this paper that LP is a robust and effective method to locate the optimal braking trajectory with the maximum RBE. The results of the optimisation are of significant interest for urban transportation systems where the regenerative braking is frequently applied. Future work of this paper is to investigate the optimisation of RBE in a more complicated scenario where the gradients are present and the motoring operation of train is allowed.	computation;effective method;gradient;linear programming;mathematical optimization	Shaofeng Lu;Paul Weston;Ning Zhao	2014	17th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2014.6958090	control engineering;simulation;dynamic braking;engineering;automotive engineering;threshold braking;dynamic braking	Robotics	56.13959192448202	-12.6881981962452	65258

The technique is based on three principles: Newton-Raphson flow for solving algebraic equations, output prediction, and controller speedup. Early applications of the technique, made to simple systems of an academic nature, were implemented by simple algorithms requiring modest computational efforts. In contrast, this paper tests it on commonlyused dynamic models to see if it can handle more complex control scenarios. Results are derived from simulations as well as a laboratory setting, and they indicate effective tracking convergence despite the simplicity of the control algorithm.	algebraic equation;algorithm;autonomous robot;computation;course (navigation);experiment;lateral computing;lateral thinking;newton's method;simulation;speedup;state space	Shashwat Shivam;Ian Buckley;Yorai Wardi;Carla Seatzu;Magnus Egerstedt	2018	CoRR			Robotics	61.2748917238519	-15.050934476800824	65279

Control systems for legged robots are plagued by dynamic constraints from underactuation, actuator power limits, and frictional ground contact; rather than relying purely on disturbance rejection, considerable advantage can be obtained by planning nominal trajectories which are more easily stabilized. In this paper, we present an approach for designing nominal periodic trajectories for legged robots that maximize a measure of robustness against uncertainty in the geometry of the terrain. We propose a direct collocation method which solves simultaneously for a nominal periodic control input, for many possible one-step solution trajectories (using ground profiles drawn from a distribution over terrain), and for the periodic solution to a jump Riccati equation which provides an expected infinite-horizon cost-to-go for each of these samples. We demonstrate that this trajectory optimization scheme can recover the known deadbeat open-loop control solution for the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) on unknown terrain. Moreover, we demonstrate that it generalizes to other models like the bipedal compass gait walker, resulting in a dramatic increase in the number of steps taken over moderate terrain when compared against a limit cycle optimized for efficiency only.	amiga walker;collocation method;control system;inverted pendulum;limit cycle;list of code lyoko episodes;mathematical optimization;optimizing compiler;rejection sampling;robot;trajectory optimization;underactuation	Hongkai Dai;Russ Tedrake	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6425971	control engineering;mobile robot;open-loop controller;pendulum;simulation;gait analysis;computer science;engineering;friction;control theory;motion planning;actuator	Robotics	62.226588412503176	-18.52998493449421	65309

The major difficulties are caused by simultaneous existence of nonholonomic constraints, unknown system parameters and a quadratic term of unmeasurable states in the mobile robot dynamic system as well as their couplings. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a new adaptive control scheme including designing a new adaptive state feedback controller and two high-gain observers to estimate the unknown linear and angular velocities respectively. It is shown that the closed loop adaptive system is stable and the tracking errors are guaranteed to be within the pre-specified bounds which can be arbitrarily small. Simulation results also verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This approach utilizes a self-organizing CMAC neural network mechanism which has a fast training rate, high approximation accuracy and significant reduction in space complexity. In order to apply this control approach to a bipedal walking robot, a Cartesian virtual dynamics space is introduced based on the virtual model control concept. The adaptive CMAC neural network control approach identifies the unmodelled dynamics of the bipedal robot and ensures asymptotic system stability in a Lyapunov sense. It can also better accommodate unexpected external disturbances, enhancing the control robustness of the bipedal robot. The CMAC neural network structure, its training algorithm, and bipedal locomotion control are described. The simulation results for a walking robot are presented.	artificial neural network;mobile robot;neural network software;one-key mac	Jianjuen J. Hu;Jerry E. Pratt;Gill A.

The maps that are used to calculate the racket's initial parameters are described. They are implemented with the locally weighted regression (LWR). An active learning approach based on the fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (FCMAC) is proposed, and then it is added to the LWR, which is regarded as lazy learning. A learning algorithm that is used for updating the experience data in the fuzzy CMAC according to the errors between the actual and desired landing positions is presented.

Because a swing leg moves to a desired landing position, an unexpected collision on a terrain may be happened by a distance error between a foot and a terrain. A swing foot has to not only absorb a impact force, but also changes a trajectory as long as a swing foot contacts on a terrain. Furthermore it is required to keep a balance against a contact force. To prevent a trip over and a losing balance by contact on a terrain, two reactive key components are installed: 1) Set appropriate impedance gains of the feet according to a walking phase, 2) Update the desired landing position to the COG (Center of Gravity) pattern generation immediately as a detecting/releasing contact. In this paper, focused on a swing motion, a robust biped walking with a collision of a swinging foot on a uneven terrain is realized. The proposed method is validated through simulation results with the HRP-2 humanoid robot.	characteristic impedance;humanoid robotics project;humanoid robot;sensor;simulation;zero moment point	Mitsuharu Morisawa;Fumio Kanehiro;Kenji Kaneko;Shuuji Kajita;Kazuhito Yokoi	2011	2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100885	simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	64.91739199405343	-21.927761918303425	65982

In this scheme the robot obtains a desired motion by repeating trials (test motion). A merit of this control scheme is that the input torque pattern that generates the desired motion can be formed without estimating the physical parameters of robot dynamics. In practice, to allow the robot motion to approach the desired one in each trial, the input torque given to the robot at the present trial is modified only by the velocity signal of the real robot motion at the previous trial and the desired one. The convergence to the desired motion is theoretically proved for a linear time-varying mechanical system, which is an approximate representation of nonlinear robot dynamics in the vicinity of the desired motion. The effectiveness of this control scheme is demonstrated through actual experiments in which a revolute-type manipulator with three degrees of freedom is used, and the desired motion trajectory is given not only in terms of joint-angle coordinates but also in terms of task-oriented coordinates. >		Sadao Kawamura;Fumio Miyazaki;Suguru Arimoto	1988	IEEE Trans.

In each step of backstepping design, the unknown upper bound of uncertainty is estimated by adaptive method to reduce conservation. The derivative of the virtual controller is calculated by a precise differentiator based on higher-order sliding modes. Using non-quadratic Lyapunov function, the global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proved. Simulation results show that the proposed control system can overcome the impact of lage-scale perturbations of aerodynamic parameters and external disturbances, which has better dynamic qualities, tracking capabilities compared to the traditional backstepping controller.

This means the density of a BUAV equals that of the surrounding air. Because of this, the motion of a BUAV is seriously affected by flow disturbances, whose distribution is usually non-uniform and unknown. In addition, the inertia in the heading motion is very large. There is also a strict limitation on the weight of equipment in the BUAV, so most BUAVs are so-called under-actuated robots. From this situation, it can be said that the motion planning of the BUAV considering the stochastic property of the disturbance is needed for obstacle avoidance. In this paper, we propose an approach to the motion planning of the BUAV via the application of Markov decision process (MDP). The proposed approach consists of a method to prepare a discrete MDP model of the BUAV motion and a method to maintain the effect of the unknown wind on the BUAVs motion. The performance of the methods is examined by dynamical simulation of the BUAV in the environment with wind disturbance	action selection;aerial photography;computational fluid dynamics;course (navigation);displacement mapping;dynamical simulation;markov chain;markov decision process;motion planning;obstacle avoidance;robot;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	Hiroshi Kawano	2006	2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2006.281889	telerobotics;markov decision process;control engineering;turbulence;mobile robot;three-dimensional space;dynamic simulation;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;motion planning;obstacle avoidance;markov process	Robotics	61.81670178985218	-18.97035477533146	66145

A consensus-based control law is described taking into account the nature of traveling in urban environment, that is the human driven leader travels with variable velocity. In addition, the proposed control law does not depend on the predecessor velocity, which in turn allows us to utilize a low cost limited bandwidth communication module by using a sensor-based link for predecessor distance and a communication-based link for leader's information. A constant-spacing policy is used to get a high capacity flow of vehicles. The control system is analyzed and conditions for both internal and string stability are set. The efficiency of the proposed framework and control law is verified via numerical analysis.

A novel feature of the planner is that it can adjust the balance between l ocal and global planning. As the experimental data sugge sts that the optimal balance depends on the problem, a scheduling mechanism is added to the algorithm to adjust the balance during planning. The resulting m otion planner is capable of solving very difficult motion planning problems.	automated planning and scheduling;computation;heuristic (computer science);local search (optimization);motion planning;openclipart;procedural generation;scheduling (computing);search algorithm	Pekka Isto	1997		10.1109/ROBOT.1997.619170	computer vision;mathematical optimization;simulation;information processing;computational geometry;computer science;artificial intelligence;motion planning	Robotics	55.264239884477476	-23.502152841058045	66373

The overall system can be thought of as a composite of two subsystems: one is the vehicle with m degrees of freedom, and the other is the robot arm with n degrees of freedom. The interconnections between them are interactive forces. A simplified decentralized controller for the two subsystems is proposed and the resulting closed-loop error systems are modelled as a composite of two error subsystems. The interconnections between the error subsystems are mismatches on interactive forces. Conditions are derived for stability when the interconnections are not completely known. An interesting conclusion is that we can choose arbitrarily large weighting gains to decrease the trajectory errors without increasing the magnitude of the physical control torques.	mobile robot	Kai Liu;Frank L.

Vehicle acceleration is optimized in real-time to vary the vehicle power demand to improve the fuel efficiency. The effects of different gear ratios on the fuel consumption rate are explicitly considered during the optimization process. A robust optimization method is adopted to ensure the controller performance under traffic prediction uncertainties. Using this approach, the optimal solution is guaranteed to provide fuel savings and satisfy constraints at the same time for any actual traffic profile within the uncertainty set. The optimal control problem is discretized and solved using a nonlinear programming (NLP) solver for an 8-vehicle platoon scenario. The results show that the proposed controller can achieve 23.5% fuel saving with perfect traffic prediction, and 16.6% fuel saving with prediction uncertainties.	controller (computing);discretization;mathematical optimization;natural language processing;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimal control;optimization problem;platoon (automobile);real-time clock;real-time transcription;robust optimization;solver	Yunli Shao;Zongxuan Sun	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963723	control theory;nonlinear programming;computer science;control engineering;robust optimization;cooperative adaptive cruise control;control theory;optimal control;fuel efficiency;solver;cruise control	Robotics	55.64183144392893	-12.432020066749876	66894

Inequality constraints on state variables i.e. collision avoidance conditions and mechanical constraints are taken into consideration. The collision avoidance is accomplished by local perturbation of the mobile manipulator motion in the obstacles neighbourhood. The fulfilment of mechanical constraints is ensured by using a penalty function approach. The proposed method guarantees satisfying control limitations resulting from capabilities of robot actuators by applying the trajectory scaling approach. Nonholonomic constraints in a Pfaffian form are explicitly incorporated into the control algorithm. A computer example involving a mobile manipulator consisting of nonholonomic platform (2,0) class and 3DOF RPR type holonomic manipulator operating in a three-dimensional task space is also presented.	fibre channel point-to-point	Grzegorz Pajak;Iwona Pajak	2017	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-016-0390-8	control engineering;simulation;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	63.727444944279924	-21.060439685231895	66940

In order to improve the accuracy of position tracking, we introduce a novel method for constraining Kalman filters by incorporating prior knowledge in an augmented motion model. In contrast to previously reported methods, our approach does not require cumbersome tuning of additional filter parameters and causes less computational overhead. We demonstrate our method in the context of sports analysis in athletics. Using 34 data sets recorded during 400m and 800m runs, we compare our approach to unconstrained and pseudo-measurement filters. The presented augmented motion model in conjunction with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) reduced the root mean square error of the filtered output by 60% compared to unconstrained filtering and by 50% compared to a pseudo-measurement EKF.	automotive navigation system;computation;extended kalman filter;mean squared error;overhead (computing);performance tuning;pseudo-spectral method;robot control;robustness (computer science)	Thomas Kautz;Benjamin H.

This paper presents a partial solution to the problem of tting a hand to an object in a given environment. Information provided by a set of ngertip contact regions or by a grasp prototype is exploited to e ciently compute the space of wrist con gurations from which the grasp speci cations can be met. The size and shape of this solution space re ect the constraints imposed by the environment geometry; they can be used to compare a grasp to others or to resolve grasp symmetries (e.g. in a wrap grasp of a cylinder). A quality metric computed over the solution space can be used to optimize a grasp. The paper describes a general method for computing this solution space, and presents a parallel implementation. Examples demonstrate grasp comparison and symmetry resolution.	cylinder seal;feasible region;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;prototype;robot	Nancy S.

While there exist techniques for planning motions of rigid bodies in rolling contact under nominal conditions, an inescapable challenge is the design of robust controllers of provable performance in the presence of model perturbations. As a preliminary step in this direction, we present in this paper an iterative robust planner of arbitrary accuracy for the plateball manipulation system subject to perturbations on the sphere radius. The basic tool is an exact geometric planner for the nominal system, whose repeated application guarantees the desired robustness property on the basis of the Iterative Steering paradigm. Simulation results under perturbed conditions show the effectiveness of the method.	algorithm;arbitrary-precision arithmetic;business continuity;computation;existential quantification;iterative method;linear programming relaxation;motion planning;optimal control;programming paradigm;provable security;scott continuity;simulation	Giuseppe Oriolo;Marilena Vendittelli;Alessia Marigo;Antonio Bicchi	2003		10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1242079	robust control;control engineering;rigid body;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory;motion planning	Robotics	63.92324555002706	-20.239519783896416	67163

A sliding mode technique is used to develop the hierarchical robust control. The control strategy consists of controlling the last joint by assuming that the remaining joints follow their desired trajectories. Then by following the same strategy, we go backward for the (n-1)-th joint, and so on until the first joint. The inverse kinematic problem is solved by the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobean. The asymptotical stability is proved using Lyapunov theory. This algorithm was experimented on a four DOF ANAT manipulator and gave effective results and good tracking in the robot's workspace.	algorithm;asymptote;control theory;inverse kinematics;lyapunov fractal;robust control;self-reconfiguring modular robot;workspace	Raouf Fareh;Mohamad Saad;Maarouf Saad	2012	2012 25th IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)	10.1109/CCECE.2012.6334838	robust control;control engineering;kinematics;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;trajectory;inverse kinematics;control theory;robot kinematics	Robotics	66.09190955267776	-18.844488861774	67243

However, in many situations, it is not feasible or easy to obtain an accurate analytic model of the robot's dynamics. An alternative to analytically deriving the dynamics is learning the dynamics from movement data. This paper describes a load estimation technique that uses the learned instead of analytically derived dynamics. We study examples where the various inertial parameters of the load are estimated from the learned models, their effectiveness in control is evaluated along with their robustness in light of imperfect, intermediate dynamic models.	control theory;glossary of computer graphics;robot	Georgios Petkos;Sethu Vijayakumar	2007	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2007.4399373	control engineering;simulation;adaptive control;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	66.77182579905762	-16.910518079895034	67696

An impedance filter is used to define the desired admittance of the system under the torsion bar (T-bar), and a position tracking control loop is used to enforce its apparent admittance. A road feedback path implemented with a road feedback filter provides the driver with awareness of road conditions with selected frequency components and magnitudes. In this new control framework, the base admittance of the system under the T-bar, which determines the base steering feel, can be configured independently from the closed position control loop; such separation of the closed-loop control design and steering feel configuration can potentially reduce the overall system tuning and calibration time. Common EPS characteristics are related to the design parameters of the new control framework. Numerical cosimulations, including an EPS system model and a vehicle model under different road conditions and maneuvers, show that the base steering feel matches the designed steering feel, and the system has good road disturbance rejection. With the road feedback filter, the base steering feel is augmented and the road condition awareness is improved.	characteristic impedance;control system;control theory;numerical analysis;rejection sampling;simulation;spectral density;torsion (gastropod)	Tao Yang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2014.2325892	damping;control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical impedance;torque steering;control theory;admittance;torque	Robotics	67.30872551627914	-13.130469496887132	68007

It is expected, among other capabilities, that the joints vary with constant velocities during the execution of those tasks which in a nonredundant manipulator require variable joint velocities. In this way, motion becomes more precise because of the elimination of errors associated with velocity change in joints. In this paper, it is shown that this expected advantage is not possible for all the joints, and that only as many joints as the degree of redundancy can have constant velocities.	circuit complexity;robot;velocity (software development)	Ahmad Hemami	1990	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574700007335	joint;computer science;artificial intelligence;manipulator;velocity;robotics;engineering drawing	Robotics	64.08720290071933	-21.16173867350673	68019

A modified sliding mode controller or u0027SATu0027 is used to handle the uncertainties and enhance the system performance, under various disturbance conditions. The new sliding mode control compensates the influence of dynamics and chattering phenomena on the system response. It also improves the robustness of the reaching phase of the modified sliding mode control. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers is demonstrated through digital simulation studies using MATLAB/SIMULINK software package. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller contribute appreciably towards improving the damping behaviour of the VSC-HVDC system under various disturbances compare to conventional PI and IMC-based PI controller.	shadow copy	Niranjan Nayak;Tanmoy Parida;Pravat K.

e013526f9010e429e7fdf1598613ae8e5501d2a9	developing a platoon-wide eco-cooperative adaptive cruise control (cacc) system		Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology has become increasingly popular. As an example, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems are of high interest, allowing CAVs to communicate and cooperate with each other to form platoons, where one vehicle follows another with a predefined spacing or time gap. Although numerous studies have been conducted on CACC systems, very few have examined the protocols from the perspective of environmental sustainability, not to mention from a platoon-wide consideration. In this study, we propose a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication based Eco-CACC system, aiming to minimize the platoon-wide energy consumption and pollutant emissions at different stages of the CACC operation. A full spectrum of environmentally-friendly CACC maneuvers are explored and the associated protocols are developed, including sequence determination, gap closing and opening, platoon cruising with gap regulation, and platoon joining and splitting. Simulation studies of different scenarios are conducted using MATLAB/Simulink. Compared to an existing CACC system, the proposed one can achieve additional 2% energy savings and additional 17% pollutant emissions reductions during the platoon joining scenario.	closing (morphology);computer aided verification;matlab;platoon (automobile);simulation;simulink;vehicle-to-vehicle	Ziran Wang;Guoyuan Wu;Peng Hao;Kanok Boriboonsomsin;Matthew J.

The stability is proved by using the Lyapunov function. The tracking errors asymptotically converge to zero according to the Barbalat lemma. The tracking performance is specified by a reference model, the convergence rate of Lyapunov function is specified by the matrix Q and the control action and the state weighting are restricted by the matrix Γ. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control. The maximum errors of the position and velocity with the integral action are reduced from 0.4 V and 1.5 V to 0.2 V and 0.4 V, respectively. The adaptive control with the integral action gives satisfactory performance, even when it suffers from input disturbance.	adaptive filter;arabic numeral 0;block cipher mode of operation;control system;controllers;converge;encoder device component;farkas' lemma;feedback;labview;lyapunov fractal;mental suffering;rate of convergence;reference model;rotary woofer;skin sensation disturbance;tachometer device component;the matrix;velocity (software development);sensor (device)	Guoqiang Wu;Shunan Wu;Yu-Guang Bai;Lei Liu	2013		10.3390/s130404742	control engineering;embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;suicide prevention;electrical engineering;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;forensic engineering	Robotics	66.86210472001427	-10.133229431093547	69168

Under a gradient-based control law for the agents, we prove local asymptotic convergence of the cycle-free persistent formation to the desired formation based on cascade system stability theory.

7669ed92b5021073ba7c6d3e8ffa8f9a1fed3ca3	sensor setups for state and wind estimation for airborne wind energy converters		An unscented Kalman filter with joint state and parameter estimation is proposed for aerodynamics, states and wind conditions for airborne wind energy converters. The proposed estimator relies on different measurement setups. Due to the strict economic constraints of wind energy converters, the sensor setups are chosen with minimal cost and reliability issues in mind. Simulation data with a high fidelity system model and experimental tests using flight data, together with wind measurements obtained using a lidar system for altitude wind measurements, are used for validation. The data was obtained during test flights of the EnerKíte EK30, an airborne wind energy converter currently in research operation in Brandenburg, Germany. Feasible accuracies were achieved even with the simplest of setups and illustrate the gain achievable by airborne sensors.

Unlike conventional roadmaps, which include position information only, the proposed roadmap also includes velocity information. Each node of the proposed roadmap consists of a fixed position and a range of velocity values, where the velocity ranges are determined by variable-resolution partitioning of the velocity space. An ordered pair of nodes is connected by a directed link if any combination of their velocity values is within the acceptable range of the nodes and produces a trajectory satisfying a set of safety constraints. In this manner, a possible trajectory connecting an arbitrary starting node and destination node is obtained by applying a graph search technique on the proposed roadmap. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations.	algorithm;autonomous robot;computer simulation;experiment;graph traversal;mobile robot;motion planning;ordered pair;plan;simulation;state space;velocity (software development)	Jingyu Xiang;Yuichi Tazaki;Tatsuya Suzuki;Blaine Levedahl	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2012.6491075	control engineering;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;mathematics	Robotics	54.20868232269988	-23.784498748658702	69506

However, the presence of large time-varying delay due to the additional modules integrated with the catalyst in the lean-burn engines is the primary limiting factor in the control of AFR. In this paper, the engine dynamics are rendered into a nonminimum phase system using Padé approximation. A novel systematic approach is presented to design a parameter-varying dynamic sliding manifold to compensate for the instability of the internal dynamics while achieving desired output tracking performance. A second-order sliding mode strategy is developed to control the AFR to remove the effects of time-varying delay, canister purge disturbance, and measurement noise. The chattering-free response of the proposed controller is compared with conventional dynamic sliding mode control. The results of applying the proposed method to the experimental data demonstrate improved closed-loop system responses for various operating conditions.	alternate frame rendering;annualized failure rate;approximation;approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);control system;control theory;controller (computing);embedded system;image noise;instability;kerrison predictor;mathematical model;minimum phase;padé approximant;roland gs;smith predictor;system dynamics;testbed	Behrouz Ebrahimi;Reza Tafreshi;Javad Mohammadpour;Matthew A.

This paper presents the implementation of an automatic take-off algorithm as a system automation module of the auto flight system. Based on a phase-breakdown of take-off, the implementation features a state machine that covers the procedure of the maneuver and the transition conditions from one phase to another. Through this state machine, the automatic take-off algorithm enables controller modules of the auto flight system and provides corresponding commands for the conduct of take-off.

Nevertheless, the sharing of the vehicle control with the driver, especially for the steering assistances, is an open issue. The rear wheels steering could be an answer to this question. This study contains the development of a control law for the rear steering able to provide lane departure avoidance and lane keeping. The design of the control law is casted as a LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) optimization problem in order to take into account constraints, as the rear steering actuator limitation. A modulation factor is added to allow a flexible activation strategy of the rear steering assistance.

The proposed robust controller consists of a nominal linear time-invariant controller and a robust compensator for pitch, roll, and yaw subsystems. The nominal controller is an inner-outer loop structure of PI+PID (proportional-integral plus proportional-integral-derivative) control method to achieve the desired tracking of the nominal system, whilst the robust compensator is added to restrain the influence of the uncertainties (equivalent disturbances) which contain parametric uncertainties, coupling, nonlinear dynamics, and external disturbances. The real-time experimental results on the hexarotor demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in real flight condition and finally, the attitude tracking errors are proven to be ultimately bounded with specified boundaries.	aerial photography;linear system;linear time-invariant theory;nonlinear system;pitch (music);real-time clock;time complexity;time-invariant system;while;yaws	Dafizal Derawi;Nurul Dayana Salim;Hairi Zamzuri;Hao Liu;Mohd Azizi Abdul Rahman;Saiful Amri Mazlan	2014	2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2014.6943241	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.56881637652883	-12.179798169320259	70583

The Treadport active wind tunnel (TPAWT) is thus created in order to produce air flow patterns that allow a variety of wind angles and speeds to be felt by the user. In order to control this system in real-time, the small gain theorem is used in conjunction with a dynamic extension to formulate an output feedback control law. Examples of controller formulations are derived and discrete time simulations in FLUENT demonstrate their effectiveness. The controller is then validated experimentally using a scale model of the TPAWT.	block cipher mode of operation;control theory;experiment;feedback;haptic technology;optimal control;real-time clock;simulation;treadport active wind tunnel;virtual reality;vortex	Sandip D.

It is a 6-degree-of-freedom rigid Stewart manipulator, in which one platform (the end-effector) should be controlled to track-desired trajectory when another platform (denoted as the base) is moving. Driving force analysis of the SAS is the basis for selecting rational servomotors and guaranteeing the dynamic performance, which will affect the terminal pose accuracy of the FAST. In order to determine the driving forces of the SAS, using the Newton-Euler method, the inverse dynamics of the Stewart manipulator is modeled by considering the motion of the base. Compared with the traditional dynamic models, the inverse dynamic model introduced here possesses an inherent wider application range. By adopting the kinematic and dynamic parameters of the FAST prototype, the driving force analysis of the SAS is carried out, and the driving force optimization strategies are proposed. Calculation and analysis presented in the paper reveal that there are three main factors affecting the driving forces of the SAS. In addition, the driving force analysis of this paper lays out guidelines for the design and control of the FAST prototype, as well as the structure and trajectory optimization.

The model developed is deterministic and assumes the availability of real-time information and historical data of the system. Stochastic effects are disturbances to be compensated by the feedback nature of the control. The objective is to minimize total user delay, which is modeled by a nonconvex cost function and nonlinear constraints. To efficiently solve the problem, simplifications of the original model are introduced, together with an iterative quadratic programming (IQP) optimization procedure. A numerical example illustrates the application of the method, indicating its feasibility for real-time applications and the good approximation of the global optimum provided by the heuristic solution.	agent-based model;approximation;brute-force search;bus (computing);computation;computational complexity theory;deterministic algorithm;genetic algorithm;global optimization;heuristic (computer science);iteration;iterative method;line level;loss function;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;performance;quadratic programming;real-time clock;real-time data;simulation	Luiz Alberto Koehler;Werner Kraus;Eduardo Camponogara	2011	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2011.2164909	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;feedback;mathematics;quadratic programming	Robotics	55.374563384396225	-12.402520396652847	71045

Our approach combines a Modified Selectively Damped Least Squares (MSDLS) and Jacobian Transpose (JT) methods. The main advantages of this method with respect to the ordinary SDLS are: optimal Cartesian increment, shorter computation time and better response near singularity configurations. The original JT method exhibits a strong shattering with small magnitudes which occurs near the goal position or in the case of unreachable positions. Like in the SDLS, a damping factor was applied to each input singular vector to filter the undesirable behavior. A comparative study between the MSDLS applied to the inverse Jacobian and JT matrix is developed to investigate manipulator performance in critical end-point positions of the index finger of a commercial anthropomorphic robotic hand and also to evaluate the impact of the increment length on computation time.	c++;cartesian closed category;computation;damping factor;horner's method;inverse kinematics;jt (visualization format);jacobian matrix and determinant;least squares;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;redundancy (engineering);robot;time complexity;unreachable memory	Choukri Bensalah;Mohamed Abderrahim;Juan González-Gómez	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181470	damping;robot;control engineering;database index;mathematical optimization;kinematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;trajectory;comparative research;inverse kinematics;vibration control;control theory;mathematics;least squares	Robotics	67.88328233527734	-20.549313091773186	71326
fa42b091cd05ae7877772a971417cb4825da328d	physically plausible wrench decomposition for multieffector object manipulation		When manipulating an object with multiple effectors such as in multidigit grasping or multiagent collaboration, forces and torques (i.e., wrench) applied to the object at different contact points generally do not fully contribute to the resultant object wrench, but partly compensate each other. The current literature, however, lacks a physically plausible decomposition of the applied wrench into its manipulation and internal components. We formulate the wrench decomposition as a convex optimization problem, minimizing the Euclidean norms of manipulation forces and torques. Physical plausibility in the optimization solution is ensured by constraining the internal and manipulation wrench by the applied wrench. We analyze specific cases of three-fingered grasping and 2-D beam manipulation, and show the applicability of our method to general object manipulation with multiple effectors. The wrench decomposition method is then extended to quantification of measures that are important in evaluating physical human–human and human–robot interaction tasks. We validate our approach via comparison to the state of the art in simulation and via application to a human–human object transport study.

This problem seems to be more difficult when big or very long pieces are manipulated in cluttered and occupied environments. Moreover, the computational effort increases if the necessary path resolution is very high. The developed algorithm is based on the c-space technique. Different robot models are used for rapid c-spaces computation. Each one for different parts of a typical pick and place task. The algorithm selectively uses these global or local c-spaces. This strategy leads to fast global c-space computation without a considerable loss of free-space caused by the simplified robot model, and to quasi real-time local c-space computation. The paths searching in the computed c-spaces can be performed by several techniques: cell (cube) mapping, octree, and slice, which are rule-base selected in an adequate way. Finally, the results of the algorithm implementation in several real robots are presented.		Carlos Balaguer;Antonio Barrientos;Francisco José Rodríguez;Rafael Aracil;Eugenio Andrés Puente;U.

0e7f03d832f520fa597a4ea7353364a95e59977f	dynamic walking on randomly-varying discrete terrain with one-step preview		An inspiration for developing a bipedal walking system is the ability to navigate rough terrain with discrete footholds like stepping stones. In this paper, we present a novel methodology to overcome the problem of dynamic walking over stepping stones with significant random changes to step length and step height at each step. Using a 2-step gait optimization, we not only consider the desired location of the next footstep but also the current configuration of the robot, thereby resolving the problem of step transition when we switch between different walking gaits. We then use gait interpolation to generate the desired walking gait in real-time. We demonstrate the method on a planar dynamical walking model of ATRIAS, an underactuated bipedal robot walking over a randomly generated stepping stones with step length and step height changing in the range of [30:80] (cm) and [30:30] (cm) respectively. Experimental validation on the real robot was also successful for the problem of dynamic walking on stepping stones with step lengths varied within [23:78] (cm) and average walking speed of 0.6 (m/s).	atrias;dynamical system;initial condition;interpolation;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;network switch;precomputation;procedural generation;randomness;real-time clock;real-time locating system;stepping level;underactuation	Quan Nguyen;Ayush Agrawal;Xingye Da;William C.

In this study, a linear active disturbance rejection control approach is proposed. The model perturbation is estimated by the extended state observer, and then the error of closed-loop system is compensated by the conventional PD control. Furthermore, a reduced-order observer is introduced to reduce the phase lag and lessen the feedback gains. The approach is employed to a hypersonic near space vehicle autopilot. The numeral simulations show that the proposed approach has a good performance on frequency domain and time domain, the angle of attack command is tracked very well, and the controller parameters are easy to be determined.	autopilot;feedback;pid;performance;rejection sampling;simulation;time series	Hui Li;Zhide Yin;Yu Fan;Fengyi Li;Chuang Song	2015	2015 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS)	10.1109/ICCAIS.2015.7338714	robust control;control engineering;vehicle dynamics;simulation;aerodynamics;engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.12025050583962	-14.220473771582393	72212

A car-like robot is difficult to control due to the nonholonomic constraints. In this paper, a path planning algorithm based on the slice projection technique, optimized particularly for car-parking is proposed. Collision-free region of a nonholonomic motion can be easily computed by using the slice projection technique. Sufficient collision-free, nonholonomic feasible paths can be directly obtained by computing reachable regions by using the slice projection technique for nonholonomic motions from the initial pose. The proposed planning scheme provide not a single solution, but a candidate solution set. Therefore, the parking path can be easily optimized with respect to performance criteria such as safety, maneuvering, and so on. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed scheme provides various practical solutions.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;automatic parking;motion planning;simulation	Dal Hyung Kim;Woojin Chung	2008	2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2008.4650938	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;motion planning	Robotics	60.263036264672635	-21.88875266346771	72393

The conic-shaped angular FOVs impose sensing limitations on every agent in the network. To increase the sensing capability of agents and preserve network connectivity, the FOV of every agent rotates with a sufficiently fast angular velocity. The problem is formulated in the framework of distributed switched nonlinear systems to address the switching topology of the network. Potential-based control inputs are subsequently designed as a combination of alignment and attractive/repulsive forces, such that the velocity vector of each agent exponentially reaches a certain neighborhood of a given desired velocity vector and the inter-agent collision is avoided. The efficacy of the proposed control strategy is confirmed by the simulation results.	angularjs;control theory;flocking (behavior);multi-agent system;nonlinear system;optical flow;potential method;sensor;simulation;velocity (software development)	Mohammad Mehdi Asadi;Amir G.

The center is assumed to be known to only some vehicles. The proposed controller does not require any communication and only uses local measurements based on a sensor graph of which the topology is modeled by a directed graph satisfying a certain acyclic condition.

The solutions may be optimized on a criterion function or on physical constraints, such as obstacle avoidance. Stability and convergence of the method are shown. Although its convergence rate is only about half that of Newton's method, the advantage of the method is that it remains easily tractable close to the singular configurations of the manipulator. A hybrid method combining the Jacobian transpose and Newton's methods is proposed. Results of the application of the method on a 10-link manipulator in 2-D space are shown. >	algorithm;inverse kinematics	Hari Das;Jean-Jacques E. Slotine;Thomas B.

a1220573780dc86ae187e866d8fdda071a87b00c	analytical inverse kinematics solver for anthropomorphic 7-dof redundant manipulators with human-like configuration constraints	human-like motion;inverse kinematics;redundancy resolution;correspondance problem	It is a common belief that service robots shall move in a human-like manner to enable natural and convenient interaction with a human user or collaborator. In particular, this applies to anthropomorphic 7-DOF redundant robot manipulators that have a shoulder-elbow-wrist configuration. On the kinematic level, human-like movement then can be realized by means of selecting a redundancy resolution for the inverse kinematics (IK), which realizes human-like movement through respective nullspace preferences. In this paper, key positions are introduced and defined as Cartesian positions of the manipulator’s elbow and wrist joints. The key positions are used as constraints on the inverse kinematics in addition to orientation constraints at the end-effector, such that the inverse kinematics can be calculated through an efficient analytical scheme and realizes human-like configurations. To obtain suitable key positions, a correspondence method named wrist-elbow-in-line is derived to map key positions of human demonstrations to the real robot for obtaining a valid analytical inverse kinematics solution. A human demonstration tracking experiment is conducted to evaluate the end-effector accuracy and human-likeness of the generated motion for a 7-DOF Kuka-LWR arm. The results are compared to a similar correspondance method that emphasizes only the wrist postion and show that the subtle differences between the two different correspondence methods may lead to significant performance differences. Furthermore, the wrist-elbow-in-line method is validated as more stable in practical application and extended for obstacle avoidance.	inverse kinematics;solver	Weihui Liu;Diansheng Chen;Jochen J.

In this paper, we present the instantaneous leg extension model of Virtual Slope Walking to analyze the essentials of Virtual Slope Walking. It has two straight massless legs and a point mass body at the hip. The stance leg is extended instantaneously while the swing leg is swung and shortened actively. We demonstrate that this model can exhibit stable walking cycles on level ground. We obtain the sufficient conditions for the existence of the fixed point. We then illustrate the effect of the model parameters on the fixed point to show how the fixed point can be determined by adjusting the parameters. Further, we theoretically proved that the fixed point is asymptotically stable, meaning that it is independent on the initial conditions.

With the rolling motion, it is possible for a humanoid robot to change lying state and adapt itself to the environmental uncertainties. The study of rolling motion for humanoid robots is fairly rare. This paper proposed a highly dynamic whole-body rolling motion. The planned rolling motion trajectories were based on the motion of human rolling, and meet the constraints of dynamic stability and multi-points contact conditions. The trajectory of the center of mass (CoM) and environmental constraints were calculated by dividing whole-body motion into upper and lower body movement. The effectiveness of proposed method was confirmed by dynamic simulation on a virtual humanoid robot.	aperiodic graph;humanoid robot;poor posture;simulation	Dacheng Yu;Zhangguo Yu;Xi Fang;Siyu Lei;Xuechao Chen;Qiang Huang;Libo Meng;Qinqin Zhou;Weimin Zhang;Jianda Han	2016	2016 International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)	10.1109/ICARM.2016.7606911	control engineering;simulation;engineering;humanoid robot;control theory	Robotics	65.24070134659559	-23.477853281902185	73206

The paths chosen are straight lines and arcs of circles. When reversing, the truck and trailer under examination can be modeled as an unstable nonlinear system with state and input saturations. The simplified goal of stabilizing along a trajectory (instead of a point) allows us to consider a system with controllable linearization. Still, the combination of instability and saturations makes the task impossible with a single controller. In fact, the system cannot be driven backward from all initial states because of the jack-knife effects between the parts of the multibody vehicle; it is sometimes necessary to drive forward to enter into a specific region of attraction. This leads to the use of hybrid controllers. The scheme has been implemented and successfully used to reverse the radio-controlled vehicle.	feedback;reversing: secrets of reverse engineering	Claudio Altafini;Alberto Speranzon;Bo Wahlberg	2001	IEEE Trans.

A simple nonlinear proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control is proposed by adding a nonlinear proportional and derivative term to the commonly used PID controller. Lyapunov's stability theory and geometric homogeneity technique are employed to prove global finite-time stability. Advantages of the proposed control include the absence of modelling information in the control law formulation and the global finite-time stability featuring fast transient and high-precision positioning. Explicit conditions on the controller parameters to ensure global finite-time regulation stability are obtained. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and the improved performances of the proposed approach.	pid;robot	Yuxin Su;Chunhong Zheng	2017	Int. J.

In the altitude loop, the backstepping strategy is applied, where the virtual control inputs about flight-path angle and attack angle are designed step by step. In order to avoid the inaccurately direct cancelation of elevator-to-lift coupling when aerodynamic parameters are uncertain, the real control inputs, that is, elevator deflection and canard deflection, are linearly converted into the equivalent control inputs which are designed independently.The reformulation of the altitude-flight-path angle dynamics and the attack angle-pitch rate dynamics is constructed into interconnection subsystems with input-to-state stability via small-gain theorem. For the velocity loop, the dynamic inversion controller is designed. The adaptive approach is used to identify the uncertain aerodynamic parameters.

In this model, a biped robot is simplified to a three-link system, and each link has a point mass. The three links, which represent the trunk and two legs of the robot, are connected at the hip. When the biped robot walks on a level ground, the heights of three point masses are kept constant and the supporting ankle torque is kept zero. With some initial restrictions, the trajectories of hip and two feet can be calculated and the angle values of the biped robot's joints can be gotten. This model has been applied to an actual biped robot.

The offline simulation demonstrates that the modified trajectory suppresses tracking error and excessive bank angles during path-tracking flight.

Heterogeneity in the group of evaders is expressed as heterogeneity in the individual maximum speeds. The goal of the pursuer is to capture a single evader in minimum time. The goal of each individual evader is to avoid capture or else to delay capture for as long as possible. Two cases of sensing among agents are considered: global (all-to-all) sensing, and local (radius-limited) sensing. We present pursuer strategies for optimal target selection that achieve bounded capture time. We propose evasion strategies and prove conditions under which they guarantee capture avoidance. In the case of local sensing, our strategy of evader risk reduction leads to aggregation of the evaders where the slowest evader in a group is the only member with a risk of capture. Our results provide insight into the dynamics of aggregation.	evasion (network security);mathematical model	William Scott;Naomi Ehrich Leonard	2014	53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2014.7039838	simulation	Robotics	57.599502944786536	-21.929610063691488	73902

We adapt the CVT framework to multi-agent motion planning by adding an extra time dimension and optimize the trajectories of the agents in the augmented domain. As an optimization framework, our method can work naturally on complex regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in achieving maximal clearance in motion planning with some examples.	algorithm;approximation;centroidal voronoi tessellation;mathematical optimization;maximal set;motion planning;multi-agent system;robot;robustness (computer science);sampling (signal processing)	Liping Zheng;Yi-King Choi;Xiaoping Liu;Wenping Wang	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980551	computer vision;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;motion planning	Robotics	58.98064374654897	-22.422898584881903	74043

These systems are referred to as mixed non-holonomic systems. The motion of such systems is governed by both the non-holonomic constraints acting on the system and a system of differential equations constraining the evolution of generalized momentum. We propose a method that utilizes both governing motions, that is, satisfying all the constraints and instantaneously conserving momentum along un-restricted directions, to generate gaits for systems like the snakeboard, which belongs to the family of mixed non-holonomic systems. We accomplish this by defining a new scaled momentum variable. This scaled momentum allows us to easily explore the design of gaits that causes momentum to evolve such that a desired non-trivial motion results	constant function;dynamical system;gait analysis;geometric phase;regular language description for xml;velocity (software development)	Elie A.

Researches on the minimum-time trajectory planning and control based on the dynamic constraints assume the availability of full dynamics of robots. However, the dynamic equation of robot may not often be exactly known. In this case, the kinematic approach for the minimum-time trajectory planning is more meaningful. We also have to construct a controller to track precisely the minimum-time trajectory. But, finding a proper controller is also difficult if we do not know the explicit dynamic equations of a robot.This paper describes an optimization of trajectory planning based on a kinematic approach using the evolution strategy (ES), as well as an optimization of a sliding mode tracking controller using ES for a robot without dynamic equations.	automated planning and scheduling;evolution strategy;robot	Young-Kiu Choi;Jin-Hyun Park;Hyun-Sik Kim;Jung Hwan Kim	2000	Robotica		control engineering;trajectory optimization;simulation;sliding mode control;computer science;engineering;control theory;evolution strategy	Robotics	63.17556987607696	-20.230427850156797	74464

Among the several techniques adopted for the same purpose, potential field force  (PFF) is the most widely accepted and reliable strategy. However, the technique is impregnated with the drawback concerning  “Local Minima”. The aim of this paper is to present an algorithm that obviously survives the limitations posed by PFF which  has been taken care efficiently with the help of reinforcement of a virtual attractive force that makes the resultant force  parallel to the boundary of the obstacle. The algorithm also includes the speed control mechanism of the robot. Computational  complexity of the given algorithm is also provided. Simulations results are presented that prove the effectiveness of the  proposed method. The algorithm has been tested on an indoor mobile robotic platform.    	algorithm;autonomous robot;mobile robot;motion planning	Soumic Sarkar;Sankar Nath Shome;S.

In contrast to other works that study this problem, we are interested in developing a pursuit strategy that doesn't require continuous, or even periodic, information about the position of the evader. To this end, we propose a self-triggered control strategy such that the pursuer can autonomously decide, based on out-dated information, when new samples of the evader's position is required in order to satisfy desired performance metrics. Our proposed algorithm guarantees capture of the evader in finite time with a finite number of sporadic updates without sacrificing any performance in terms of guaranteed time to capture as compared to classic algorithms that assume continuous information is available at all times.

Here we follow this approach to learn to engage a transmission clutch, with the aim of obtaining a rapid and smooth engagement, with a small torque loss. Using an approximated model of a wet clutch, which simulates a portion of the whole engagement, we first learn an open loop control signal, which is then transferred on the actual wet clutch, and improved by further learning with a different reward function, based on the actual torque loss observed.	approximation algorithm;experiment;iteration;rl (complexity);reinforcement learning;simulation	Kevin Van Vaerenbergh;Abdel Rodríguez;Matteo Gagliolo;Peter Vrancx;Ann Nowé;Julian Stoev;Stijn Goossens;Gregory Pinte;Wim Symens	2012	The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252825	open-loop controller;simulation;artificial intelligence;control theory;torque;clutch	Robotics	62.372775868448414	-23.86422239392091	74756

Each robot is controlled to track its desired trajectory, while synchronized its motion with the two neighboring robots. A novel dynamic model of the wheeled mobile robot is derived based on Lagrange method. The Lagrange multipliers of the robot are determined based on the input torques and the robot's velocities. The dynamic model is divided into translational and rotational model. A saturated synchronous translational controller is proposed to guarantee the asymptotic stability of both position and synchronization errors. A rotational controller is developed such that each robot always oriented towards its desired position. A simulation results verified the efficiency of the proposed saturated synchronous controller in the formation tasks.	lagrange multiplier;mathematical model;mobile robot;motion planning;simulation	Ibrahim M.

This paper proposes the use of multiple controllers for a FTC system of an induction motor drive, selected based on a switching mechanism. The system switches between sensor vector control, sensorless vector control, closed-loop voltage by frequency (V/f) control and open loop V/f control. Vector control offers high performance, while V/f is a simple, low cost strategy with high speed and satisfactory performance. The faults dealt with are speed sensor failures, stator winding open circuits, shorts and minimum voltage faults. In the event of compound faults, a protection unit halts motor operation. The faults are detected using a wavelet index. For the sensorless vector control, a novel Boosted Model Reference Adaptive System (BMRAS) to estimate the motor speed is presented, which reduces tuning time. Both simulation results and experimental results with an induction motor drive show the scheme to be a fast and effective one for fault detection, while the control methods transition smoothly and ensure the effectiveness of the FTC system. The system is also shown to be flexible, reverting rapidly back to the dominant controller if the motor returns to a healthy state.	adaptive system;control system;controllers;fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;flatulence;intrinsic drive;mathematical induction;network switch;propagation delay;r.o.t.o.r.;sensor;simulation;smoothing;switch device component;united states federal trade commission;wavelet;voltage	Khalaf Salloum Gaeid;Wooi Ping Hew;Mustafa Khalid;Ammar Masaoud	2012		10.3390/s120404031	control engineering;wavelet;embedded system;telecommunications;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory;induction motor;vector control;statistics	Robotics	57.18156361056174	-9.925640444770048	75071

The necessity for investigation in this field arises from the increasing demands in terms of safety within in the industry. Should the industrial hoist feature too high deceleration this can lead to overstressing of the hoist mechanism and structure, further, damaging of the load due to large dynamical forces. Furthermore, too low deceleration can lead to incompliance with industrial standards and thus being a safety issue, due to potential loss of load in the worst case. Till this day various solutions and devices have been proposed to achieve controlled deceleration of the industrial hoist braking. However, there still lies a necessity for deeper study into this problem, to achieve quicker response towards the desired behavior of the hoist deceleration as well as improved adherence with the desired behavior. Thus, this paper analyses the potentials of hoist deceleration control by neural network architectures as such the linear, quadratic and cubic neural units with real-time recurrent learning and back-propagation through time approach when real measured data are used for experimental analysis.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation through time;best, worst and average case;cubic function;javascript syntax;mathematical optimization;real-time clock;simulation;software propagation;teaching method	Peter Benes;Ivo Bukovsky	2014	2014 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889831	simulation	Robotics	61.64816381692822	-11.134646714434746	75161

At the same time, nonlinearity of constraints compels the numerical solution of optimization problem. Therefore, a number of intelligent algorithms to overcome nonlinear optimization of the cost function is reviewed, however, their time consuming computations are considered as a dominant limitation. Meantime, due to its remarkable advantages, the motion control of Omni-directional mobile robot is handled by design of NMPC scheme. Furthermore, a novel kinematic model for the application of mobile robot is represented. As a demonstration for the proposed model, simulation results show that settling time is reduced 22% in comparison with ideal kinematic model and also the performance of the suggested control strategy shows its effectiveness in presence of disturbance and noise in all environments.	algorithm;computation;control theory;display lag;input lag;loss function;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical partial differential equations;optimization problem;settling time;simulation	Mahdi Zarghami;Ahmad Fakharian;Amin Ganjali Poudeh;Aras Adhami-Mirhosseini	2014	2014 13th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)	10.1109/ICARCV.2014.7064517	control engineering;mobile robot;kinematics;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;trajectory;inverse kinematics;mathematical model;control theory;robot kinematics	Robotics	63.80163924532749	-13.671634963777462	75319

Most of biped walking control methods based on point-contact assume that foot-contact is completely inelastic collision and it occurs for a moment. Thus, it is difficult to realize biped walking when the assumptions are not satisfied. In order to solve this problem, we propose a three-dimensional biped walking control using a double support phase based on Passive Dynamic Autonomous Control (PDAC) that is one of point-contact methods. By use of the double support phase, the robot dynamics converges to stable orbit even if a disturbance happens at a foot-contact. Also, this paper introduces an adaptation control method of the PDAC constants that facilitates stabilization. Finally, the proposed biped walking algorithm is verified by numerical simulation.	algorithm;computer simulation	Tadayoshi Aoyama;Kousuke Sekiyama;Yasuhisa Hasegawa;Toshio Fukuda	2011	2011 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science	10.1109/MHS.2011.6102216	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.46190731741021	-17.400359984990793	75374

Such scheme is based on a continuous approximation of the LuGre friction model, developed so as to allow complete Lyapunov stability analyses without resorting to assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in practice due to their physical meaning. By using adaptive estimation, extensive identification procedures are also avoided for determining friction parameters.

We solve the exact tracking control problem for both the 3-D position of the robot (either absolute or with respect to the platform) and the tension along the link. To achieve this goal, we prove some fundamental system properties, useful to design a nonlinear controller, such as differential flatness and dynamic feedback linearizability. To close the control loop, a set of minimal and standard sensors is proposed. Then, we show that it is possible to retrieve the full system state from those sensors by means of nonlinear measurements transformations and a bank of low-dimension estimators based on the nonlinear high gain observer. The ability of the proposed observer-controller method is tested by extensive numerical simulations spanning many nonideal conditions.	aerial photography;aerobot;autonomous robot;consensus dynamics;control system;experiment;file spanning;linearizability;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;obstacle avoidance;sensor;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Marco Tognon;Sanket S.

However, a well-known difficulty with the method is that a human will often demonstrate the task to be programmed inconsistently or even erroneously, leading to the inclusion of what is essentially noise in the demonstration. A number of techniques exist in the literature for filtering out this type of noise; however, most focus on very low level control command details. In this paper, we propose a new, complementary direction of research. We take a “task-level” view of the demonstration, and note that noise can exist at this level also. We propose a framework, based on a hybrid dynamic system modeling approach, to select the most optimal, task-level execution strategies that were demonstrated. We apply our framework to a real household task of inserting the compressible spindle of a paper towel holder into its supports. We conduct experiments to show that significant improvements in robot performance of the task can be achieved by a PbD regime that includes our method.

The difficulty of this task lies in the fact that the container is connected to the bridge crane by cables, causing an opening angle while the container is being transported, interfering with the operation at high speeds due to oscillation that occurs at the end point, which could cause accidents. Fuzzy logic is a mathematical theory that aims to allow the modeling of approximate way of thinking, imitating the human ability to make decisions in uncertain and imprecise environments. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models are made of simple processing units, called artificial neurons, which calculate mathematical functions. The aim of the paper was to present a container crane controller pre-project using an artificial neural network type Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) combined with fuzzy logic, referred to as Neuro Fuzzy Network (NFN).

The algorithm combines a particular choice of navigation function with Voronoi partitions. This results not only in obstacle avoidance and motion to the goal, but also in a desirable geographical distribution of the vehicles. Our algorithm is decentralized in that each vehicle needs only to know the position of neigh boring vehicles, but no other inter-vehicle communication or centralized control are required. The algorithm gives a natural priority to safety, goal convergence, and formation keeping, in that (1) collision avoidance is guaranteed under all circumstances, (2) the vehicles will move toward the goal as long as a given optimization problem is feasible, and (3) if prior criteria admit, the vehicles tend to a desirable lattice formation. These theoretical properties are discussed in the paper and the performance of the algorithm is illustrated in simulations with realistic models of twenty all-terrain vehicles. Planned experimental evaluation using customized miniature cars is also briefly described.	algorithm;centralized computing;mathematical optimization;navigation function;obstacle avoidance;optimization problem;simulation;voronoi diagram	Magnus Lindhé;Petter Ögren;Karl Henrik Johansson	2005	Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570372	control engineering;optimization problem;simulation;index term;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;flocking;control theory;obstacle avoidance;swarming	Robotics	57.28265542200868	-21.70682282694796	75945

Theoretically speaking, viability and model predictive control are unquestionably related, but both can quickly lead to untractable numerical problems. We present here a promising approach for the problem of avoiding to fall in the case of legged locomotion that elegantly solves this difficulty. We propose then a brief discussion about what makes this approach successful with respect to the approaches proposed for the other problems where viability is at stake. This paper should be considered therefore mostly as a prospective reflection on the general problem of safe robotic locomotion.	lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;prospective search;robot	Pierre-Brice Wieber	2008	2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2008.4651022	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory;model predictive control	Robotics	63.740867413949346	-14.165639923509715	75981

Unlike most previous neural network observers, the proposed observer uses nonlznear m parameter neural network (NLPNN). Therefore, it can be applied to systems with higher degrees of nonlinearity without any a priori knowledge of system dynamics. The learning rule of the neural network is based on backpropagtion algorithm. Backpropagtion is a well known algorithm which is easy to implement and it has been successfully applied to many engineering problems. However, previous works on backpropagation suffer from the lack of mathematical proof of stability. An e-modification term is also added to guarantee the robustness of the observer. No SPR or any other strong assumption is imposed on the proposed approach. The stability of the recurrent neural network observer is shown by Lyapunov's direct method.

We first provide existence results and compute analytically the cost functional variation. Then we formulate an instantaneous policy, depending only on the density at the exit point. Then we compare three strategies: The instantaneous policy; Random exploration of control space; Steepest decent using numerical expression of gradient. We show that the gradient technique is able to achieve a cost within 10% of random exploration minimum, while keeping the computational cost much lower. On the other side, the instantaneous policy is outperformed by the other two.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;downstream (software development);gradient;gradient descent;mathematical optimization;maximal set;numerical analysis;optimal control;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Maria Laura Delle Monache;Benedetto Piccoli;Francesco Rossi	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525302	mathematical optimization;simulation;optimal control;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;computational model;statistics	ML	60.90203768837981	-18.23441910611797	76297

The controller is implemented on a simple PLC platform with an extra mathematical coprocessor, but is intended for the advanced control of complex processes. The model of the controlled plant is obtained by means of experimental modelling. A special batch-wise algorithm that is based on the Takagi–Sugeno model and uses ‘‘fuzzy instrumental variables’’ technique is described in the paper. Many robustness problems of the classical adaptive approaches can be circumvented to some extent by the proposed batch-wise approach combined with a supervisory mechanism.

To eliminate the influence of geometric changes to the path and to be able to predict the orientation, the proposed method plans rotational paths with respect to a natural local coordinate frame formed by three unit vectors, namely, the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors, defined by the geometry of the path. A motion control strategy is developed to maintain the desired rotational speed or acceleration of the end effector. Examples are presented which show the practicality of the method. >	robot	Chi H.

We formulate this as an optimization problem, in which the kinematic parameters are selected to minimize the total distance between the end-effector frame and each goal frame. The objective function is defined in terms of a class of distance metrics on the rigid body motions that are invariant with respect to choice of fixed reference frame. A main contribution of this article is an explicit expression for the gradient of this objective function with respect to the kinematic parameters. With this analytic gradient, efficient optimization algorithms can now be developed for the design of general spatial mechanisms.

It can be steered by modulating the frequency of the alternating field. We model the swimmer as a unicycle and learn a mapping from frequency to forward speed and turning rate using locally-weighted projection regression. We apply iterative linear quadratic regulation with a receding horizon to track motion primitives that could be used for path following.

Current wall climbing robots in literature overlook statically indeterminate forces, causing an incapability to estimate climbing failure under certain circumstances. Accounting for these forces, robot deformation can be approximated, paving the way for the proposed two-wall climbing approach. During a wall climb, two failure modes, slide and over-torque, are identified to compute feasible climbing region. A hexapod robot is used to verify the proposed technique by climbing between walls with pure friction end effectors.		Xuan Lin;Hari Krishnan;Yao Su;Dennis W.

54ef26132cfa439454817f8c304b115eb505ac0e	a switched ramp-metering controller for freeway traffic systems		Abstract   In the paper a switched controller for freeway traffic systems is proposed. First of all, the Cell Transmission Model, a first-order model commonly used for freeway traffic systems, is described and a switched version of this model is proposed. According to this version, a freeway can be seen as a piece wise-affine system, i.e. a system which switches among different sets of linear difference equations. Then, based on this model, a switched controller is proposed so that different control laws are applied depending on the operation mode of the system. More specifically, the controller computes the current control law depending on the mode of the system and on the probabilities to reach future states, on the basis of a Discrete-Time Markov Chain modelling the state space and the possible transitions among them.	freeway;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability	Antonella Ferrara;Simona Sacone;Silvia Siri	2015		10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.11.160	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Logic	54.23118510856117	-13.28225181217174	76965

However, design of control laws for UAV is complicated and challengeable due to UAV uncertainties, nonlinearity and coupling. This paper proposes a new hybrid controller design scheme, which consists of a backstepping controller and a neural network compensator. The backstepping controller realizes linearization and decoupling of the highly nonlinear and tightly coupled UAV model. For cancelling out uncertainties such as unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances, the neural network compensator is designed to enhance the robustness of flight system. Pseudoinverse method is applied to establish the mapping between moments and multiple control surfaces. Numerical simulation shows that the UAV equipped the hybrid controller has good maneuverability, strong self-learning ability of compensating the unmodeled dynamics and enough robust stability against constraints of actuators.	aerial photography;artificial neural network;audio control surface;babinet–soleil compensator;coupling (computer programming);moore–penrose pseudoinverse;need to know;nonlinear system;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Liwei Qiu;Guoliang Fan;Jianqiang Yi;Wensheng Yu	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.5420545	robust control;remotely operated underwater vehicle;control engineering;vehicle dynamics;simulation;backstepping;computer science;engineering;control theory;artificial neural network;robustness;actuator	Robotics	64.08537315377862	-11.682404666441373	77231

Its most significant merit is that they determine their behavior independently, and cooperate with other robots in order to perform the given tasks. Especially, in DARS, it is essential for each robot to have evolution ability in order to increase the performance of system. In this paper, a schema co-evolutionary algorithm is proposed for the evolution of collective autonomous mobile robots. Each robot exchanges the information, chromosome used in this algorithm, through communication with other robots. Each robot diffuses its chromosome to two or more robots, receives other robot's chromosome and creates new species. Therefore if one robot receives another robot's chromosome, the robot creates new chromosome. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by applying it to cooperative search problem.

The task assignment problem considered here requires that all agents that perform tasks related by a task constraint be able to communicate directly. The problem is motivated by complex military missions where tasks are assigned to various vehicles and tasks must be scheduled to meet constraints between them. This requires communication between vehicles responsible for tasks that are related by constraints. The physically distributed and dynamic nature of such missions combined with unreliable communication motivates algorithms that can perform the required distributed planning. Toward this goal, we introduce a method that assigns tasks under the restrictions imposed by these mission constraints. The new method presented here is a distributed search designed to solve a nonlinear, distributed constrained assignment problem for which a proof of correctness is presented. The method is illustrated on an example involving two unmanned air vehicles and two unmanned ground vehicles.	activity selection problem;addendum;adjacency matrix;algorithm;assignment problem;best, worst and average case;cluster analysis;constraint (mathematics);correctness (computer science);distributed web crawling;matrix multiplication;nonlinear system;numerical aperture;scheduling (computing);surround sound;telecommunications network;the matrix;unmanned aerial vehicle	Justin Jackson;Mariam Faied;Pierre T.

This paper proposes a localization method, which can accommodate communication at a low predefined rate rather than forcing communication each time a measurement is logged. This is achieved without explicitly accumulating past measurements locally at each robot. This capability is necessary to support increasing number of robots in a team, under finite communication and computation resources. The design includes a novel fusion strategy, a consistent estimation method, and a state based initialization method, embedded in a distributed target tracking framework. The design is efficient in terms of computation demand, since it scales linearly with the number of robots. Additionally, the design is efficient in terms of communication demand, since communication is neither required to be synchronized with sensor readings, nor constrained to a specific network topology. The paper validates the proposed approach for its initialization capability, consistency of estimates, and robustness of performance, through several numerical simulations and using a publicly available multi-robot data set.	computation;embedded system;internationalization and localization;login;network topology;numerical analysis;robot;robotic mapping;simulation	Oscar De Silva;George K.

However, the relations between the factors and system performance are not easy to be determined. Usually, more than one system performance characteristic is considered. For determining the settings of factors in a systematical way, we apply Taguchi methods in this paper to design the structure of a fuzzy controller with multiple performance characteristics. A cart-pole system is exemplified to illustrate the design processes. An aggregated performance index is also proposed to measure the response of the cart-pole system. The simulated results showed that the proposed method can find the efficient design for fuzzy controller.	fuzzy concept;software performance testing;taguchi methods	Cheng-Hsiung Chiang;Liang-Hsuan Chen	2006		10.2991/jcis.2006.286	control engineering;control theory;engineering drawing	Robotics	59.322752384379584	-10.693392404335128	77677

Our approach is to treat the linked mobile robots as a multiple degree-of-freedom object, comprising an articulated open kinematic chain, which is being manipulated by pseudo robots (p-robots) at the ground interaction points. Dynamics of the open chain are computed independently of the constraints, thus allowing the same set of equations to be used as the constraint conditions change, and simplifying the addition of multiple robots to the chain. The decoupling achieved through constraining thep-robots facilitates the analysis of kinematic as well as force constraints, not possible with direct analysis. We introduce the idea of a ‘tipping cone’, similar to a standard friction cone, to test whether forces on the robots cause undesired tipping. We have carried out static as well as dynamic analysis for a 2-robot cooperation case. Also, we have demonstrated that introduction of redundant actuation, by an additional third robot, can help in improving the friction requirements. We also present our preliminary ideas for employing this newly designed framework to analyze other interesting multi-body robotic systems.	coupling (computer programming);kinematic chain;mobile robot;requirement	Ashish Deshpande;Jonathan E.

The complexities in this problem of optimal guidance of interceptors launched with high initial heading errors include the more involved physics of a three dimensional missile–target engagement, and those posed by the assumption of a realistic dynamic model such as time-varying missile speed, thrust, drag and mass, besides gravity, and upper bound on the lateral acceleration. The classic, pure proportional navigation law is augmented with a polynomial function of the heading error, and the values of the coefficients of the polynomial are determined using differential evolution (DE). The performance of the proposed DE enhanced guidance law is compared against the existing conventional laws in the literature, on the criteria of time and energy optimality, peak lateral acceleration demanded, terminal speed and robustness to unanticipated target maneuvers, to illustrate the superiority of the proposed law.	differential evolution;interceptor pattern	T.

Further, the heuristic is modified, by replacing projections with geodesics, to meet requirements of routing pipes on surfaces. Numerical computations of a 119 pipe routing problem are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed pipe routing algorithm.	approximation algorithm;computation;floor and ceiling functions;heuristic (computer science);interaction;interference (communication);numerical analysis;polyhedron;requirement;routing	Chengen Wang;Qiang Liu	2011	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2010.2099219	differential geometry;mathematical optimization;geodesic;simulation;computer science;engineering;mathematics;engineering drawing;algorithm;engineering design process	Robotics	54.91052753697834	-19.798349043193287	77865

Independent applications of Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) and Ramp Metering (RM) have shown strong potential to effectively alleviate urban traffic congestion by adjusting the signal timings in real-time in response to traffic fluctuations to achieve desirable objectives (e.g., minimize delay at intersections or minimize travel time along freeways). This paper presents the problem formulation and the framework for addressing traffic control problem using an integrated solution combining ATSC and RM. According to that problem definition, an optimal closed-loop approach for ATSC and RM can be designed using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach. Authors' previous studies of MARL on a large-scale simulated network of 59 intersections in the lower downtown core of the City of Toronto for the morning rush hour have shown unprecedented reduction in the average intersection delay up to 39% at the network level, and travel time savings of up 2to 26% along the busiest routes in downtown Toronto. Additionally, authors' studies of MARL applied to a calibrated microsimulation model of the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto, Canada resulted in 50% reduction in total travel time compared with the base case scenario.	atsc standards;algorithm;approximation;artificial intelligence;channel capacity;closed-loop transfer function;control system;control theory;curse of dimensionality;discretization;freeway;interaction;multi-agent system;network congestion;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;real-time clock;recursion;reinforcement learning;software metering;test case	Samah El-Tantawy;Kasra Rezaee;Baher Abdulhai	2015	2015 IEEE 18th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2015.387	control engineering;simulation;engineering;transport engineering	Robotics	55.324638710450905	-12.467948794902231	77937

It presents a hazard-evaluation-based driver-automation switched shared steering control approach for intelligent vehicles in this manuscript. The switched operation between human driver and autopilot system is carried out when the hazard situation is tested by the autopilot controller. The driver’s operation and the deviation from the road center line are employed to carry out the hazard evaluation. The autopilot controller is designed using the constrained model predictive control (MPC) approach to keep the intelligent vehicle run in the safe area that is between the road boundary. In order to verify the control performance of the proposed algorithm, simulation verification under hazard situation of the proposed approach are carried out and compared with the non-switching method. The results show that the intelligent vehicle can keep safe in the hazard situation.	algorithm;automation;autopilot;safe area (television);simulation	Yangyang Guo;Andrew Joyce;Linhuan Song;Hongyan Guo;Yunfeng Hu;Hong Chen	2018	2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2018.8500443	automation;control theory;autopilot;model predictive control;control engineering;computer science	Robotics	61.80871403800963	-15.907128772551374	78015

Through an optimized policy gradient algorithm, we were able to demonstrate rapid convergence (requiring less than 10 minutes of experiments) to a stroke form which maximized the propulsive efficiency of this very complicated fluid-dynamical system. This success was due in part to an improved sampling distribution and carefully selected policy parameterization, both motivated by a formal analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of policy gradient algorithms. The resulting optimal policy provides insight into the behavior of the fluid system, and the effectiveness of the learning strategy suggests a number of exciting opportunities for machine learning control of fluid dynamics.	algorithm;control flow;control system;dynamical system;experiment;gradient;machine learning;photographic plate;reinforcement learning;sampling (signal processing);signal-to-noise ratio	John W.

The dynamics of the object carried by the two robots is assimilated to the dynamics of a mass-spring-damper system described by a piecewise linear model (PWA). The coordination of the two robots is accomplished using a master slave synchronization approach dedicated for PWA systems, based on the Lyapunov theory, and solved via Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). The performances of the proposed approach are proved by simulation results and compared to a related approach with larger stability criteria. © 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

177faaf59b0b4b5e66c3af4357e3fbb511e89e97	multi-group motion planning in virtual environments	motion dynamics;generalized traveling salesman problem;probabilistic roadmap;sampling based motion planning	Toward enhancing automation, this paper proposes an efficient approach for multi-group motion planning, where the set of goals is divided into k groups and the objective is to compute a collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectory that enables a virtual vehicle to reach at least one goal from each group. The approach works with ground and aerial vehicles operating in complex environments containing numerous obstacles. In addition to modeling the vehicle dynamics by differential equations, the approach can use physics-based game engines, which provide an increased level of realism. The approach is based on a hybrid search that uses generalized traveling salesman tours over a probabilistic roadmap to effectively guide the sampling-based expansion of a motion tree. As the motion tree is expanded with collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories, tours are adjusted based on a partition of the motion tree into equivalence classes. This gives the approach the flexibility to discover new tours that avoid collisions and are compatible with the vehicle dynamics. Comparisons to related work show significant improvements both in terms of runtime and solution length. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley u0026 Sons, Ltd.

The robots of our days have to feature human like form and structure. But, more importantly its ways of motion and reactions should be like that expected with human. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for solving the human arm inverse kinematics problem (position and orientation). The proposed method eliminates the singular configurations faced in the classical inverse kinematics methods. Our algorithm is based on the choice of a special reference frames in the workspace of the different parts of human arm. The geometrical projection in local frames gives the aimed results. The proposed redundancy resolution criterion for 7ddl human like arm is obtained through an energetic optimization. The proposed algorithm could be used for humanoid robots arm, in upper limb prosthesis application, as well as in computer animations. It gives the solution for the inverse kinematics of the arm.

The outer-loop sliding mode controller (SMC) is designed in order to deal with the impacts from the remainder equivalent disturbances, which is due to the inadequate estimation of the inner-loop DOB. Meanwhile, the existence of DOB can reduce the switching gain of SMC law, which can suppress the high-frequency chattering of control input to a certain extent. Moreover, an approximate differential method is employed in order to reliably acquire the differential information in a noisy environment. From the experiment results on a DC motor servo system, it is presented that the proposed dual-loop control scheme can effectively improve the tracking performances with respect to higher tracking accuracy and stronger system robustness against external disturbances and parameter perturbations, compared with the traditional DOB+PD control scheme.	dual loop;servo	Tianpeng He;Shu Li;Xiaodong Liu	2015	IJMSSC	10.1142/S1793962315500269	robust control;control engineering;real-time computing;servo control;sliding mode control;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.55016214459434	-10.318625576455487	78547

The ability of a robotic master and slave system to monitor and correct for acceleration induced movement errors would enable conduct of delicate medical procedures onboard moving vehicles. Such operations, without compensation, would be complicated by unintended movement of the surgeonpsilas hands and master controls, causing potentially dangerous response of the surgical robot manipulators. In caring for astronauts on long haul interplanetary missions, it is essential to compensate for alterations in gravitational acceleration when delivering telesurgical or autonomous robotic therapy in the microgravity of space or on non-terrestrial planetary surfaces. This paper introduces new work focused on compensating for unintended master and slave manipulator motion resulting from accelerations of the environment within which they are operated. Experimental results from vehicular operation show how induced motion can be reduced by introduction of dynamic electronic balancing of the master manipulator device and the addition of variable damping proportional to vehicle acceleration. A surgical master console and robot were operated in the micro-gravity and variable gravity of the NASA C-9 airborne parabolic laboratory. Robot kinematics data and surveys of surgeon and astronaut users show that compensating for different gravitational conditions improves usability of the system. Further experiments using an elevator as a motion platform demonstrate the effectiveness of acceleration compensation.	airborne ranger;algorithm;autonomous robot;experiment;haptic technology;motion simulator;operating environment;parabolic antenna;planetary scanner;remote surgery;stationary process;telerobotics;terrestrial television;usability	Hawkeye H.

Further, we prove that every periodic plate motion maps to a unique velocity field. By allowing a plate to oscillate with six-degrees-of-freedom, we can create a large family of programmable velocity fields. We examine in detail sinusoidal plate motions that generate fields with either isolated sinks or squeeze lines. These fields can be exploited to perform tasks such as sensorless part orientation.	assembly language;automatic number plate recognition;coefficient;computational fluid dynamics;map;numerical linear algebra;planar (computer graphics);prototype;rate of convergence;simulation;sorting;velocity (software development)	Murilo G.

In the literature, there exists a wide variety of techniques, some complex and some simple and yet effective in particular scenarios. The choice of the path tracker influences the performance in terms of precision, stability and passenger comfort. This paper addresses the lateral control of a self-driving car in an urban environment, where speed is not high but variations in velocity and curvature are frequent. In choosing a lateral controller, simplicity, efficiency and robustness are considered as the main criteria. In this paper, three classical techniques used for controlling the lateral error are analyzed: pure pursuit, Stanley and a simplified kinematic steering control. Additionally, a novel kinematic controller based on the lateral speed is proposed. A home-made realistic simulation environment has been developed to allow rapid testing of the control laws. The relevance of this work has been demonstrated for all controllers through realistic simulations and experiments. The experimental site is the campus of Ecole Centrale de Nantes, where all control laws have been compared along the same path. A longer path, involving a portion of the ring road of Nantes (France) has been simulated. It involves speeds up to 90 km/h, allowing to extrapolate the comparison results to higher velocities.	autonomous car;autonomous robot;experiment;extrapolation;lateral computing;lateral thinking;relevance;simulation;stanley (vehicle);velocity (software development)	Salvador Dominguez;Alan Ali;Gaëtan Garcia;Philippe Martinet	2016	2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795743	control engineering;simulation;engineering;transport engineering	Robotics	62.71029580387807	-16.98984635801917	78823

The highly nonlinear dynamic coupling between the mobile base and the manipulator arm, in addition to the nonholonomic constraints at the base, makes these systems difficult to plan and control. If the system is under-actuated, the problem becomes even more difficult. In this paper, using a special inertia distribution on the manipulator arm, the differential flatness property of mobile manipulators is achieved. An integrated planning and control methodology is presented for two different types of under-actuated planar mobile manipulators, with a twowheeled differentially driven mobile base and with a car-like mobile base, respectively. A mobile manipulator with either of the two bases is shown to be differentially flat. In addition, this paper shows that a wide range of under-actuated arm designs results in differential flatness. Through illustrative examples of under-actuated two-link planar mobile manipulators, it is demonstrated that with the differential flatness property, the trajectory planning and feedback controller design problem can be solved in an efficient and simplified way.	arm architecture;control theory;h2 database engine;megabyte;mobile manipulator;nonlinear system;os-tan;simulation;wheels;xfig	Ji-Chul Ryu;Sunil Kumar Agrawal	2010	Auton.

4059d8adbabae734c5b76d485a05cf35b4f14f71	flexible cable-driven parallel manipulator control: maintaining positive cable tensions		In this brief, a planar cable-driven parallel manipulator is controlled using a strictly positive real compensator, cable pretension is explicitly accounted for, and cable slack is avoided. A strictly positive real controller is implemented using actuator saturation prevention techniques and the solution to a linear programming problem to ensure that the cable tensions remain strictly positive. Pretension torque is directly accounted for when determining the input–output stability of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the controller can track high-acceleration trajectories with the same precision as a state-of-the-art controller from the literature, while maintaining positive cable tensions.	category 5 cable;computational fluid dynamics;encoder;feedback;flexible display;linear programming;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;parallel manipulator;sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;slack variable;tachometer;tree rearrangement;workspace	Ryan James Caverly;James Richard Forbes	2018	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2017.2728007	control engineering;control theory;control theory;actuator;mathematics;flexible cable;torque;parallel manipulator;winch;linear programming	Robotics	68.05081183514231	-14.533316383803365	79278

In this paper, an adaptive compensation with a robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback is developed for high precise tracking control of hydraulic motion system. To handle both payload and hydraulic unknown parameters in one controller, a chain of integrator nonlinear system model is first derived, and an adaptive RISE controller is then proposed, in which adaptive law is synthesized to handle parametric uncertainty and RISE robust term to attenuate unmodeled disturbance. The major feature of the proposed controller is that it can theoretically guarantee asymptotic tracking performance with a continuous control input, in the presence of various parametric uncertainties and unmodeled disturbances such as unconsidered dynamics as well as external disturbances via Lyapunov analysis. However, the proposed controller takes the acceleration as a system state, which usually suffers heavy noise pollution and thus cannot be utilized directly in actual control. To solve this practical issue, in this paper, a tracking differentiator is employed to extract high-quality acceleration signal and to make the proposed controller feasible execution. The effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear controller is demonstrated via comparative experimental results.	differentiator;estimation theory;lyapunov fractal;motion system;nonlinear system;petri net;row hammer;the matrix;velocity (software development)	Jianyong Yao;Wenxiang Deng;Zongxia Jiao	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2015.2434393	computer science;robustness (computer science);integrator;control theory;differentiator;control engineering;motion system;nonlinear system;adaptive control;parametric statistics;control theory	Robotics	66.55022523731199	-10.892296309517073	79297

A contact force regulator capable of accurately applying mechanical stimuli to a live Drosophila larva could greatly facilitate mechanobiology research on Drosophila and may eventually lead to novel discoveries in mechanotransduction of neuron circuitry. In this paper, we present a novel contact force scheme implemented in an automated Drosophila larvae micromanipulation system, featuring a switched fuzzy-PD controller and a noise-insensitive extended high gain observer. The switched fuzzy-PD controller inherits the fast convergence from fuzzy controller and overcomes the drawbacks (overshoot and oscillation) of a conventional fuzzy controller. The observer provides precise estimation to compensate for system modeling errors despite force measurement noise, which overcomes the disadvantage of traditional high gain observer. Force control experiments show that, compared to an conventional PID controller, this new controller-observer scheme has significantly enhanced dynamic performance in terms of rising time, overshoot, and oscillation. The developed robotic system and the force control scheme will be applied to mechanical stimulation and fluorescence imaging of Drosophila larvae for identifying new mechanotransduction mechanisms.	electronic circuit;experiment;neuron;overshoot (signal);pid;robot;steady state;systems modeling	Weize Zhang;Xianke Dong;Xinyu Liu	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139770	control engineering;electronic engineering;network switch;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;force;fuzzy control system;quantum mechanics	Robotics	64.14209526418311	-10.478910295868173	79305

One-step Guess method using one step history data sampled from actual continuous-time plant at a constant sampling interval is developed to estimate the unknown fixed or time-varying force. A discrete-time adaptive controller based on estimation of load force is designed to track desired joint trajectory. System simulation of a 6 DOF manipulator is carried out with the help of robotic toolbox in MATLAB, which demonstrates performances of the proposed scheme dealing with both fixed and variable forces, compared with traditional control method.	computer simulation;electrical load;matlab;open science grid consortium;performance;robot end effector;sampling (signal processing)	Hao Zhou;Hongbin Ma;Haiyang Zhan;Yimeng Lei;Mengyin Fu	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-43506-0_2	control engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.36918207901279	-12.425043802636669	79760

The developed adaptive joint torque controller uses additional sensing including the joint and motor positions and the joint torque, and adaptively compensates the large friction associated with harmonic drives, while incorporating the dynamics of flexspline. With guaranteed L2/Linfin stability and asymptotic stability, the adaptive joint torque controller allows any motion controller to be employed. Experimental results using the developed adaptive joint torque controller incorporating a motion controller based on the virtual decomposition control demonstrate precision trajectory tracking control of a 7-DOF robot at both moderate and ultra-low speeds. The precision control with encoder-resolution accuracy at an ultra-low joint speed of 0.001 (rad/s) characterizes the effectiveness of the friction compensation.	encoder;motion controller;robot	Wen-Hong Zhu	2007	Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364066	control engineering;motion control;simulation;adaptive control;engineering;friction;control theory;degrees of freedom	Robotics	66.76912153547906	-14.855374257351574	79881

In this paper, we continue to explore into “grasping by caging” and propose a new solution by using eigen-shapes and space mapping. For one thing, eigen-shapes fix dexterous hands into a series of finger formations and help to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity. For the other, space mapping builds a mapping between rasterized grids in 2-D Work space (W space) and rasterized voxels in 3-D Configuration space (C space) and helps to rapidly reconstruct C space so that we can efficiently measure the robustness of caging and find an optimal caging configuration for grasping. Our algorithm can work rapidly and squeezingly cage any 2-D shapes, including objects with either convex boundaries, concave boundaries, 1-order or high-order boundaries and even objects with inner holes. We implement the algorithm with MATLAB and carry out experiments with WEBOTS simulation to test its robustness to uncertainties. The results show that our algorithm can work well with various object shapes and can be robust to noisy control and noisy perception. It is promising in the power grasping tasks of dexterous hands.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;concave function;eigen (c++ library);experiment;matlab;raster graphics;rasterisation;simulation;space mapping;voxel	Weiwei Wan;Rui Fukui;Masamichi Shimosaka;Tomomasa Sato;Yasuo Kuniyoshi	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2013.6630779	robot;control engineering;computer vision;space mapping;shape;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;computational complexity theory;robustness;dimensionality reduction	Robotics	61.88220519047546	-23.410127364870856	79908

In order to control those tasks, we extend hybrid position/force control scheme presented thus far by various researchers for a single-arm robot. The point of the extension is formulation of kinematics and statics for a two-arm robot which is new in this paper. We define a unique system of workspace coordinates and, corresponding to the unique workspace, introduce an unique jointspace vector consisting of joint-vectors of the two arms. Using these work and joint spaces, we formulate kinematics and statics. Based upon this formulation, we successfully apply the hybrid scheme to the two-arm robot. A demonstration of the theory working on a real two-arm industrial robot and experimental data of simultaneous control of position and force proves the effectiveness of our method.	coat of arms;industrial robot;robotic arm;workspace	Masaru Uchiyama;Naotoshi Iwasawa;Kyojiro Hakomori	1987		10.1109/ROBOT.1987.1087766	control engineering;mobile robot;robot learning;robot end effector;cartesian coordinate robot;simulation;articulated robot;robotic arm;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;social robot;arm solution;dynamic programming;inverse kinematics;control theory;robot control;arm architecture;robot kinematics;robot calibration	Robotics	68.30381937922292	-22.583473234345647	79999

The objective function to be minimized is a weighted sum of the integral squared jerk and the execution time. Two possible primitives for building the trajectory are considered: cubic splines or fifth-order B-splines. The proposed technique allows to set constraints on the robot motion, expressed as upper bounds on the absolute values of velocity, acceleration and jerk. The described method is then applied to a 6-d.o.f. robot (a Cartesian gantry manipulator with a spherical wrist); the results obtained using the two different primitives are presented and discussed. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Inverse kinematics solutions are obtained through the inversion of a neural network that has been previously trained to approximate the manipulator forward kinematics. The inversion provides difference vectors in the joint space from difference vectors in the workspace. Our differential inverse kinematics (DIV) approach can be viewed as a neural network implementation of the Jacobian transpose method for arm kinematic control that does not require previous knowledge of the arm forward kinematics. Redundancy can be exploited to obtain a special inverse kinematic solution that meets a particular constraint (e.g. joint limit avoidance) by inverting an additional neural network The usefulness of our DIV approach is further illustrated with sensor-based multilink manipulators that learn collision-free reaching motions in unknown environments. For this task, the neural controller has two modules: a reinforcement-based action generator (AG) and a DIV module that computes goal vectors in the joint space. The actions given by the AG are interpreted with regard to those goal vectors. © 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

In a previous work [9], the optimization of an entropy function was suggested as the selection criteria for determining a solution to the redundant inverse kinematics problem; it was shown that judicious selection of joint values that minimize this entropy function will result in a highly-reliable solution to the inverse kinematics problem. The technique was demonstrated in a simple case study, where a closed-form expression could be developed to describe the pose uncertainty of the manipulator. In this paper, a novel computational technique is presented for minimizing the entropy function which described the positioning uncertainty of the robotic manipulator. This two-level algorithm allows the reliability-based inverse kinematic formulation to be extended to more complex manipulators, where simulation techniques must be used to determine the pose uncertainty of the manipulator. This technical note presents a review of the reliability-based inverse kinematic formulation, a description of the novel computational algorithm used to minimize the entropy function describing the reliability of the inverse kinematic solution, and an example implementation in a four degree of freedom manipulator.	algorithm;computation;inverse kinematics;let expression;mathematical optimization;optimizing compiler;real-time computing;real-time transcription;robot;simulation	Joseph C.

Firstly, a coupled model based on dual quaternions is introduced to describe the six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) relative motion of spacecraft formation flying. Secondly, hysteretic quantized control input is implemented to reduce the required communication rate and to avoid the oscillations caused by the logarithmic quantizer. Thirdly, a fast terminal sliding mode tracking controller with adaptive updating laws is proposed to guarantee that the resulting closed-loop system is fixed-time stable, and that the relative motion tracking errors converge to a neighborhood around the origin in a fixed time, despite the presence of model uncertainties, external disturbances, and input quantization. Finally, a simulation example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control design scheme.	quantization (signal processing)	Ruixia Liu;Xibin Cao;Yanzheng Zhu	2019	Inf.

In this paper, the dynamic model of a three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle, which is linearized to simplify controller design, is developed. The conditions of making its dynamics linear are derived first. Then, a strategy of planning wheel velocities to satisfy these conditions is proposed. Consequently, three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle can be easily treated by classical linear control theories. Finally, a linear optimal tracker is designed to control the omnidirectional vehicle for desired movement trajectories. In particular, the dynamic model includes the motors installed in the three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle, making it a practical model. Three kinds of vehicle trajectories illustrate the planning of wheel trajectories for linearizing the vehicle dynamics, and simulations demonstrate the performance of the linear optimal tracker. In addition, experimental results of a practical three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle are also included.	care-of address;coat of arms;control system;coupling (computer programming);experiment;mathematical model;motion planning;robot;simulation;theory;tracing (software);traction teampage;wheels	Kuo-Yang Tu	2010	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574709990890	control engineering;vehicle dynamics;simulation;engineering;linear programming;control theory	Robotics	62.66640067640068	-18.664258615305958	80543

A specific choice of the Lagrangian is recommended. The motion planning algorithm is applied to the motion planning problem of a free-floating space manipulator with non-zero momentum. A conjecture is formulated that for this specific choice of the Lagrangian the motion planning algorithm outperforms the other Jacobian algorithms in terms of the length of the resulting robot trajectory.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;control system;futures studies;jacobian matrix and determinant;lagrangian and eulerian specification of the flow field;motion planning;robot	Krzysztof Tchon;Joanna Ratajczak	2017	2017 22nd International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2017.8046950	conjecture;jacobian matrix and determinant;control theory;parametric equation;algorithm;momentum;affine transformation;mathematical optimization;motion planning;lagrangian;trajectory;mathematics	Robotics	63.05323772498726	-20.78041598352892	80593

In this study, the falling cat is treated as an example of a control object. The cat is modelled as two similar cylindrical rigid bodies that represent the front and rear half of its body and the motion of the falling cat is formulated by considering the law of conservation of angular momentum. Because of nonholonomic constraints, the motion control of the falling cat can be treated as a symmetrically affine system without a drift term. A quantum neural controller in which the quantum neural network uses qubit neurons as the information processing unit is designed to solve the control problem that brings the nonholonomic system from the initial to desired position. The computational experiments indicate the feasibility and characteristics of the quantum neural controller in dealing with a nonholonomic system.	angularjs;artificial neural network;experiment;information processing;quantum neural network;qubit;systems design	Kazuhiko Takahashi	2012	2012 12th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA)	10.1109/ISDA.2012.6416669	motion control;nonholonomic system;control theory	Robotics	63.32288892811465	-12.706992674314353	80644

For example in a bilateral teleoperation system, a human can control a robot or a system which is far away from each other. One of the major problems faced in a bilateral teleoperation system is the time delay due to the transmission of data between the master and the slave sides. If the controller is not properly designed, the delay degrades the closed-loop performance and even worse, it destabilizes the bilaterally controlled teleoperator. In order to minimize the effect of the time delay we chose a predictive control approach to improve the system performance while at the same time it can retain the stability of the whole teleoperation system. The human operator dynamics is not taken into account and hence less prior information is required for the design when compared with earlier proposed control schemes. Another main contribution of this paper is that various comparison results with conventional schemes are extensively discussed.

The fuel content (or percentage of biodiesel fuel) is estimated by an adaptive estimation scheme based upon the exhaust oxygen sensor signal during the normal engine operations and during the LNT regeneration when the AFR is controlled in a closed loop. The engine system was modeled by a third order linear system in this study. A Linear Quadratic optimal tracking controller was used to regulate the engine AFR to the desired level during the LNT regeneration period. The closed loop system robustness with respect to the air flow measurement error and the fuel content estimation error is also analyzed. Three adaptive control schemes were studied through simulations, and the best performance was obtained for the dual-gain scheme, where the low adaptive estimation gain is used during normal engine operations and high gain is used during the LNT regeneration.	alternate frame rendering;closed-loop transfer function;diesel;linear system;simulation	Xuefei Chen;Yue-Yun Wang;Ibrahim Haskara;Guoming Zhu	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		control engineering;engineering;automotive engineering;control theory;mathematics;biofuel	Mobile	67.96975118132033	-10.765520083748147	80987

The system is general to non-human morphologies and results in natural balancing motions employing the entire body (for example, wind-milling). Our novel balance routine seeks to control the linear and angular momenta of the character. We demonstrate how momentum is related to the center of mass and center of pressure of the character and derive control rules to change these centers for balance. The desired momentum changes are reconciled with the objective of tracking the reference motion through an optimization routine which produces target joint accelerations. A hybrid inverse/forward dynamics algorithm determines joint torques based on these joint accelerations and the ground reaction forces. Finally, the joint torques are applied to the free-standing character simulation. We demonstrate results for following both motion capture and keyframe data as well as both human and non-human morphologies in presence of a variety of conditions and disturbances.

The controller described, which follows a reactive technique, generates trajectories of near-minimal lengths when no obstacles are detected and, in presence of obstacles, generates minimum deviations from them. All these reference paths meet the kinematic constraints of car-like robots and take into account dynamic issues. Besides its efficiency, the proposed controller is very simple and linguistically interpretable. The whole controller has been designed and verified by using the CAD tools of the Xfuzzy environment.	computer-aided design;geometric analysis;heuristic (computer science);neuro-fuzzy;robot;robotic mapping	Iluminada Baturone;Andrés Gersnoviez	2007	2007 IEEE International Fuzzy Systems Conference	10.1109/FUZZY.2007.4295621	mobile robot;computer vision;navigation;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;geometric analysis;neuro-fuzzy;cad;motion planning;robot control;obstacle avoidance;supervised learning;robot kinematics;fuzzy control system	Robotics	58.126921174661696	-18.41748755688559	81086

In this paper guidance laws are developed to optimally position a relay Micro-UAV (MAV) to provide an operator at the base with real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) by relaying communication and video signals when the rover MAV performing the ISR mission is out of radio contact range with the base. The ISR system is comprised of two MAVs, the Relay and the Rover, and a Base. The Relay strives to minimize the radio frequency (RF) power required for maintaining communications, while the Rover performs the ISR mission, which may maximize the required RF power. The optimal control of the Relay MAV entails the solution of a differential game.	information systems research;optimal control;radio frequency;real-time clock;relay;rover (the prisoner);unmanned aerial vehicle	Youngdong Choi;Meir Pachter;David R.

The first control scheme combines a nonlinear rigid model of the flexible manipulator with a linear rigid observer, whereas the second scheme uses a nonlinear flexible manipulator model with a linear flexible observer. The majority of the results available in the literature do not address the optimal control problem through the use of observers, as it is done in this paper, for the control of parallel robots. The simulation results have shown in both cases that indeed optimal state-obscrver-based control is a good candidate for controlling parallellink manipulators in practice. As expected, the second scheme (flexible model plus flexible observer) gives better results than the first one, achieving faster trajectory tracking. The effects of white noises, applied forces, and zero gravity environment were taken under consideration.	computer simulation;control theory;nonlinear system;optimal control;parallel manipulator;robot;simulation	Spyros G.

It develops a cooperative scheme based on a decentralized planning algorithm which considers the vehicles in an initial open chain configuration. In this scheme the trajectories are intersections-free, and each trajectory is planned independently of the others. To ensure the stabilization of each vehicle in the planned trajectory, a fuzzy closed loop motion control is presented, where, based on the properties of the Fuzzy maps, the Lyapunov's stability of the motion errors is demonstrated for all the vehicles. Based on the ISO 2631-1 standard, the saturation property of the Fuzzy maps guarantees low values of longitudinal and lateral accelerations, to ensure comfort of the human body during the motion. The validity of this control algorithm is supported by simulation experiments.	control theory	Francesco Maria Raimondi;Maurizio Melluso	2008	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2008.04.012	fuzzy logic;planning;control engineering;motion control;open-loop controller;human body;simulation;adaptive control;lyapunov function;engineering;control theory;cooperation;saturation	Robotics	59.67455157523216	-17.6823321586261	81568

Modeling of the human welder's response to 3D weld pool surface can help develop next generation intelligent welding machines and train welders faster. In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy based human intelligence model is constructed and implemented as an intelligent controller in automated GTAW process to maintain a consistent desired full penetration. An innovative vision system is utilized to real-time measure the specular 3D weld pool surface under strong arc interference in GTAW process. Experiments are designed to produce random changes in the welding speed and voltage resulting in fluctuations in the weld pool surface. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is proposed to correlate the human welder's response to the 3D weld pool surface. Control experiments are designed to start welding using different initial current and have various disturbances including variations of arc length and welding speed. It is found that the proposed human intelligence model can adjust the current to robustly control the process to a desired penetration state despite different initial conditions and various disturbances. A foundation is thus established to explore the mechanism and transformation of human welder's intelligence into robotic welding system.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;emoticon;experience;experiment;initial condition;interference (communication);neuro-fuzzy;phone connector (audio);real-time clock;robot welding;robust control	Yukang Liu;Weijie Zhang;Yuming Zhang	2013	2013 American Control Conference		robust control;control engineering;robot welding;arc welding;computer science;engineering;control theory;engineering drawing;intelligent control;manufacturing engineering	Robotics	59.23439109074976	-12.460979956311522	82457

However, in some cases the task priority needs to be changed in order to successfully perform the desired task without changing the initial strategy. In this paper we propose a novel method for control of kinematically redundant robots, where we focus on a smooth, continuous transition between the primary and the secondary task. The method is based on a null-space velocity control algorithm, which is essential for achieving good behaviour of a redundant robotic system. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated on a robotic system with two Kuka LWR robots.	algorithm;humanoid robot;interrupt priority level;lyapunov fractal;network switch;robot;smoothing;velocity (software development)	Tadej Petric;Leon Zlajpah	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2011.6181279	robot;control engineering;kinematics;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot control;tracking;redundancy;robot kinematics	Robotics	65.7174344929262	-21.37213655051095	82644

This system is developed in two major steps. First, an offline planning based on robot kinematic and dynamic models, including actuators, is performed to generate a large dataset of trajectories, covering most of the robot workspace and minimizing time and energy, while avoiding singularities and limits on joint angles, rates, accelerations, and torques. An augmented Lagrangian technique is implemented on a decoupled form of the PKM dynamics in order to solve the resulting nonlinear constrained optimal control problem. Then, the outcomes of the offline-planning are used to build a data-driven neuro-fuzzy inference system to learn and capture the desired dynamic behavior of the PKM. Once this system is optimized, it is used to achieve near-optimal online planning with a reasonable time complexity. Simulations proving the effectiveness of this approach on a 2-degrees-of-freedom planar PKM are given and discussed.	algorithm;atomic layer deposition;augmented lagrangian method;automated planning and scheduling;computer simulation;condition number;forward kinematics;fuzzy control system;inference engine;inverse kinematics;jacobian matrix and determinant;mathematical optimization;motion planning;multistage amplifier;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;online and offline;optimal control;parallel manipulator;penalty method;poor posture;robot;time complexity;velocity (software development);workspace	Amar Khoukhi	2010	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2009.2036600	control engineering;constrained optimization;simulation;computer science;engineering;control theory;mathematics;motion planning;robotics	Robotics	59.769294609108464	-16.194658891168185	82647

The main purpose of the STS is the automated transport function of containers within the port in minimum time, which also requires high precision and safety. A major difference between the STS and a container crane is the configuration of the cables for holding the spreader. A mathematical model of the STS is developed in this paper, which results in an eight-pole system. Also, an open loop control is investigated in the way that the derived command for the overhead shuttle yields the minimum possible sway of the payload. Simulation results show that the vibration suppression capability of the STS is superior to the conventional overhead container crane, which is partially due to the cable configuration.	mathematical model;overhead (computing);simulation;zero suppression	Gyoung-Hahn Kim;Umer Hameed Shah;Mingxu Piao;Sang-Hei Choi;Seoung-Nam Kim;Keum Shik Hong	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2015.7222740	control engineering;simulation;engineering;automotive engineering	Robotics	65.08888688030996	-14.466727922107541	83235

Based on the constraint optimal principle, it was obtained that the trajectory of the minimum jerk movement on the surface of sphere should be a geodesic. Experiments used a robot especially designed for studies of human-machine interactions to evaluate movements on a virtual surface. Experiments revealed that the nervous system tries to learn and represent a constrained surface so it can move most efficiently (i.e. move along a geodesic) with practice, and that subjects can generalize this knowledge to nearby locations not yet visited.	communication endpoint;experiment;interaction;robot	D.

On the other hand, the attitude control subsystem (ACS) applies torques so that the spacecraft keeps its desired orientation. We explore the interaction of an orbital control maneuver with the attitude of a spacecraft. We propose to use the thrusters that provide the force for the orbit control as actuators to control the attitude as well. We obtain the conditions on the thruster configuration which guarantee that any perturbation torque can be compensated while performing the orbit control maneuver. We prove that the minimum number of thrusters which solve this problem is 4. Furthermore, we prove that the same problem can be solved with a minimum of 6 thrusters if a single failure in any thruster is accepted. We compute a robustness index which measures the maximum allowable uncertainty in the thruster configuration while still solving the problem stated previously. In the case of 4 thrusters with bounded thrusts, we solve the problem of maximizing the resulting force in a certain direction.		Ricardo Salvador Sánchez Peña;Roberto Alonso;Pablo A.

This technique is based on a new parametrization of the unknown adherence force. The control philosophy is alternative to the ones currently implemented in the industry and found in the literature, and aims at enhancing vehicle performances by estimating the maximum available adhesion force, which is then exploited via a nonlinear controller. The effects of the implemented control scheme are the use of the maximum available deceleration in case of poor adhesion conditions and, consequently, a reduction in the wear rate of the rolling stock.

The second level consists of two loops: a fast SISO plasma vertical position stabilization loop and a slow MIMO plasma current and shape control loop. Both loops have the controllers which were designed by an H∞ loop shaping approach in the framework of the disturbance rejection configuration. The third level is a structure with a Model Predictive Controller for improving the plasma shape control process by a vertical position reference adjustment during a plasma discharge. The main idea of our proposal is to solve a tokamak plasma vertical position instability problem in cooperation with the plasma shape and current MIMO control loop. The plasma vertical position stabilization technique provides a more reliable control system in whole when compared with the known system approach when a plasma vertical speed is stabilized at about zero. The simulation results of the plasma magnetic hierarchical control system obtained on plasma-physics nonlinear DINA code for ITER are presented. The system was modeled on DINA code on the divertor phase of the plasma current ramp-up stage and on a DINA linearized model on the flat-top phase when a minor disruption occurs.	denial-of-service attack;dina;discharger;hierarchical control system;instability;mimo;noise shaping;nonlinear system;plasma active;plasma display;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;rejection sampling;simulation interoperability standards organization	Yuri V.

Within this CRT framework, a Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) estimation method is derived to represent the RTK GPS/INS problem, and solved by Nonlinear Mixed Integer Least Square (NMILS) approach. This approach allows the utilization of multiple epochs of GPS data with INS defined motion constraints over a time interval. The NMILS approach over time intervals allows hypothesis testing on each interval to contemplate alternative fault detection hypotheses. The objectives are to enhance reliability and accuracy. Implementation results are included that demonstrate the performance of the proposed method achieving centimeter position accuracy.	algorithm;cathode ray tube;epoch (reference date);fault detection and isolation;global positioning system;inertial navigation system;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;real time kinematic;real-time computing;real-time transcription;receiver autonomous integrity monitoring;sensor	Yiming Chen;Sheng Zhao;Dongfang Zheng;Jay A.

We parameterize the general c-surface using the rotation angle and the vector of translation parameters of the individual contacts. Once we compute the domain of the rotation parameter, we can setup the translation parameters in a linear equation. The singular value decomposition of this equation gives us with the exact parameters of translation. We extend the theory to project a point in c-space onto the csurface. We implement our theory on the Assembly Plan from Observation (APO) system. The APO observes discrete instants of an assembly task and reconstructs the compliant motion plan employed in the task. We compute the contacts at each observed instant and the corresponding csurface. We then interpolate the path on each c-surface to obtain segments of the path. The complete motion plan will be the concatenation of the connected path segments.	assembly language;concatenation;interpolation;linear equation;singular value decomposition	George V.

The dynamics of the robot are represented by an n-link rigid robotic manipulator. To deal with the system uncertainties and improve the robustness of the system, the adaptive neural networks are used to approximate the unknown model of the constrained robot. With the proposed control, uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed loop system is achieved based on the Lyapunov method. The states of the system converge to a small neighborhood of zero by properly choosing control gains. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the proposed control.	nominal impedance;robot	Wei He;Shuzhi Sam Ge;Yanan Li;Effie Chew;Yee Sien Ng	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34103-8_53	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.6124709622698	-11.006750336173887	84122

Although certain control theory exists, such as zero moment point (ZMP) compensation, these theories assume humanoid robot morphology is given in advance. Thus, engineers have to design control program for apriori designed morphology. If morphology and locomotion are considered simultaneously, we do not have to spare time with trial-and-error. The detail model of morphology is used for morphology in which the characteristics of servo module are considered. As the controller, pattern generators are used. The biped walking rohnt which can walk the longest distance are designed with two step genetic algorithm. As a result, the detail model of the robot which can walk the longest distance is generated from limited size of chromosomes. Moreover, emerged result of cauluration is used for design of the real biped walking robot.	apriori algorithm;control theory;evolutionary computation;galaxy morphological classification;genetic algorithm;humanoid robot;mathematical morphology;mobile robot;servo;zero moment point	Ken Endo;Takashi Maeno;Hiroaki Kitano	2003		10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1241781	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot control;evolutionary computation	Robotics	58.589531965735425	-19.49088456773176	84222

5b6d94ac4b782ea7d66a88aa2714dc0ddc3ce225	investigating functional redundancies in the context of vehicle automation – a trajectory tracking perspective		Level 3+ automated driving implies highest safety demands for the entire vehicle automation functionality. For the part of trajectory tracking, functional redundancies among all available actuators provide an opportunity to reduce safety requirements for single actuators. Yet, the exploitation of functional redundancies must be well argued if employed in a safety concept as physical limits can be reached. In this paper, we want to examine from a trajectory tracking perspective whether such a concept can be used. For this, we present a model predictive fault-tolerant trajectory tracking approach for over-actuated vehicles featuring wheel individual all-wheel drive, brakes, and steering. Applying this approach exemplarily demonstrates for a selected reference trajectory that degradations such as missing or undesired wheel torques as well as reduced steering dynamics can be compensated. Degradations at the physical actuator limits lead to significant deviations from the reference trajectory while small constant steering angles are partially critical.

The control structure includes a proportional-derivative controller acting as a feedback servo machine and a radial-basis-function (RBF) NN acting as a feedforward predictive machine. Under the sufficient constraints on control parameters, the closed-loop system achieves semiglobal practical exponential stability, such that an accurate NN approximation is guaranteed in a local region along recurrent reference trajectories. Compared with the existing NNLC methods, the novelties of the proposed method include: 1) the implementation of an adaptive NN control to guarantee plant states being recurrent is not needed, since recurrent reference signals rather than plant states are utilized as NN inputs, which greatly simplifies the analysis and synthesis of the NNLC and 2) the domain of NN approximation can be determined a priori by the given reference signals, which leads to an easy construction of the RBF-NNs. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of this approach.	approximation;biomimetics;control flow;controllers;feed forward (control);feedback;feedforward neural network;inspiration function;nn304;nonlinear system;parkinson disease;radial (radio);radial basis function;servo;simulation;exponential;motor learning;phosphoethanolamine	Yongping Pan;Haoyong Yu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2527501	nonlinear system;computer science;trajectory;machine learning;control theory;artificial neural network;intelligent control	Robotics	62.82154267021333	-10.130668545340896	84327

This approach is very simple since it does not require a joint torque/motor current interface but only a positional interface. It can be applied with elastic end-effectors (sensors) as well as with stiff environments where most elasticity is in the robot joints. In both cases deviations from the desired forces are transferred to positional deviations on joint level. The resulting path can then be controlled with high accuracy by a learned feedforward controller including the influence of the forces. The approach can be applied to the sensing of a contour or to the tracking of a known contour with high speed.	robot	Friedrich Lange;Gerd Hirzinger	1996		10.1109/ROBOT.1996.506504	robot;control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot control;tracking;feed forward	Robotics	66.12565502483491	-23.161347880653786	84611

This motion coordination is a cooperative behavior for security against invaders in surveillance areas. Each robot in this control law has its own coordinate system and it senses a target/invader, other robots and obstacles, to achieve this cooperative behavior without making any collision. Although there is no centralized controller and each robot has local feedback that is relative-position feedback, all the robots are asymptotically stabilized, and they make formations enclosing a target. Each robot especially has a vector referred to as a “formation vector,” and the formations are controllable by the vectors. As for determining the formation vectors, we use a reactive-control framework in which robots have some reactions heuristically designed according to this cooperative behavior. Therefore, this robotic system is a hybrid system that consists of a feedback-control law and a reactive-control framework. The validity of this hybrid system is supported by computer simulations.	authorization;centralized computing;computer simulation;deadlock;distributed artificial intelligence;feedback;heuristic;hybrid system;mobile robot;optimal control;robotics	Hiroaki Yamaguchi	1999	I.

In this paper, we focus on allowing heavy quadruped robot to be self-adaptive to various disturbances. The Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum method is applied in regulating feet landing positions. Moreover, yaw motion is discussed to revise direction-deflection after disturbance of external force. In dynamics analysis, both inverse dynamics and balance controller are employed to predict desired torque of joints. Meanwhile gains of position controller can be decreased. The main contribution is an active compliant controller with respect to robot posture. According to linear functions, it can adjust four leg lengths separately to keep robot balance. Therefore, stability is kept both in torque level and position level. The simulation results prove the effect of proposed control scheme under disturbances of external force and uneven terrain. In summary, this control scheme is exceedingly useful in enhancing legged robot stability.	inverse dynamics;inverted pendulum;landing page;linear function;poor posture;robot;simulation;traverse;yaws	Zhe Xu;Junyao Gao;Chuzhao Liu	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2016.7866328	control engineering;bang-bang robot;dynamics;simulation;torso;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;force;robot kinematics;foot	Robotics	66.60819688406725	-18.671614780368866	84911

The proposed control structure is designed by cascading a nonlinear function of state and error with linear fractionalorder PID controller. The introduction of nonlinearity provides the self-tuning control capability, whereas inclusion of fractional-order operator increases the flexibility by providing extra degrees of freedom to the controller. Nonlinear PID, fractional-order PID and conventional PID controllers are also designed for comparative analysis. The parameters of all the designed controllers are optimized using multi-objective modified black hole optimization algorithm. Further, robustness of the proposed controller is examined by performing intensive simulation studies in the system. Finally, the extensive studies and hardware-in-theloop simulation for experimental validation clearly suggest that the proposed controller performs significantly better and is more robust as compared to conventional PID, FOPID and NPID controllers for all the case studies.	algorithm;black hole;control flow;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;pid;qualitative comparative analysis;robot;self-tuning;simulation	Reza Javidan;Hossien Khuban	2016	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-016-2691-z	mathematical optimization;control theory	Robotics	60.406473085445455	-10.444632560806394	84982

Given a planar track including lane boundaries, our goal is to find a trajectory of the car minimizing the lap time subject to tire and steering limits. By using a new set of coordinates, the time-dependent system is transformed into a “space-dependent” (and space-variant) system. The choice of a suitable set of coordinates and the partition of the dynamics into a “longitudinal” one and a “transverse” one, allows us to convert the minimum time problem into a fixed horizon constrained optimal control problem. Based on a projection operator nonlinear optimal control technique, we propose a minimum lap-time strategy to push the rigid car to the limit of its handling capabilities. Finally, we provide numerical computations that: (i) show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, and (ii) allow us to highlight important features of minimum lap-time trajectories.	computation;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;transverse wave	Alessandro Rucco;Giuseppe Notarstefano;John Hauser	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426265	control engineering;simulation;optimal control;engineering;shear modulus;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	62.65635422272983	-19.131656980985866	85192

It is shown that if the robot is actuated by three rotors, any feasible kinematic trajectory is dynamically realizable. For the case of two rotors the conditions of controllability and dynamic realizability of a feasible kinematic trajectory are established. It is shown that in moving the robot by tracing straight lines and circles in the contact plane the dynamically realizable trajectories are not represented by the circles on the sphere, which is a feature of the kinematic model of pure rolling. The dynamic motion planning problem is then formulated in the optimal control settings, and the properties of the optimal trajectories are illustrated under simulation.	angularjs;motion planning;optimal control;robot;simulation;velocity (software development)	Mikhail M.

842cf870ce5b9399d5f0cdd7328a13e0e823f18d	on bisection continuous collision checking method: spherical joints and minimum distance to obstacles		In this paper, we adapt the Continuous Collision Detection (CCD) method proposed in [1] to efficiently handle the case of spherical and two revolute joints, this kind of joints is very common in modern robotic systems. The new formulations provide more tight motion bounds, thus increase the success rate of checking collision-free paths. We also propose an extension to get the minimum distance to obstacles along a path, this information is primordial as it allows sampling-based motion planning techniques to sort collision-free paths according to their minimum clearance. We have integrated our implementation into a sampling-based motion planning technique and validated it through simulation and on the real Baxter research robot. The experiments revealed that the method not only does not miss any collision between the robot and the obstacles, but also the minimum distance extension provides the path with the maximum clearance at no additional computational cost.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;arm span;automated planning and scheduling;baxter (robot);charge-coupled device;collision detection;displacement mapping;experiment;motion planning;robot;robotic arm;sampling (signal processing);simulation;time complexity;workspace	Sonny Tarbouriech;Wael Suleiman	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2018.8463199	control theory;collision;bisection;motion planning;sampling (statistics);robot;collision detection;engineering;sort;revolute joint	Robotics	61.183815294444145	-21.947068842535735	85711

The presented method is based on robust multi-stage NMPC which represents the uncertainty as a scenario tree with the possibility of recourse, reducing the conservativeness of the approach. In the case of structural mismatch, the unmodeled dynamics can cause a significant difference between the model used for the predictions and the reality, which can cause violations of constraints. We generate a scenario tree to account for the mismatch between the plant and the model by assuming a bound on the effect of the structural mismatch on the model. Thus the proposed scheme will be robust to the structural mismatch present in the model. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach for a nonlinear continuous stirred tank reactor example.	iterative method;nonlinear system;reactor (software);sampling (signal processing)	Sankaranarayanan Subramanian;Sergio Lucia;Sebastian Engell	2015	2015 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2015.7330766	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.14325547663191	-11.540923727413713	85775

In these such cases, traditional filtering methods usually fail to provide reliable estimates because of the highly corrupted sensor measurements. This work proposes to model the data fusion problem for heavily disturbed systems through a hybrid systems modeling framework and presents an online hybrid stochastic filter capable of tracking the system's state in unfavorable operating conditions.

By using the Laplacian matrix of the communication graph and a semidefinite program, a synthesis of a time varying optimal stochastic matrix P is done. This matrix P, is used to drive given initial attitudes of the spacecraft to a consensus attitude. The concept of quadratically constrained attitude control (Q-CAC) is then employed to generate an optimal collision-free attitude trajectory along the consensus attitude trajectory. This solution technique is used to simulate coordinated attitude rendezvous, and attitude formation acquisition of multiple spacecraft, in the presence of dynamic obstacles.

e1d2ba35982a7fd2ef2bccf27fbb280a56a05976	neural-network-controlled spring mass template for humanoid running		To generate dynamic motions such as hopping and running on legged robots, model-based approaches are usually used to embed the well studied spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model into the whole-body robot. In producing controlled SLIP-like behaviors, existing methods either suffer from online incompatibility or resort to classical interpolations based on lookup tables. Alternatively, this paper presents the application of a data-driven approach which obviates the need for solving the inverse of the running return map online. Specifically, a deep neural network is trained offline with a large amount of simulation data based on the SLIP model to learn its dynamics. The trained network is applied online to generate reference foot placements for the humanoid robot. The references are then mapped to the whole-body model through a QP-based inverse dynamics controller. Simulation experiments on the WALK-MAN robot are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating bio-inspired and robust running motions.

95c9c460a17cbe92f56c9b4746d5fdb758d3a2af	a speed trajectory optimization model for rail vehicles using mixed integer linear programming		With the increasing of energy demand, energy conservation is becoming more important in rail transportation. In order to minimize the energy consumption for the transportation system, the speed trajectory optimization and regenerative braking method are applied to improve the energy efficiency in rail vehicle traction system. In this paper, a mathematic model is proposed to locate the optimal trajectory with the given initial speed and braking distance using mixed integer linear programming method. This model could deal with the scenarios under practical constraints such as journey time, route altitude and speed limits. Thus, the model proposed in this paper is able to locate the speed trajectory with minimum energy consumption for practical train operation. Compared with previous research, the previous study could merely deal with monotonous trajectory, but the model in this paper has no such constraints and it able to deal with more complicated application scenarios. Model using mixed integer linear programming method is robust and adaptive in managing constraints. In future work, more constraints such as battery characteristic and motor efficiency will be considered in the model.	integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;traction teampage;trajectory optimization	Zhaoxiang Tan;Shaofeng Lu;Fei Xue;Kai Bao	2017	2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317807	simulation;braking distance;trajectory optimization;energy consumption;efficient energy use;regenerative brake;integer programming;trajectory;engineering;energy conservation;control engineering	Robotics	55.981233796648866	-12.41360081712253	86186

A feed-forward network trained with the error back-propagation algorithm was implemented to model the performance's expressiveness of a professional flutist. In particular, the note duration and vibrato were considered as performance rules (sources of variation) to enhance the robot's performance expressiveness. From the mechanical point of view, the vibrato and lung systems were re-designed to effectively control the proposed music performance rules. An experimental setup was proposed to verify the effectiveness of generating a new score with expressiveness from a model created based on the performance of a professional flutist. As a result, the flutist robot was able of automatically producing an expressive performance similar to the human one from a nominal score.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;computation;control system;early stopping;feedback;feedforward neural network;model selection;overfitting;point of view (computer hardware company);robot;software propagation	Jorge Solis;Kei Suefuji;Koichi Taniguchi;Takeshi Ninomiya;Maki Maeda;Atsuo Takanishi	2007	Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363849	speech recognition;computer science;artificial intelligence;backpropagation;robotics	Robotics	61.35714945535212	-12.174923701109691	86248

Furthermore, we demonstrate how the impulse-based inverted pendulum (IIP) model can be extended to embody rotational information to synthesize more dynamic actions, such as when the feet leave the ground or when slipping (i. e., foot friction).	algorithm;control theory;inverted pendulum;real-time transcription;stepping level	Ben Kenwright	2013	2013 International Conference on Cyberworlds	10.1109/CW.2013.20	impulse;anime;character animation;inverted pendulum;dynamics;pendulum;simulation;nonlinear system;computer science;mathematical model;bipedalism;control theory;computer animation;foot	Robotics	64.15530616548608	-23.494944205928583	86323

Experiment over Newton's cradle, using vision-based velocity estimation, achieves a close agreement with simulation. The presence of friction requires a contact mode analysis via solution of a linear system to check for contact mode consistencies with Coulomb's friction law. Simulation of nine-ball break shots, drawing upon a recent trajectory study [6], yields realistic scenarios. The modeling approach is part of our efforts toward planning for robotic manipulation strategies using impulsive forces.	computation;computational model;linear system;newton;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical integration;robot;velocity (software development)	Feifei Wang;Huan Lin;Yan-Bin Jia	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7354137	classical mechanics;collision response;simulation;angular velocity;bismuth;friction;mathematical model;control theory;mechanics;computational model;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	65.61621421448842	-18.368107206035816	86333

In this study, we propose a method for dynamic programming of biped walking and apply it to a simple passive dynamic walker (PDW) on an irregular slope. The key of the proposed approach is to employ the transient dynamics of the walker just before approaching the falling state in the absence of any controlling input, and to derive the optimal control policy in the low-dimensional latent space. In recent our study, we found that such transient dynamics deeply relates to the basin of attraction for a stable gait. By patching latent coordinates to such a structures in each Poincaré section and defining the reward function according to the survive time of the transient dynamics, so-called escape-times, we construct a Markov decision process (MDP) for the PDW and obtain an optimal policy using a dynamic programming (DP). We will show that the proposed method actually succeeds in controlling the PDW even if the degree of disturbance is relatively large and the dimensionality of coordinates is reduced to lower ones.	amiga walker;dynamic programming;dynamical system;limit cycle;mandelbrot set;markov chain;markov decision process;optimal control;reinforcement learning;rejection sampling;robot	Hiromichi Suetani;Aiko M.

Both schemes are reformulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem. Two recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are then developed for the online solution of the resultant QP problem. The first RNN solver is based on the gradient-descent method and is termed as gradient neural network (GNN). The other solver is based on Zhang 's neural-dynamic method and is termed as Zhang neural network (ZNN). The computer simulations performed on a three-link planar robot arm and the PUMA560 manipulator demonstrate the efficacy of the two redundancy-resolution schemes and two RNN QP-solvers presented, as well as the superiority of the ZNN QP-solver compared to the GNN one. More importantly, the simulation results show that the solutions of the two presented schemes fit well with each other, i.e., the two different-level redundancy-resolution schemes could be equivalent in some sense. The theoretical analysis based on the gradient-descent method and Zhang 's neural-dynamic method further substantiates the new finding about the different-level redundancy-resolution equivalence.	artificial neural network;computer simulation;gradient descent;inverse kinematics;quadratic programming;random neural network;recurrent neural network;resultant;robot;robotic arm;solver;turing completeness;velocity (software development)	Binghuang Cai;Yunong Zhang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2106092	gradient descent;mathematical optimization;computer science;recurrent neural network;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network	Robotics	62.66475103381231	-12.313243494360794	87609

Because of nonlinear time-varying dynamics of these payloads, choosing an appropriate control mechanism and stability strategy can be an engineering challenge. Thus in a new approach, a moving mass control system in conjunction with brain emotional learning-based intelligent control is used to fulfill payload de-tumbling. The contribution of brain emotional learning-based intelligent control in handling the nonlinear timevarying dynamics is shown by comparison with results obtained from a linear proportional–integral controller. The results demonstrate excellent performance of brain emotional learning-based intelligent control in learning dynamic couplings and improvement of behavior without any considerable control system complexity.	angularjs;control system;control theory;effective method;intelligent control;lateral thinking;nonlinear system;online and offline;optimal control;velocity (software development)	Aidin Mohammadi;Morteza Tayefi	2012	J.

The contributions of this paper are (i) An algorithm that transforms a point cloud into a acyclic directed graph; (ii) A motion control law that, from the acyclic directed graph, allows a swarm of robots to achieve the target shape in a decentralized manner; and (iii) A theoretical model, which provides sufficient conditions on the convergence of the control law. The key idea of our approach is to achieve the target shape progressively by inducing an ordering among the robots. More precisely, we construct an acyclic directed graph so that any free robot (i.e., not part of the shape) finds its location with respect to the already placed robots. We prove that, for a 2D shape, it is sufficient for a free robot to calculate its location with respect to two already placed robots to achieve this objective. We validate our method through accurate physics-based simulations of non-holonomic robots.	robot	Carlo Pinciroli;Andrea Gasparri;Emanuele Garone;Giovanni Beltrame	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-73008-0_30	simulation	AI	58.426124705678745	-22.49309693106086	87898
44012af359118ed66f68ee6cf025f02e1d1cf2cd	bearing-based formation control of networked robotic systems with parametric uncertainties		Abstract In this paper, the distributed bearing-based formation control problem for networked robotic systems with parametric uncertainties is investigated. Firstly, under the consideration that the task-space velocity is measurable, a reference control input is designed to achieve a bearing constrained target formation. For the unmeasurable task-space velocity case, an observer-based reference velocity scheme is proposed and only the local relative task-space position measurement is needed to achieve globally bearing-based formation stabilization. By designing a velocity feedback in proportional-integral reference velocity control scheme, at least two leaders can handle the leader–follower formation tracking problem, in which the followers do not need any global information. Finally, some simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control laws.	consensus dynamics;robot	Xiaolei Li;Xiaoyuan Luo;Jiange Wang;Yakun Zhu;Xin-Ping Guan	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2018.04.052	observer (quantum physics);machine learning;artificial intelligence;bearing (mechanical);control theory;parametric statistics;mathematics;measure (mathematics)	Robotics	65.47424053827396	-12.6614013301952	87908

Good dynamic and static performance of servo system requires controlling inertia robustly. In order to get the moment of rotational inertia, online identification methods based on model reference adaptive identification (MRAI) were developed in this paper. Then a well-trained neural network supplies the PI controller with suitable gain according to each operating condition pair (inertia, angular velocity error, and angular velocity) detected. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed self-tuning PI control technique based on neural network, the simulation was executed in this research. The simulation results show that the method not only enhances the fast tracking performance, but also increases the robustness of the synchronous motor drive.	angularjs;artificial neural network;self-tuning;servo;simulation;velocity (software development)	Jianguang Zhu;Zhifeng Zhang;Renyuan Tang	2008	2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2008.325	control engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.40102738518003	-10.70909077107523	87955

This framework relies on a look-up table that stores precomputed optimal solutions to boundary value problems (assuming no obstacles), which form the directed edges of a precomputed motion planning roadmap. A sampling-based motion planning algorithm then leverages such a precomputed roadmap to compute online an obstacle-free trajectory. Machine learning techniques are employed to minimize the number of online solutions to boundary value problems required to compute the neighborhoods of the start state and goal regions. This approach is demonstrated to reduce online planning times up to six orders of magnitude. Simulation results are presented and discussed. Problem-specific framework modifications are then discussed that would allow further computation time reductions.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;collision detection;computation;constrained optimization;control theory;convex function;finite-state machine;kinodynamic planning;lookup table;machine learning;mathematical optimization;motion planning;nonlinear system;precomputation;real-time clock;real-time locating system;robot;sampling (signal processing);simulation;state space;time complexity;trajectory optimization	Ross E.

4fae07c6df7fc875e05e5052abeb634997840d3f	a new gap-based collision avoidance method for mobile robots		This paper presents a new concept, the “Directly Navigable Gap”, for reactive obstacle avoidance. A directly navigable gap DNG is defined as the gap that a robot can safely navigate through by executing only a single motion command. With this concept, it has been possible to achieve navigation in unknown cluttered environments, similar to the gap-based obstacle avoidance methods (e.g the Nearness-Diagram Navigation). Compared to these methods, however, our approach avoids the limitation of being prone to oscillatory and unstable motion, improving their navigation performance, especially in narrow spaces. Experimental results are presented to verify the outstanding performance of the proposed DNG approach. Moreover, a discussion and comparison with existing gap-based methods is reported where the DNG approach generates less-oscillatory, safer, and faster trajectories than its counterparts.	autonomous robot;collision detection;control theory;diagram;digital negative;mobile robot;neural oscillation;obstacle avoidance;performance evaluation;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Muhannad Mujahed;Bärbel Mertsching	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR)	10.1109/SSRR.2016.7784302	computer vision;simulation;engineering;communication	Robotics	60.781360183412886	-23.14543193123381	88412

A neural network (NN) is introduced to approximate the dynamics of the follower and its leader using online weight tuning. Furthermore, a novel NN observer is designed to estimate the linear and angular velocities of both the follower robot and its leader. It is shown, by using the Lyapunov theory, that the errors for the entire formation are uniformly ultimately bounded while relaxing the separation principle. In addition, the stability of the formation in the presence of obstacles, is examined using Lyapunov methods, and by treating other robots in the formation as obstacles, collisions within the formation are prevented. Numerical results are provided to verify the theoretical conjectures.	angularjs;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;block cipher mode of operation;consensus dynamics;feedback;input/output;lyapunov fractal;neural network simulation;optimal control;robot (device);separation principle;collision	Travis Dierks;Sarangapani Jagannathan	2010	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2025508	mobile robot;simulation;stability;backstepping;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;feedback;mathematics;robot control;obstacle avoidance;torque;artificial neural network;separation principle;robot kinematics	Robotics	63.70059784252877	-10.911747789957177	88445
0ddd248740976deaa2ca724d702a12991cb748d5	deep learning for robotic mass transport cloaking		We consider the problem of Mass Transport Cloaking using mobile robots. The robots carry sources that collectively counteract a chemical agent released in the environment. The goal is to steer the mass flux around a desired region so that it remains unaffected by the external concentration. We formulate the problem of controlling the robot positions and release rates as a PDE-constrained optimization, where the propagation of the chemical is modeled by the Advection-Diffusion (AD) PDE. Since discretization-based methods, such as the Finite Element method, are computationally demanding for time-dependent problems, we use a Deep Neural Network (NN) to approximate the solution of the PDE. Particularly, we propose a novel loss function for the NN that utilizes the variational form of the AD-PDE and allows us to reformulate the planning problem as an unsupervised modelbased learning problem. Our loss function is discretization-free and highly parallelizable. Unlike passive cloaking methods that use metamaterials to steer the mass flux, our method is the first to use mobile robots to actively control the concentration levels and create safe zones independent of environmental conditions.

The algorithm explores the state-space using a bi-directional rapidly exploring random tree (biRRT) in order to find a feasible trajectory between an initial and goal state. By incrementally scheduling LQR controllers, it attempts to connect states so as to link the two trees. These attempts are evaluated by verifying that the connected state is inside the controllable area of an infinite time horizon controller at the goal. This allows for a rapid delineation of equivalent neighborhoods in the state-space. As a result, random exploration is terminated as soon as a feasible solution is made possible by feedback means, avoiding oversampling and partially introducing optimal actions at the neighborhood of the connection. The algorithm is demonstrated and compared against a biRRT using single-link pendulum and cart-pole swing-up tasks amongst obstacles, the latter showing a nearly order of magnitude more efficient search.	algorithm;automation;control theory;dynamic programming;feedback;gs/os;motion planning;nonlinear system;optimal control;oversampling;rapidly-exploring random tree;roland gs;scheduling (computing);state space;the australian;verification and validation;vii;winsock;workspace	Guilherme J.

Assuming that the sensor nodes can adjust their transmission power depending on the distance ρ between the pursuer and pursuee according to the usual power law ρ−α, the task is to find the optimal trajectory of the pursuer minimizing the total transmission energy. We approach this classical control theoretic problem by the method of dynamic programming. The cost function, describing the transmission cost with an optimal policy, factorizes into radial and angular functions. The partial differential equation governing the cost function can then be reduced to an ordinary differential equation for the angular function. This equation as well as the related optimal trajectories can be solved numerically. The qualitative behavior of the trajectories is also discussed. The trajectories are self-similar in the sense that any magnification of an optimal trajectory is also an optimal trajectory for different initial conditions.	angularjs;dynamic programming;initial condition;loss function;numerical analysis;pursuit-evasion;radial (radio);self-similarity;sensor node;theory;velocity (software development)	Attila Vidács;Jorma T.

In order to tackle this problem, we propose a sliding mode controller based on a dynamic model that we obtained using the conformal geometric algebra (CGA) approach. An important contribution of this paper is the development of algorithms using the CGA framework. The CGA framework permits us to use lines, points, and other geometric entities to obtain the Lagrange equations of the system. The references for the joints of the robot were obtained in a bio-inspired way following the kinematics of a walking human body. The first and second derivatives of the reference signal were obtained via an exact robust differentiator based on a high-order sliding mode. We analyzed the performance of the proposed control schemes by using bio-inspired walking patterns and simulations.	advanced process control;algorithm;british informatics olympiad;conformal geometric algebra;differentiator;entity;euler–lagrange equation;humanoid robot;mathematical model;perturbation theory;real-time computing;real-time transcription;robust control;simulation	Jose Oviedo-Barriga;Luis Enrique González Jiménez;Bernardino Castillo-Toledo;Eduardo Bayro-Corrochano	2015	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574714000216	control engineering;computer vision;control theory	Robotics	66.73876694335569	-16.321579022917547	89423

However, the steering law can not work when the Jacobian matrix is singular and its pseudo-inverse is indefinite. To avoid the conditions stated above, a new steering law is designed using radial basis function(RBF) neural networks. This algorithm can output the desired gimbal angles directly according to the momentum command. And also, this algorithm can deal with the singular conditions since the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian matrix is not needed.

Recursive least square (RLS), evolutionary genetic algorithms (GAs), general regression neural network (GRNN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithms are proposed to develop the mechanisms of an AVC system. The controller is designed on the basis of optimal vibration suppression using a plant model. A simulation platform of a flexible beam system in transverse vibration using a finite difference method is considered to demonstrate the capabilities of the AVC system using RLS, GAs, GRNN, and ANFIS. The simulation model of the AVC system is implemented, tested, and its performance is assessed for the system identification models using the proposed algorithms. Finally, a comparative performance of the algorithms in implementing the model of the AVC system is presented and discussed through a set of experiments.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;artificial neural network;experiment;finite difference method;genetic algorithm;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;inference engine;machine learning;neuro-fuzzy;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;simulation;system identification;transverse wave;zero suppression	A.

This demands a detailed landing gear model running in real-time. We developed the model and verified its validity by contrast with flight test data. It is accurate sufficiently and very suitable for real-time flight simulation to represent complex ground reaction behavior under various conditions and occasions. Based on this model, we realized a landing gear class in a unified flight simulation framework written in C++ and successfully applied the whole simulation codes through S-function in a PC-based experimental flight simulator. Because of the unique features of object-oriented design principles, the software framework presented here is structural, transplantable and convenient to maintain. The constitution and the quality of the simulator reveal that it would have cause to decrease the cost for developing a flight simulator with higher fidelity in future. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In order to reduce this phenomenon, the excessive grasping force needs to be limited. Based on contact-impact force model, a fuzzy logic system for stiffness estimation determined by contact force and its gradient is presented. In order to avoid undesired deformation, the maximum grasping force of the soft object is set up by experimental data. Then, a fuzzy control model is proposed to modify initial desired force.

The general approach is to augment the nominal system with disturbances, i.e. to build a disturbance model, and to estimate the state and disturbance from output measurements. Some alternatives are available, which are based on a non augmented system with state disturbance observer, or on velocity form representations of the system to be controlled. In this paper, we review the disturbance model approach and two different approaches in a coherent framework. Then, differently from what is reported in the literature, we show that the two alternative formulations are indeed particular cases of the general disturbance model approach.	algorithm;coherence (physics);velocity (software development)	Gabriele Pannocchia	2015	2015 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2015.7330597	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	62.93880540484836	-14.26146317070082	90430
3ead21e190fa86b3b0da0a735d41dadc4dac2c6c	fast uav trajectory optimization using bilevel optimization with analytical gradients		This paper presents an efficient optimization framework that solves trajectory optimization problems efficiently by decoupling state variables from timing variables, thereby decomposing a challenging nonlinear programming (NLP) problem into two easier subproblems. With timing fixed, the state variables can be optimized efficiently using convex optimization, and so the time variables can be optimized using a separate outer optimization. This is a bilevel optimization in which the outer objective function itself requires an optimization to compute. The challenge is that gradient optimization methods require the gradient of the objective function with respect to the time variables, which is not available. Whereas the finite difference method must solve many optimization problems to compute a gradient, this paper proposes a more efficient method: the dual solution (Lagrange multipliers) of the convex optimization problem is exploited to calculate the analytical gradient. Since the dual solution is a by-product of the convex optimization problem, the gradient can be obtained “for free” with high accuracy. The framework is demonstrated on solving minimum-jerk trajectory optimization problems in safety corridors for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Experiments demonstrate that bilevel optimization improves performance over a standard NLP solver, and analytical gradients outperforms finite differences. With a 40 ms cutoff time, our approach achieves over 8 times better suboptimality than the current state-of-theart.	aerial photography;benders decomposition;bilevel optimization;convex optimization;coupling (computer programming);finite difference method;gradient descent;humanoid robot;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;motion planning;natural language processing;newton;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;program optimization;real-time clock;real-time computing;solver;trajectory optimization;unmanned aerial vehicle	Weidong Sun;Gao Tang;Kris Hauser	2018	CoRR			EDA	55.54080786462399	-12.714065488605891	90502

5ea47ee72a4d4d0fdeff1aa9336cd6fc1d99b238	versatile ventilation and air conditioning operation: gaussian process regression for temperature field prediction		Comfort oriented control approaches require detailed knowledge of the spatial room conditions, especially how the temperature is affected by diverse air conditioning and ventilation operation. This paper presents different modeling approaches based on Gaussian Process Regression for the prediction of the temperature field using the example of an open-plan office equipped with randomly distributed sensors. In addition to a common location-based modeling approach, a distance-based model is introduced. Furthermore, ventilation condition, as well as additional boundary conditions, are taken into account. The investigated models are compared in regard to their predictive quality and ability to adapt to changing air conditioning operation. A CFD simulation is used as a reference for the evaluation of the model's quality. It is shown that the application of a Gaussian process model provides a detailed knowledge of the spatial temperature distribution and allows for prediction of the impact of diverse ventilation conditions, such that disturbance compensation and local actuation of temperatures can be enabled for future control concepts.	consistency model;gaussian process;kriging;location (geography);location-based service;process modeling;randomness;sensor;simulation;vacuum cleaner	Janine Guenther;Oliver Sawodny	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431040	control engineering;computer science;air conditioning;control theory;ventilation (architecture);boundary value problem;kriging;data modeling;gaussian process;computational fluid dynamics;atmospheric model	ML	54.6707553798464	-11.997806299554814	90859

However, a huge step can only be achieved step by step which may be relatively small at the beginning. Robotic exploration can provide necessary information needed to do the further step safely, with less cost, more conveniently. Trajectory generation for a robotic vehicle is an essential part of the total mission planning. To save energy by exploiting possible resources such as wind will assist a robotic explorer extend its life span and perform tasks more reliably. In this paper, we propose to utilize Nonlinear Trajectory Generation (NTG) methodology to generate energy efficient trajectores for the JPL Aerobot by exploiting wind. The Aerobot model is decoupled into longitudinal and lateral dynamics with control inputs as elevator deflection δe, thrust demand δT, vectoring angle δv for the longitudinal motion, aileron deflection δa, rudder deflection δr for the lateral motion. The outputs are the velocities and orientation of the Aerobot. The Aerobot state space model parameters are obtained from experimental identification on AURORA Airship since the actual JPL Aerobot is similar to the AURORA Airship. In this paper, the results show that with the state-space model, the proposed trajectory generation method can guide the Aerobot to take advantage of previously known wind profile to generate an energy-efficient trajectory.	aerobot;lateral thinking;robot;rudder;state space;state-space representation;thrust	Weizhong Zhang;Tamer Inanc;Alberto Elfes	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5654461	robot;planet;control engineering;life expectancy;atmospheric model;simulation;aerospace engineering;computer science;state space;engineering;artificial intelligence;state-space representation;trajectory;mathematical model;control theory;efficient energy use	Robotics	61.8927158500024	-19.35239484316598	91144

The braking system for an HDT is composed of three subsystems: Jake (engine) brake, transmission retarder and pneumatic (air) brake. Judicious combination of these three subsystems for achieving a desired braking torque is critical for both safety and performance. Based on the two different brake modes, the combination of the engine brake and the air brake and the combination of the transmission retarder and the air brake, two different control designs are proposed such that the total braking torque tracks its target value rapidly and the truck follows its leading truck in speed with a constant gap distance.

However, this problem has not been seriously addressed until recently. The two robot manipulators have to follow complicated trajectories to maintain a minimum interaction force with the flexible beam. These trajectories are very complicated and not suitable for real time systems. In this article, three approximation methods of the optimal trajectories and a compliant control scheme are introduced. The first one uses a piece-wise linear approximation of the optimal trajectories, while the second one uses adaptive piece-wise linear approximation. The third method applies a continuous approximation of the optimal trajectories using an ellipsoid. Finally, a compliant motion scheme is proposed to reduce the interaction forces and moments in the first method. The stability of the proposed system is investigated. Experimental results encourage the proposed schemes.		Omar M. Al-Jarrah;Yuan F.

Analogously, even though statically stable multi-wheeled robots are easier to control, they are energetically less efficient and have low accelerations to avoid tipping over. In contrast, the ballbot is an underactuated, nonholonomically constrained mobile robot, whose upward equilibrium point has to be stabilised by active control. In this work, we derive coordinate-invariant, reduced, Euler–Poincare equations of motion for the ballbot. By means of partial feedback linearisation, we obtain two independent passive outputs with corresponding storage functions and utilise these to come up with energy-shaping control laws which move the system along the trajectories of a new Lagrangian system whose desired equilibrium point is asymptotically stable by construction.

To assist in the selection of learning rates, this paper investigates robotic system sensitivity to neural network (NN) learning rate. The work reported here consists of experimental and simulation results. A neural network controller module, developed for the purpose of experimental evaluation of neural network controller performance of a CRS Robotics Corporation A460 robot, allows testing of NN controllers using real-time iterative learning. The A460 is equipped with a joint position proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controller. The neural network module supplies a signal to com­ pensate for remaining errors in the PID-controlled system. A robot simulation, which models this PID-controlled A460 robot and NN controller, was also developed to allow the calculation of sensitivity to the NN learning rate. This paper describes the implementation of three NN architectures: the error back-propagation (EBP) NN, mix­ ture of experts (ME) NN, and manipulator operations using value encoding (MOVE) NN. The sensitivity of joint trajectory error of three NN controllers to learning rate was investigated using both simulation and experimentation. Similar results were obtained from the robot experiments and the dynamic simulation. These results of state sensitivity to NN learning rate confirm that the MOVE NN is least sensitive to learning rate, implying that selection of suitable learning rates for this NN architecture for the system considered is accomplished more readily than other NN architectures.

The proposed method succeeds by using a supervisory inertia matrix when updating the neural network weights. The supervisory matrix does not need to accurately model the real inertia matrix to achieve accurate trajectory tracking.

Dealing with the influence of lateral impact disturbances greatly increases the complexity of control in 3D space. Inspired by biomechanical studies, this paper constructs a control strategy based on the spring-loaded inverted pendulum principle (SLIP) for legged locomotion under lateral impact disturbances. This strategy, named 3D-HFC, is composed of three core modules: touchdown angle control, body attitude angle control and energy compensation. The first module regulates the forward/lateral running velocities such that lateral velocity recovers to zero after impact, the second maintains the body posture without being influenced by external forces, and the third compensates energy loss to ensure a desired hopping height. These three parts operate commonly to achieve the APEX state variables converging to the desired value in each running cycle, so as for the system to keep stable periodic motion. The simulations of running systems bearing different force impacts are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the 3D-HFC strategy, indicating that the proposed approach can reject impact disturbances effectively.	3d printing;algorithm;control theory;experiment;fault tolerance;feedback;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;hybrid fibre-coaxial;inverted pendulum;lateral computing;lateral thinking;poor posture;prototype;simulation;velocity (software development)	Bin Han;Xin Luo;Qingyu Liu;Tao Zhang;Xuedong Chen	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7418820	control engineering;von neumann stability analysis;simulation;engineering;control theory;feedback;attitude control	Robotics	66.6919471596949	-18.020710310737748	92159

A novel problem formulation is proposed that addresses a number of important multiagent missions. The coverage goal, which is to cover a given search domain using multiple mobile sensors such that each point is surveyed until a certain preset level is achieved, is formulated in a mathematically precise problem statement. A control law is developed that guarantees to meet the coverage goal. This control law is modified to guarantee that a partially connected fleet also attains the coverage goal. Finally, a collision avoidance component is added to the controller to guarantee that the agents do not collide. The new controller is shown to safely achieve coverage.

The contribution is that rigorous mathematical proofs of these properties are presented, most of which have not bee n reported in existing literatures. We first give some properties regarding switch points and accelerating/decelerating cu rves of the NI method. Then, for the fact that when kinematic constraints are considered, the original version of NI which only considers torque constraints may result in failure of trajectory planning, we give the concrete failure conditions with rigorous mathematical proof. Accordingly, a failure detection algorithm is given in a ‘run-and-test’ manner. Some simulation result s on a unicycle vehicle are provided to verify those presented properties. Note that though thoseknown properties are not discovered first, their mathematical proofs are given first i n this letter. The detailed proofs make the theory ofNI more complete and help interested readers to gain a thorough understandin g of the method.	algorithm;numerical integration;numerical method;simulation	Peiyao Shen;Xuebo Zhang;Yongchun Fang	2016	CoRR			Theory	65.90572688543652	-18.921350152562844	92419

In this paper, we consider motion planning for humanoid robots based on the concept of virtual holonomic constraints. At first, recorded kinematic data of particular human motions are analyzed in order to extract consistent geometric relations among various joint angles defining the instantaneous postures. Second, a simplified human body representation leads to dynamics of an underactuated mechanical system with parameters based on anthropometric data. Motion planning for humanoid robots of similar structure can be carried out by considering solutions of reduced dynamics obtained by imposing the virtual holonomic constraints that are found in human movements. The relevance of such a reduced mathematical model in accordance with the real human motions under study is shown. Since the virtual constraints must be imposed on the robot dynamics by feedback control, the design procedure for a suitable controller is briefly discussed.	algorithm;anthropometry;approximation algorithm;control theory;feedback;humanoid robot;kempe chain;mathematical model;motion planning;reduced dynamics;relevance;robotics;simulation;system dynamics;underactuation	Uwe Mettin;Pedro X.

The parameters of all these hysteresis models have been experimentally identified using evolutionary optimization algorithms. Each of the identified hysteresis models is suitable for an additional feedforward control action in an existing nonlinear control structure for a high-speed linear axis that is actuated by pneumatic muscles to further reduce the tracking error. This cascaded nonlinear control structure consists of fast underlying control loops for the internal muscle pressures and an outer adaptive backstepping control loop for both the carriage position and the mean muscle pressure. Here, the adaptive control part counteracts nonlinear friction and the remaining model uncertainty. Comprehensive experimental results from an implementation of the proposed control approach on a test rig at the Chair of Mechatronics, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany, point out both the benefits and efficiency of the corresponding feedforward hysteresis compensation strategies.	algorithm;control flow;control system;experiment;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;hysteresis;least squares;mathematical optimization;maxwell (microarchitecture);mechatronics;nonlinear system;optic axis of a crystal;support vector machine	Harald Aschemann;Dominik Schindele	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2287217	control engineering;simulation;adaptive control;pneumatic actuator;hysteresis;engineering;control theory;feed forward;evolutionary computation	Robotics	67.84844510130014	-14.842113736953797	92702

There are many researches on the control methods of inverted pendulum. Using Backstepping [1–6] for the controller design of the linear Inverted Pendulum is presented in detail in this paper. This method does not need linearizing the system, and can design the controller directly and recursively, meanwhile, the designed controller remains the useful nonlinear terms and can be closer to the reality with strong Robustness. The experimental platform simulation demonstrated the method has the characteristics of fast stabilization time, great anti-interference capabilities and good control effects.	control theory;instability;interference (communication);inverted pendulum;nonlinear system;recursion;robustness (computer science);simulation	Lixia Deng;Shengxiang Gao	2011	Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronic & Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology	10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6023033	robust control;control engineering;inverted pendulum;pendulum;simulation;engineering;double pendulum;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	66.21503239934489	-12.040043103926752	93080

The case of drones autonomously flying according to a pre-defined route is clearly the most interesting one for the deployment of such applications. Yet, autonomic flight requires that a drone is able to maintain stability – in terms of a target attitude – in spite of external disturbances (e.g. gusts of wind), with no human intervention. This is traditionally done with a PID (proportional integral derivative) controller, which takes as input the deviations from the target, and supplies in output the indication of how to act on the drone engines so as to restore the proper attitude. Two orders of problems must be dealt with when deploying a PID controller. First, the parameters weighing the input components must be properly tuned in order to guarantee attitude restoring, and to avoid oscillations of the system. Second, the PID output must be translated into commands to the drone engines so as to achieve the desired behavior. The former aspect can be solved either by hand, or with a number of automatic methods proposed in the literature (e.g. [1, 2]). Those methods involve complex mathematical models and are considerably time-consuming. As far as the latter aspect is concerned, there are hardware constraints that impede to abruptly change speed or spin of rotors and propellers, which otherwise may be damaged. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model simplified yet effective in yielding appropriate parameters to implement an accurate controller, without the need of a complex preliminary calibration of the mechanical system. We describe our policies to apply controller indications to the drone hardware. We validate both model and policies through experiments.	aerial photography;autonomic networking;experiment;mathematical model;pid;software deployment;unmanned aerial vehicle	Federico Pedersini;Andrea Toscano;Elena Pagani	2015		10.1145/2750675.2750676	simulation;aerospace engineering;engineering;aeronautics;flight simulator	Robotics	61.19604335453477	-16.21542551470001	93086

In this paper, we present the BP-MPSO algorithm for PUMA robot vacuum path planning that can well enhance the efficiency robot execution. Firstly, according to PUMA robot’s mechanical structure, the BP algorithm condition modeling and an attitude modeling were presented. Secondly, for the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) limitation in searching space and easily running into local optimal points, the re-initialization mechanism using the global information feedback to modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm was introduced. Finally, the BP-MPSO algorithm is combined with BP network algorithm and the MPSO algorithm, which can not only avoids the difficulty in solving the inverse motion equations but also ensures that the optimal solution and can obtains the global optimal aim instead of falling into local extremer.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;hybrid algorithm;mathematical optimization;motion planning;particle swarm optimization;robot;robotic vacuum cleaner;software propagation	Qinghua Su;Juntao Li	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-64861-3_1	equations of motion;programmable universal machine for assembly;motion planning;robot control;robot;algorithm;computer science;particle swarm optimization	Robotics	59.39650786535532	-20.38655111546688	93148

However, most of these models do not explicitly characterize the robotpsilas rotational inertia, a critical component of its dynamics, and especially of its balance. To remedy this, we have earlier introduced the reaction mass pendulum (RMP), an extension of the inverted pendulum, which models the rotational inertia and angular momentum of a robot through its centroidal composite rigid body (CCRB) inertia. However, we presented only the kinematic mapping between a robot and its corresponding RMP. Focussing in-depth on planar mechanisms, here we derive the dynamic equations of the RMP and explicitly compute the parameters that it must possess in order to establish equivalence with planar compass gait robot. In particular, we show that, a) an angular momentum equality between the robot and RMP does not necessarily guarantee kinetic energy equality, and b) a cyclic robot gait may not result in a cyclic RMP movement. The work raises the broader question of how quantitatively similar the simpler models of humanoid robot must be in order for them to be of practical use.	angularjs;emoticon;humanoid robot;inverted pendulum;mass effect trilogy;risk management plan;time-scale calculus;turing completeness	Ambarish Goswami	2008	Humanoids 2008 - 8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/ICHR.2008.4755943	simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	68.02479692521756	-20.144178030657127	93217

To achieve this mission efficiently, we implemented a simple and decentralised task allocation mechanism based on individual activation-thresholds, i.e. the energy level of the nest under which a given robot decides to go collect food-items. The experiments show that such a mechanism — already studied among social insects — results in an efficient dynamical task allocation even under the noisy conditions prevailing in real experiments.

cf09517644138be0815ede129156c115f25658b9	nonlinear multi-layer consensus seeking of vehicular platoons		In this paper, non-linear estimators and feed-forward actions are designed to solve a vehicular platoon control problem. In particular, these estimators are useful in implementation of a Multi-Layer Consensus Seeking approach to the platooning problem. In the Multi-Layer approach the feed-forward part is built separately from the feedback part, based on desired trajectories. This opens the way to study different methods to compute this information. In this work, sliding mode algorithms are employed to generate the desired trajectories and also to compute the feed-forward control input of each vehicle. In this way, a velocity-dependent inter-vehicle spacing policy can be realized without using derivatives of the vehicular acceleration to compute the feed-forward input. Furthermore, a full-state feedback implementation scheme is discussed. The vehicles are modeled with heterogeneous linear longitudinal dynamics. The proposed algorithms are validated through experiments on automated cars.	algorithm;experiment;feed forward (control);layer (electronics);nonlinear system;velocity (software development)	Mauro Fusco;Elham Semsar-Kazerooni;Jeroen C.

The technique is guaranteed to find a path if one exists at the resolution, and all paths returned are safe. The planner can handle any polyhedral geometry of robot and obstacles, including disjoint and highly concave unions of polyhedra.The planner uses standard graphics hardware to rasterize configuration space obstacles into a series of bitmap slices, and then uses dynamic programming to create a navigation function (a discrete vector-valued function) and to calculate paths in this rasterized space. The motion paths which the planner produces are minimal with respect to an L1 (Manhattan) distance metric that includes rotation as well as translation.Several examples are shown illustrating the competence of the planner at generating planar rotational and translational plans for complex two and three dimensional robots. Dynamic motion sequences, including complicated and non-obvious backtracking solutions, can be executed in real time.	backtracking;bitmap;computer graphics;concave function;dynamic programming;graphics hardware;motion planning;navigation function;path (graph theory);polyhedron;rasterisation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;robot;taxicab geometry	Jed Lengyel;Mark Reichert;Bruce Randall Donald;Donald P.

A TUSK system consists of a rigid undersea wing (or kite) attached by a flexible tether to a support structure on the ocean surface or floor. A turbine is mounted on the undersea kite to harness hydrokinetic energy from an ocean current when the kite moves in high-speed, cross-current motions. In this paper, we adopt a six degree of freedom aircraft model that incorporate the translational motion of the kite center of gravity and rotational dynamics of the Euler angles. To simplify the analysis, we assume a fixed support structure, uniform current conditions and a straight-line, inelastic tether. This results in an under-actuated system whose boundedness is addressed with the Lyapunov method and comparison principle. A passivity based PD controller is proposed to control the kite trajectory and orientation. A baseline simulation for typical design parameter values in a TUSK system is studied.	baseline (configuration management);energy systems language;euler;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nautical chart;program optimization;simulation;transient (computer programming);velocity (software development)	Haocheng Li;David J.

Since it doesn't require referential motion trajectories defined by time, it can achieve longitudinal walking which is flexible enough to follow an arbitrary referential velocity given at random timing and to cope with unexpected external forces. The controller is developed based on the dynamics morphing, which is a framework to enable seamless transitions between various motions by continuously morphing the dynamical structure of the feedback system. Thus, it is compatible with the standing, the stepping-out for emergency, and so forth. Three key techniques are (i) morphing from the standing stabilizer with a stable equilibrium point to the velocity-follower which lacks any equilibrium points, (ii) a foot control maneuver which is automatically activated together with the morphing into the velocity following control, and (iii) automatic update of the referential position of COM for safety when going back to the standing stabilization. Although it is based on the same principle with the simulated regulator proposed by the author, the proposed controller is advantageous to it as it doesn't require an additional automaton to update the referential position of COM. The idea was examined through interactive computer simulations.	automaton;computer simulation;morphing;seamless3d;stepping level;velocity (software development)	Tomomichi Sugihara	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385699	control engineering;motion control;dynamics;simulation;engineering;trajectory;control theory;feedback;oscillation;foot	Robotics	65.1803486089917	-18.31485322993856	95298

More specifically, the control of contact interaction is of crucial importance for robots that will actively interact with their environment. Model-based controllers such as inverse dynamics or operational space control are very appealing as they offer both high tracking performance and compliance. However, while widely used for fully actuated systems such as manipulators, they are not yet standard controllers for legged robots such as humanoids. Indeed such robots are fundamentally different from manipulators as they are underactuated due to their floating-base and subject to switching contact constraints. In this paper we present an inverse dynamics controller for legged robots that use torque redundancy to create an optimal distribution of contact constraints. The resulting controller is able to minimize, given a desired motion, any quadratic cost of the contact constraints at each instant of time. In particular we show how this can be used to minimize tangential forces during locomotion, therefore significantly improving the locomotion of legged robots on difficult terrains. In addition to the theoretical result, we present simulations of a humanoid and a quadruped robot, as well as experiments on a real quadruped robot that demonstrate the advantages of the controller.	agile software development;algorithm;computer hardware;control point (mathematics);expect;experiment;humanoid robot;inverse dynamics;kernel (linear algebra);real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation	Ludovic Righetti;Jonas Buchli;Michael Mistry;Stefan Schaal	2011	2011 11th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/Humanoids.2011.6100832	mobile robot;simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;robot locomotion;control theory;robot control	Robotics	65.3829092060247	-20.85567159775536	95328

At the velocity level, the linearized Jacobian equation for such a redundant system represents an underspecified system of algebraic equations, which can be subject to a set of constraints such as obstacles in the workspace and various limits on the joint motions. A method, which we named the FSP (Full Space Parameterization), has recently been developed to resolve such underspecified systems with constraints that may vary in time and in number during a single trajectory. The application of the method to motion planning problems with obstacle and joint limit avoidance was discussed in some of our previous work. In this paper, we present the treatment in the FSP of a non-holonomic constraint on the platform motion, and give corresponding analytical solutions for resolving the redundancy with a general optimization criterion. Comparative trajectories involving a 10 d.0.f. mobile manipulator testbed moving with and without a non-holonomic constraint for the platform motion, are presented to illustrate the use and efficiency of the FSP approach in motion planning problems for highly kinematically redundant and constrained systems.	algebraic equation;jacobian matrix and determinant;mathematical optimization;mobile device;mobile manipulator;motion planning;testbed;velocity (software development);workspace	François G.

The proposed manipulator has 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) and enables physical interaction on the sides, as well as below the aerial robot. The design parameters of the manipulator are chosen such that it achieves large and singularity-free workspace in combination with high dexterity. A Global Conditioning Index (GCI) is defined and used as a performance index for the manipulator over its complete workspace. Given the manipulator design parameters, a holistic model of the redundant aerial manipulation system is derived capturing the coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and the manipulator. Free flight experimental studies are utilized to validate the system, demonstrate its redundant DoFs, and evaluate its performance.	aerial photography;aerobot;experiment;google code-in;holism;human–computer interaction;parallel manipulator;robot;workspace	Mina Kamel;Kostas Alexis;Roland Siegwart	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759715	control engineering;database index;kinematics;parallel manipulator;simulation;computer science;engineering;mobile manipulator;control theory	Robotics	68.26297821586624	-21.846864125798774	95676

Based on this information, the effect of the delay is compensated. Specifically, we design a gain switching observer via LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) technique for multiple purpose optimization. An experimental result of synchronization of a mini plant with 3 DC-motors is shown to demonstrate its practical effect on the transmission delay.	basic stamp;consensus dynamics;control system;experiment;linear approximation;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;network packet;nonlinear system;quantization (signal processing);robot;simulation;synchronization (computer science)	Yukinori Nakamura;Kentaro Hirata;Kenji Sugimoto;Kiminao Kogiso	2007	2007 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Intelligent Control	10.1109/ISIC.2007.4450882	control engineering;real-time computing;engineering;processing delay;control theory;transmission delay	Embedded	66.16610647315851	-13.701517156757093	95821
5adee6113c45a8fc0e027e82f770ef3ce614f7ae	trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles in time varying environments using support vector machines		A novel trajectory planning method is proposed in time varying environments for highway driving scenarios. The main objective is to ensure computational efficiency in the approach, while still ensuring collision avoidance with moving obstacles and respecting vehicle constraints such as comfort criteria and roll-over limits. The trajectory planning problem is separated into finding a collision free corridor in space- time domain using a support vector machine (SVM), which means solving a convex optimization problem. After that a time-monotonic path is found in the collision free corridor by solving a simple search problem that can be solved efficiently. The resulting path in space-time domain corresponds to the resulting planned trajectory of the vehicle. The planner is a deterministic search method associated with a cost function that keeps the trajectory kinematically feasible and close to the maximum separating surface, given by the SVM. A kinematic motion model is used to construct motion primitives in the space-time domain representing the non-holonomic behavior of the vehicle and is used to ensure physical constraints on the states of the vehicle such as acceleration, speed, jerk, steer and steer rate. The speed limits include limitations by law and also rollover speed limits. Two highway maneuvers have been used as test scenarios to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;computation;convex optimization;heuristic;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;real-time computing;rollover (key);search problem;stationary process;support vector machine	Mahdi Morsali;Jan Åslund;Erik Frisk	2018	2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2018.8500620	search problem;acceleration;support vector machine;jerk;mathematical optimization;time domain;trajectory;kinematics;convex optimization;computer science	Robotics	60.8730431162052	-17.942229734916904	95863

Further contributions of the paper are explicit foot step targeting during running, leg cross-over avoidance and the embedding of the BID controller into a QP-based whole-body controller. The BID controller is based on the encoding of leg forces and CoM trajectories during stance as polynomial splines, allowing for intuitive and primarily analytical controller design. It allows a real-time implementation, is highly robust against perturbations and enables versatile running patterns. The performance of the control framework is tested in various simulations for a bipedal point-mass model and an articulated multi-body model of the humanoid robot Toro.	agile software development;autonomous system (internet);binary integer decimal;embedded system;explicit and implicit methods;humanoid robot;organizing (structure);perturbation theory;polynomial;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;stepping level	Johannes Englsberger;Pawel Kozlowski;Christian Ott	2015	2015 IEEE-RAS 15th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)	10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2015.7363501	acceleration;simulation;boundary value problem;trajectory;control theory;force;foot	Robotics	67.17588796238638	-18.625596635179736	95959

In particular, from an industry point of view, it is desirable to develop energy saving strategies applicable also to established manufacturing systems, being liable of small possibilities for adjustments. Within this scenario, an engineering method is reported for reducing the total energy consumption of pick-and-place manipulators for given end-effector trajectory. Firstly, an electromechanical model of parallel/serial manipulators is derived. Then, an energy-optimal trajectory is calculated, by means of time scaling, starting from a pre-scheduled trajectory performed at maximum speed (i.e. compatible with actuators limitations). A simulation case study finally shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.	algorithm;energy minimization;image scaling;mathematical optimization;online and offline;parallel manipulator;point of view (computer hardware company);robot end effector;smt placement equipment;scheduling (computing);serial port;simulation	Marcello Pellicciari;Giovanni Berselli;Francesco Leali;Alberto Vergnano	2011	2011 15th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR)	10.1109/ICAR.2011.6088620	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.79101392264023	-21.207682587567117	95979

The proposed control scheme, consisting of an adaptive constrained motion/force controller and a joint torque sliding mode controller, guarantees that motion, force and joint torque tracking errors converge asymptotically to zero without persistent excitation.

Online walking control is indispensable to obtain a stable dynamic walking, even if the walking pattern is provided based on a zero moment point and an angular momentum because modeling errors and external disturbances, which are not expected in the modeling stage, may exist in the actual condition. Considering these issues, this paper proposes a stabilization control, which consists of landing force controller, posture controller and walking pattern generator to walk on the inclined plane. The proposed control does not require a complex dynamic equation of robot and the adjustment of control parameters because it is based on time-domain passivity approach. Moreover, it can guarantee the stability of the controller without requiring any dynamic model information. The proposed control is verified through dynamic walking simulations using Webots simulator.	angularjs;apache axis;game controller;humanoid robot;mathematical model;optic axis of a crystal;poor posture;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;time-scale calculus;zero moment point	Yong-Duk Kim;In-Won Park;Jeong-Ki Yoo;Jong-Hwan Kim	2008	Humanoids 2008 - 8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots	10.1109/ICHR.2008.4755927	simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	66.85973043147452	-17.96060016102788	96107

The robot without tail is underactuated with only 2 drive motors and mass of 35 grams including battery and control electronics. For some surface conditions, OctoRoACH can maintain heading or turning rate using only leg velocity control, and a basic rate-gyro-based heading control system can respond to disturbances, with a closed-loop bandwidth of approximately 1 Hz. Using a modified off-the-shelf servo for the tail drive, the robot responds to turning commands at 4 Hz and up to 400°/sec.	control system;course (navigation);gyro;grams;robot;servo;tail call;velocity (software development);yaws	Andrew O.

In this paper, PersianGulf - an autonomous combined traffic signal controller and route guidance system - will be proposed which has two unique features as compared to similar research. First, it is totally distributed because calculation of optimal routes are done independently in traffic signal controllers of intersections and second, it is totally autonomous because there is no need to communicate/cooperate with either traffic supervisors such as traffic management centers or the vehicles/drivers. Also, Simulation results show that PersianGulf improve the average speed of vehicles significantly in the simulated scenarios.	autonomous robot;guidance system;simulation	Mohammad Khanjary;Karim Faez;Mohammad Reza Meybodi;Masoud Sabaei	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6092889	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;transport engineering;fuzzy set	Robotics	54.27312566485353	-14.295349028852325	96223

In contrast to other works, the design of the reactive and deliberative processes is exclusively oriented to the exploration having both the same importance level. The approach is based on the concepts of expected safe zone and gateway cell. The reactive exploration of the expected safe zone of the robot by means of basic behaviours avoids the presence of local minima. Simultaneously, a planner builds up a decision tree in order to decide between exploring the current expected safe zone or changing to other zone by means of travelling to a gateway cell. Furthermore, the model takes into account the degree of localization of the robots to return to previously explored areas when it is necessary to recover the certainty in the position of the robots. Several simulations demonstrate the validity of the approach. & 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The motion of the aircraft itself during manipulation is considered in order to obtain an accurate trajectory control. The generalized Jacobian of multiarm free-flying space robots is obtained efficiently by regarding the total multilink system as a composite system consisting of two links with a joint. The algorithm can be easily extended to any tree-structured multiarm robot with rotational as well as prismatic joints except for closed-loop structures. An efficient computational algorithm for the resolved acceleration control of the multiarm free-flying robots is also presented. The computational complexities are evaluated and compared to those of fixed-base manipulators. It is shown that the computational complexity for the generalized Jacobian is five times greater than that for fixed-base manipulators whereas the resolved acceleration control requires twice the computation for fixed-base manipulators. >	algorithm;coat of arms;robot	Yasuyoshi Yokokohji;Takeshi Toyoshima;Tsuneo Yoshikawa	1993	IEEE Trans.

However, that does not necessarily mean that human must be maintained as the final authority at all times and on every occasion. Design of authority is crucial for automobile, especially when there is possibility that the driver becomes complacent by trusting the automation excessively and when available time for safety control or information for situation understanding is limited. This paper gives a computer simulation method for analyzing the complacency effect and for investigating the efficacy of the trading of authority, by taking as an example the design of safety control schemes for driving with the adaptive cruise control systems.	automation;computer simulation;control system;humans;trust (emotion)	Toshiyuki Inagaki;Hiroshi Furukawa	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat.

When the braking speed of a train is comparatively high, regenerative braking is prior to the mechanical braking. However, if the regenerative braking energy can not be absorbed by other trains in the same power supply section, the regenerative braking energy may lead to the voltage rising, even have to use dissipative resistance to absorb the surplus energy. The expected situation is that the regenerative braking energy is absorbed by other trains in the same power supply section as much as possible. Multi-train cooperation method is given in this paper, where the speed profile of the trains, selected to absorb the regenerative braking energy, will be partly adjusted. Typically, part of the original speed profile will be replaced by coast-accelerate-coast strategy, the objective is to make the train run as far as possible by only using the distributed regenerative energy. A case is studied based on Beijing Yizhuang Subway line, where speed profiles of two trains are adjusted to absorb the regenerative braking energy generated by a braking train at the same power supply section.	power supply;simulation	Xubin Sun;Hu Cai;Xiaowei Hou;Mengyang Zhang;Hairong Dong	2014	17th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957680	simulation;retarder;engineering;dynamic braking;forensic engineering;mechanical engineering	Robotics	56.016098342068645	-13.557153160887777	96514

The redundant robot should be decomposed into its nonredundant part and an actually redundant subrobot. The Jacobians should be expressed in some intermediate coordinate frames in order to obtain the simplest symbolical expressions. The Jacobian for the nonredundant part should be decomposed into several submatrices of the order 1*1, 2*2 or 3*3. In the case of 3*3 matrices, it is not always possible to obtain the symbolical expressions for SVD. The redundant subrobot Jacobian should also be further decomposed into submatrices of the order m/sub s/*n/sub s/, with m/sub s/ being less or equal to 2. By deriving the symbolical damped least-squares solution, the numerical complexity is reduced about 15 times as compared to the numerical SVD of the Jacobian submatrices of the same order. Simulations at the kinematic control level have shown very low position error and limited joint velocities. >	robot control;singular value decomposition	Manja V.

The algorithm aims to move as few nodes as possible to maintain the dynamic target within the coverage of the network all the time. First we define the tracking uncertainty concept and obtain its derivative with the target dynamics. Then a potential function is set up to represent the network connectivity. The nodes which detect the target broadcast the target state information. A local control strategy is proposed for the node motion to minimize the tracking uncertainty under the connectivity constraint.

This kind of manipulator system may restrict the direction of the end-effector's force depending on which joints are set to passive ones. In the case of operating and transferring a common object, this restriction may give a less effective force and excessive internal force to the object. To use driving force effectively, the question of which joints are set to passive ones must be considered. Therefore, we show the effect of the joint configurations by case studies.

We aim at identifying those methods that achieve better tracking, have a low sensitivity to system uncertainties, and offer a good balance between development effort and end results. A formal approach for solving this problem relies on several practical metrics, which will be introduced herein. Their choice is important, as the comparison results between controllers can vary significantly, depending on the selected criterion. Apart from the quantitative assessment, we also raise aspects which are difficult to quantify, but which must stay in attention when considering the position control problem for this class of hydraulic servo systems.	cylinder seal;servo;single-ended signaling	Adrian Bonchis;Peter I.

The presented composite controller is consisted with an adaptive sliding mode technique to construct an additional disturbance-like signal, and particularly a direct fuzzy controller to approximate the optimal velocity tracking control effort by the adaptive mechanism. Unlike the traditional control strategies, this composite control approach offers a coordinate control objective for the vehicle with an unstable equilibrium and second-order nonholonomic constraints. In addition, with the aid of a posture controller aiming to the tracking error dynamics, the nonholonomic vehicle can track an arbitrary trajectory given by the earth-fixed frame. Numerical simulation results confirm that the proposed controllers can maintain the balance of the unstable suspension, drive the vehicle globally to track any reference trajectory, and guarantee all the signals of the closed-loop system convergent within a compact set.	approximation algorithm;control theory;emoticon;fuzzy control system;inverted pendulum;poor posture;rejection sampling;rendering (computer graphics);robustness (computer science);simulation;underactuation;velocity (software development)	Ming Yue;Shuang Wang;Jianzhong Sun	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2016.01.008	inverted pendulum;simulation;computer science;underactuation;control theory	Robotics	64.7808399713795	-17.130621238985565	97366

Besides, a predictor is proposed since the future trajectory of the mobile robot is not known a priori being it decided online by the user.

In a NGIMU system, an inevitable accumulation error of navigation parameters is produced due to the existence of the dynamic noise of the accelerometer output. When designing an integrated navigation system, which is based on a proposed nine-configuration NGIMU and a single antenna Global Positioning System (GPS) by using the conventional Kalman filter (CKF), the filtering results are divergent because of the complicity of the system measurement noise. So a fuzzy logic adaptive Kalman filter (FLAKF) is applied in the design of NGIMU/GPS. The FLAKF optimizes the CKF by detecting the bias in the measurement and prevents the divergence of the CKF. A simulation case for estimating the position and the velocity is investigated by this approach. Results verify the feasibility of the FLAKF.	fuzzy logic;global positioning system;kalman filter	Mingli Ding;Qi Wang	2005		10.1007/11539506_100	feasibility study;gps/ins;computer science;machine learning;antenna;control theory;extended kalman filter	Robotics	58.14503726591936	-13.430838124281898	97566

The goal of this research is to preserve the versatility of actively controlled humanoids, while reducing their energy consumption. The biped Lucy, powered by pleated pneumatic artificial muscles, has been built and controlled and is able to walk up to a speed of 0.15 m/s. The pressures inside the muscles are controlled by a joint trajectory tracking controller to track the desired joint trajectories calculated by a trajectory generator. However, the actuators are set to a fixed stiffness value. In this paper a compliance controller is presented to reduce the energy consumption by controlling the stiffness. A mathematical formulation has been developed to find an optimal stiffness setting depending on the desired trajectory and physical properties of the system and the proposed strategy has been validated on a pendulum structure powered by artificial muscles. This strategy has not been implemented on the real robot because the walking speed of the robot is currently too slow to benefit already from compliance control.	approximation;controlled grammar;experiment;maxima and minima;national fund for scientific research;pneumatic artificial muscles;robot;robotics;stiffness	Bram Vanderborght;Björn Verrelst;Ronald Van Ham;Michaël Van Damme;Pieter Beyl;Dirk Lefeber	2008	Auton.

Its conceptual design is meant to mimic a human-ridden unicycle. It is an underactuated robot with only two actuators: wheel and pendulum motors, and five degrees of freedom. The wheel motor's function is to provide forward thrust while the pendulum motor provides steering torque. The combination of these forward thrust and steering torque results in gyroscopic effect which makes it possible for ALP Cycle to perform turning/yaw motion. In this paper, two separate linear quadratic integral controllers are designed for wheel and pendulum motors.

a73ee5c25f4dac9b22e86348803948258bf50580	neural lander: stable drone landing control using learned dynamics		Precise trajectory control near ground is difficult for multi-rotor drones, due to the complex ground effects caused by interactions between multi-rotor airflow and the environment. Conventional control methods often fail to properly account for these complex effects and fall short in accomplishing smooth landing. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learningbased robust nonlinear controller (Neural-Lander) that improves control performance of a quadrotor during landing. Our approach blends together a nominal dynamics model coupled with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that learns the highorder interactions. We employ a novel application of spectral normalization to constrain the DNN to have bounded Lipschitz behavior. Leveraging this Lipschitz property, we design a nonlinear feedback linearization controller using the learned model and prove system stability with disturbance rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DNN-based nonlinear feedback controller with stability guarantees that can utilize arbitrarily large neural nets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller significantly outperforms a baseline linear proportional-derivative (PD) controller in both 1D and 3D landing cases. In particular, we show that compared to the PD controller, Neural-Lander can decrease error in z direction from 0.13m to zero, and mitigate average x and y drifts by 90% and 34% respectively, in 1D landing. Meanwhile, NeuralLander can decrease z error from 0.12m to zero, in 3D landing. We also empirically show that the DNN generalizes well to new test inputs outside the training domain.	artificial neural network;autonomous system (internet);baseline (configuration management);control theory;deep learning;interaction;lunar lander (video game series);nonlinear system;r.o.t.o.r.;rejection sampling	G Shi;Xichen Shi;Michael O'Connell;Rose Yu;Kamyar Azizzadenesheli;Anima Anandkumar;Yisong Yue;Soon-Jo Chung	2018	CoRR			ML	62.33101828761839	-12.87877544353172	97690

This paper aims to demonstrate a comparison between two different PID tuning methods which are based on full state feedback Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The two PID tuning methods are implemented for hovering flying mode of quad-rotor model, other flying modes are comparable therefore they are omitted in this paper. The simulation tests were conducted using different PID configurations. The results show that the second method outperforms the first method in term of ease of application, performance and computational time.	computation;pid;r.o.t.o.r.;simulation;time complexity	Fatima Alkhoori;Shamma Bin Safwan;Yahya H.

dde0e224c95afc9f555ebea1baedf53deb1902ca	falling prevention system from external disturbances for humanoid robots		Humanoid robot requires a robust prevention system against external disturbances to protect itself from falling to the ground and to perform its tasks completely. In this paper, a Falling Prevention System for humanoid robot is proposed to avoid falling from the disturbances, and helps humanoid robot recover its balance from external force by taking a step. The algorithm for the Falling Prevention System consists of two processes. First, humanoid robot can perceive whether it is falling or not by using an IMU sensor, and if falling, the center of mass (CoM) and swinging leg trajectories are calculated for the robot to take a step. The CoM and swinging leg trajectories are also used to acquire all joint angles of lower body by inverse kinematics. Furthermore, designed foot trajectory helps humanoid robot minimize its yawing moment. Next, mass-spring-damper system for the robot’s legs is modeled to reduce large impact force from the ground. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through computer simulations for a humanoid robot.	algorithm;computer simulation;humanoid robot;inverse kinematics	Gyeong-Moon Park;Seung-Hwan Baek;Jong-Hwan Kim	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-16841-8_10	computer vision;simulation;humanoid robot	Robotics	65.04511243080078	-22.43727662838585	98037

While some additional tasks can be performed by optimizing a proper objective function, other additional tasks can be performed by satisfying a set of kinematic inequality constraints. In this article, we reformulate a redundancy resolution problem with multiple criteria into a local equality and inequality constrained optimization problem, and propose a method to solve it at velocity level. The proposed method is efficient, especially when the number of additional tasks is larger than the degree of redundancy. It also systematically assigns the priorities between the additional tasks. Besides the computational efficiency, the method has a cyclic property.	constrained optimization;mathematical optimization	Young Whee Sung;Dong Kwon Cho;Myung Jin Chung	1996	J.

0b401bea2c9a19a2378183773bcdecc5f69e09b5	dynamic walking over rough terrains by nonlinear predictive control of the floating-base inverted pendulum		We present a real-time pattern generator for dynamic walking over rough terrains. Our method automatically finds step durations, a critical issue over rough terrains where they depend on terrain topology. To achieve this level of generality, we consider a Floating-base Inverted Pendulum (FIP) model where the center of mass can translate freely and the zero-tilting moment point is allowed to leave the contact surface. This model is equivalent to a linear inverted pendulum with variable center-of-mass height, but its equations of motion remain linear. Our solution then follows three steps: (i) we characterize the FIP contact-stability condition; (ii) we compute feedforward controls by solving a nonlinear optimization over receding-horizon FIP trajectories. Despite running at 30 Hz in a model-predictive fashion, simulations show that the latter is too slow to stabilize dynamic motions. To remedy this, we (iii) linearize FIP feedback control into a constrained linear-quadratic regulator that runs at 300 Hz. We finally demonstrate our solution in simulations with a model of the HRP-4 humanoid robot, including noise and delays over state estimation and foot force control.	ftc fair information practice;factory instrumentation protocol;feedback;feedforward neural network;humanoid robot;inverted pendulum;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;real-time clock;rough set;simulation	Stéphane Caron;Abderrahmane Kheddar	2017	2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2017.8206385	humanoid robot;center of mass;simulation;control engineering;equations of motion;computer science;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;feed forward;inverted pendulum;model predictive control;control theory	Robotics	66.075048472788	-18.16063339652908	98347

Other main features of the algorithm include the use of higher order Adams time-discretization schemes, numerical calculation of Jacobians, and advanced conjugate gradient methods for favorable convergence properties. The algorithm performance is illustrated on an example of off-line vehicle dynamics control optimization based on a realistic high-order vehicle model. The optimized control variables are active rear differential torque transfer and active rear steering road wheel angle, while the optimization tasks are trajectory tracking and roll minimization for a double lane change maneuver.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation through time;conjugate gradient method;control theory;discretization;euler method;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical integration;numerical stability;online and offline;optimal control;robust control;run time (program lifecycle phase)	Josip Kasac;Josko Deur;Branko Novakovic;Ilya V.

Such agents are all identical, simple, autonomous and can only communicate indirectly through the environment. These agents secrete two types of pheromone, one to mark trails towards the goal and another to mark trails back to the starting point. Three pheromone perception strategies are proposed (Strategy A, B and C). Agents that use strategy A perceive the desirability of a neighbouring location as the difference between levels of attractive and repulsive pheromone in that location. With strategy B, agents perceive the desirability of a location as the quotient of levels of attractive and repulsive pheromone. Agents using strategy C determine the product of the levels of attractive pheromone with the complement of levels of repulsive pheromone. We conduct experiments to confirm directionality as emergent property of trails formed by agents that use each strategy. In addition, we compare path formation speed and the quality of the formed path under changes in the environment. We also investigate each strategy's robustness in environments that contain obstacles. Finally, we investigate how adaptive each strategy is when obstacles are eventually removed from the scene and find that the best strategy of these three is strategy A. Such a strategy provides useful guidelines to researchers in further applications of swarm intelligence metaphors for complex problem solving.	autonomous robot;emergence;experiment;problem solving;shortest path problem;swarm intelligence	Colin Chibaya;Shaun Bangay	2007		10.1145/1292491.1292493	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;communication	AI	56.11606615649321	-23.82729381468633	98514

2ee2dd4f0fe4e66d30d27f2ac88236743d3cb5d0	system identification & attitude control of avian-type flyer with flight test		This paper investigates system identification of the longitudinal and lateral linear models and control of an avian-type flyer with flight test. Longitudinal and lateral linear models are separately adopted by referring to fixed-wing aircraft cases. System identification is performed by exciting the avian-type flyer with doublet and multi-step inputs. Analyzing flight data shows that flapping motion of the main wing causes repetitive vibrations to the flyer to affect its built-in sensors. Unconstrained nonlinear optimization is applied to estimate system parameters by minimizing the difference between flight data and simulated data from the estimated linear models. As the result of system identification, the small-sized flapping aircraft used in this study shows the characteristics of the phugoid mode like fixed-aircraft. For the lateral direction, the flyer tends to turn to the right since adverse yaw happens. This paper investigates controller design and simulations based on the acquired linear models. The designed controller successfully maintains altitude and waypoint navigation enough to confirm the system identification results of the avian-type flyer system.	autopilot;lateral computing;lateral thinking;linear model;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;sensor;simulation;system identification;units of information;waypoint;yaws	Jangjin Oh;Seongyoung Kim;Byoungju Lee;Seungkeun Kim;Jinyoung Suk	2017	2017 11th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2017.8287426	flight test;control theory;attitude control;phugoid;system identification;control theory;adverse yaw;waypoint;computer science;wing	Robotics	64.1276032544614	-14.072469794529374	98753

Basically we tried two different approaches. In the first case the aim was to keep the state of charge (SOC) of the battery at a constant level, while in the second case the SOC had to follow a prescribed function of time.

A model of the muscle that has been learned by a NNARX (Neural Network Auto Regressive eXogenous) structure is used. The PID parameters are tuned by an MLP Network with a special indirect online learning algorithm. The calculation of the learning algorithm is performed based on a mathematical equation of the DC motor or with a Neural Network identification of the motor. For each of the two algorithms, the output of the muscle model is used as a reference for the DC motor control loop. The results show that we succeeded in forcing the physical system to behave in the same way as the muscle model with acceptable margin of error. An implementation in the knees of a simulated biped robot is realized. Simulation compares articular trajectories with and without the muscle emulator and shows that with muscle emulator, articular trajectories become closer to the human being ones and that total power consumption is reduced.	algorithm;biological neural networks;control system;emulator;knee;mathematics;memory-level parallelism;muscle;myalgia;pid;robot (device)	Hayssam J.

e7d5e1430581ed2d83df2f0e48ff0f2cf085ae84	optimal proportional-integral guidance with reduced sensitivity to target maneuvers		This paper proposes a new optimal guidance law based on the proportional-integral (PI) concept to reduce the sensitivity to unknown target maneuvers. Compared to the existing PI guidance laws, the proposed guidance command is derived in the optimal control framework while guarantees finite-time convergence. The kinematics equation with respect to the zero-effort-miss (ZEM) is utilized and the integral ZEM is augmented as a new system state. The proposed guidance law is derived through the Schwarz's inequality method. The closed-form solution of the proposed guidance law is presented to provide better insight of its properties. Additionally, the working principle of the integral command is investigated to show why the proposed guidance law is robust against unknown target accelerations. The analytical results reveal that the proposed optimal guidance law is exactly the same as an instantaneous direct model reference adaptive guidance law with a prespecified reference model. The potential significance of the obtained results is that it can provide a point of connection between PI guidance laws and adaptive guidance laws. Therefore, it allows us to have better understanding of the physical meaning of both guidance laws and provides the possibility in designing a new guidance law that takes advantages of both approaches. Finally, the performance of the guidance law developed is demonstrated by nonlinear numerical simulations with extensive comparisons.

Non-linear leg springs have the potential to improve the performance of running robots and models, but it is not clear to what extent. In this paper, the effect of non-linear leg springs on disturbance rejection behavior is investigated. The optimal leg stiffness profile is determined by optimizing the gait sensitivity norm, a measure for disturbance rejection. The results of this optimization show that the optimal leg stiffness profile is strongly non-linear, and that the disturbance rejection is a factor of seven better than it would be with the optimal linear leg stiffness. The cause for this great improvement is that non-linear leg springs allow stable limit cycles that are much further away from the fall modes.	nonlinear system;rejection sampling	J. G.

The series of motions brought about by SPC is called self-posture changing motions (SPCM). SPC and SPCM are considered assuming that the link system moves slowly enough to suppress any dynamic effects. It is shown that, according to a particular combination of link posture, joint assignment, and object shape, there exist a deadlock state, where no further angular displacement can be imparted to the position-controlled joint. It is also shown that there are two different types of deadlock states which never result in any SPCM. The authors introduce (w, omega )-posture changeability, the characteristic with which a link can change posture for every possible force within a cone of a prime axis w and a solid angle, omega . The necessary and sufficient conditions leading to (w, omega )-posture changeability are shown, for a given contact point and frictional conditions. a sufficient condition is included required to realize SPCM under the assumption that the contact point moves continuously over the object and the link-object system never results in a deadlock state. >	poor posture	Makoto Kaneko;Kazuo Tanie	1992		10.1109/ROBOT.1992.220018	robot;control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	66.98785916132312	-22.004651105836206	98901

cf6fa3b7ec3054a0123845ea49ad35ab177dd730	control of a flexible-joint robot using a stable adaptive introspective cmac		This paper proposes an adaptive control for a rigidlink, flexible-joint robot using the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) and the backstepping method, which is a suitable method when joints are underdamped and exhibit a large amount of flexibility. A previously proposed robust weight update method, deemed the introspective method, is placed into a Lyapunov-stable framework. In the introspective method, each local CMAC cell measures the output error in its own domain and over the domain of several sequentially activated cells on the same CMAC array. The cell then votes on whether it appears its previous weight update has reduced this error or not. The sum of all votes from the activated cells determines whether weight updates continue. In order to ensure uniformly ultimately bounded signals, a robust CMAC operates in parallel using a conservative e-modification weight update. Simulations with a two link flexible-joint arm show significantly improved performance over e-modification and a model-based LQR control.	artificial neural network;biconnected component;cerebellar model articulation controller;computer simulation;lyapunov fractal;one-key mac;robot	Chris J.

Regulating the heading of the foil is complicated, however, by a recovery phenomenon resulting from viscous drag whereby reorientation of the foil during actuation is partly undone once actuation is ceased. Aspects of this phenomenon can be reproduced by a relatively simple nonlinear model.	course (navigation);nonlinear system;r.o.t.o.r.

A speed-sensorless drive system is considered. A controller structure consisting of a load torque observer, a speed estimator and a speed predictor is developed. Next, different AI based approaches to speed controller design are investigated. The speed controllers based on (1) feed-forward neural network, (2) neuro-fuzzy network, and (3) self-organising Takagi–Sugeno (TS) rule based model are designed. A comparative analysis of the drive behaviour with these three types of AI based speed controllers is performed. In addition, a comparison is made with respect to the drive performance obtained with a conventional optimised PI controller. A detailed simulation study of a number of transients indicates that the best performance, in terms of accuracy and computational complexity, is offered by the self-organising Takagi– Sugeno controller. The controllers are developed and tested for a plant comprising a variable-speed separately excited DC motor. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The originality in solving this intensively studied problem resides in the proposed geometrical view combined with differential flatness for trajectory generation and B-splines for the flat output parametrization. Using some important properties of these theoretical tools we show that the constraints can be validated at all times.

Recently, we derived a new adaptive Jacobian tracking controller for robots with uncertain kinematics and dynamics. This note extends the results to include redundant robots and adaptation to actuator parameters.

During each interaction, subjects are asked to perform a command-following (i.e., pursuit tracking) task. Each subject’s performance at that task improves from the first trial to the last trial. For each trial, we use subsystem identification to estimate each subject’s feedforward (or anticipatory) control, feedback (or reactive) control, and feedback time delay. Over the 40 trials, the magnitudes of the identified feedback controllers and the identified feedback time delays do not change significantly. In contrast, the identified feedforward controllers do change significantly. By the last trial, the average identified feedforward controller approximates the inverse of the dynamic system. This observation provides evidence that a fundamental component of human learning is updating the anticipatory control until it models the inverse dynamics.	broadcast delay;controllers;dynamical system;feed forward (control);feedback;feedforward neural network;humans;inverse dynamics	Xingye Zhang;Shaoqian Wang;Jesse B.

Guidance schemes in the form of attractive and repulsive constraints can simplify task execution and facilitate natural operation of the robot by clinicians. The real-time seamless calculation and application of guidance, however, requires computationally efficient algorithms that solve the non-linear inverse kinematics of the robot and guarantee that the commanded robot configuration is stable and sufficiently away from the anatomy. This paper presents a multi-processor framework that allows on-the-fly calculation of optimal safe paths based on rapid workspace and roadmap pre-computation The real-time nature of the developed software enables complex guidance constraints to be implemented with minimal computational overhead. A user study on a simulated challenging clinical problem demonstrated that the incorporated guiding constraints are highly beneficial for fast and accurate navigation with concentric tube robots.	active set method;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;consensus dynamics;control theory;distributed computing;inverse kinematics;motion planning;multiprocessing;nonlinear system;online and offline;overhead (computing);precomputation;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;remote manipulator;robot;seamless3d;shortest path problem;usability testing;vii;workspace	Konrad Leibrandt;Christos Bergeles;Guang-Zhong Yang	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759195	robot;kinematics;navigation;simulation;shape;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;computer graphics (images)	Robotics	60.17788339522094	-22.460586658937316	100124
43d844140683b9ce607cd421be2b453adc7fc56d	inner loop design for pmlsm drives with thrust ripple compensation and high-performance current control		To realize the precise thrust force control in permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) drives, this paper studies a novel design method of the high-performance current inner loop. First, to increase the control bandwidth, an optimized predictive current controller, which takes account of the one-step delay issue, is presented on the basis of the discrete-time model of the PMLSM. Second, as disturbance factors, the thrust ripple and parameter variation can influence the input and output command of the current controller, respectively. Therefore, an improved sliding mode algorithm with the variable exponential reaching law is introduced to suppress these two disturbances simultaneously, and the stability analysis is given to prove the convergence of the algorithm through the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a precise experimental platform on account of the aerostatic guide is established, and experimental results are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.	algorithm;controller (computing);inner loop;input/output;lyapunov fractal;motion compensation;ripple effect;thrust;time complexity	Mingyi Wang;Rui Yang;Cheng Ming Zhang;Jiwei Cao;Mingyi Wang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2018.2814014	control theory;synchronous motor;thrust;linear motor;control engineering;lyapunov stability;control theory;inner loop;ripple;engineering;hysteresis	EDA	67.97532448029425	-10.986690141834542	100194

An inefficient large displacement of each angular joint motion caused by foot rotational trajectory without considering kinetic energy increases hydraulic flow consumption. And it requires the higher capacity of power system and it will be a burden on walking robot. In this paper, we proposes a redundancy resolution algorithm that minimized the hydraulic flow consumption for hydraulic actuated quadruped walking robot with redundancy resolution.

Both the cases of an unbounded and a cyclic, bounded workspace are considered. In the first case, we show that the closed loop system reaches a configuration in which the minimum distance between any pair of agents is larger than a specific lower bound. It is proved that this lower bound coincides with the agents' sensing radius. In the case of a bounded cyclic workspace, the control law is redefined in order to force the agents to remain within the workspace boundary throughout the closed loop system evolution. Moreover the proposed control design guarantees collision avoidance between the team members in both cases. The results are supported through relevant computer simulations.	closed-loop transfer function;collision detection;computer simulation;control engineering;control theory;definition;optimal control;swarm;testbed;vii;workspace	Dimos V.

However, the effectiveness of RC decays when the time period of the RC does not exactly match with the period of the repetitive disturbance. RC also leads to reduced performance in between harmonics in terms of degraded sensitivity (more noise sensitive). High Order Repetitive Control (HORC) is an RC structure, which allows to shape the sensitivity function to make it either more robust for time period of the repetitive disturbances, or more noise robust. In addition, standard RC will also fail in systems with spatial repetitive disturbances, since the time period of this kind of repetitive disturbances may vary. Delay-Varying Repetitive Control (DVRC) can cope with spatial disturbances, however, it lacks the robustness attained by HORC. By combining these two RC structures, HORC and DVRC, a new Robust Delay-Variable Repetitive Controller (RDVRC) is obtained. The RDVRC is successfully applied to measurement data from a media transport system of an industrial printer. Robust DVRC will be useful for many motion control systems with repetitive tasks, as disturbances often repeat along the motion path.	algorithm;control system;interpolation;printer (computing)	Ezequiel Bajonero Canonico;Ewout van der Laan;Sjirk H.

The situation is further complicated by input saturation, which is almost inevitable for microactuators. This paper presents a novel control architecture combining a parallel internal-model-based tracking design and a robust antiwindup control structure, such that asymptotic tracking can be achieved for nanoservo systems in the presence of saturation nonlinearity and model uncertainties. For the augmented system with internal-model dynamics, an I/Obased equivalent representation from control (free of saturation) to system output is derived by incorporating the dead-zone nonlinearity, saturation compensation blocks, as well internal-model units. The robustness condition on the saturation compensator is also derived based on the sector bound criterion and an H∞-optimal design is developed accordingly. The proposed robust antiwindup tracking control architecture is deployed on a customize-designed nanostage driven by a piezoelectric (PZT) actuator, where numerical simulations and real-time experiments demonstrate excellent tracking performance and saturation compensation capability, achieving tracking precision error less than 0.23%.	control flow;dead reckoning;experiment;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;piezoelectricity;real-time clock;saturation arithmetic;servo;simulation	Pengbo Liu;Peng Yan;Zhen Zhang;Hitay Özbay	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2569060	control engineering;electronic engineering;uncertainty;engineering;control theory;servomotor;robustness;actuator	Robotics	67.3510229748125	-14.239014840008418	100491

The basic idea is to formulate an optimization problem over a family of continuous paths which satisfy the specified end conditions and possess robot-obstacle collisions. The cost to be minimized depends on the penetration growth distance, a new measure for the depth of intersection between a pair of object models. The growth distance and its derivatives with respect to configuration variables describing the orientation and position of the objects can be computed quickly. This is a key factor in attaining acceptable computational times. Variations of the initial strategy, which improve computational efficiency and reliability, are discussed.

These features also present different challenges in control design and aircraft operation. An accurate mathematical model is unlikely to be available meaning optimal control methods become difficult to apply. Furthermore, their reduced weight and inertia mean they are significantly more vulnerable to environmental disturbances such as wind gusts. Larger disturbances require more control actuation, meaning small UAVs are far more susceptible to actuator saturation. Failure to account for this can lead to controller windup and subsequent performance degradation. In this work, numerical simulations are conducted comparing a baseline Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller to integral augmentation and Disturbance Observer Based Control (DOBC).

Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) based adaptive control is designed to compensate for the effect of the unknown dynamics. To achieve the finite-time convergence of both trajectory tracking error and RBFNN learning error, barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) and and filtering techniques are employed to design a performance function and a tracking error region to ensure position tracking error converge to a pair of specified bounds in a finite time. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control method is tested and verified by simulation studies.	algorithm;artificial neural network;converge;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;radial (radio);radial basis function;robot;simulation;software studies;spectral leakage	Chenguang Yang;Runxian Yang;Jing Na;Fei Chen	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7792980	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.0818120877455	-11.121376440940285	100978

There are three elements in the rotation vector which has clear physical meaning of the rotations and avoids the singularity problem of Euler angles and the unity norm constraint problem of quaternions. Basic definition of the rotation vector and its relation with the object body angle velocity is introduced and used in the 6DOF quadrotor dynamics. Based on the property that the rotation vector rate is equivalent to the body angle velocity when the rotation is small, a simple and intuitive attitude reference is proposed. A proportional-derivative (PD) law is used by integrating the new attitude reference for the attitude control of quad-rotor UAVs. Simulation results prove the efficiency of the new method which provides a new model with intuitive physical meaning for quadrotor UAVs.	angularjs;euler;optimal control;r.o.t.o.r.;robotics;simulation;technological singularity;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	Dongming Gan;Guowei Cai;Jorge Manuel Miranda Dias;Lakmal D.

The DACL robot is a reconfigurable manipulator consisting of two cooperative arms, which may act separately. These may also be cam-locked in each other in some links and thus lose some degrees of freedom while gaining higher structural stiffness. This will also decrease their workspace volume. It is aimed to obtain the optimal configuration of the robot and the optimal joint trajectories to minimize the consumed energy for following a specific task space path. The Pontryaginu0027s Minimum Principle is utilized with a shooting method to resolve kinematic redundancy. Numerical examples are investigated to show optimal trajectories in different cam-locked configurations, and the final decision is made based on a selection table of the computed performance indices.	robot;workspace	Behnoush Rezaeian Jouybari;Kambiz Ghaemi Osgouie;Ali Meghdari	2016	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574714000423	computer science;artificial intelligence;motion planning;robot control;robot kinematics;robot calibration	Robotics	63.81980807903327	-21.313767325004484	101366

The building consists in multiple connected rooms and zones. The control objective is to keep the temperature of each room and zone at a given comfortable level with minimal energy consumption. This control scheme is divided into two levels. The upper level controller collects temperature and predictive information of all rooms and zones to generate reference trajectories while a lower level controller only uses local information to track the reference and optimize energy efficiency and thermal comfort. By using a contraction property of building's dynamics, recursive feasibility of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed.

Especially, the sideslip angle, an important variable of the vehicle state, is difficult to measure directly for technology or economic reason. What's more, some key parameters of vehicle system, such as the mass of vehicle, may vary significantly front one journey to the others, and require real-time estimation. This article is designed to propose a new nonlinear observer which can derive the state and unknown parameter of the vehicle dynamic system. This observer is based on the nonlinear double track model, in which the Dugoff model is used to describe the relation between the tire road force and the sideslip angle. The dual unscented Kalman filter is employed to get the states and the key parameters in the observe: Simulation results indicate that the new nonlinear observer works effectively and has big potential benefit in the real vehicle dynamic system.	dynamical system;estimation theory;extended kalman filter;nonlinear system;real-time transcription;simulation	Qi Cheng;Alessandro Corrêa Victorino;Ali Charara	2012	2012 15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338813	control engineering;engineering;automotive engineering;control theory;state observer;alpha beta filter	Robotics	62.83112129288608	-15.217085946587353	102216

Based on this set of filters, an adaptive integrator backstepping procedure is used to develop a torque input controller which guarantees semiglobal asymptotic link position tracking while also ensuring that all signals remain bounded during closed-loop operation. Simulation results for a two-link RLFJ robot are utilized to validate the performance of the proposed controller.		Ser Yong Lim;Darren M.

c9ccc24e46021794e91770b66f4a176d4848e153	high-speed trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles using a simple dynamic model		In this article, we propose a new approach to drive a vehicle at high speed along a predetermined path using Model Predictive Control. Instead of modeling precise vehicle dynamics, which strongly restricts the planning horizon that can be considered in real-time, we use a simplified second-order integrator model which is constrained to match the vehicle's feasible dynamic envelope. Moreover, and contrary to many MPC approaches taking a target speed as input, our formulation also includes velocity planning, making the vehicle able to automatically adjust its speed to the layout of the road. Simulation results on a highly precise vehicle model show that our approach can be used in real-time to provide feasible trajectories that can be tracked using a simple control architecture. Moreover, the use of our simplified model makes the planner more robust and yields better trajectories compared to kinematic models commonly used in trajectory planning.	algorithm;autonomous robot;coefficient;computation;converge;high- and low-level;lateral computing;lateral thinking;linear model;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;pid;path (graph theory);planner;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;solver;velocity (software development)	Florent Altché;Philip Polack;Arnaud de La Fortelle	2017	2017 IEEE 20th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317632	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	61.457572592452564	-18.173580779925462	102355
54bb78935b7b48e21e5031b060e9979becccf51f	minimum sensitivity control for planning with parametric and hybrid uncertainty	optimal control;motion control;motion planning;nonlinear control systems	This paper introduces a method to minimize norms on nonlinear trajectory sensitivities during open-loop trajectory optimization. Specifically, we derive new parametric sensitivity terms that measure the variation in nonlinear (continuous-time) trajectories due to variations in model parameters, and hybrid sensitivities, which account for variations in trajectory caused by sudden transitions from nominal dynamics to alternative dynamic modes. We adapt continuous trajectory optimization to minimize these sensitivities while only minimally changing a nominal trajectory. We provide appended states, cost, and linearizations, required so that existing open-loop optimization methods can generate minimally sensitive feedforward trajectories. Though there are several applications for sensitivity optimization, this paper focuses on robot motion planning, where popular sample-based planners rely on local trajectory generation to expand tree / graph structures. While such planners often use stochastic uncertainty propagation to model and reduce uncertainty, this paper shows that trajectory uncertainty can be reduced by minimizing first-order sensitivities. Simulated vehicle examples show parametric sensitivity optimization generates trajectories optimally insensitive to parametric model uncertainty. Similarly, minimizing hybrid sensitivities reduces uncertainty in crossing mobility hazards (e.g. rough terrain, sand, ice). Examples demonstrate the process yields a planner that uses approximate hazard models to automatically and optimally choose when to avoid hazardous terrain and when controls can be adjusted to traverse hazards with reduced uncertainty. Sensitivity optimization offers a simple alternative to stochastic simulation and complicated uncertainty modeling for nonlinear systems.	approximation algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;control flow;decision theory;discretization;feedforward neural network;first-order predicate;first-order reduction;gaussian process;hazard (computer architecture);loop optimization;mathematical optimization;motion planning;nonlinear system;parametric model;process modeling;propagation of uncertainty;sampling (signal processing);simulation;software propagation;stochastic gradient descent;system dynamics;traverse;trajectory optimization;uncertainty principle	Alex Ansari;Todd D.

Electric Vehicles can achieve a high efficiency under these conditions due to their ability to recover energy during braking. However, the high current loads during both charging and discharging cause battery energy losses, making them less efficient and degrading their useful lifetime. Super capacitors work well under high power charge and discharge cycles, however, their high cost and low energy density prevent them from being a viable replacement for batteries. A hybrid system consisting of a battery and a super capacitor has the potential to offer the benefits of both devices, which may increase vehicle range and battery lifetime. Consequently, the goal of the project is to: (a) investigate the use of a hybrid battery/super capacitor system in response to real commuter drive cycles. (b) develop scheduling algorithms that optimize the flow of energy between the battery, super capacitor and motor.	algorithm;charge cycle;discharger;emoticon;gradient;hybrid system;scheduling (computing);traverse	William Price;Harsh Jain;Yash Pant;Rahul Mangharam	2013	SIGBED Review	10.1145/2518148.2518171	embedded system;simulation;control system	Mobile	54.5540707079567	-10.964113615223706	102497

The existing work on this problem discussed the required formation and capture strategy for a group of pursuers. However, the formulation has mathematical errors and has raised concerns over the validity of the developed capture strategy. This paper uses the idea of Apollonius circle to develop an escape strategy for the high speed evader, resolving the shortfalls in the existing work. The strategy is built on a concept of perfectly encircled formation and the conditions required to construct the same are presented. The escape strategy contains two steps. Firstly, the evader employs a strategy that forces a gap in the formation against all the admissible strategies of a group of pursuers. In the second step, it uses this gap to escape. The strategy considers both direct and indirect gaps in the formations. The indirect gap is encountered when a group of three or four pursuers is employed to capture. The efficacy of the escape strategy is established using simulation results.	evasion (network security);pursuit-evasion	M. V.

Two novel full-order multi-input/multi-output terminal sliding mode control schemes are proposed for position tracking and velocity tracking of rigid robotic manipulators. The first scheme uses the robust control to deal with the system uncertainties. The second scheme utilises the neural network to estimate the uncertain dynamics. Both of the two schemes can drive the system states to reach the designed full-order terminal sliding mode and then the tracking errors can converge to zero in finite time. Compared with the existing terminal sliding mode control techniques, the two control schemes proposed in this paper exhibit full-order dynamics and overcome singularity and chattering problems without sacrificing the tracking precision. Lyapunov stability analysis and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.

A nonholonomic dynamic model and controllability analysis of the roller racer was first published by Krishnaprasad and Tsakiris in 1998. The model is derived from the usual assumption that all the wheels obey sticking (non-slipping) constraints, i.e., rolling without slipping. Controllability analysis shows that under these assumptions, the roller racer cannot be stopped once started. Yet physical prototypes do not exhibit this characteristic. In this paper, a high-fidelity model of the roller racer is presented by considering the finite static friction between the wheels and the ground, i.e., slipping will occur when constraint force exceeds the maximal allowable frictional force. It is proved that the system could be stopped from any state with only the steering angle control.

This paper presents an effective method to find the dynamic tracking line in a robotic workcell. The maximum permissible line-speed which is a quantitative measure of the robot capability for conveyor tracking, is defined on the basis of the relation between the end-effector speed and the bounds on the joint velocities, accelerations, and torques. This measure is derived in an analytic form using the parameterized dynamics and kinematics of the manipulator, and some of its properties are established mathematically. The problem of finding the dynamic tracking line is then formulated as a root-solving problem for a single-variable equation, and solved by the use of a simple numerical technique. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the methodology and its applications in workspace specification.

It is responsible for robot’s movements. In this work, the cell decomposition algorithm is used to find a spatial path on preliminary static workspaces, and then, the rapidly exploring random tree algorithm (RRT) is used to validate this path on the actual workspace. Two methods have been proposed to enhance the omnidirectional robot’s navigation on partially changed workspace. First, the planner creates a RRT tree and biases its growth toward the path’s points in ordered form. The planner reduces the probability of choosing the next point when a collision is detected, which in turn increases the RRT’s expansion on the free space. The second method uses a straight planner to connect path’s points. If a collision is detected, the planner places RRTs on both sides of the collided segment. The proposed methods are compared with the others approaches, and the simulation shows better results in term of efficiency and completeness.	algorithm;approximation;collision detection;list of algorithms;motion planning;rapidly-exploring random tree;robot;simulation;stationary process;workspace	Ahmad Abbadi;Vaclav Prenosil	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22383-4_9	computer vision;mathematical optimization;simulation;computer science	Robotics	54.68808828085976	-23.640803896131008	103148

The proposed control framework is applied to the passive compliant humanoid robot COMAN which is equipped with series elastic actuators. The stabilization control framework combines the compliance control and the intrinsic angular momentum modulation to achieve an agile and compliant interaction against external perturbations. The admittance based compliance control uses the force/torque sensing in both feet to regulate the active compliance for the position controlled system. The physical elasticity in the new full body COMAN is exploited for the reduction and absorption of the instantaneous impacts while the admittance control further dissipates the excessive elastic energy. The angular momentum controller reduces the overall inertia effect for providing more rapid reactions. Both the theoretical work and experimental validation were presented. The effectiveness of the control scheme is demonstrated by COMAN's capabilities of withstanding various types of perturbations applied over the body, balancing on a moving platform and stabilizing while walking. Experimental data of the ground reaction force/torque, center of mass references and estimations, and the stored elastic energy are presented and analyzed.	agile software development;angularjs;elasticity (cloud computing);experiment;frequency response;humanoid robot;modulation;poor posture;stiff equation	Zhibin Li;Nikolaos G.

It is said that dynamic walk is superior in both speed and energy consumption. This paper describes how a quadruped robot should walk dynamically to realize these advantages. Such consideration is lacking in past research. In this paper, three criteria are introduced to evaluate the walk { `stability', `maximum speed' and `energy consumption'. The relations between these three criteria and the parameters (gait, speed, period, stride, length of the leg, joint angles, etc.) are formulated accordingly to the dynamics. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The shorter a period is, the more stably the quadruped can walk. (2) It is desirable to walk with a longer period and wider stride in order to increase the maximum speed. (3) There is a period which maximizes the speed. (4) There is a period which minimizes the energy consumption for a given speed. (5) Trot gait is desirable when the priority is placed on energy consumption. Pace gait is recommended when the priority is place on maximum speed. From experiments using the quadruped robot Collie-2, the validity and usefulness of these relations are veri ed."""	experiment	Hiroshi Kimura;Isao Shimoyama;Hirofumi Miura	1989	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855390X00305	dynamics;simulation;stability;computer science;artificial intelligence;equations of motion;robotics	Robotics	64.43935171648592	-20.8632726887929	103513

Successful interception of such spiraling targets is critically dependent on the performance of the target state estimator. Strong nonlinearities involved in the system dynamics and measurement equations together with sensor noise make this a challenging estimation task. The performance of an extended Kalman filter (EKF), an unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and a particle filter (PF) designed for this estimation problem is compared in this paper. Additionally, a hybrid Rao-Blackwellized PF (RBPF) approach combining the EKF and the PF is also considered.

Constraint based programming was developed in robotic manipulation as a technique to take several constraints into account when controlling redundant manipulators. The approach has also been generalized, and applied to other control systems such as dual arm manipulators and unmanned aerial vehicles. Navigation functions are an elegant way to design controllers with provable properties for navigation problems. By combining these tools, we take advantage of the redundancy inherent in a multi-agent control problem and are able to concurrently address features such as formation maintenance and goal convergence, even in the presence of moving obstacles. We show how the user can decide a priority ordering of the objectives, as well as a clear way of seeing what objectives are currently addressed and what are postponed. We also analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed controller. Finally, we use a set of simulations to illustrate the approach.	aerial photography;control system;multi-agent system;navigation function;obstacle avoidance;provable security;robot;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle;vergence	Michele Colledanchise;Dimos V.

The aim is to combine dynamic path planning with the ability to learn about the environment. The vehicle is tasked with autonomous travel from an uncertain initial position to an uncertain target, without prior mapping information. The environment is modelled using linear segments that represent boundaries between the estimated traversable and non-traversable regions. The approach integrates Receding Horizon Control (RHC) and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). The control problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and explicitly includes the obstacles and vehicle dynamics.We present the results of our experiments using Pioneer robots, as well as, simulation results which clearly demonstrated the impact of each component of the system.	autonomous robot;experiment;global positioning system;image scaling;linear programming;mathematical model;motion planning;real-time clock;recueil des historiens des croisades;simulation;simultaneous localization and mapping	Markus Deittert;Arthur Richards;George Mathews	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509903	control engineering;layout;mobile robot;navigation;vehicle dynamics;simulation;integer programming;global positioning system;computer science;engineering;linear programming;artificial intelligence;control theory;motion planning;simultaneous localization and mapping	Robotics	61.30795858406942	-19.36094687522808	103692

The inverse dynamics models are derived using the trajectory pattern method. The path of motion is divided into a number of relatively large segments, along which the motion is described by a selected trajectory pattern. The resulting inverse dynamics models are in the form of a summation of a fundamental sinusoidal time function and a number of its harmonics with constant coefficients. The coefficients are computed offline using analytical expressions that are derived for the selected trajectory pattern. The controller permits ultra-high-speed generation of the desired trajectory and feedforward signals. The online computations are minimal and can all be performed in parallel. The inverse-dynamic model of a spatial 3R manipulator is derived for a specified trajectory pattern. The controller structure and simulation results indicating its effectiveness are presented. u003e	inverse dynamics;robot	Behruz Fardanesh;Jahangir Rastegar	1992		10.1109/ROBOT.1992.219938	computer simulation;robot;control engineering;simulation;concurrent computing;computer science;inverse problem;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;robotics	Robotics	66.62859255616452	-19.214961216328884	103751

This paper addresses the problem of active mode stabilization in an aircraft with flexible wings. The main objective of closed-loop control is to enlarge the allowable flight envelope by stabilizing flexible modes that become unstable after a certain airspeed is exceeded. The nominal full-order (FO) model has a very large state dimension and hence the controller is designed using a reduced order (RO) model. This paper offers an analysis of the trade-offs present when designing controllers for systems under the premise of large order model reductions. Simulation results are provided using a reliable high order linear model.	computer performance;control theory;instability;linear model;robustness (computer science);simulation;truncation	Jorge I.

To this end, an acceleration feedback (AF) enhanced $H_{\infty}$ controller is proposed to enhanced the ability of UAV against wind disturbance and it has been deigned and implemented on a hex-rotor. Firstly, The dynamic of UAV system is decoupled into inner-loop (attitude) and outer-loop (position). Then, a hierarchical $H_{\infty}$ controller is designed for the decoupled system. Finally, a AF enhanced method is introduced into the system without changing controller structure. The stability of the AF enhanced method for the UAV system is analyzed and can be ensured by $H_{\infty}$ theory as well. The comparison results of trajectory tracking performance between $H_{\infty}$ controller and AF enhanced $H_{\infty}$ controller under continuous and gusty wind verify that the proposed method is not only robust but effective for both types of wind disturbances.

The computation of this distance is based on the application of the GJK algorithm [6] to a particular subset of the Minkowski difference set of the involved objects. This subset states the separation or penetration distance between two objects along their given motions. When a collision is predicted, a collision-free intermediate temporal-position is generated avoiding such a collision.	computation;gilbert–johnson–keerthi distance algorithm;minkowski addition;mobile robot;protein structure prediction	Enrique J.

In this paper, using the theory of functional observers, we model SA for the user interacting with a continuous-time linear time-invariant dynamical system. For systems under human control or shared control, we use the proposed model to determine the required information to be displayed in the user interface for achieving SA. The user interface provides the user with the ability to observe the continuous-time outputs of the system, as well as the ability to enter continuous-time control inputs. In some systems, due to inadequacy of the displayed information, the user may not be able to accomplish the desired task. To determine the required information to be displayed and the necessary states to be tracked, we propose a model of attaining SA for the users by modeling the user as a specific type of estimator (i.e., the extended delayed functional observer/predictor). We then evaluate what information is needed for such an estimator and how the desired functional of the states have to be expanded so that the user can precisely reconstruct and accurately predict the desired task. As an application example, we investigate the problem of controlling the depth of anesthesia during surgery and determine whether there exists a feasible combination of the expanded task and the displayed information that allows the anesthetist to precisely predict the depth of anesthesia of the patient.	branch predictor;dynamical system;interaction;kerrison predictor;linear time-invariant theory;time complexity;time-invariant system;user interface	Neda Eskandari;Guy Albert Dumont;Z.

The air-to-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas and boost pressure of the intake manifold were selected as performance indicators in this paper. To enable the online calibration of the controller, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) was used as a feedback controller. Using quantitative feedback theory (QFT), two control loops for air-to-fuel ratio and boost pressure were independently designed with linearized models and parameter uncertainties. The prefilters and PID gains of two control loops were designed for satisfying required robust stability and tracking performance using the QFT design framework. Furthermore, the problems originated from the cross-coupled dynamics between the EGR and VGT systems were mitigated by a static decoupler. Using the proposed design steps, PID and decoupler gains of the representative 15 engine operating points which are mainly used in New European Driving Cycle were obtained. The proposed controller was validated through various test conditions of engine experiments. From the step responses and transient experiments, it was demonstrated that the required robustness and tracking performance were successfully achieved.	control system;control theory;diesel;experiment;interaction;mimo;pid;performance;robust control;robustness (computer science);setpoint (control system);steady state;test case;vane display	Inseok Park;Seungwoo Hong;Myoungho Sunwoo	2014	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2014.2301160	robust control;control engineering;calibration;engineering;automotive engineering;control theory;mathematics;statistics;mimo	Embedded	67.1006732606137	-11.708007351734315	105250
41e89ad6fce5f045e844f955dc63e175cae71a62	dynamically feasible, energy efficient motion planning for skid-steered vehicles	skid-steered vehicles;dynamic modeling;power modeling;motion planning;energy efficient	Recent research has developed experimentally verified dynamic models for skid-steered wheeled vehicles and used these results to derive a power model for this important class of all-terrain vehicles. As presented in this paper, based on the torque limitations of the vehicle motors, the dynamic model can be used to develop payload and terrain-dependent minimum turn radius constraints and the power model can be used to predict the energy consumption of a given trajectory. This paper uses these results along with Sampling Based Model Predictive Optimization to develop an effective methodology for generating dynamically feasible, energy efficient trajectories for skid-steered autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) and compares the resultant trajectories with those based on the standard distance optimal trajectories. The simulated and experimental results consider an AGV moving at a constant forward velocity on both wood and asphalt surfaces under various payloads. The results show that a small increase in the distance of a trajectory over the distance optimal trajectory can result in a dramatic savings in the AGV’s energy consumption. They also show that distance optimal planning can often produce trajectories that violate the motor torque constraints for skid-steered AGVs, which can result in poor navigation performance.	algorithm;authorization;automated planning and scheduling;autonomous robot;coefficient;computation;consortium;control system;experiment;gibbs sampling;mtr;mathematical model;modulus of continuity;motion planning;program optimization;relevance;resultant;robotics;simulation;velocity (software development);wheels	Nikhil Gupta;Camilo Ordonez;Emmanuel G.

This adds a deliberative component to the obstacle avoidance guarantees present in the dynamic window approach as well as allow for the inclusion of complex robot models. The proposed algorithm allows for guaranteed convergence to a goal location while navigating through an unknown environment at relatively high speeds.

Thus, there is a need for motion sequences that can be parameterized and changed dynamically. This paper presents a motion engine that translates motions into joint angles by using trajectories. These motions are defined as a set of Bezier curves that can be changed online to allow adjusting, for example, a kicking motion precisely to the actual position of the ball. During the execution, motions are stabilized by the combination of center of mass balancing and a gyro feedback-based closed-loop PID controller.	bézier curve;experiment;gyro;pid;robot;system dynamics;zero moment point	Judith Müller;Tim Laue;Thomas Röfer	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-20217-9_10	pid controller;center of mass;simulation;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;bézier curve	Robotics	66.48675934649191	-18.11313500062728	105568

A reconfigurable sliding mode flight controller is designed that achieves robust, high accuracy command angle tracking both before and after damage to an aircraft. Command angles and angular rate commands are robustly tracked in outer and inner loops correspondingly via finite reaching time continuous sliding mode controllers. An optimal control allocation algorithm is employed using nominal mathematical model of an aircraft. Sliding surface boundary layer reconfiguration (direct adaptation) is used in the “very” inner loop to account for actuator dynamics, deflection limits, and rate limits. On-line damage identification is not required by this design. The reconfigurable sliding mode flight control technique is applied to a flight dynamics model of a tailless jet fighter that was developed under is the innovative control effectors program.

The considered element is approximated with the use of known discrete PSE and CFE approximations. The operator we deal with is a crucial part of fractional order PID controller and another FO control algorithms. As an example the implementation at SIEMENS SIMATIC S7 1500 platform is presented. The both proposed approximations PSE and CFE were compared in the sense of accuracy, convergence and PLC execution time. Results of experiments show, that the PLC implementation of the fractional order element using the both approximations can be done with the use of object-oriented approach, the accuracy of approximation is determined by its order. The CFE approximation is much more faster than PSE and its accuracy is comparable to accuracy of PSE.	real-time transcription	Krzysztof Oprzedkiewicz;Edyta Gawin;Tomasz Gawin	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-77179-3_4	implementation;pid controller;operator (computer programming);order operator;siemens;simatic s5 plc;control theory;digital control;convergence (routing);computer science	Theory	58.508226170044345	-12.482912557545843	105690

In order to facilitate this combination, the particle swarm algorithm is improved by making it iterative, this both improves performance and guarantees convergence to a global minimum. The PSO algorithm's convergence rate is further improved by adding a random search term which is dependent on the value of the evaluation function as well as focusing the randomly generated particles around the previous best particle in every iteration of the iPSO algorithm. Simulations are used to investigate this algorithms effectiveness and limitations.	algorithm;computation;computer simulation;convergence (action);evaluation function;fitness function;graphics hardware;handling (psychology);iteration;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;mesenchymal stem cells;nonlinear system;opencl api;parallel computing;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;procedural generation;random search;rate of convergence;real-time clock;resultant;underactuation	Kirill Van Heerden;Yatsutaka Fujimoto;Atsuo Kawamura	2014	2014 IEEE 13th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control (AMC)	10.1109/AMC.2014.6823326	control engineering;mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;simulation;computer science;particle swarm optimization;metaheuristic	Robotics	59.32015421568819	-19.77300121649393	105713

A twolevel navigation algorithm is presented in which a subgoal selection algorithm (SSA) generates visible subgoals to be pursued by the steering control algorithm (SCA). An earlier article presented the SSA in detail, demonstrating how subgoals can be updated while the AMR is moving so that a continuous motion is achieved without stopping to replan the path when new sensor data become available. This study focuses on the SCA. In particular, a general feedback scheme is developed for dynamically steering an AMR to a visible goal in the local obstacle-free space identified by the SSA. We present the detailed implementation of the SCA for a conventionally steered AMR (CAMR). Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the combined SSA-SCA feedback scheme.

First, a subspace structure is analyzed using projection matrices into four subspaces of contact force space. Motivated by an example demonstrating that a careless definition of contact force subspaces leads to completely invalid result, we propose a proper set of projection matrices using a special weighted pseudo-inverse. Next, an example of statical ambiguity is provided in obtaining contact force distribution, which implies that contact forces can not be determined in light of statical viewpoint. To resolve such ambiguity, we propose the notion of dynamical balance. By presenting a tool for identification of dynamically balanced motions and forces, we can have a complete characterization of the force distribution for a general enveloping grasp system.	dynamical system	Jonghoon Park	2002		10.1109/ROBOT.2002.1013674	classical mechanics;identification;control engineering;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	67.42490802788612	-21.1051553682044	105959

Starting with problem description of parameter configuration, the feasibility of RBF used for parameter configuration is analyzed and the possible structure of RBF is described. Taking uniform cross section leaf-spring as an example, parameter configuration model based on RBF Neural Network is built by the train of collected samples and the final simulation results show that the model can achieve a comparatively accurate solving of parameter configuration to testify the method in the paper.	artificial neural network;cross section (geometry);genetic algorithm;neuron;organizing (structure);radial (radio);radial basis function;simulation	Bin He	2011	2011 Seventh International Conference on Natural Computation	10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022199	control engineering;engineering;engineering drawing;mechanical engineering	Robotics	54.15254482837819	-16.3959833540566	105995

This approach is intended to minimize the mean value of the resultant control effort taken over a set of possible evader maneuvers which is modeled as a step function, the parameters of which are unknown. Since the resultant control effort is the minimum effort among the pursuers, we encounter the nonlinear “min” function in the performance index. By introducing binary parameters, it is changed to a linear function including binary parameters and continuous variables. After the optimal control problem is solved, the optimal binary parameters are determined through an integer programming approach. Then, the closed-form optimal cooperative guidance law (OCGL) is derived in feedback form. The analytical and numerical results, obtained for the engagement of two missiles against a maneuvering target, show that OCGL is superior to the noncooperative guidance laws such as proportional navigation (PN) and optimal guidance law (OGL), even if the real model, used in evaluations, differs from the model used in the derivation of the guidance law. The performance of the proposed guidance law has been evaluated for higher order dynamics at the presence of acceleration saturation.	control theory;integer programming;linear function;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;opengl;optimal control;resultant	Mahdi Nikusokhan;Hadi Nobahari	2016	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2015.140623	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Vision	61.11120321567651	-18.20107859031141	106054

However, their coupled nonlinear system dynamics demand for an effective control system in terms of accuracy, robustness and disturbance rejection. This paper presents a hybrid control scheme that is designed specifically to these features. The hierarchical approach encapsulates the robots dynamics on drive-level and, thus, provides the basis for effective real-time hybrid control. It is interfaced by a fully specified C 2 -continuous trajectory, see (1) for detailed design.

The redundancy of such manipulators can be effectively used to avoid obstacles, avoid singularities, and maintain a high degree of manipulability while performing the desired end effector task. The extra degrees of freedom of a redundant manipulator are exhibited as joint velocities that do not contribute to the velocity of the end effector. In this paper, we provide a dynamic control law that guarantees the tracking of a given end effector trajectory and also provides for the control of the redundant joint velocity. The desired redundant joint velocity can then be specified to optimize a cost function over the configurations allowed by the extra degrees of freedom that achieve the given end effector position.	loss function;optimal control;robot end effector;velocity (software development)	Ping Hsu;John Hauser;S.

This paper studies the tracking control problem of an array of nanoparticles moving on a substrate with friction between the substrate and the particles. The major challenges in this problem include 1) nonlinearities and uncertainties in the frictional dynamics and 2) limited availability of measurable states in nanosystems. In this paper, the particle-substrate and interparticle interactions are considered to be unknown and of general dynamic forms. The unknown effect of unmodeled particle dynamics on the dynamics of the center of mass of the array is also considered. A nonlinear identifier is developed to identify this unmodeled dynamics. A feedback controller is developed upon the identifier to control the center of mass of the particles to track a desired trajectory. Boundedness of the closed-loop states and semiglobal asymptotic stability of the tracking error are proved using Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed identification and control laws.	control theory;feedback;identifier;interaction;limited availability;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;simulation	Guoqiang Hu;Faryad Darabi Sahneh;Warren E.

The considered constraints arise during the contact of a robot with an external object in its environment. Such a situation happens mainly if a robot is desired to apply forces and/or torques on an external surface for machining purposes, or if it is used to mate parts with limited clearances. A novel method that is based on task-space formulations and on the modes-of-motion approach is developed to represent constraints and constrained tasks. It is shown that this methodology can handle constrained motions generally without having any of the substantial limitations of other proposed methods. Special attention is paid in this paper to surface forces, a general reduction method is given where its results acknowledge the existence of these forces. Constrained systems under surface forces maybe not solvable: the sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a solution is given and then illustrated by an example. >	robot	Karim A.

While this kind of system has many potential significant applications, there have been several key challenges, for example, localization accuracy, visibility and velocity constraints, obstacle avoidance, and so on, to prevent the implementation of such a system. The main contribution of this paper is to develop an adaptive nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) to meet all these challenges in one single controller. In particular, the model of the vision-based mobile grasping system is first derived. Then, based on the model, a nonlinear predictive control strategy with vision feedback is proposed to deal with the issues of optimal control and constraints simultaneously. Different from other work in this field, in order to improve the performance, an adaptive mechanism is proposed in the paper to update the model online so that it can track the nonlinear time-varying plant in a real time manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply model predictive control to mobile visual servoing and consider various constraints at the same time. The approach was validated with two physical experiments. It was shown that the system with the new control strategy was quite successful to carry out an autonomous mobile grasping task in a complex environment.	autonomous robot;control theory;experiment;mobile robot;nonlinear system;obstacle avoidance;on-board data handling;optimal control;real-time computing;requirement;robustness (computer science);velocity (software development);visual servoing	Ying Wang;Haoxiang Lang;Clarence W. de Silva	2010	IEEE ICCA 2010	10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524177	control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;control theory;model predictive control	Robotics	61.72715831000527	-18.21509864646789	106619

Slip motions, infinite estimation error and impossible control actions are avoided escaping from singularities. In addition, high amplification of wheel velocity errors and high wheel velocity values are also avoided by moving far from the singularity. The proposed cost index can be used directly to complement path-planning and motion-planning techniques (e.g. tree graphs, roadmaps, etc.) in order to select the optimal collision-free path or trajectory among several possible solutions. To illustrate the applications of the proposed approach, an industrial forklift, equivalent to a tricycle-like mobile robot, is considered in a simulated environment. In particular, several results are validated for the proposed optimality criterion, which are extensively compared to those obtained with other classical optimality criteria, such as shortest-path, time-optimal and minimum-energy.

However, to guarantee that the reference joint trajectory will produce a safe movement despite modeling errors and perturbations, a stabilizer needs to be implemented on the robot. Though this stabilizer constitutes an essential part of the control strategy of most advanced humanoid platform, it is usually not open-source and dedicated to the own robot characteristics. The goal of this paper is to propose a general and practical strategy for designing a stabilizer for joint-position controlled humanoid robots. The proposed method is based on a double inverted pendulum model and a decoupling approach thanks to which the position of the ZMP and the center of gravity can be controlled independently through the regulation of the ankle and hip joints. The stabilizer generates the expected stabilizing torques from the admissible joint position input. The resulting control algorithm is fast and can be easily executed on the robot. This algorithm was successfully implemented as real-time plugins for the OpenHRP simulator of the HRP2. Simulations showing the efficiency of the method are presented and discussed.	algorithm;computation;computer simulation;control theory;coupling (computer programming);humanoid robotics project;humanoid robot;inverse kinematics;inverted pendulum;open-source software;plug-in (computing);poor posture;rate of convergence;real-time transcription;stabilizer code;zero moment point	Dmitry Kaynov;Philippe Souères;Paolo Pierro;Carlos Balaguer	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354431	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory;robot control	Robotics	65.31887434362876	-19.591835220601094	106976

A BCSLA approach is proposed to allow mobile robots to capture an intelligent evader. During the process of hunting, four states including dispersion-random-search, surrounding, catch and prediction are employed. In order to ensure each robot appropriate movement in each state, a series of strategies are developed in this paper. The dispersion-search strategy enables the robots to find the evader effectively. The leader-adjusting strategy aims to improve the hunting robots’ response to environmental changes and the outflank strategy is proposed for the hunting robots to force the evader to enter a besieging circle. The catch strategy is designed for shrinking the besieging circle to catch the evader. The predict strategy allows the robots to predict the evader’s position when they lose the tracking information about the evader. A novel collision-free motion strategy is also presented in this paper, which is called the direction-optimization strategy. To test the effect of cooperative hunting, the target to be captured owns a safety-motion strategy, which helps it to escape being captured. The computer simulations support the rationality of the approach.	computer simulation;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;random search;rationality	Zhiqiang Cao;Nong Gu;Min Tan;Saeid Nahavandi;Xiaofeng Mao;Zhenying Guan	2008	Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing	10.1080/10798587.2008.10642983	simulation;self-oscillation;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	56.77423160400767	-23.64972318052848	107100

We propose a new theory, risk-aware control, in which movement is governed by estimates of risk based on uncertainty about the current state and knowledge of the cost of errors. We demonstrate the existence of a feedback control law that implements risk-aware control and show that this control law can be directly implemented by populations of spiking neurons.

We propose a new emergent stop method using modification criteria map. The stable gait change is generated by adjusting the amount of the ZMP modification according to the timing of stop command. The modified ZMP trajectory is given so that the humanoid robot can change the current motion without falling down. The modification criteria are defined from the relation between the predicted ZMP trajectory using a preview controller and the support polygon. The preview controller employs table-cart model and it derives center of mass (CoM) trajectory from ZMP reference in real-time. We make the map of relation among the ZMP modification length, the modification timing and the timing of the stop command for stable gait modification. The robot can execute the best motion referring to the predefined map. In this method, the humanoid robot can stop immediately within one step or zero step to avoid a collision, if humans or objects appeared unexpectedly in front of the walking humanoid robot. The stop motion is typically divided two phase: single leg support phase and double leg support phase. In the single leg support phase, the next landing position and timing are decided according to command time of the stop signal. In the double leg support phase, the humanoid robot can stop anytime without changing standing position. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by experiment using a humanoid robot HRP-2.	anytime algorithm;emergent;humanoid robotics project;humanoid robot;humans;real-time transcription;zero moment point	Tomohito Takubo;Takeshi Tanaka;Kenji Inoue;Tatsuo Arai	2007	Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363869	control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	64.00350098212844	-23.13120472169371	107515

These two analyses take into account the influence of a human operator and time delay. A peculiarity of the presented approach is the exact combination of discrete- and continuous-time elements, which reveals fundamental parameter dependencies for passivity and stability. These dependencies do not only differ in scale for passivity and stability, but consist in substantially different relations. By using realistic parameter ranges for human arms, this paper clearly illustrates that the maximum stable stiffness of virtual walls is far higher than admitted by passivity. Responsible for this great disparity is the limited stiffness of real human arms, as passivity covers a stiffness range that is orders of magnitudes larger than feasible. Finally, useful guidelines for designing stable haptic systems are concluded.	binocular disparity;broadcast delay;coat of arms;haptic technology;interaction	Thomas Hulin;Alin Albu-Schäffer;Gerd Hirzinger	2014	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2013.2283372	damping;control engineering;von neumann stability analysis;simulation;engineering;control theory;transfer function;force;physics	Robotics	66.15098131227215	-19.065970194578608	107871

The method is based on the use of dynamical systems theory which allows us to express intelligent behaviors using systems of differential equations. These differential equations operate at two distinct levels. At one level, the differential equations governing movement comprise a carefully designed set of attractor-repeller fields. At a second level, behavior selection is modeled using a competition dynamics that determines the relevant contributions to the movement dynamics at each time instant. Thus, our autonomous agents are capable of exhibiting useful behaviors in complex environments. Using this approach we are able to demonstrate in real time behaviors such as single and multiple target tracking with both stationary and moving obstacles.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;dynamical systems theory;real-time clock;real-time computing;stationary process	Siome Goldenstein;Edward W.

bd77ff7e615dc15c1dffd904300de78ef8aa2b91	safeguardpf: safety guaranteed reactive potential fields for mobile robots in unknown and dynamic environments		An autonomous navigation with proven collision avoidance in unknown and dynamic environments is still a challenge, particularly when there are moving obstacles. A popular approach to collision avoidance in the face of moving obstacles is based on model predictive algorithms, which, however, may be computationally expensive. Hence, we adopt a reactive potential field approach here. At every cycle, the proposed approach requires only current robot states relative to the closest obstacle point to find the potential field in the current position; thus, it is more computationally efficient and more suitable to scale up for multiple agent scenarios. Our main contribution here is to write the reactive potential field based motion controller as a hybrid automaton, and then formally verify its safety using differential dynamic logic. In particular, we can guarantee a passive safety property, which means that collisions cannot occur if the robot is to blame, namely a collision can occur only if the robot is at rest. The proposed controller and verification results are demonstrated via simulations and implementation on a Pioneer P3-AT robot.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;analysis of algorithms;autonomous robot;computation;experiment;hybrid automaton;mobile robot;motion controller;multi-agent system;scalability;simulation;velocity (software development);workspace	Rafael Rodrigues da Silva;Samuel Silva;Grigoriy Dubrovskiy;Hai Lin	2016	CoRR		control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	53.77446727039672	-22.669418701013537	108145

To meet this demand, the human model is required to design the suitable assist controller in the man-machine cooperative system. This paper presents a new human behavior model based on a piece-wise affine model which is a class of hybrid dynamical system, and apply it to a sliding task. Since the human behavior is considered to consist of several primitive motions expressed by continuous dynamics and a decision-making expressed by the discrete switch, it seems to be natural to introduce the hybrid system modeling. Particularly, the decision strategy for the number of discrete modes is addressed by using a hierarchical clustering technique, and the measured data are classified into several modes. Then, each primitive motion in each mode is identified based on the affine model. Finally, the switching conditions among modes are identified by applying support vector machine to the classified data. The obtained piece-wise affine model can quantitatively represent both primitive motions and decision-making in the human behavior	behavior model;cluster analysis;consensus dynamics;decision theory;dynamical system;feed forward (control);hierarchical clustering;hybrid system;support vector machine;systems modeling;velocity (software development)	Hiroyuki Okuda;Soichiro Hayakawa;Tatsuya Suzuki;Nuio Tsuchida	2007	Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363846	control engineering;support vector machine;behavioural sciences;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;human behavior	Robotics	58.82916519391269	-16.56800544147219	108149

Compared to classical extension, the technique uses a higher-dimensional state extension, which allows rejecting a constant disturbance on the robot rotational axis. The proposed dynamic extension acts as a velocity scheduler that specifies, at each time instant, the ideal translational velocity that the robot should have. By using a higher-order extension, both the magnitude and the orientation of the velocity vector can be generated, which introduces robustness in the control scheme. Stability for both asymptotic convergence to a point and trajectory tracking is proven. The theoretical results are illustrated first in simulation, and then experimentally on the autonomous mobile robot Fouzy III.	apache axis;autonomous robot;experiment;mobile robot;robustness (computer science);scheduling (computing);simulation;velocity (software development)	Davide Buccieri;Damien Perritaz;Philippe Müllhaupt;Zhong-Ping Jiang;Dominique Bonvin	2009	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2009.2014494	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;robotics	Robotics	65.20728798541676	-16.750156649256585	108242

Instead of using a sequence of samples from one or just a few coherent sequences, the idea of identifying nonlinear dynamic models at distinct points in the state space is considered. In this way, the placement of the experiment points is fully flexible with respect to the set of reachable points. Also, a method for model-based generation of prediction errors is proposed, which is used to compute an a-priori estimate of the sample covariance of the prediction error. This covariance matrix may be used to approximate the Fisher information matrix a-priori. The availability of the Fisher matrix a-priori is a prerequisite for experiment optimization with respect to covariance in the parameter estimates. This work is driven by the problem of parameter identification of hydraulic models. There are methods for hydraulic systems regarding the estimation of parameters from experimental data, but the choice of experiments has not been treated adequately yet. A hydraulic servo system actuating a stewart platform serves as an illustrative example to which the methods above are applied.	approximation algorithm;coherence (physics);design of experiments;experiment;fisher information;formation matrix;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimal design;servo;state space	Franz Dietrich;Annika Raatz;Jürgen Hesselbach	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509535	control engineering;econometrics;nonlinear system;computer science;fisher information;control theory;statistics	Robotics	60.07118626405774	-12.773486944477588	108346

Finally, we present efficient techniques to update the orientation to compute collision-free trajectories. Our algorithm can handle thousands of elliptical agents in real-time on a single core and provides significant speedups over prior algorithms for elliptical agents.

The approach encodes inherent uncertainty in the input data by modeling this data in terms of intervals. Appropriate interval arithmetic is then used to propagate the data through standard fault trees to generate output distributions which reflect the uncertainty in the input data. Through a canonical example of reliability estimation for a robot manipulator system, we show how the use of our novel interval method significantly improves the accuracy of reliability estimates over existing approaches to the problem of uncertain input data. We also show that the method avoids the key problem of loss of uncertainty inherent in some previously suggested approaches when applied to non-coherent systems. We further discuss how the method has advantages over approaches based on partial simulation of the input data space as it can provide guaranteed bounds for the estimates in reasonable times.	coherence (physics);dataspaces;fault tree analysis;interval arithmetic;robotics;simulation	Carlos Carreras;Ian D.

The method is based on a pair of neural networks—the neural controller and the neural emulator—and focuses mainly in the appropriate design of the various global and chain-local penalty functions and the convergence control limitations, needed for the on-line training of the controller. No reference models or paths are needed for the implementation of the method, only set-points. The results, Ž . compared to conventional proportional-derivative PD control and to traditional one-step-ahead neural control, are quite satisfactory, indicating improved accuracy, faster response, and greater overall efficiency.

The concept makes use of a dynamic damper model, which is able to represent the dynamic behavior significantly more accurate than the standard approach, where static damper characteristics are used.While an additional force feedback path is able to enhance force tracking even further, a measurement signal of the realized damper force is not available for control purposes in practice. Hence, a model-based and a signal-based estimation approach are employed. The impact on ride performance caused by the reduced tracking error is studied using three different suspension controllers known from literature. The performance potential of the force tracking controller as well as of the entire control structure is analyzed in simulations and on a quarter-car test rig. No matter which suspension controller is applied and thus independently from the respective control objective, the overall ride performance can be increased due to the enhanced force tracking of the semi-active damper.	control flow;feedback;feedforward neural network;haptic technology;hysteresis;nonlinear system;semiconductor industry;simulation	Enrico Pellegrini;Nils Pletschen;Sebastian Spirk;Michael Rainer;Boris Lohmann	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2012.6402425	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.25190627070647	-13.384050952539411	108759

Through these definitions, two classes of simple paths are obtained, namely the set of circular arcs and the set of cubic spirals. A cubic spiral is a curve whose tangent direction is described by a cubic function of path distance s. These sets of simple paths are used for solving path planning problems of symmetric posture (position and orientation) pairs. For a nonsymmetric posture pair, two simple paths are used as a solution, based on the fact that the locus of split postures is a circle or a straight line. A posture q is said to be a split posture of a pair (p/sub 1/,p/sub 2/) of postures, if p/sub 1/ and q are symmetric and so are q and p/sub 2/. The resultant solutions are smoother than those obtained using clothoid curves.

The integration of a manipulator and a mobile robot base places special demands on the vehicle’s drive system. For smooth, accurate motion and coordination with an onboard manipulator, a holonomic vibration-free wheel system that can be dynamically controlled is needed. In this paper, we present the design and development of a powered caster vehicle (PCV), which is shown to possess the desired mechanical properties. To dynamically control the PCV, a new approach for modeling and controlling the dynamics of this parallel redundant system is proposed. The experimental results presented in the paper illustrate the performance of this platform and demonstrate the significance of dynamic control and its effectiveness in mobile manipulation tasks.

The architecture is designed to guarantee robot’s locomotion stability using only proprioceptive information. The robot is equipped with linear displacement sensors and pressure sensors located on the hydraulic cylinders used as actuators, a gyroscope on the main body and contact sensors on the leg tips. The robot knowledge is limited to proprioceptive sensory data and no a priori information is given about the environment. The resulting walking behaviour is validated through simulations on both flat terrain (with unknown objects along the path) and slopes. The gait is performed using a generic leg sequence and a simplified foothold planner. Initial experiments on the real platform have been carried out as well.	motion planning	Giulio Cerruti;Wei-Zhong Guo;Fulvio Mastrogiovanni	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-48036-7_26	control engineering;computer vision;simulation	Robotics	66.36910389454411	-23.621446866841257	109526

Utilizing the natural oscillation of the elastic actuation can lead to efficient locomotion. However finding a matching combination of joint stiffness and actuator input is challenging as these robots share the properties of underactuated and hybrid dynamic systems. In this paper an optimization problem for cyclic walking of a robot with series elastic actuators is formulated and a flatness based solution method is presented. The method efficiently generates trajectories which exploit the actuator capabilities while respecting all limitations of the system.

There is a single leader in the group which is located at the centre of the circle. Other agents, i.e., the followers control their motions to locate themselves evenly on the arc of the circle. The problem considered here is two fold - formation of a circular pattern with a static leader and tracking of a randomly moving target by this pattern. A novel distributed control law has been designed based on artificial potential function approach to achieve the formation and maintenance of the circle with the leader being static. The follower agents are allowed to communicate with the leader and only one neighboring follower. For the tracking problem, the leader estimates state of the target using Kalman filter. The leader is then made to track the target as the estimated target position works as the tracking destination. The control law of the followers is modified by adding a navigation term to make them move along with the leader while maintaining the circular pattern. Both the algorithms - circular formation and tracking - have been shown to be Lyapunov stable. Effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through extensive simulation.

The modified invasive weed optimization algorithm (MIWO) is employed to optimize the fuzzy input-output scaling factors of lower limb exoskeleton. A fuzzy logic control (FLC) system with the (MIWO) are evolved for reference tracking control. The exoskeleton is developed to enhance and upgrade the lower limb capability and augment the torque of knee and hip of elderly people during the walking cycle. Invasive weed optimization is a bio-inspired search algorithm that mimics how weeds colonize a certain area in nature. The algorithm is modified by applying local knowledge during distribution of seeds that depends on their cost function value in each generation to narrow the accuracy and improve the local search ability. The obtained results from the modified invasive weed optimization algorithm are compared with heuristic gain values to improve the performance of the exoskeleton system. The Visual Nastran 4D software is used to develop a simulation model of the humanoid and an exoskeleton for testing and verification of the developed control mechanism. Simulation results demonstrating the performance of the adopted approach are presented and discussed.	british informatics olympiad;entry point;fuzzy logic;heuristic;image scaling;local optimum;local search (optimization);logic control;mathematical optimization;nastran;pid;search algorithm;simulation;torque;time complexity	Ghasaq Al-Rezage;Hyreil Anuar Kasdirin;Siti Khadijah Ali;M.

The interaction force can be decomposed into motion-induced force and internal force, which are orthogonal between each other. Only the motion-induced force contributes to the motion of the robot, while the internal force abrades the wheels components, and causes the reduction of their life span. So the internal force should be eliminated or minimized. In this paper, kinematic model and dynamic model of redundantly actuated omni-directional WMR considering the interaction force is first established. A proportional differential plus motion regulator is presented. An integral feedback internal force controller is applied to minimize the internal force. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The robot is regulated successfully, and the internal force is reduced efficiently.	castor;coefficient;control theory;dfa minimization;kernel (linear algebra);mathematical model;mobile robot;simulation;wheels	Dongbin Zhao;Jianqiang Yi;Xuyue Deng	2007	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2007.4399170	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	66.2094398673756	-19.541405703054192	109963

Two neural network schemes are presented. In the first scheme, the controller is composed of a stabilizing joint PD controller and a neural network tracking controller. The objective is to simultaneously achieve hub-position tracking and control of the elastic deflections at the tip. In the second scheme, tracking control of a point along the arm is considered to avoid difficulties associated with the output feedback control of a non-minimum phase flexible manipulator. A separate neural network is employed for determining an appropriate output to be used for feedback. The controller is also composed of a neural network tracking controller and a stabilizing joint PD controller. Experimental results on a single-link flexible manipulator show that the proposed networks result in significant improvements in the system response with an increase in controller dynamic range despite changes in the desired trajectory.	artificial neural network	Heidar Ali Talebi;Khashayar Khorasani;Rajnikant V.

The problem of optimal end point control of the beam is then addressed. A sixth-order state space model is derived for the manipulator and the controller is based on this model. Several control laws are studied for this model. Next, the manipulator is modeled as eighth order but the control law based on the sixth-order model is retained. We then estimate the six states from the output of the eighth-order model and feed these states back to the controller to derive the control torque used to drive the manipulator. A filter is introduced to compensate for spillover. The results are very satisfactory, and are illustrated by simulated case studies.	optimal control	Subhra Pal;Harry E.

We analyze the singularities of such mechanisms, assuming that the output-link moves on a pre-defined and parametric path. Especially, we focus on the so-called instantaneous self-motion type singularity. We propose a closed-loop controller that guarantees asymptotic stability when tracking paths through such a singularity. As a comprehensive analytical example we use a planar five bar mechanism. A computer simulation study is also presented, using the same example, as well as the HEXA parallel robot structure.	motion planning;parallel manipulator	Dragomir N.

The vehicles are described by linear heterogeneous dynamics. For example, we consider third-order systems, however the algorithms discussed are suitable for any higher-order. A velocity-dependent inter-vehicle spacing policy is rigorously addressed. The approach used is both multi-layered and consensus-based. The multi-layer approach allows to separate the problem of estimating the desired trajectories from the problem of controlling the vehicles towards those trajectories while keeping a safety distance. Consensus algorithms will be employed on each layer to solve these two problems.	algorithm;consensus (computer science);layer (electronics);regular expression;velocity (software development)	Mauro Fusco;Elham Semsar-Kazerooni;Jeroen Ploeg;Nathan van de Wouw	2016	2016 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2016.7535414	control engineering;simulation;engineering;transport engineering	Robotics	63.73432893134395	-16.848829775944463	110430

The nonlinear model of quadrotor aerial robot is based on Newton-Euler formalism. Model derivation comprises determining equations of motion of the quadrotor in three dimensions and seeking to approximate actuation forces through modeling of the aerodynamic coefficients and electric motor dynamics. The derived model is dynamically unstable. Thus a nonlinear control strategy is implemented for the quadrotor. The control strategy includes feedback linearization for translational subsystem and backstepping based nonlinear controller for the rotational subsystem of quadrotor aerial robot. Nonlinear Backstepping control design is based on constructing Lyapunov function for closed loop system and guarantees stability and tracking performance through Lyapunov energy dissipation. Effectiveness of the control design scheme is shown through nonlinear simulations.	aerobot;approximation algorithm;coefficient;control engineering;control theory;euler;flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft);formal system;lyapunov fractal;newton;nonlinear system;simulation;underactuation	Ashfaq Ahmad Mian;Daobo Wang	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control	10.1109/ICNSC.2008.4525351	electric motor;control engineering;simulation;nonlinear control;aerodynamics;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.12146040932039	-17.26326988888769	110470

In this paper, we propose a modular approach to such motor learning and control. We review the behavioral evidence and benefits of modularity, and propose a new architecture based on multiple pairs of inverse (controller) and forward (predictor) models. Within each pair, the inverse and forward models are tightly coupled both during their acquisition, through motor learning, and use, during which the forward models determine the contribution of each inverse model's output to the final motor command. This architecture can simultaneously learn the multiple inverse models necessary for control as well as how to select the inverse models appropriate for a given environment. Finally, we describe specific predictions of the model, which can be tested experimentally.	experiment;humans;kerrison predictor;benefit;motor learning	Daniel M.

These estimates are used by the CTM to generate the input torques. This combination of the EKF and the CTM was shown to result in a stable adaptive control scheme.

a36c5cb021f3058bfe39d183deacb2fc384b6ea1	efficient and collision-free anticipative cruise control in randomly mixed strings		Connected intelligent vehicle following can improve safety and efficiency compared to today's road transport, but real traffic in the near future will not provide an ideal setting for its deployment. Unconnected human-driven vehicles will follow variable behavior patterns that combine with differences in dynamic capability to create heterogeneous scenarios. In this paper, connected automated vehicles employ model predictive control for following in traffic that may include both heavy and passenger vehicles at quasi-random positions. Adding further realism, some quasi-randomly mixed vehicles are completely unconnected and equipped with the reactive intelligent driver model using pseudorandom parameters. A mixed-integer quadratic programming formulation adapts the predictive algorithm to diverse powertrain operating point constraints. The preceding vehicle's control input is estimated from velocity and brake light observations and used to probabilistically generate a preview for the ego vehicle. A terminal constraint designed using particle kinematics prevents collisions due to shortsightedness. Results are simulated at various heavy and predictive vehicle concentrations in the presence of packet loss. Linear fuel economy improvements between 1.4% and 1.9% per 10% increase in predictive vehicle penetration rate are shown.	algorithm;deploy;drug vehicle;genetic heterogeneity;integer (number);low-discrepancy sequence;network packet;operating point;penetration test;pseudorandomness;quadratic programming;randomness;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);velocity (software development);collision	Robert Austin Dollar;Ardalan Vahidi	2018	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles	10.1109/TIV.2018.2873895	collision;quadratic programming;operating point;packet loss;intelligent driver model;model predictive control;control theory;powertrain;cruise control;computer science	Robotics	59.44296845437217	-16.05224021566714	110859

The design of a small scale ROV has been done to minimize the hydrodynamic force and increase energy efficiency compared to the previous model that was developed by Underwater Technology Research Group (UTeRG). The performance of the designed ROV will be tested in UTeRG laboratory (lab tank test). The output signal from the pressure sensor (MPX4250GP) and the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor are interpreted via an NI-card which was used for the data transfer. The prototype ROV was compared with the previous version in terms of depth control performance. System identification toolbox in MATLAB was used to infer a model from open-loop experiments. Then the obtained model was used to design a controller for the ROV. The focus of the controller design will be to ensure that the ROV is stable and can maintain position at a certain depth in a real underwater environment. After all the experiment has been conducted, the ROV managed to operate in a certain depth underwater using the controller designed successfully.	experiment;matlab;prototype;remotely operated vehicle;system identification	Mohd Shahrieel bin Mohd Aras;Fadilah binti Abdul Azis;Lim Wee Teck;Shahrum Shah bin Abdullah;Ahmad Fadzli Nizam Abdul Rahman	2015	2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244902	control engineering;simulation;engineering;marine engineering	Robotics	67.59623749347493	-17.04103173067195	111045

In a biological flock a large group of animals seek their course while moving in a more or less fixed formation. It seems reasonable that the immediate course is determined by leaders at the boundary of the flock. The others follow: what is their algorithm? The most popular technological application consists of cars on a one-lane road. The light turns green and the lead car accelerates. What is the efficient algorithm for the others to closely follow without accidents? In this position paper we present some general questions from a more fundamental point of view. We believe that the time is right to solve many of these questions: they are within our reach.	agent-based model;algorithm;coherence (physics);flock;flocking (behavior);frequency response;hoc (programming language);linear system	J.

In this study, we address the formation problem of distributed mobile robots that are subject to physical constraints. Mobile robots considered in this study have physical dimensions and their motions are governed by physical laws. They are equipped with sonar and infrared range sensors. The formation of lines and circles is investigated in detail. It is demonstrated that line and circle algorithms developed for idealized robots do not work well for physical robots.

A control-oriented prediction model for A/C system is proposed, identified, and validated against a higher fidelity simulation model (CoolSim). Based on the developed prediction model, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problem is formulated and solved online to minimize the energy consumption of the A/C system. Simulation results illustrate the desirable characteristics of the proposed NMPC solution such as being able to enforce physical constraints of the A/C system and maintain cabin temperature within a specified range. Moreover, it is shown that by utilizing the vehicle speed preview and through coordinated adjustment of the cabin temperature constraints, energy efficiency improvements of up to 9% can be achieved.	algorithm;autonomous car;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;real-time clock;scenario testing;setpoint (control system);simulation;testbed	Hao Wang;Ilya V.

These pure delays are present in autonomous vehicles due to position estimation. The problem is analyzed by solving directly the transcendental characteristic equation that appears when the time delay is considered. The analysis has been done for straight paths and paths of constant curvature. The method has been applied to the pure pursuit path tracking algorithm, one of the most widely used. The paper presents several tests with two different outdoor autonomous vehicles (ROMEO-3R and a computer controlled HMMWV), in spite of difficulties of practical experiments with real vehicles close to the stability limits. These tests pointed out how the predictions about the stability of the proposed methods obtained by using simple models are verified in practice with two different outdoor vehicles. keywords: autonomous vehicles, mobile robots, path tracking, stability, time delay	algorithm;autonomous car;autonomous robot;broadcast delay;characteristic polynomial;computation;control system;experiment;mobile robot;straight skeleton	Guillermo Heredia;Aníbal Ollero	2007	Advanced Robotics	10.1163/156855307779293715	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	63.87812614263918	-18.446626109033318	111935

The algorithm of the presented method is based on a A* graph searching with nodes placed in discretised configuration space. The graph generation process is driven by a heuristic cost which is found with the aid of a cost propagation procedure. This accelerates the searching without losing the optimality. The method presented is equipped with procedures of fast path replanning which is especially important for cases with partially known workspaces.	mobile robot	Leszek Podsedkowski	1998		10.1109/ROBOT.1998.681024	acceleration;control engineering;mobile robot;configuration space;three-dimensional space;mathematical optimization;simulation;any-angle path planning;computer science;graph theory;machine tool;motion planning;quantum mechanics;production engineering	Robotics	54.64198977289936	-22.974253961101166	111979

Most traditional methods for grasp quality evaluation suffer from non-uniformity of the wrench space and a dependence on the scale and choice of the reference frame. To overcome these weaknesses, we present a grasp evaluation method based on disturbance force rejection under the assumption that the normal component of each individual contact force is less than one. The evaluation criterion is solved using an enhanced ray-shooting algorithm in which the geometry of the grasp wrench space is read by the support mapping. This evaluation procedure is very fast due to the efficiency of the ray-shooting algorithm without linearization of the friction cones. Based on a necessary condition for grasp quality improvement, a heuristic searching algorithm for polyhedral object regrasp is also proposed. It starts from an initial force-closure unit grasp configuration and iteratively improves the grasp quality to find the locally optimum contact points. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are illustrated by a number of numerical examples.	circuit complexity;heuristic;numerical analysis;numerical method;polyhedron;reference frame (video);rejection sampling;robot;search algorithm	Shuang-Quan Wen;Tie-Jun Wu	2012	Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE C	10.1631/jzus.C1100151	mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	63.97718548383392	-21.710254076587248	112078

To get a Linear Time Variant (LTV) state space model, the 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) dynamics and kinematics model of the AUV is linearized about the given desired 3D trajectory it needs to track. A linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed based on the linear model and is applied to the nonlinear model to track the desired trajectory. Simulation results show that the linear control law provides satisfactory results when applied to the nonlinear model for tracking basic trajectory maneuvers: helix, saw-tooth path, and 3D Dubin's path.	autonomous robot;closed-loop transfer function;control system;control theory;linear model;nonlinear system;optimal control;prototype;simulation;state-space representation	Abed AlRahman Al Makdah;Elie A.

In this paper, three adaptive schemes are introduced for a feedforward hybrid ANC system, which are capable of effectively reducing the FM and thus making the system robust and immune against sensor error. Extensive simulations are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive schemes as well as the performance of the modified system.	coefficient;computer simulation;control system;fm broadcasting;feedforward neural network;sensor;vergence	Yegui Xiao;Hongyun Wei	2012	2012 12th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)	10.1109/ICARCV.2012.6485176	robust control;control engineering;electronic engineering;adaptive control;engineering;active noise control;control theory;feed forward	Robotics	67.77836777322119	-10.090934042620404	112342

Attitude feedback control with finite time convergence has been considered in the past using the ambiguous unit quaternion representation. However, it is known that continuous feedback control with unit quaternion feedback leads to the unstable unwinding phenomenon, which has debilitating effects on convergence of states and control effort expended. This work considers finite-time stabilization of rigid body attitude dynamics using the coordinate-free representation of attitude on the group of rigid body rotations in three-dimensional Euclidean space, SO(3). The feedback control law designed here leads to almost global finite time stabilization of the attitude motion of a rigid body with known attitude dynamics model, to the desired attitude. Almost global finite time stability of this control law is shown using a Morse function as part of a Lyapunov analysis; this Morse function has been previously used for almost global asymptotic stabilization of rigid body attitude motion.	angularjs;control theory;feedback;loop unrolling;lyapunov fractal;numerical linear algebra;optimal control;quaternions and spatial rotation;simulation;state space;velocity (software development);vergence	Amit K.

The aim is to design decentralized control laws for N robots moving in the horizontal plane in order to reach an unpredictably moving point at the same time. The rendezvous problem is modeled using the relative kinematics equations. Our control laws are derived using the integration of geometrical rules with the relative kinematics model. Two approaches are used, namely reference-robot and leader-follower. In the first approach the robots move independently from each other, but they depend on the motion of the reference trajectory. In the second approach the motion of each following robot depends only on its leader, and the motion of one leader depends on the motion of the reference trajectory. Each follower has one leader. For both approaches, two control laws are derived for each robot. Our strategy is illustrated using various simulation examples.	angularjs;distributed control system;optimal control;robot;simulation;velocity (software development)	Fethi Belkhouche;Boumediene Belkhouche;Parviz Rastgoufard	2005	2005 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571490	kinematics equations;mobile robot;cartesian coordinate robot;simulation;decentralised system;computer science;artificial intelligence;social robot;inverse kinematics;control theory;robot control;mobile robot navigation;robot kinematics	Robotics	64.1485349323978	-18.457288414169465	112530

A quadruped walking machine requires dynamical control to keep its stability in high speed walking. The authors make the dynamical compensator by using a weight oscillator built in the center of the body. First, the authors calculate the exact oscillator motion that can neutralize the moment, completely. Next, they try to use a harmonic oscillation for the oscillator's motion instead of the accurate motion. Finally, the authors use a notion of autonomous distributed control for motion control and expand it to quasi-dynamical walking. >	autonomous robot;distributed computing;dynamical system	Katsuhiko Inagaki;Hisato Kobayashi	1994		10.1109/IROS.1994.407534	control engineering;simulation;harmonic oscillator;control system;control theory;oscillation;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	66.55030239136622	-23.433317204892198	112872

The control system is extended with to tackle a fundamental and challenging problem for the quadcoptor: hovering control. The proposed system is based on self-organizing incremental neural network that includes an associative memory algorithm. The algorithm can cope with a hierarchical data space and complex time-transition dynamics; it enables online incremental learning from manual control, thereby gradually improve the stability against interference such as drift caused by either mechanical impairment or external excitation. In particular, after continuously learning the associative state-command pair of hovering manoeuvre, the system can execute the command associated with current state. The proposed system is evaluated on a realistic AR.Drone quadcoptor to test its capacity to tackle the hovering control problem. The results demonstrate that for the first time, the proposed system effectively offers a novel approach to quadcoptor application of an associative memory-based neural network by successfully tackling a hover task through iterative on-line learning.	control system	Pei-Hua Huang;Osamu Hasegawa	2015		10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280554	robot;estimation;navigation;simulation;propulsion;prediction;artificial intelligence;machine learning;statistics	Robotics	63.006781917448414	-11.56253317167404	112973

The challenge of modular-robot control is that the overall system dynamics are unknown due to its flexible composition from given modules. Most previous work has faced this problem by designing decentralized controllers. Simple decentralized controllers do not guarantee global asymptotic stability without knowledge of the overall system dynamics and alternative versions involving communication with neighboring modules result in complicated control concepts. Our approach is completely different: we store parameters regarding the dynamics and kinematics of each module and a unique identification number in itself. After finishing the assembly of the modules, the parameters are gathered in a central controller, which also detects the configuration using the identification numbers. Our centralized controller uses this information to synthesize model-based control laws on-the-fly as if the full system dynamics are known beforehand. We introduce a novel and compact notation to automate this procedure and to generalize the derivation of the kinematic and dynamic model for heterogeneous modules. Finally, a possible application is shown using simulations.	bus (computing);can bus;centralized computing;continuation;control unit;elasticity (data store);identifier;mathematical model;robot control;self-reconfiguring modular robot;simulation;system dynamics	Andrea Giusti;Matthias Althoff	2015	2015 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2015.7353831	kinematics equations;control engineering;kinematics;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;inverse kinematics;mobile manipulator;control theory;assembly;robot kinematics	Robotics	66.97103764374268	-18.395394262079126	112990

Instead of thrusters, electrically powered reaction wheels are utilized to provide accurate and continuous torque. Referring to the dynamic model of the space robot system, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm is developed in the task space to control the attitude of the spacecraft and the end-effector motion. The performance of NMPC is compared with that of Sliding Mode Control (SMC). The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is verified by simulations. When the system uncertainties are not considered, the proposed NMPC application demonstrates higher accuracy than SMC and it can be achieved without the need to linearize the dynamic equations of the FFSR.	algorithm;control theory;euler method;mathematical model;newton;nonlinear system;robot end effector;simulation;time-scale calculus;wheels	Sharmila Kayastha;Lingling Shi;Jay Katupitiya;Garth Pearce	2017	2017 11th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2017.8287244	robotic spacecraft;motion control;torque;sliding mode control;nonlinear system;control theory;spacecraft;model predictive control;reaction wheel;computer science	Robotics	65.90072934017459	-17.209538312667082	113517
06327aa7bccd4efd0cd373d348b6d6cc6fc313d1	geo debris towing removal using reel control of tethered space robots		The avoidance of collision and intertwist is of great significance for debris towing removal. For this purpose, a removal strategy using releasing mechanism is proposed in this paper. The dynamics model is established, taking into account the tether slackness, platform orbital motion, relative motion of the two end bodies and their in-plane attitude. Platform and debris are assumed to be rectangle and square with certain size respectively. Therefore, the twisted length of unstretched tether is defined to investigate the change of tension during twist. Through the study of the impact of tension on collision and twist, a motor control law of releasing mechanism is developed to adjust tension. Simulation shows that the tension is confined to the defined bounds, making the platform-debris distance kept in a safe range while preventing the twist.	elevator:2010;linear programming;molecular orbital;optimal control;robot;simulation;twisted;uncontrolled format string	Zhongjie Meng;Bingheng Wang;Panfeng Huang	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2017.8324750	orbital motion;robotic spacecraft;control engineering;reel;rectangle;control theory;engineering;towing;motor control;debris;space debris	Robotics	66.50652665911484	-19.014145890986267	113556
9c7875666572351420ba37ed792856d5f73b764b	experience report: constraint-based modeling of autonomous vehicle trajectories	cyber physical systems;metamodeling;autonomous systems	Autonomous vehicles and other robotics systems are frequently implemented using a general-purpose programming language such as C++, and prototyped using domain-specific tool such as MATLAB/Simulink, and LabVIEW. Such an approach is not efficient when programming primitive motions of autonomous vehicles when considering important safety constraints, and when promoting the broad access to robotic systems through involvement of students and aspiring students who do not know conventional low-level programming languages. Aside from general-purpose programming languages, there are languages that are specifically designed to model autonomous vehicles, such as SHIFT, but these languages are typically for simulation purposes only. This experience report discusses the creation of a domain-specific language that allows for faster programming of autonomous vehicles while ensuring valid constraints will be met. This language generates code for multiple controllers that will operate alternatively to allow for fast and effective programming of vehicle trajectories using primitive motions. In addition to improving coding efficiency and reducing the number of programming errors, the language adds a level of abstraction so that autonomous vehicle behaviors may be generated by people with little knowledge of low-level details of the car's operation. Furthermore, this language ensures safe operation of the vehicle by enforcing a set of user-definable constraints on the output path. A main set of constraints that are applied to every generated path have been specifically chosen to enforce safe switching between controllers and prevent the planning of unsafe actions. A novel application of the language is its ability to permit users to add specific constraints for a particular path; these constraints are checked for validity after the main constraint check is performed.	algorithmic efficiency;autonomous robot;c++;course (navigation);dead reckoning;digital subscriber line;directory services markup language;domain-specific language;general-purpose markup language;general-purpose programming language;global positioning system;high- and low-level;labview;low-level programming language;matlab;metaprogramming;modeling language;programmer;robotics;sensor;simulation;simulink	Kennon McKeever;Yegeta Zeleke;Matt Bunting;Jonathan Sprinkle	2015		10.1145/2846696.2846706	control engineering;constraint programming;real-time computing;simulation;constraint satisfaction;computer science;inductive programming;programming language specification	Robotics	60.94291202466016	-23.58815300969509	113601

The concept of the virtual plane is introduced and used to create reactive kinematic-based navigation laws. A virtual plane is an invertible transformation equivalent to the workspace, which is constructed by using a local observer. This results in important simplifications of the collision detection process. Based on the virtual plane, it is possible to determine the intervals of the linear velocity and the paths that lead to collisions with moving obstacles and then derive a dynamic window for the velocity and the orientation to navigate the robot safely. The speed of the robot and the orientation angle are controlled independently using simple collision cones and collision windows constructed from the virtual plane. The robot's path is controlled using kinematic-based navigation laws that depend on navigation parameters. These parameters are tuned in real time to adjust the path of the robot. Simulation is used to illustrate collision detection and path planning.	automated planning and scheduling;collision detection;microsoft windows;motion planning;robot;simulation;stationary process;velocity (software development);workspace	Fethi Belkhouche	2009	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2009.2022441	control engineering;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent;robotics	Robotics	63.89224405470184	-19.818086901182575	113701

183aab00a1c023220306fb964b132fafcf96b9e2	iterative learning of optimal control - case study of the gantry robot		In [15] the authors proposed an iterative learning algorithm for searching for optimal control of linear dynamic systems. This algorithm has been preliminary tested on the laser power control for the cladding process. The aim of this paper is to present a case study of a similar algorithm when applied to control Z-axis of a gantry robot. The original algorithm from [15] has to be modified in order to cover the case when the tracking signal is the output of the system instead of its whole state, as in [15]. The obtained results indicate a fast rate of convergence of the learning algorithm. One can also observe how learning of the shapes of the optimal input and output signals are convergent.	cartesian coordinate robot;iterative method;optimal control	Ewaryst Rafajlowicz;Wojciech Rafajlowicz	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59060-8_30	robot;laser power scaling;iterative learning control;rate of convergence;computer science;dynamical system;input/output;optimal control;tracking signal;control theory	Robotics	63.765807378836115	-11.355200113417208	113899
6848ad37c308aca7233a5c131d702af0dc885bd9	humanoid running based on centroidal dynamics and heuristic foot placement		Inspired by the motion of juggling a ball from one hand to the other, humanoid running motion actually can be treated as juggling its center of mass (CoM) from one leg to the other. In both cases, stance phase and flight phase are involved. During the stance phase, the CoM trajectories of humanoid running can be generated based on the juggling motion characteristics. During the flight phase, the CoM follows ballistic dynamics. However, the relative position of feet with respect to CoM can still be controlled for the subsequent landing. The feet positions can be calculated by a simple heuristic foot placement algorithm considering the current CoM state. Afterwards, the CoM and feet tracking tasks are accomplished by a torque controller based on the full dynamics of the robot with respect to kinematic and dynamic constraints. The feasibility of the proposed control method is fully addressed by different simulations.	algorithm;heuristic;simulation	Songyan Xin;Yangwei You;Chengxu Zhou;Nikolaos G.

56ed12386d53c13678e92fccb16eeb4e6c1eac22	low-voltage ride-through operation of single-stage pv system via using recurrent fuzzy cmac		Advantages of the recurrent fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (RFCMAC) include local generalization capability, fast learning, simplicity of computation, and capability of solving dynamic problem. Normally, the tracking error and the derivative of the tracking error are fed into the controller to perform the control of command tracking. Firstly, in this study, a two-dimensional RFCMAC (2D-RFCMAC) is adopted to approach the command control of the active and reactive power for performing the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) operation of a single-stage photovoltaic (PV) system. However, the 2D-RFCMAC requires larger memory due to the memory size increases exponentially with the number of inputs. Thus, a one-dimensional RFCMAC (1D-RFCMAC) with signed distance and input space repartition mechanisms is proposed to replace the 2D-RFCMAC to perform the LVRT operation of the single-stage PV system. The reduced input dimension and computation complexity make the 1D-RFCMAC more practical. Moreover, some experimental tests are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The results show that the control performance of the proposed 1D-RFCMAC is not only slightly better than 2D-RFCMAC but also has lower memory size and computation complexity.	algorithm;biconnected component;cerebellar model articulation controller;computation;dynamic problem (algorithms);machine learning;one-key mac;page view	Faa-Jeng Lin;Kuang-Chin Lu	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2017.8015401	fuzzy logic;control theory;control theory;dynamic problem;computer science;tracking error;ac power;low voltage ride through;cerebellar model articulation controller;photovoltaic system	Robotics	60.28827326457341	-10.096667331629133	114011

The collision-free path planning problem is converted to a convex optimization problem that can be solved numerically using linear matrix inequalities (LMI). A new optimal (shortest) path cost formulation is given for LMI optimization using a novel Line of Sight Meshing (LSM) method. As compared to the traditional meshing algorithms such as Voronoi and Delaunay, the LSM generates fewer mesh cells which results in reduced computation time. A virtual path diagram (VPD), consisting of all collision-free piecewise straight-line paths, is then found for robot navigation. The LMI optimization method is then used to find the optimal (shortest) collision-free path from the VPD set. In addition to distance, other constraints, such as terrain condition and curvature of the path can be incorporated in the cost function for constrained optimal solution. Finally, a rapid prototyping (RP) environment has been developed, which is used for hardware implementation of the algorithm. The generated paths are then converted to motion commands, which are sent wirelessly from a base-station to mobile robots for motion control.	algorithm;autonomous robot;computation;convex optimization;delaunay triangulation;experiment;linear matrix inequality;loss function;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;motion planning;numerical analysis;obstacle avoidance;optimization problem;rp (complexity);rapid prototyping;real-time clock;real-time path planning;real-time transcription;recursion;robotic mapping;shortest path problem;time complexity;user interface;voronoi diagram;workspace	Weifeng Huang;Anan Osothsilp;Farzad Pourboghrat	2010	2010 11th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision	10.1109/ICARCV.2010.5707357	control engineering;mobile robot;mathematical optimization;convex optimization;simulation;fast path;longest path problem;computer science;mathematics;shortest path problem	Robotics	61.0748037344503	-20.918095229337606	114118

Dynamically stable walking on unstructured terrain and fast walking can only be achieved with an orientation sensor. The control system of the biped robot “Johnnie” is designed such that the orientation of the upper body is controlled throughout all phases of the gait pattern. Furthermore, a sophisticated measurement and control of the foot torques has been implemented. In this way, the interaction forces and torques between robot and environment are controlled and tilting of the foot is avoided.

The Dual Smart Drive is a specially designed nonlinear actuator intended for use in climbing and walking legged robots. It features a continuously changing transmission ratio and dual properties and is very suitable for situations where the same drive is required to perform two different types of start-stop motions of a mobile link. Then, the associated control problem to this nonlinear actuator is established and a backstepping design strategy is adopted to develop Lyapunovbased nonlinear controllers that ensure asymptotic tracking of the desired laws of motion, which have been properly selected using time-optimal control. The approach is extended for bounded control inputs. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed nonlinear control methods for the Dual Smart Drive.	autonomous robot;bang file;bang–bang control;computation;control engineering;information architecture institute;nonlinear system;optimal control;robot;s.m.a.r.t.;simulation	Roemi Fernández;João Pedro Hespanha;Teodor Akinfiev;Manuel A.

NMPC is employed as a high-level controller that simultaneously controls the longitudinal and the lateral vehicle motion. The designed emergency collision avoidance controller considers the constraints of maximum wheel steering angle and maximum acceleration. NMPC predicts vehicle position using open-loop dynamics and calculates the optimized wheel steering control input and acceleration control input. A collision avoidance maneuver that does not consider vehicle dynamics may not avoid obstacles. In the worst case, it may transition into another dangerous situation. The performance of the proposed collision avoidance maneuver is simulated in Matlab/Simulink and CarSim, a realistic commercial simulation software.	best, worst and average case;high- and low-level;lateral computing;lateral thinking;matlab;nonlinear system;real-time clock;simulation software;simulink	Chulho Choi;Yeonsik Kang;Seangwock Lee	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety (ICVES 2012)	10.1109/ICVES.2012.6294281	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	62.70540435378409	-16.438160160333094	114328

The solution to the problem is the setpoints of the leg contact forces for a particular system task. In this paper, the efficient compact QP method which takes into account both the linear and quadratic objective functions is adopted to resolve this constrained optimization problem. Various objective functions such as minimum force, load balance, safety margin on friction constraints can be considered by the compact QP method. This method can also be applied to smooth discontinuities in commanded forces by manipulating the homogeneous solution and including smoothing periods when the leg phase alternates between support and transfer. This smoothing scheme does not require force sensors. Multiple goals which consider several alternative objective functions can also be achieved by the compact QP method.

Firstly, based on the spatial structure of the dual-arm robot with gantry, a novel mathematical model is presented between the joint variables and the terminal attitude and the quaternion replaces the Euler Angle to describe the posture for avoiding gimbal lock. Then a constraint model predictive controller is constructed for the multi-variable, nonlinear and coupling model of the robot and the constraints of the environment. Meanwhile, the temporal logic formula is used for describing the complex welding tasks and reducing the workload of repeated programming. Next the expectation values and constraints are converted by the temporal logic formula will be sent to the predictive controller one by one. Finally, the simulation result shows that the system can effectively solve the problem of motion planning for the welding dual-arm robot with gantry.	euler;gimbal lock;mathematical model;motion planning;nonlinear system;poor posture;robot welding;simulation;temporal logic;transform, clipping, and lighting	Shaoying He;Dewei Li;Yugeng Xi	2018	2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2018.8444213	workload;control theory;euler angles;control engineering;gimbal lock;control theory;engineering;motion planning;nonlinear system;model predictive control;temporal logic	Robotics	65.9042524363251	-17.596875910295164	114933

In this new formulation, the quadratic errors of position, velocity, and acceleration are minimized subject to the rear wheel car-like vehicle nonlinear kinematic model. Minimizing the error of velocity and acceleration in addition to the error of position, allows us to obtain both optimal vehicle trajectory and control law. The Variational approach is used to minimize the cost function. Then, optimal trajectory and control inputs are numerically calculated by solving a set of two-point boundary value (TPBV) nonlinear differential equations. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated in two scenarios of lane changing and multi-curvature road which verify the success of the proposed method in generating an optimal trajectory and control inputs.	algorithm;autonomous robot;function representation;loss function;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;polynomial;scott continuity;variational principle;velocity (software development)	Sema Durmus Duzgun;Mohammad Razeghi-Jahromi;Abdollah Homaifar	2018	2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	10.1109/IVS.2018.8500609	acceleration;differential equation;boundary value problem;quadratic equation;optimal control;nonlinear system;kinematics;control theory;trajectory;mathematics	Robotics	62.65164042482587	-19.085710239423666	115572

This framework is versatile allowing different types of search schemes (exhaustive vs. preemptive), various part separation techniques, and the ability to group parts, or not, into subassemblies to improve the solution efficiency and parallelism. This enables a truly hierarchical approach to disassembly sequence planning. We demonstrate two different search strategies using this framework that can either yield a single solution quickly or provide a spectrum of solutions from which an optimal may be selected. We also develop a method for subassembly identification based on collision information. Our results show improved performance over an iterative motion planning based method for finding a single solution and greater functionality through hierarchical planning and optimal solution search.	disassembler;feasible region;iterative method;mathematical optimization;motion planning;parallel computing;separation kernel;tree traversal	Timothy Ebinger;Sascha Kaden;Shawna L.

The cable length is controlled in relation to the direction of the cable so that the inspection end-effecter hanging at the tip of the cable can follow the path dynamically despite the lack of full degrees of freedom. We analyze the tracing dynamics, address under what conditions a given geometric path can be traced (traceability conditions), and prove under what conditions the tracing motion is repetitive.

7fb8a1ad44a029ff440155023e833d6b64351c39	hardware/software co-design techniques for compass search self-tuning pid controller in dc drive applications		This paper presents the development of a self-tuning digital controller for DC motor applications, specifically designed using hardware/software co-design techniques. Two tuning structures are investigated and then implemented, both reliant on a compass direct search algorithm. The developed structures overcome many of the typical limitations of classical self-tuning methods; such as computation complexity, simplicity of adaptation, and ease of real-time tuning. The self-tuning processes are based on measuring the closed loop impulse response by injecting an excitation signal and comparing the measured signal with the desired ideal impulse response. Optimal PID parameters are achieved once the measured and the desired impulse response are matched. Special focus is given on rapid implementation of the presented on-line tuning mechanism for the digital PID controller using the National Instruments-RIO architecture and LabVIEW-FPGA design tools.

Motion planning has application in many areas such as robotics, virtual reality systems, computer-aided design, and even computational biology. Although there have been steady advances in motion planning algorithms, especially in randomized approaches such as probabilistic roadmap methods (PRMs) or rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs), there are still some classes of problems that cannot be solved efficiently using these state-of-the-art motion planners. In this paper, we suggest an iterative strategy addressing this problem where we first simplify the problem by relaxing some feasibility constraints, solve the easier version of the problem, and then use that solution to help us find a solution for the harder problem. We show how this strategy can be applied to rigid bodies and to linkages with high degrees of freedom, including both open and closed chain systems. Experimental results are presented for linkages composed of 9-98 links. Although we use PRMs as the automated planner, the framework is general and can be applied with other motion planning techniques as well.	automated planning and scheduling;computational biology;computer-aided design;iterative method;linear programming relaxation;motion planning;probabilistic roadmap;randomized algorithm;robotics;virtual reality	O.

The new method combines the static and dynamic modes of trajectory planning to provide an algorithm that gives fast and optimal solutions for static environments, and generates a new path when an unexpected situation occurs. The particularity of the method is in the representation of the static environment in a judicious way facilitating the path planning and reducing the processing time. Moreover, when an unexpected obstacle blocks the robot trajectory, the method uses the robot sensors to detect the obstacle, finds a best way to circumvent it and then resumes its path toward the desired destination. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In order to find this encoding, we build a database of optimal walking trajectories for a 3D humanoid model by sampling the input space (initial state and footstep sequence) and solving a physically-based trajectory optimization problem for each sample. Then, the function coefficients are obtained by fitting the data using least squares. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing the function values with other optimal walking motion data generated with different footstep samples. As an application, we use a quadratic function to calculate the effort cost used in finding an optimal footstep sequence with an A* algorithm. Our study shows that a simple function can encode optimal walking effectively, which provides a fast alternative to online optimization of walking with full body dynamics.	a* search algorithm;coefficient;encode;least squares;mass effect trilogy;mathematical optimization;online optimization;optimization problem;quadratic function;sampling (signal processing);stepping level;supercomputer;trajectory optimization;universality probability;vii	Junggon Kim;Nancy S.

A receding horizon control (RHC) approach is formulated that directly relates navigation uncertainty and process noise to non-convex quadratic constraints, which enforce passive safety in the presence of a large class of navigation or propulsion system failures. Several Keplerian simulations are executed to examine increased ¿v usage incurred by adding passive safety constraints, the corresponding reduction in collision probability, and resulting passively safe formation flight geometries. Results show that modest cross-track motion significantly reduces collision probability, and that once a passively safe relative orbit is achieved, steady-state ¿v usage rates are comparable to usage rates without passive safety constraints. Navigation uncertainty and process noise are found to be significant ¿v usage drivers for passively safe proximity operations. Onorbit autonomous RHC control with passive safety constraints applied to proximity operation missions enables trajectory generation and control that reduces collision probability to acceptable levels while minimizing ¿v usage.	apache axis;autonomous robot;distributed computing;gaussian process;many-worlds interpretation;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;recueil des historiens des croisades;simulation;steady state;time complexity	Marcus J.

Despite of that, the problem of navigation and motion planning for continuum manipulators turns out to be demanding tasks due to the complexity of their flexible structure modelling which in turns complicates the pose estimation. In this paper, we present a real-time obstacle avoidance algorithm for tendon-driven continuum-style manipulator in dynamic environments. The algorithm is equipped with a non-linear observer based on an Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the pose of every point along the manipulator's body. The overall algorithm works well for a model of a single-segment continuum manipulator in a real-time simulation environment with moving obstacles in the workspace of manipulators.	3d pose estimation;algorithm;apache continuum;biomechatronics;coat of arms;extended kalman filter;mathematical model;motion planning;nonlinear system;obstacle avoidance;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;robotics;simulation;triune continuum paradigm;workspace	Ahmad Ataka;Peng Qi;Ali Shiva;Ali Shafti;Helge A.

The proposed model adaptiveness comes from estimating the movement of the Center of Gravity CoG combined with the thrust constant of the motors, making the system robust to disturbances and fast to adapt to changing parameters, while also taking under consideration the control signal bounds in order to guarantee for no motor stalls, while flying. The linear requirements of the MPC are adhered to by transforming the estimation and control problem into a control signal squared domain, making the system linear. The efficacy of the proposed estimation and control scheme is presented in simulations where worst case scenarios have been considered.

These utility functions, along with their coefficients and parameters, comprise a set of beliefs. The term “belief” is used to describe how autonomous systems associate quantified confidences in the existence of things that make up their worldly knowledge; hence, decisions made by an AI system are governed by the states of its belief. Just as in control system theory where the states are quantities used to estimate and describe the behaviors of electrical and/or mechanical systems, belief states are quantities that are used to describe and estimate decision making characteristics. For evolving AI systems (e.g., ones that change their belief states over time through learning) and heterogeneous systems (e.g., ones that do not share a common notion of a global belief), it is important to develop mechanisms that will allow these systems to converge their beliefs, where they can determine how each other “thinks.” This is important since it will allow each agent in a cooperating collective to make decisions that optimally solves their individual needs, along with their collective needs, without requiring explicit communication or a mediator. In this paper, methodologies are presented that facilitate belief convergence. The significance of this study is that we demonstrate how a state observer, such as a Kalman filter, can be used by each agent in a collective to estimate neighboring belief states. This is done with no a priori information of their neighbors' belief states, and by only comparing each individual's estimate for the required effort of the whole collective to perform a group plan.	artificial intelligence;autonomous system (internet);coefficient;control engineering;control system;converge;kalman filter;matchware mediator;systems theory	Jamahl Overstreet;Farshad Khorrami;Prashanth Krishnamurthy	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6425830	mobile robot;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory	AI	56.24510843986733	-19.537442461060902	117410

For a class of actuation mechanisms, we derive a controller for the geometric center of the sphere to asymptotically track any sufficiently smooth reference trajectory, with robustness to bounded, constant uncertainties in the inertial properties of the sphere and actuation mechanism, and to constant disturbance forces including, for example, from constant inclination of the rolling surface. The sphere and actuator are modeled as distinct systems, coupled by reaction forces. It is assumed that the actuator can provide three independent control torques, and that the actuator center of mass remains at a constant distance from the geometric center of the sphere. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for such a controller to exist is that for any constant disturbance torque acting on the sphere there is a constant input such that the sphere and the actuator mechanism has a stable relative equilibrium. A geometric PID controller guarantees robust, semi-global, locally exponential stability for the position tracking error of the geometric center of the sphere, while ensuring that actuator velocities are bounded.	robot;semiconductor industry;time complexity	T.

The problem of dynamic motion planning and payload maximization was formulated using open-loop optimal control theory. Then, the indirect solution based on Pontryagin’s minimum principle was employed to solve the problem. Using the proposed method, complete nonlinear states and control constraints were treated without any simplifications such as linearizing the dynamics equations, discretizing the robot’s workspace, or parameterizing the solution.

Scaling methods are based on the path/velocity decomposition principle: a dynamic filter is used to modify the longitudinal velocity along a planned path in order to satisfy given system constraints. The strategy here proposed enhances the results of a previous work by enlarging the number of considered constraints. In particular, still accounting for the existence of bounds on joint velocities and torques, in this paper, the presence of constraints on joint accelerations is also considered. Furthermore, the nonlinear filter, which represents the core of the scaling system, has been revised in order to devise a new and more compact implementation. Finally, some practical issues that could occur in actual implementations are discussed and solutions are proposed to overcome possible problems.	constraint (mathematics);digital filter;image scaling;nonlinear system;performance;real-time clock;robot;velocity (software development)	Corrado Guarino Lo Bianco;Friedrich M.

8d2250235a9b18ed07eb27ea8de2fe640eae8ad0	active trailer steering control for high-capacity vehicle combinations		In this paper, a new control strategy for the active steering of a trailers of longer and heavier vehicle combinations is proposed to improve both low speed maneuverability and high speed stability. A novelty of the approach is in the use of a single controller structure for all velocities using a gain scheduling method for optimal performance at any velocity. To achieve such a control objective, the problem is initially formulated as a path following problem and subsequently transformed into a tracking problem using a reference model. To support controller design, a generic nonlinear model of a double articulated vehicle, based on a single track model, is employed. The proposed systematic design approach allows to easily adjust the controller for additional trailers or different dimensions, in which only some of the towed vehicles are allowed to steer. The performance of the controller is verified on a high-fidelity multi-body model for evidencing the practical applicability of the approach. Simulation results show substantial reduction of both, the swept path width and tail swing for low speed, and the rearward amplification for high speed.	control theory;nonlinear system;reference model;scheduling (computing);simulation;velocity (software development)	Karel Kural;Pavlos Hatzidimitris;Nathan van de Wouw;Igo Besselink;Henk Nijmeijer	2017	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles	10.1109/TIV.2017.2767281	novelty;vehicle dynamics;trailer;control engineering;reference model;control theory;articulated vehicle;automotive engineering;active steering;computer science;gain scheduling	Robotics	65.98530198360737	-13.96640652802081	117760

The mission space is modeled using a probability density function representing the probability of occurrence of events. The distributed scheme is generated by the decomposition of a single optimal coverage problem into distributed receding horizon coverage control problems, each of them associated with one robot. The distributed coverage scheme is proven to optimally stabilize robots at a centroidal Voronoi configuration, which is an optimal configuration to cover an event. The control scheme is tested in three simulation environments to illustrate its good performance at environments with any probability density function of events, as well as its ability to generalize to much larger groups of mobile robots.	configuration interaction;mobile robot;simulation	Fateme Mohseni;Ali Doustmohammadi;Mohammad Bagher Menhaj	2016	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2014.2325219	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;trajectory;control theory	Robotics	57.48571932186015	-22.643579387940093	117846

The evolved densities are fit with a Gaussian mixture model and compared probabilistically to evaluate the validity of the simplified dynamics models over time. With this method, analysis of a formation flying mission on a halo orbit near the Sun/Earth-Moon L2 point reveals a 2 hr window of validity in which the relative satellite dynamics are indistinguishable from a double integrator (DI) and initial relative velocities drive model uncertainty.	approximation algorithm;consensus dynamics;control engineering;mixture model;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;particle filter;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;velocity (software development)	Isaac Miller;Mark E.

Internet-based tele-robotic systems are characterized by the fact that the operator and the remote robotic system are connected by Internet. Since limited bandwidth, random time delay and other transmission problems deteriorate performance of tele-robotic systems severely, control strategies which can be used to settle transmission problems are expected. The obvious characteristic of the new method introduced in this paper is that control commands have a linguistic flavor, data transferred between operator and remote robot can be reduced accordingly. The framework presented in this paper has the potential of reducing operator's working pressure and enhancing the performance of the system. Furthermore, the existing motion description language modal is expanded to deal with the packet loss and disorder problem. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel framework for tele-robotics and its implementation in a real tele-manipulator system.	broadcast delay;control system;internet;mdl (programming language);modal logic;robot;smt placement equipment;television;user interface	Jianning Hua;Hongyi Li;Yuechao Wang;Ning Xi	2010	2010 11th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision	10.1109/ICARCV.2010.5707267	telerobotics;control engineering;computer vision;the internet;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;trajectory;packet loss;robot kinematics	Robotics	66.01869792083775	-23.090217621043582	118014

A compliant contact model is developed to solve the static in-determinacy problem in multiple-contact power grasp. A dynamic simulation algorithm is developed based on a discrete-time, state variable approach. The algorithm models friction, rolling, slipping, and wedging eeects, as well as the changing topological structure of power grasp dynamics. The simulation algorithm is implemented for the DIGITS Grasping System , and results of quasi-static and dynamic stability experiments are discussed.	algorithm;dynamic simulation;experiment	Khalid Mirza;Mark D.

Multi-robot systems are composed of several robots that generally are similar, so if an economic optimization is done in one of them, such optimization can be replicated in each member. In this paper we deal with the economic optimization of each control loops of the subsystems that each robot must control individually. As the subsystems can be complex, we propose to use a Predictive Control modeled by Time Delayed Neural Networks and implemented using very low cost Field Programmable Gate Arrays.	robot	José Manuel López-Guede;Manuel Graña;Ekaitz Zulueta;Oscar Barambones	2008		10.1007/978-3-642-02490-0_128	real-time computing;computer science;machine learning;control theory;time delay neural network;model predictive control;field-programmable gate array	Robotics	55.10738674730093	-16.87484606379589	118681

It is well known that in the reference-tracking, for nonminimum phase systems, there exists a fundamental performance limitation in terms of a lower bound on the L/sub 2/-norm of the tracking error, even when the control effort is free. We show that this is not the case for the less stringent path-following problem, where the control objective is to force the output to follow a geometric path without a timing law assigned to it. Furthermore, the same is true even when an additional desired speed assignment is imposed.	minimum phase	Antonio Pedro Aguiar;João Pedro Hespanha;Petar V.

One method to remedy this problem is the use of predictive controllers in which the slave and environment dynamics are modelled and rendered locally at master to reproduce the contact information and bypass the delayed feedback loop. A major challenge in these controllers is the agility of local model adaptation to the changes in environment dynamics and its synchronization with slave contact events. In this paper, a novel collision prediction method using laser rangefinder is introduced. The proposed method is employed to synchronize the master local model and slave control events in a force position teleoperation architecture. Moreover, this method speeds up environment identification algorithm. The proposed predictive controller is evaluated experimentally on a one degree of freedom (DOF) master-slave teleoperation setup and its performance is compared to that of a conventional force-position controller	algorithm;bilateral filter;experiment;feedback	Farid Mobasser;Keyvan Hashtrudi-Zaad	2006	2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering	10.1109/CCECE.2006.277568	telerobotics;control engineering;simulation;stability;computer science;engineering;feedback loop;control theory;feedback;degrees of freedom;model predictive control;statistics;channel	Robotics	68.30404593290142	-13.069189552257253	118798

Due to the nonholonomic kinematics model, it is difficult to drive flexible needles to track a pre-plan path. In this paper, we propose an effective path tracking control method based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The kinematics model of flexible needles is described firstly, according to which the control method is designed. Then, the path tracking control method is presented in detail. The finite prediction horizon of MPC is extended to infinite in order to obtain a global optimal solution. Due to the nonlinear model, the objective function of receding horizon optimization is also nonlinear, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to search optimal predictive control series. At last, simulations are conducted and results illustrate that the proposed controller performs well to precisely drive the flexible needle to track a desired path.	controllers;inverse kinematics;loss function;mathematical optimization;mesenchymal stem cells;needle device;nonlinear system;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;puncture procedure;simulation;wounds and injuries	Benyan Huo;Xingang Zhao;Jianda Han;Weiliang L.

Additionally, ultimate boundedness of the unactuated sway velocity is proven. Simulation results are presented to show numerically that the controller works as expected in the ideal case. Outdoor experimental results are presented, using a GPS and compass as sensors, showing the practical feasibility of the approach in the presence of sensor noise, disturbances, and unmodeled dynamics.	algorithm;control theory;course (navigation);experiment;global positioning system;image noise;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;pid;rejection sampling;robotics;sensor;simulation;time complexity;underactuation;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	John M.

The main goal of this study is a novel soft computing based approach in controlling the rotor speed of wind turbine. The performance objectives for controller design is to keep the error between the controlled output (speed of rotor) and the target rotor speed, as small as possible. The wind turbine involves controlling both the aerodynamics and hydrodynamics response together, therefore in this paper an attempt is being made using soft computing approach. The commonly used proportional --- integral --- derivative controller (PID controller) for wind turbines employs Ziegler and Nichols (ZN) approach which leads to excessive amplitude in some situations. In this work, the parameters of PID controller are obtained using the conventional method that is ZN along with the artificial intelligence (AI) technique. Two types of AI (i) bacteria foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA) and (ii) particle swarm optimization (PSO) coupled with ZN controller are studied. The controller performance indices are taken as integral square error, steady state error, controller gain, maximum overshoot and settling time. In this work, the idea of model generation and optimization is explored for PID controller. The planned controller strategy would be able to carry out high quality performance which reveal that the proposed controller system can significantly reduce the errors and settling time.

To date, nearly all designs and analyses of omnidirectional robots have considered the case of motion on flat, smooth terrain. This paper presents a kinematic analysis and control method for an omnidirectional mobile robot driven by active split offset casters operating on rough, uneven terrain. Robot average isotropy is analyzed as a function of wheel module geometry on both flat and rough terrain. A simple kinematic control scheme that considers the effects of terrain unevenness is presented. The performance of the algorithm in rough terrain is studied in simulation. It is shown that with knowledge of terrain conditions, near- omnidirectional mobility is achievable in rough terrain.	algorithm;british undergraduate degree classification;mobile robot;rough set;simulation;terrain rendering	Martin Udengaard;Karl Iagnemma	2007	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2007.4398996	control engineering;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;robotics	Robotics	65.7714497646939	-19.646163267434236	119178

Our approach consists of introducing an auxiliary dynamical system whose output (which is also a unit quaternion) is used in the control law together with the unit quaternion representing the attitude tracking error. Roughly speaking, the necessary damping that would have been achieved by the direct use of the angular velocity can be achieved, in our approach, by the vector part q of the error signal between the output of the auxiliary system and the unit quaternion tracking error. The resulting velocity-free control scheme guarantees almost global 1 asymptotic stability which is as strong as the topology of the motion space can permit. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.	angularjs;block cipher mode of operation;control theory;dynamical system;optimal control;simulation;velocity (software development)	Abdelhamid Tayebi	2007	2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2007.4434055	control engineering;rigid body;dynamical system;control theory;mathematics;attitude control;tracking	Robotics	65.70246505392083	-13.005195536760654	119268

The approach represents a path by a series of via points connected by elastic strings which are subject to displacement due to collisions with obstacle regions as well as constraints pertaining to the domain to which path planning is applied. Obstacle regions are represented by a potential field created by a multilayered neural network. A fast simulated annealing approach is used for local minima problems from the potential field. The automatic generation and removal of via points is incorporated in the path planning approach to ensure collision-free planning regardless of the complexity of the environment. Local and global bias on the potential field is used to avoid any existing singularities and local minima. Our path planning approach is flexible, efficient and massively parallel.	artificial neural network;motion planning	Sukhan Lee;George Kardaras	1997		10.1109/CIRA.1997.613846	robot;mathematical optimization;propulsion;fast path;simulated annealing;any-angle path planning;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;maxima and minima;motion planning;obstacle avoidance;artificial neural network	Robotics	55.03884914075686	-22.74814857214221	119399

Snake robots, a class of hyper-redundant mechanisms, can use their many degrees of freedom to achieve a variety of locomotion capabilities. Like their biological counterparts, snake robots locomote using cyclic motions called gaits. These cyclic motions directly control the snake robot's internal degrees of freedom which causes a net motion (e.g. sining moves the robot forward, strafing moves the robot laterally, and spinning rotates the robot about its center). The gaits described in this paper fall into two categories: differentiable and piecewise differentiable. The differentiable gaits, as their name suggests, can be described by a differentiable function whereas the piecewise cannot. This paper describes the functions we prescribed for gait generation and our experiences in making these robots operate in real experiments.	experiment;robot	Kevin Lipkin;Isaac Brown;Aaron Peck;Howie Choset;Justine Rembisz;Philip Gianfortoni;Allison Naaktgeboren	2007	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2007.4399638	control engineering;motion control;mobile robot;simulation;gait analysis;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;robot locomotion;control theory;robot control;degrees of freedom	Robotics	68.2184271171431	-23.864649049927	119429

This paper addresses walking pattern synthesis and sensory feedback control for humanoid stair climbing. The proposed stair-climbing gait is formulated to satisfy the environmental constraint, the kinematic constraint, and the stability constraint; the selection of the gait parameters is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. The sensory feedback controller is phase dependent and consists of the torso attitude controller, zero moment point compensator, and impact reducer. The online learning scheme of the proposed feedback controller is based on a policy gradient reinforcement learning method, and the learned controller is robust against external disturbance. The effectiveness of our proposed method was confirmed by walking experiments on a 32-degree-of-freedom humanoid robot.	control theory;experience;experiment;feed forward (control);feedback;feedforward neural network;gradient;hill climbing;humanoid robot;humans;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;reinforcement learning;speech synthesis;zero moment point	Chenglong Fu;Ken Chen	2008	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2008.921205	control engineering;simulation;nonlinear programming;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory;feedback	Robotics	63.3532896339124	-13.282508061413823	119584

A cooperative dynamic surface control design approach is proposed to devise the formation tracking controllers, where nonlinearly-parameterized neural networks are used to compensate for the model uncertainties. It is proved that with the developed controllers, formation among vehicles can be reached if the trajectory has directed paths to all follower vehicles. Based on Lyapunov stability analysis, all signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded, and formation tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulation results are given to show the efficacy of the proposed method.	artificial neural network;block cipher mode of operation;converge;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;simulation	Zhouhua Peng;Dan Wang;Gang Sun;Hao Wang;Wei Wang	2013		10.3182/20130902-3-CN-3020.00118	control theory	Robotics	65.01376215070572	-11.685997728982185	120508
584ee8ddb1222db4ad86adcd9d2d51b80403b671	human-directed coordinated control of an assistive mobile manipulator		This paper considers the control of a mobile manipulator with the end-effector commanded by a human user. The motivation is to empower mobility impaired individuals to tackle certain activities of daily living. The prototype robotic system consists of a redundant articulated arm mounted on a mobile base. The human user specifies the desired motion of certain degrees of freedom, such as the translation or rotation of the arm end-effector. An optimization-based control algorithm determines the full arm and base motion to minimize deviation from the human intent while satisfying certain equality and inequality constraints. These constraints may involve physical requirements of the system, e.g., collision avoidance and joint limits, and human user consideration, such as intuitiveness of the combined arm and base motion. This constraint optimization problem is strictly convex and may be efficiently solved as a quadratic problem.

In other words, each connected autonomous vehicle makes cooperative lane-changing decision independently. In the state prediction module, we employed existing cooperative car-following models to predict the vehicles’ future state. In the candidate decision generation module, we proposed incentive based model to generate a candidate decision. In the candidate decision coordination module, we proposed an algorithm to avoid candidate lane-changing decision that may lead to a vehicle collision or traffic deterioration to be final decision. Moreover, the effects of decentralized cooperative lane-changing decision-making framework on traffic stability, efficiency, homogeneity, and safety are investigated in a numerical simulation experiment. Some stability, efficiency, homogeneity, and safety indicators are evaluated and show the high potential of our proposed framework in traffic dynamics.	algorithm;autonomous robot;computer simulation	Jianqiang Nie;Jian Zhang;Wanting Ding;Xia Wan;Xiaoxuan Chen;Bin Ran	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2649567	simulation;computer security	Robotics	55.98658975293809	-20.92237603517008	120795

In this paper, a new solution is proposed. The key idea is to divide the global full-constraining task into several subtasks, which can be applied or inactivated to take into account potential constraints of the environment. Far from any constraint, the robot moves according to the full task. When it comes closer to a configuration to avoid, a higher level controller removes one or several subtasks, and activates them again when the constraint is avoided. The last controller ensures the convergence at the global level by introducing some look-ahead capabilities when a local minimum is reached. The robot accomplishes the global task by automatically sequencing sensor-based tasks, obstacle avoidance, and short deliberative phases. In this paper, a complete solution to implement this idea is proposed, along with several experiments that prove the validity of this approach	constraint (mathematics);converge;experiment;maxima and minima;motion planning;obstacle avoidance;robot	Nicolas Mansard;François Chaumette	2007	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2006.889487	planning;control engineering;motion control;mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;sequencing;sequence;motion planning;obstacle avoidance;degrees of freedom;redundancy;robotics;visual servoing	Robotics	62.97247414278963	-21.47961248541664	120859

A hovering vehicle interacting with objects and surfaces must be robust to contact forces and torques transmitted to the airframe. These produce coupled dynamics that are distinctly different from those of free flight. While external contact is generally avoided, extending aerial robot functionality to include contact with the environment during flight opens up new and useful areas such as perching, object grasping, and manipulation. These mechanics may be modeled as elastic couplings between the aircraft and the ground, represented by springs in R3×SO(3). We show that proportional derivative and proportional integral derivative (PID) attitude and position controllers that stabilize a rotorcraft in free flight will also stabilize the aircraft during contact for a range of contact displacements and stiffnesses. Simulation of the coupled aircraft dynamics demonstrates stable and unstable modes of the system. We find analytical measures that predict the stability of these systems and consider, in particular, the planar system in which the contact point is directly beneath the rotor. We show through explicit solution of the linearized system that the planar dynamics of the object-helicopter system in vertical, horizontal, and pitch motion around equilibrium remain stable, within a range of contact stiffnesses, under unmodified PID attitude control. Flight experiments with a small-scale PID-stabilized helicopter fitted with a compliant gripper for capturing objects affirm our model's stability predictions.	aerial photography;aerobot;control theory;experiment;interaction;pid;r.o.t.o.r.;robot end effector;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Paul E.

247da27b4cb6ce5e9828ebe414e7eb0c297170b8	efficient and stable locomotion for impulse-actuated robots using strictly convex foot shapes		Impulsive actuation enables robots to perform agile maneuvers and surpass difficult terrain, yet its capacity to induce continuous and stable locomotion have not been explored. We claim that strictly convex foot shapes can improve the impulse effectiveness (impulse used per travelled distance) and locomotion speed by facilitating periodicity and stability. To test this premise, we introduce a theoretical 2-D model based on rigid-body mechanics to prove stability. We then implement a more elaborate model in simulation to study transient behavior and impulse effectiveness. Finally, we test our findings on a robot platform to prove their physical validity. Our results prove that continuous and stable locomotion can be achieved in the strictly convex case of a disk with an off-centered mass. In keeping with our theory, stable limit cycles of the off-centered disk outperform the theoretical performance of a cube in simulation and experiment, using up to 10 times less impulse per distance to travel at the same locomotion speed.

The proposed controllers are simple and can easily be implemented in the outer feedback loop that encloses the inner Cartesian position control system supplied by the robot manufacturer. In the position-based force control approach, adaptive PID and nonlinear PI controllers are proposed for setpoint tracking in which the controller gains are adjusted on-line as functions of the force error. In the position-based compliance control approach, nonlinear and adaptive PD controllers are developed to achieve a desired behavior at contact, where the controller gains are functions of the contact force. Dynamic simulation results for a 7-DOF Robotics Research Corporation (RRC) arm are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the adaptive compliance control scheme in executing contact tasks. Experimental results are also presented to illustrate nonlinear force control of the RRC arm. The results demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear PI controller, where the integral gain is a sigmoidal function of the force error, yields superior performance compared to afixed-gain PI controller by producing a fast force response with a small settling time while preventing oscillations. Finally, the nonlinear PD compliance controller is implemented on the RRC arm and experimental results are presented. These results demonstrate that the nonlinear PD controller, where the proportional gain is a hyperbolic function of the contact force, exhibits less sensitivity to the surface stiffness than afixed-gain PD controller.	control system;feedback;nonlinear system;online and offline;pid;robot;robotics;setpoint (control system);settling time;sigmoid function;simulation	Homayoun Seraji	1998	I.

The method combines natural gait plan (NGP) and 3-D linear inverted pendulum model (3D-LIPM). By analyzing the human natural gait, the HCCOM considers the effect of swinging leg for COM height, so the hip height is no longer fixed and re-planned as a periodic movement. We divide the walk gait into four stages and indicate the process of gait generation. For the test platform, we develop IPR-I robot, through the simulation and experimental analysis, the HCCOM can effectively solve the swinging leg's effect on COM height, get stable and practical gait, reduce effect of the model inaccuracy for the 3D-LIPM.	humanoid robot	Fayong Guo;Jianghai Zhao;Tao Mei;Minzhou Luo;Xiaobo Song	2014		10.1109/ROBIO.2014.7090509	planning;computer vision;simulation;computer science;engineering;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;trajectory;mathematical model	Robotics	64.79953403264561	-23.298651457632783	121542

While for non-redundant robots the problem of finding such trajectories has been solved, the redundant case has not been treated exhaustively. In this contribution, the problem is split into two interlaced parts: inverse kinematics and trajectory optimization. In a direct optimization approach, the inverse kinematics problem is solved numerically at each time point. Therein, the manupulator’s kinematic redundancy is exploited by introducing scaled nullspace basis vectors of the Jacobian of differential velocities. The scaling factors for each time point are decision variables, thus the inverse kinematics is solved optimally w.r.t. the trajectory optimization goal, i.e. minimizing end time. The effectiveness of the presented method is shown by means of the example of a planar 4R manipulator with two redundant degrees of freedom.	basis (linear algebra);central processing unit;computation;decision theory;image scaling;interlaced video;inverse kinematics;jacobian matrix and determinant;kernel (linear algebra);latent class model;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;robot end effector;shooting method;trajectory optimization	Alexander Reiter;Hubert Gattringer;Andreas Müller	2016		10.5220/0005975800610068	computer vision	Robotics	63.18469454116785	-21.082028061653602	121605

Decentralized neural networks are used to control each axis of the x-y table robot separately. For an each neural network compensator, an inverse control technique is used. The neural network control technique called the reference compensation technique (RCT) is conceptually different from the existing neural controllers in that the NN controller compensates for uncertainties in the dynamical system by modifying desired trajectories. The back-propagation learning algorithm is developed in a real time DSP board for on-line learning. Practical real time position control experiments are conducted on the x-y table robot. Experimental results of using neural networks show more excellent position tracking than that of when PD controllers are used only.	artificial neural network;control table;robot	Hyun Taek Cho;Sung-Su Kim;Seul Jung	2008	Int.

The classical definition of the problem assumes that the set of agents is unchangeable, and that the distances in the graph are homogeneous. We propose to add to the problem specification a set of new attributes to bring it closer to the real world. These attributes include varying distances, number of agents that can occupy an edge or node, and dynamic appearance of new agents.	pathfinding	Jirí Svancara	2018		10.24963/ijcai.2018/837	homogeneous;satisfiability;distributed computing;computer science;search algorithm;graph	AI	54.346851032370466	-22.397394518952098	121916

As a consequence, the hexarotor pose cannot track an arbitrary trajectory while the center of mass is tracking a position trajectory. In this paper, we consider a different hexarotor architecture where propellers are tilted, without the need of any additional hardware. In this way, the hexarotor gains a 6-DoF actuation which allows to independently reach positions and orientations in free space and to be able to exert forces on the environment to resist any wrench for aerial manipulation tasks. After deriving the dynamical model of the proposed hexarotor, we discuss the controllability and the tilt angle optimization to reduce the control effort for the specific task. An exact feedback linearization and decoupling control law is proposed based on the input-output mapping, considering the Jacobian and task acceleration, for non-linear trajectory tracking. The capabilities of our approach are shown by simulation results.	aerial photography;coupling (computer programming);experiment;fundamental interaction;jacobian matrix and determinant;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optic axis of a crystal;optimal control;parallax propeller;prototype;simulation;underactuation;unmanned aerial vehicle;zettabyte	Sujit Rajappa;Markus Ryll;Heinrich H.

This paper proposes a method to reduce the motion range of the trunk by generating a desired trajectory of the ZMP. The trajectory is determined by a fuzzy logic based upon the leg trajectories that are arbitrary selected. The resulting ZMP trajectory is similar to human’s one and the ZMP continuously moves forward. The proposed scheme is simulated on a 7-degree-of-freedom biped robot. Its results indicate that the proposed ZMP trajectory increases the stability of the locomotion and thus resulting in reduction of motion range of the trunk.	algorithm;fuzzy logic;robot;simulation;zero moment point	Jong H.

The trajectory of a ball is function of its initial velocity, launch angle, and some aerodynamic effect. Specially, the initial velocity is created by an instant impulse given to the ball. The external impulse exerted to a ball by a kicking robot is function of robot geometry and dynamic parameters. Initially, we analyze the external impulses for several kicking postures and simulate trajectories for several different kicking conditions. Based on this observation, a trajectory-planning algorithm of a ball, in which the initial velocity and the launch angle of the ball are calculated for a desired trajectory of the ball, is proposed, and then an external impulse required for that motion is calculated and applied to the kicking simulation. The aerodynamic effect such as drag force and lift force is also incorporated into the dynamic simulation of the soccer ball. A kicking robot has been developed for experimental verification of the proposed analytical methodology. It was shown that experimental result is in good agreement with simulation result within 10% error bound.	algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;ball project;dynamic simulation;experience;is functions;launch angle;reinforcement learning;robot;time of arrival;velocity (software development)	Je Youn Choi;Byung Rok So;Byung-Ju Yi;Whee Kuk Kim;Il Hong Suh	2005	Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570543	control engineering;dynamic simulation;kinematics;simulation;index term;aerodynamics;engineering;trajectory;drag;control theory;impact	Robotics	65.3185922804302	-19.174681497292713	122424

To maximize the formation aerodynamic benefits at different flight maneuvers, the formation geometry is described in the wind frame of the leader aircraft. A novel nonlinear robust close formation control algorithm with a two-degree-of-freedom nature is developed. The command filtered backstepping technique is employed to design the baseline formation controller, whereas the UDE is introduced to enhance the robustness of the baseline formation control. The proposed control law can lead to desired tracking performance for the close formation flight under different maneuvers without using the acceleration information of the leader aircraft, asymptotical stability for the close formation flight at a level and straight flight with constant speeds, and enough robustness against the formation aerodynamic effects by purely observing system states and inputs. Numerical simulations are performed to show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed controller.	algorithm;asymptote;baseline (configuration management);computational fluid dynamics;consensus dynamics;flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft);nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;optimal control;simulation	Qingrui Zhang;Hugh H.

First, the dynamics of the micro-heat exchanger, which acts as a nonlinear plant, is identified using a neurofuzzy network. To build the neurofuzzy model, a locally linear learning algorithm, namely, locally linear mode tree (LoLiMoT) is used. Then, an intelligent controller based on brain emotional learning algorithm is applied to the identified model. The intelligent controller is based on a computational model of limbic system in the mammalian brain. The brain emotional learning based intelligent controller (BELBIC) based on PID control is adopted for the micro-heat exchanger plant. The contribution of BELBIC in improving the control system performance is shown by comparison with results obtained from classic PID controller without BELBIC. The results demonstrate excellent improvements of control action, without any considerable increase in control effort for PID + BELBIC. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A first draft path is computed using random motion planning techniques that ensure collision avoidance. In a second step, the draft path is approximated by a whole-body dynamically stable walk trajectory. The contributions of this work are: (i) a formal guarantee, based on small-space controllability criteria, that the first draft path can be approximated by a collision-free dynamically stable trajectory; (ii) an algorithm that uses this theoretical property to find a solution trajectory.

35181cb3afe4124b24b0048daff9ce6bc9cf8616	action petri net for specifying robot motions	formal model;action petri net;motion composition;matrix	Smart robots and smart services using robots are promising research ̄elds in academia and industry. However, those smart services are based on basic motions of the robot, such as grabbing objects, and moving them to a designated place. In this paper, we propose a way to produce new motions without programming, from existing motions, through a motion composition method. Our motion composition method utilizes an Action Petri net, which is a variance of a Petri net, with both interpolation and composition operations on a transition. In the Action Petri net, a place is a posture or a moving action of a robot, and it is represented as a diagonal matrix with the robot's joint motor values. Robot motions can be generated from one posture to another posture, and from composing di®erent postures and moving actions. All operations performed to generate new motions are carried out as matrix manipulation operations. Our approach provides a formal method to generate new motions from existing motions, and a practical method to create new motions in low level motion control, without programming.	broadcast delay;formal methods;humanoid robot;interpolation;library (computing);mathematical model;motion planning;open road tolling;petri net;poor posture;robot	Jongmyung Choi;Youngho Lee;Young-Jae Ryoo;Jongsun Choi;Jaeyoung Choi	2014	I.

The uncertainties have to be considered in estimating the viscoelasticity of the multijoint human arm. In general, the uncertainties existing in the structure of the human arm and the motor command from the central nervous system are subject to the non-Gaussian noises. A generalized Gaussian ratio function is brought in to deal with the non-Gaussian noises. The momotonicity of the generalized Gaussian ratio function is studied based on the approximation formula of Gamma functions, then a robust condition is proposed for the computation of even moments using shape parameters. That is, we can guarantee the accuracy of the simulation results and experimental results by the robust condition. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by the experimental results.	algorithm;approximation;computation;courant–friedrichs–lewy condition;gaussian process;simulation	Mingcong Deng;Ni Bu;Akira Yanou	2010			mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory	Robotics	63.81076716781576	-13.082563636128773	123613
622c5b3df3c65bbb40542124657115b265edb31d	worst case analysis of a launcher vehicle using surrogate models		Abstract   Polynomial surrogate models of an industrial standard, closed-loop launcher model during an atmospheric flight phase are developed. A probabilistic collocation method is applied to derive surrogate models of varying complexity for wind perturbations occurring at different time instances during the atmospheric flight phase. These models are employed in optimisation-based worst-case analysis to significantly reduce the computational overhead while maintaining the accuracy of the computed worst-case uncertain parameter combinations. Comparisons of worst-case analysis results obtained using standard simulation models and their polynomial surrogate equivalents demonstrate significant potential of the proposed approach for radically reducing the computational burden associated with the industrial verification and validation process.	best, worst and average case	Atul Krishna Kamath;Prathyush P.

To develop the adaptive cruise control system, the original throttle system and braking system of the vehicle have to be modified. The original throttle valve which is controlled by a cable from the accelerator pedal is modified to the drive-by-wire system by using a dc motor with a position control algorithm. The braking system is modified by using a dc servo motor to directly control the brake pedal. A proportional and derivative control with error compensation algorithm is proposed to perform the velocity control mode. In the distance control mode, a fuzzy logic algorithm is applied. Inputs of the fuzzy controller are distance error and relative velocity read from a laser range finder. The experiments on a racing circuit show that the vehicle can perform adaptive cruise control efficiently.	advanced intelligent tape;algorithm;control system;experiment;fuzzy logic;servo;velocity (software development)	Worrawut Pananurak;Somphong Thanok;Manukid Parnichkun	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913274	control engineering;adaptive control;engineering;control system;dc motor;automotive engineering;control theory;cruise control	Robotics	61.25174353128742	-12.917053844701892	123921

We focus on finite transition systems with inputs, which are often encountered when solving motion planning problems by using discrete quotients induced by a given partition of the state space. Our approach solves the problem conservatively using LTL games, and consists of the following three steps: (1) the original transition system is transformed into a transition system on which an LTL game can be played, (2) a solution of the LTL game on the new transition system is obtained, and (3) an interface between this solution and the initial transition system is constructed. The correctness of the method is ensured by design. The advantages and conservativeness of our approach are discussed and illustrated by simple examples.	automated planning and scheduling;control theory;correctness (computer science);linear temporal logic;motion planning;nondeterministic algorithm;robot;state space;transition system;vii	Marius Kloetzer;Calin Belta	2007	Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363945	control engineering;game theory;simulation;strategic planning;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;automatic control;control theory;mathematics;motion planning	Robotics	58.0413244602849	-17.11018431308598	124056

The article attempts to solve inverse kinematics, when the lengths of the links of the manipulator are not precisely known. The sources of uncertainties include manufacturing tolerances, approximations for complex link geometries, inaccuracies in joint angle measurements etc. The inverse kinematics is intended to produce solutions for joint variables in interval of tolerances for specified end effector accuracy range. The redundancy resolution is cast as an optimization problem with arm isotropy as performance metric. In solving for the inverse kinematics, two stage interval optimization method is implemented, where, in the first stage, bisection technique is applied and in the second stage interval discrete random variable method is used. As exemplar problem solving, two cases, namely a planar3-degrees-of-freedom and a spatial 5-degrees-of-freedom serial link manipulators are considered.	approximation;inverse kinematics;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;problem solving;robot end effector;serial communication	Virendra Kumar;Soumen Sen;Sankar Nath Shome;S.

The underlying stabilization problem consists of controller designs for position loop and attitude loop, both of which are carried out based on the terminal sliding mode control approach. First, a robust finite-time position controller is designed by considering the bound of disturbances such that the position control loop can be stabilized in finite time. As a consequence, the thrust for altitude stabilization, as well as the desired attitude angles for tracking of the attitude loop are determined. Then, attitude tracking control is realized by further combining robust adaptive control strategy to achieve finite-time attitude tracking with nonlinearities of uncertain inertia and disturbances tackled by an introduced adaption term. A numerical example is presented to verify the proposed control scheme.	control system;control theory;numerical analysis;thrust	Lixian Zhang;Junnan Shen;Yang Fei	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2017.8123133	robustness (computer science);control theory;kinematics;attitude control;control theory;torque;control system;adaptive control;computer science;terminal sliding mode	Robotics	65.66204880866577	-13.067184519186014	124547

We design a globally exponentially stable adaptive observer which estimates the unknown states and parameters of the hydraulic system and in particular quantifies the magnitude of the in-/out-flux and its location in the well. While the observer can be used purely as an in-/out-flux detection system, the paper also presents a simple controller that automatically and effectively stops an in-/out-flux. This novel control scheme departs from common practice for automatic managed pressure drilling, which is to regulate down-hole pressure to some predetermined set point.

High gear ratios reduce the payload sensitivity and computational complexity of the system dynamics but do not eliminate the performance enhancement from accurate compensation of dominant dynamics. Robot controllers must compensate for changes in dominant drive system, link, and payload dynamics to achieve high speed trajectory tracking accuracy. Feedforward dynamic compensation reduced the peak trajectory tracking errors of an independent-joint PD (proportional differential) controller by a factor of three. Knowledge of payload mass and centroid allowed feedforward dynamic compensation to overcome the disturbances produced by unmodeled payload dynamics. The combination of high sample rates, constant PD gains, and adaptive feedforward dynamic compensation produces a control algorithm with excellent payload independent, peak, and final error. >		Michael B.

New applications, however, often require physical contact between the robot and its environment, and then the position control accuracy is generally not sufficient. Force control is a suitable alternative. The environment is often stiff, and then it is crucial to design appropriate force controllers, which is non-trivial for a robot programmer. This paper presents an adaptive algorithm for choosing force control parameters, based on identification of a contact model. The algorithm is experimentally verified in an assembly task with an industrial robot.	adaptive algorithm;characteristic impedance;control flow;experiment;industrial robot;memory controller;programmer;recursive least squares filter;self-tuning	Andreas Stolt;Magnus Linderoth;Anders Robertsson;Rolf Johansson	2012		10.3182/20120905-3-HR-2030.00033	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;robot control	Robotics	68.01658114271515	-18.135630402596373	125225

Due to the extreme complexity of the vehicle dynamics, only the longitudinal model is adopted and rewritten as a feedback form for the backstepping design. Then, a new tracking differentiator (TD) is designed based on hyperbolic sine function to solve the problem of “explosion of term” in the traditional backstepping control. Furthermore, to enhance the controller׳s robustness, a new nonlinear disturbance observer is constructed using the proposed TD to estimate the model uncertainties and varying disturbances. More specially, owing to the measurement difficulties of angle of attack and flight-path angle in practice, the developed TD is utilized to reconstruct them based on the measurable states.

This controller can yield asymptotic stability of the helicopter in horizontal motion control, which can be proven by the linear stability analysis. And this controller can flawlessly engage with traditional dual loop autopilot by using auto-varying references in an inner stabilizing loop. Moreover, to facilitate the controller design, this paper derives the dynamics of hingeless helicopters with an emphasis on gyroscopic effect. Finally, the stability and superior performance of the proposed controller are empirically demonstrated on an instrumented JR Voyager GSR helicopter.	asymptote;autopilot;control theory;dual loop;experiment;ncr voyager;pid;phase margin;vii	Tak-Kit Lau;Yunhui Liu;Kai-wun Lin	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354278	pid controller;robust control;remotely operated underwater vehicle;control engineering;motion control;von neumann stability analysis;simulation;gyroscope;spinning;engineering;control theory;azimuth	Robotics	64.50801148205927	-16.380117564634922	125736
251a66a745ecbd0b45f4f34cb3938062a21d6420	comfort in cars - estimating equivalent temperature for comfort driven heating, ventilation and air conditioning (hvac) control		Equivalent Temperature is generally considered an accurate predictor for thermal comfort in car cabins. However, direct measurement of this parameter is impractical in fielded applications. The paper presents an empirical, multiple linear regression based approach for estimating body segment equivalent temperatures for car cabin occupants from different sensors within the car. Body part equivalent temperature at eight segments and cabin sensor data (air temperature, surface temperature, mean radiant temperature, humidity and solar load) was gathered in a variety of environmental and cabin conditions. 38 experimental hours of trials in a controlled environment and 26 experimental hours of realistic driving trials were used for training and evaluating the estimator’s performance. The estimation errors were on average between 0.5 °C and 1.9 °C for different body parts for trials within a controlled environment, while for trials in realistic driving scenarios they ranged between 1 °C and 2 °C. This demonstrates that passenger body part equivalent temperature can be estimated using a multiple linear regression from environmental sensors and leads the way to comfort driven Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning control.	automation;computer performance;cross-validation (statistics);informatics;jaguar;kerrison predictor;mira;newton's method;radiant ai;robotics;rover (the prisoner);sensor	Diana Hintea;James Brusey;Elena I.

We begin by deriving the gradient of the recursive Newton-Euler dynamics formulation with respect to the parameters of a curve defining the motion, where the kinematics are expressed via the product of matrix exponentials. We then use this gradient to solve joint torque minimization problems for spatial open chains. The advantage of our approach is that the gradients are computed for each local frame recursively, therefore sharing the same efficiency advantages as the original recursive algorithm, and also can be computed for any spatial open chain. The optimization approach is applied to several open chains where minimum effort paths are found.		Bryan J. Martin;James E.

It is often the case that some desired motions cannot be achieved by the robot due to limitations in actuation power. We suggest a simple solution to the problem: complement the actuators by some configuration of mechanical springs which delivers a torque profile that is well-tuned for the desired robot motion. As a result, the control effort for the original actuator will be reduced. In this case study we consider an underactuated planar two-link robot for experimental demonstration of the concept. The virtual holonomic constraints approach serves as analytical tool to parameterize, plan, and stabilize desired periodic motions.	reduction (complexity);robot;robotics;underactuation	Uwe Mettin;Pedro X.

The NSB is a behavior-based robot control approach that uses a hierarchical organization of the tasks to guarantee that they are executed according to a desired priority: it uses a projection technique to avoid that, in the absence of actuator saturations, low-priority tasks could influence higher-priority tasks. The main contribution of this paper is the extension of the NSB approach to the case where actuator velocity saturation bounds are explicitly taken into account. The proposed solution dynamically scales task velocity commands so that the hierarchy of task priorities is preserved in spite of actuator velocity saturations. The approach has been validated on two specific case studies. In the first case, the NSB elaborates the motion directives for a single mobile robot that has to reach a target while avoiding a point obstacle1 in this case, the mission is composed of two tasks. In the second case, the NSB elaborates the motion directives for a team of six mobile robots that has orates the motion directives for a team of six mobile robots that has to entrap and escort a target1 in this case the mission is composed of four tasks. The approach is validated by numerical simulations and by experiments with real mobile robots.	kernel (linear algebra);robot	Filippo Arrichiello;Stefano Chiaverini;Giovanni Indiveri;Paola Pedone	2010	I.

3c937f59ea9db567d3519821a3fdfcdb5ac7ca83	disturbance-compensated intercept guidance using line-of-sight rate information		Proportional navigation (PN) is a well-known guidance law for a two-vehicle engagement. In the two-vehicle engagement, the miss distance (the closest distance between the two vehicles) is desired to be zero that can be achieved by annulling the line-of-sight (LOS) rate. The PN guidance law requires information of the LOS rate and, if it is available, the closing velocity (the relative approaching speed to the target). The PN guidance system may degrade the system performance due to target maneuvers. Such target maneuvers should be compensated with a guidance system. However, it is difficult to obtain accurate target information due to the target's unpredictable maneuvers, velocity changes, and so on. This paper proposes a novel guidance law based on the PN guidance law using only LOS rate information. The proposed guidance is referred to as uncertainty and disturbance-compensated intercept guidance. Potential of the proposed guidance law is demonstrated with some representative simulations. Robust performance of the proposed guidance system for a time-lag system is also shown with simulation results.	closing (morphology);dynamical system;guidance system;line-of-sight (missile);simulation;system dynamics;velocity (software development);visual intercept	S.

6d493b8a50446c4d92ef61c5a99ce3d5ef3951bd	a hybrid chaos-pso algorithm for dimensional synthesis of a redundant manipulator based on tracking trajectories without or with singularities		The paper presents a novel hybrid CHAOS-PSO algorithm for dimensional syntheses of redundant manipulators while not following common design principles of arm length or arm length ratio of a human in previous literatures. More specifically, we employ the clamping weighted least-norm (CWLN) method to solve inverse kinematics of the redundant manipulator tracking desired nonsingular or singular trajectories considering joint limits. Thus, an optimal solution of flexible D-H parameters of manipulator is explored in the search space based on evaluations by the defined fitness functions with the proposed algorithm. As an optimization tool in this work, the hybrid CHAOS-PSO algorithm incorporates chaos into the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm as population initialization and global perturbation technique in order to enhance swarm diversity and escape from premature convergence. To demonstrate validity and practicability of the proposed algorithm compared to PSO, simulations of dimensional syntheses of a 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) redundant manipulator with complex structures along the planed nonsingular or singular trajectories are performed.	algorithm;arm span;chaos;fitness function;inverse kinematics;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;premature convergence;simulation	Jun Wan;Li Ding;Jiafeng Yao;Hongtao Wu	2018	Production Engineering	10.1007/s11740-018-0837-9	swarm behaviour;clamping;manufacturing engineering;initialization;engineering;invertible matrix;inverse kinematics;algorithm;premature convergence;particle swarm optimization;population	Robotics	60.10438155101646	-13.939221322429223	126241

53d6b6b6924954ad2bd201aa3ea0cb7e6136426f	a smooth traction control design for two-wheeled electric vehicles		Over the recent years many solutions to the problems of anti-locking and traction control have been widely investigated for four-wheeled vehicle equipped with both electric and internal combustion engines. Few works are relative to TCS (Traction Control System) for two-wheeled vehicle and most of them take advantage of well established nonlinear techniques. This paper proposes a traction controller for two-wheeled electric vehicle based on nonlinear model predictive approach. The controller objective is to prevent the traction wheel from spinning out when accelerating in order to maintain the driving performance as well as driving comfort. A proper evaluation of the interaction between the rider command and the controller action is made in order that the controller take over the rider’s input as soon as longitudinal slip condition is detected. In controlled state the optimal driving torque that guarantees optimal traction is computed based on a model predictive approach taking into account the nonlinearities of the system conveyed by the friction forces. The controller has been tested in simulation environment.	control system;invariant (computer science);lateral computing;lateral thinking;lock (computer science);nonlinear system;simulation;traction teampage	Andrea Bonci;Riccardo De Amicis;Sauro Longhi;Emanuele Lorenzoni	2018	2018 14th IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications (MESA)	10.1109/MESA.2018.8449199	control theory;torque;electric vehicle;nonlinear system;traction (orthopedics);control engineering;slip (materials science);computer science;traction control system	Robotics	67.41470933832234	-13.419295465798767	126620

Dynamic grasp condition is obtained for the instances that the manipulators carry the object on their palms. Manipulation problem is modeled as a nonlinear optimal control problem. In this optimal control problem, time of free flight is used as a free parameter to determine throw and catch times. Cost function is selected to get maximum covered horizontal distance using minimum energy. By selecting third-order polynomials for joint motions, the problem is changed to a constrained parameter selection problem. Adaptive particle swarm optimization method is consequently employed to solve the optimization problem. Effectiveness of the optimization algorithm is verified by a set of simulations in MSC.

To solve the problem, we employ the so-called geometric phase approach based on the fact that tracing a closed path in the space of input variables results in a non-closed path in the space of output variables. To set up the governing equations, the contact kinematic equations are modified by the condition of dynamic realizability, which constrains the component of the angular velocity of the rolling carrier and depends on the mass distribution, and parameterized. By using a motion planning strategy based on tracing two circles on the spherical surface, an exact and dynamically realizable motion planning algorithm is fabricated and verified under simulation.	algorithm;angularjs;automated planning and scheduling;geometric phase;kinematic chain;mathematical model;motion planning;robot;simulation;velocity (software development)	Mikhail M.

A terminal sliding mode controller for attitude angular loop is introduced to obtain the virtual control input. Thus, the required deflection angle of aerodynamic surfaces can be calculated via dynamic surface technique in inner angular rate loop. When the aero-surfaces are saturated and unable to supply the moment vector commanded by the fault tolerant controller, a reaction control system will be driven by quadratic programming allocator to provide the residual control torque. The system stability is analyzed utilizing the Lyapunov function. Several simulation results validate that the system output can track the desired command even under fault situations.	algorithm;angularjs;control system;fault tolerance;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;quadratic programming;simulation;windows aero	Ang Wang;Fuyang Chen;Huajun Gong	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2809515	control theory;deflection (engineering);reaction control system;actuator;computer science;torque;attitude control;fault tolerance;distributed computing;control theory;terminal sliding mode	Robotics	64.92197558849962	-14.400907602242226	127287

To study the effect of mechanical design in the rolling motion, a simple bounding-in-place (BIP) template is introduced as a candidate frontal plane model that captures the targeted steady-state behavior of a straight-ahead level ground running quadruped robot. This model is parametrically analyzed and local stability analysis shows that the dynamics of the open loop passive system alone can confer stability of the motion! These results might explain the success of simple, open loop running controllers on existing experimental robots and can be further used in developing control methodologies for legged robots that take advantage of the mechanical system.	bip-8;emoticon;in-place algorithm;linear programming;robot;self-stabilization;steady state	Panagiotis Chatzakos;Evangelos Papadopoulos	2009	2009 International Conference on Advanced Robotics		control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.4053206929499	-19.537722050714006	127392

eaaef337c15137fa24728fc6cfae2b0d4be3167b	cloud-based active disturbance rejection control for industrial robots		The classical design of industrial robot controllers relies strongly on constant and stable cycle times for any closed loop operation. Meanwhile, decentralizing robot control into independent services and rolling them out to virtual machines and cloud instances is an upcoming trend. The advantage of the distributed robot control lies in achieving full flexibility of location independent service execution. In contrast, the internet connectivity leads to unknown latency conditions and resulting unpredictable cycle times. That is not well handled by standard feedback controllers like PID or P-PI cascades. In addition to the time-critical aspect, the performance of a closed -loop control relies on the accuracy of the underlying model. Modeling is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents four different implementations of a non-model based modified Switching Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) in a robotic use case. The comparison of these four concepts reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the ADRC approach regarding controller performance under the assumption of full dynamics compensation with tough communication conditions. By extending the Switching-ADRC approach by a gain-scheduler to smooth the switching between the linear and non-linear ADRC description and a static adjustment of control-parameters related to the measured round-trip time, the presented control-concept is able to stabilize the high-dynamic, partly unstable robot-system without model-information. The stability of the modified Switching-ADRC is demonstrated empirically by extensive experiments with a distributed industrial robot joint position control.	apache axis;closed-loop transfer function;control theory;distributed control system;experiment;industrial robot;internet access;nonlinear system;pid;rejection sampling;robot control;scheduling (computing);virtual machine;window of opportunity	Emma T Bode;Axel Vick;Jörg Krüger	2018	2018 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2018.8502580		Robotics	58.70781721535968	-18.13273161969682	128015

This paper proposes an algorithm for driver behavior characterization based on handling limits. In order to implement the handling limit-based algorithm, an interacting multiple model estimation technique is applied, which accounts for probabilistic correctness of the multiple models.

When such limits are not explicitly considered, manipulators performances rapidly decrease. In this paper, dynamic saturations are handled by means of a real-time technique based on a trajectory scaling method: whenever saturations occur, trajectories are automatically scaled by means of a dynamic filter in order to preserve an accurate path tracking. Commonly known scaling algorithms only consider the existence of torque saturations. In this paper, the strategy is enriched by also accounting for torque derivatives constraints. The solution proposed is suited to be used in conjunction with standard inverse dynamics controllers. The adopted methodology explicitly requires the realtime evaluation of the derivative of the manipulator inertia matrix. To this purpose, a novel efficient procedure is proposed.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;image scaling;inverse dynamics;performance;real-time clock;real-time computing;robot	Corrado Guarino Lo Bianco;Oscar Gerelli	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354822	control engineering;mathematical optimization;dynamics;trajectory;control theory;inverse dynamics;physics	Robotics	65.28880747003797	-19.915276788997108	128083

In this paper, we show how input-output linearization of a cart can be leveraged for a novel and practical application, closed-loop control of a differential-drive sheet registration device. The current state of the art for control for such a device, typically found in xerographic engines like printers and copiers, is open-loop motion planning. We present a closed-loop method that achieves full-state trajectory tracking via input-output linearization and asymptotically stable internal dynamics. To achieve rapid convergence while satisfying acceleration constraints, we apply elementary gain scheduling to the output tracking controller of the linearized input-output system. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the discrete-time implementation of our control strategy, which is based on a kinematic model with acceleration as the control input.	control theory;encoder;mobile robot;motion planning;photocopier;scheduling (computing);underactuation;velocity (software development);wheels	Jack G.

The locomotion mechanism of eQuad is a novel eccentric paddle mechanism (ePaddle) that can perform wheeled, legged and paddling actions in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. We first introduce five terrestrial and aquatic gaits. A duty factor of up to 1.0 can be achieved for the legged walking. Therefore, the proposed robot eQuad can walk with a unique gait by eliminating the swing phase of the legs, and it has a large stable margin because all its legs are in contact with ground during walking. Kinematic models of this robot suggest that with this unique gait the reconfigurable ePaddle mechanism has the potential to achieve both legged and wheeled locomotion with the aid of a simple controller. A decoupled controller adapted from the wheeled robot is then built to evaluate this idea. Finally, simulations are performed to verify our proposed decoupled control and gait sequence planning methods.	aquatic ecosystem;computer simulation;duty cycle;experiment;poor posture;prototype;robot;terrestrial television	Yi Sun;Shugen Ma	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979886	control engineering;simulation;gait analysis;computer science;artificial intelligence;trajectory;robot locomotion;control theory;motion planning;robot control;robot kinematics	Robotics	67.54980699790791	-23.210356158577092	128590

By bringing the system dynamics into diagonal form, one obtains SISO systems for which independent feedback strategies can be implemented. Furthermore, there exist control laws that utilize the available control inputs up to their limits, e.g. optimization-based controllers. While these limits can be applied easily in original space, a still open question is which bounds are feasible in modal space, as one property of the (linear) decoupling transformation is that the actuator constraints become coupled. In this paper, we address the problem of finding the largest possible input limits in modal space that allow independent SISO control and meet the real actuator saturations at the same time. We identify how the controller structure influences the search for the modal constraints and find the limits via optimization. The methods are developed for the general n-DOF case and applied to 2-, 3-, and 7-DOF examples in simulation.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;constrained optimization;control theory;coupling (computer programming);existential quantification;loss function;mathematical optimization;maximal set;modal logic;nonlinear system;real-time clock;real-time computing;robot;simulation interoperability standards organization;soft-in soft-out decoder;system dynamics;time-invariant system	Nico Mansfeld;Christian Ott;Sami Haddadin	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526730	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.7457601683464	-16.095718201860766	128669

The dynamics of the robot manipulator are derived with the assumption that all matrices in this robot model are unknown. Since these matrices are time varying and their variation bounds are not given, traditional adaptive or robust control schemes cannot be applied. The function approximation technique is employed here to represent uncertainties in some finite linear combinations of the orthogonal basis. Using the Lyapunov stability theory, a set of update law is derived to give closed loop stability with proper tracking performance. A two-link flexible-joint robot is used in the computer simulation to verify validity and effectiveness of the proposed control law.	approximation;computer simulation;control theory;converge;experiment;lyapunov fractal;optimal control;robot;robust control;stepping level	Yin-Chieh Chang;Jinsiang Shaw	2011	2011 First International Conference on Robot, Vision and Signal Processing	10.1109/RVSP.2011.10	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.96623408747539	-10.882777180462998	128839

Despite its popularity, an analytic formulation of this method has yet been provided. In this work, using an instantaneous stance phase assumption, we present the increase in robustness of the swing method. This analysis provides a way to isolate the optimal parameters of the SLR.

The cost functional to be minimized is the integral over time of a non-negative power of the particle's speed. Special cases of such a cost functional include travel time and path length. Unlike previous work on related problems, variations in the magnitude of the velocity vector are allowed. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to show that the optimal paths possess a special property whereby the vector that divides the velocity and acceleration vectors in a specific ratio, which depends on the cost functional, is a constant. This property is used to characterize the optimal acceleration vector and obtain the parametric equations of the corresponding optimal paths. Sufficiency conditions for optimality are used to show that trajectories satisfying the necessary conditions are actually optimal if the heading change required is sufficiently small. Solutions of the time-optimal and the length-optimal problems are obtained as special cases of the general problem.	course (navigation);mathematical optimization;pontryagin's maximum principle;velocity (software development)	Sanjay P.

Nonlinear programming method is used to optimize the energy saving speed trajectory of the following train. The real-time location of the leading train could be integrated into the optimization process. Due to simplicity, it can be used for online implementation. Finally, a smoothing algorithm is proposed to improve the speed trajectory for ride comfort. The feasibility and effectiveness are verified through simulation.

1ce02dc87c6c64b680f995fb8fc0393403b5284b	backstepping-based sliding mode control of an electro-pneumatic clutch actuator		In this paper, a nonlinear control approach is presented for an electro-pneumatic clutch actuator for heavy trucks. A clutch is required at start-up or during gear shifts to disconnect the combustion engine from the gear box. This automated actuator provides the necessary actuation force according to the large torque transmitted through the power train. Based on a control-oriented system representation, a cascaded control structure is designed. The outer loop is related to the mechanical subsystem and guarantees an accurate tracking of desired trajectories for the clutch position using a backstepping-based sliding mode control. Furthermore, hysteresis effects of the nonlinear clutch force are addressed properly by a Bouc-Wen hysteresis model. The inner loop controls the internal pressure of the clutch actuator. A new nonlinear reduced-order observer is designed that estimates both the effective internal pressure and a mass flow offset. The benefits of the proposed control structure are demonstrated by experimental results from a dedicated test rig.	control flow;experiment;hysteresis;inner loop;mechatronics;multiple encryption;nonlinear system;steady state;system dynamics	Robert Prabel;Harald Aschemann	2017	2017 22nd International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2017.8046862	control engineering;sliding mode control;computer science;backstepping;control theory;torque converter;actuator;torque;nonlinear control;clutch;transmission (mechanics)	Robotics	67.57934814517104	-13.750632684477452	130246

The transient response of motor under starting, speed reversal, as well as during load disturbance conditions has been considered. The aim is to minimize maximum overshoot, rise time, settling time, peak time and integral absolute control error of the PMSM shaft speed, with the aid of a PID speed controller, so as to achieve fast and efficient transient speed response. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique has been employed for determining the gain coefficients (proportional, integral and derivative) of the PID speed controller. The results demonstrate that with the use of ACO technique improved dynamic performance of PMSM drive can be achieved in comparison to the classical Ziegler-Nichols method of PID tuning under different operating conditions.

bf829b974f56cacf91eee9c436de03a2215d9c3e	neighboring degree-of-approximation equating method for computing contact points between robot and convex object		With a proper combination of compliant joint and position-controlled joint, a link system chatiges its posture with keeping contact between link system and environment. This is so-called Self-Posture Changing Motion (SPCM) and conveniently used to detect a contact point between robot and an unknown object. In conventional approach, a contact point has been computed as an intersecting point between two different link postures before and after SPCM. In general, this computation scheme gives us a contact point with unsatisfactory approximation, while it furnishes us with an exact contact point for a sharp-edged object. In this paper, we first introduce a concept of degree-of-approximation, which is defined as the distance between a computed point and the nearest point over the object surface, and then propose the Neighboring Degree-Of-Approximation Equating Method which improves the degree-of-approximation drastically and provides exact contact points not only for a sharp-edged object but also for a constant curved object. Mathematical framework is provided for the proposed computation scheme. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulations.	approximation;robot	Makoto Kaneko;Kazuo Tanie	1993	JRM	10.20965/jrm.1993.p0019	computer vision;mathematical optimization;mathematics;geometry	Robotics	66.85216330978483	-21.902570754009805	130506

It proposes to find the Pareto optimal set, rather than a single solution usually obtained through scalarization, e.g., weighting the objective functions. Using the trajectory planning problem for a redundant manipulator as part of a captive trajectory simulation system, the general discrete dynamic programming (DDP) approximation method presented in our previous work is shown to be a promising approach to obtain a close representation of the Pareto optimal set. When compared with the set obtained by varying the weights, the results confirm that the DDP approximation method can find approximate Pareto objective vectors, where the weighting method fails, and can generally provide a closer representation of the actual Pareto optimal set.	approximation algorithm;bellman equation;captive portal;carpal tunnel syndrome;cluster analysis;computation;curse of dimensionality;data-directed programming;differential dynamic programming;elegant degradation;hausdorff dimension;motion planning;newton's method;pareto efficiency;polynomial;robot;simulation;time complexity	A.

The maneuvers are defined dynamically by using a predefined set of 3D basic maneuvers. This formation changing is necessary when the squadron has to perform tasks which demand both formations, such as lift off, georeferencing, obstacle avoidance and landing. Simulations show that the formation changing is made without collision. The time complexity analysis of the transformation algorithm reveals that its efficiency is optimal, and the proof of correction ensures its longitudinal formation features.

9cf991fa8bcfc2792da120bde924facb174b8697	a robust walking controller based on online step location and duration optimization for bipedal locomotion		Step adjustment for humanoid robots has been shown to improve gait robustness, while timing adjustment is often neglected in control strategies. In this paper, a new walking controller is proposed that combines both step location and timing adjustment for generating robust gaits. In this approach, step location and timing are decided, based on the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) measurement. We define the ”DCM offset” as the offset between the DCM and landing location of the swing foot at landing time, and employ it to split state space into viable/non-viable parts. Constructing our walking controller based on the DCM offset, we can exploit the whole capability of a biped robot in terms of stepping to recover from disturbances. The proposed approach is comprised of two stages. In the first stage, the nominal step location and step duration for the next step(s) are decided. In this stage, the main goal is to schedule the gait variables far from constraint boundaries for a desired walking velocity. The second stage adapts at each control cycle the landing position and time of the swing foot. By using the DCM offset and a change of variable for the step timing, we can formulate the second stage of our controller as a small sized quadratic program without the need to preview several steps ahead. The swing foot trajectory is also re-planned at each control cycle to realize adapted landing properties. To map the adapted gait variables to the full robot, a hierarchical inverse dynamics is employed. Interestingly, our approach does not require precise control of the center of pressure and can also be used on robots with passive ankles or point feet. Simulation experiments show a significant improvement in robustness to various types of external disturbances, such as pushes and slippage, compared to state of the art preview controllers where step timing is not adjusted. In particular, we demonstrate robust walking behavior for a simulated robot with passive ankles.	dicom;experiment;humanoid robot;inverse dynamics;mathematical optimization;quadratic programming;robustness (computer science);simulation;state space;stepping level;velocity (software development)	Majid Khadiv;Alexander Herzog;S.

The problem of stabilizing the vehicle at desired position and orientation is seen as an extension of the tracking problem. A saturated control is proposed which achieves quick steering of the system near the desired position of the parking spot with desired orientation and can be successfully used in solving parking problems. In addition, in order to obtain larger area of the starting positions of the vehicle with respect to the parking spot for the first reverse maneuver of the parallel parking, an approach of using saturated control with two different levels of saturation is proposed. The vehicle can be automatically parked by using one or multiple maneuvers, depending on the size of the parking spot. Simulation results are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.	algorithm;automatic parking;feedback;intelligent parking assist system;simulation	Plamen Petrov;Fawzi Nashashibi	2014	2014 13th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)	10.1109/ICARCV.2014.7064368	axle;control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;automotive engineering;robot kinematics	Robotics	62.72666090296684	-18.152632942811824	130965

Taking inspiration from such studies, a hybrid impulse-position (HIP) controller has been developed for legged locomotion over uneven terrain. The HIP controller generates joint torques during the stance phase of each leg cycle to propel and stabilize the body, and is meant to operate with CPG-based coordination strategies and ground search routines to generate robust walking, running, jumping and climbing. Joint torques are computed without extracting information about the ground and using only local feedback. No feedback of body state is needed to regulate body motion, which is preferred because inertial sensors are rife with issues. The algorithm is applied to a hexapod system in simulation, and an experimental system is being built to further investigate the approach. The HIP controller has potential for expansion to bipeds, quadrupeds and other biologically-inspired forms.	algorithm;central pattern generator;experimental system;mobile robot;propel;rife;sensor;simulation	Luther R.

11cee5aea2102405ab9dec13f5f67890ab2675be	fast kinodynamic bipedal locomotion planning with moving obstacles		In this paper, we present a sampling-based kino-dynamic planning framework for a bipedal robot in complex environments. Unlike other footstep planning algorithms which typically plan footstep locations and the biped dynamics in separate steps, we handle both simultaneously. Three primary advantages of this approach are (1) the ability to differentiate alternate routes while selecting footstep locations based on the temporal duration of the route as determined by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) dynamics, (2) the ability to perform collision checking through time so that collisions with moving obstacles are prevented without avoiding their entire trajectory, and (3) the ability to specify a minimum forward velocity for the biped. To generate a dynamically consistent description of the walking behavior, we exploit the Phase Space Planner (PSP) [1] [2]. To plan a collision-free route toward the goal, we adapt planning strategies from non-holonomic wheeled robots to gather a sequence of inputs for the PSP. This allows us to efficiently approximate dynamic and kinematic constraints on bipedal motion, to apply a sampling-based planning algorithm such as RRT or RRT*, and to use the Dubin's path [3] as the steering method to connect two points in the configuration space. The results of the algorithm are sent to a Whole Body Controller [1] to generate full body dynamic walking behavior. Our planning algorithm is tested in a 3D physics-based simulation of the humanoid robot Valkyrie.

Frogs are the efficient and stable organisms which use jumping as their primary means of locomotion. For any legged robot to take a perfect jump, taking off perfectly is one of the most important aspects. So, the trajectory of the center of gravity (CG) of the robot is of the utmost importance. For this, the motion and coordination of the legs should be very precise for which, we have to carry out the forward and inverse kinematics of the robot. In this paper, we used Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Parameters to carry out the forward kinematics.

We leverage techniques from differential geometry and Lie algebra to formulate a cost functional which is intrinsic to the geometric structure of this space and makes physical sense. We propose an approximation technique to generate trajectories on the subgroup SO(3) and use Semidefinite Programming (SDP) to approximate an NP-Hard problem with one which is tractable to compute. From this trajectory on the subgroup, the trajectory generation on the other dimensions of the group becomes a Quadratic Program (QP). For obstacle avoidance, we use a computational geometric technique to decompose the environment into overlapping convex regions to confine the trajectory. We show how this motion planning technique can be used to generate feasible trajectories for a space robot in SE(3) and describe controllers that enable the execution of the generated trajectory. We compare our method to other geometric techniques for calculating trajectories on SO(3) and SE(3), but in an obstacle-free environment.	approximation algorithm;cobham's thesis;mathematical optimization;motion planning;np-hardness;obstacle avoidance;quadratic programming;robot;semidefinite programming	Michael Watterson;Trey Smith;Vijay Kumar	2016	2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	10.1109/IROS.2016.7759803	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;manifold;computer science;artificial intelligence;trajectory;mathematics;geometry;robot kinematics;measurement	Robotics	61.79621379535062	-20.93203730924002	131316

As an interesting topic in the robot motion planning and control, the kinematic singularity problem also attracted much attention in the literatures. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to plan an optimal trajectory passing though kinematic singularities with the end-effector precisely tracking the desired path. The method follows two steps. In the first step, the desired path is parameterized with a geometric variable q 0 . The robot motion can then be represented as a spatial curve in the joint space augmented by q 0 . The spatial curve, called augmented path, is obtained by numeric method as a function of another parameter s, which represents the arc-length of the augmented path. In the second step, the optimal trajectory with respect to time can be solved by optimally assigning s(t) along the augmented path. Dynamic programming is adopted in this paper to fulfill the optimal computation. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the presented approach	coat of arms;motion planning	Guangyu Lian;Zengqi Sun;Chundi Mu	2006		10.1109/IROS.2006.282008	control engineering;constrained optimization;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;motion planning	Robotics	62.862644727744474	-20.928949812669675	131755

The predictor improves these measurements counteracting the delay. The algorithm is validated in realtime using gyroscopes and accelerometers of a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). These results are compared with the measurements coming from a commercial IMU with good precision and the results show that the proposed scheme improves substantially the angular measurements.	aerial photography;algorithm;angularjs;computation;control system;control theory;database schema;experiment;kalman filter;kerrison predictor;real-time clock;sensor;simulation	Ricardo Sanz;Pedro García;Pedro Castillo;Pedro Albertos	2014	17th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)		control engineering;inertial measurement unit;inertial reference unit;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	63.862423069660856	-14.31934183707194	132395

Several motor learning strategies from the literature are adopted to kinematic problems: “feedback-error learning”, “distal supervised learning”, and “direct inverse modeling”. One of these learning strategies, direct inverse modeling, is significantly enhanced by combining it with abstract recurrent neural networks. Moreover, a newly developed learning strategy (“learning by averaging”) is presented in detail. The performance of these learning strategies is compared on different learning tasks on two simulated robot setups (a robot-camera-head and a planar arm). The results indicate a general superiority of direct inverse modeling if combined with abstract recurrent neural networks. Learning by averaging is especially successful if the motor task is constrained by special requirements.	artificial neural network;recurrent neural network;requirement;supervised learning	Wolfram Schenck	2011	Connect.

1e82ea4f4c7439916494c5cc0bac274dcce6f78f	an efficient multiobjective design optimization method for a pmslm based on an extreme learning machine		This paper focuses on the multiobjective design optimization of the permanent magnet synchronous linear motors (PMSLMs), which are applied to a high-precision laser engraving machine. A novel efficient multiobjective design optimization method for a PMSLM is proposed to achieve optimal performances as indicated by high average thrust, low thrust ripple, and low total harmonic distortion at different running speeds. First, based on the finite-element analysis (FEA) data, a regression machine learning algorithm, called an extreme learning machine (ELM), is introduced to solve the calculation modeling problem by mapping out the nonlinear and complex relationship between input structural factors and output motor performances. Comparative simulation experiments conducted using the traditional analytical modeling method and another machine learning modeling method, i.e., support vector machine, confirm the superiority of the ELM. Then, a new bionic intelligent optimization algorithm, called the gray wolf optimizer algorithm, is used to search the best optimization performances and structural parameters by performing iteration optimization calculation for multiobjective functions. Finally, FEA and prototype motor experiments prove the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method.	algorithm;experiment;federal enterprise architecture;finite element method;iteration;machine learning;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;performance;prototype;ripple effect;simulation;support vector machine;thrust;total harmonic distortion	Juncai Song;Fei Dong;Jiwen Zhao;Zhongyan He;Lijun Wang	2019	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2018.2835413	support vector machine;control engineering;total harmonic distortion;thrust;engineering;ripple;linear motor;finite element method;extreme learning machine;nonlinear system	EDA	59.740243729254814	-12.119365585762592	132809

This robot is able to pass through a narrow space because it can extend and shrink the size between the wheels by changing the configuration of the legs. In this study, obstacle avoidance is achieved by two passage width constraints. Obstacle size and wheel positions are considered in those constraints. A distance between the robot and an obstacle is kept larger than a value specified by those constraints. Comparing with conventional artificial potential methods, the proposed method does not require tuning of obstacle parameters. We utilize two kinds of linear constraints. In the first constraint, we use the internal common tangent between the robot and the obstacle nearest to the robot. In the other constraint, we use the external common tangent to reduce getting stuck into the narrow space between obstacles. The optimal tracking control is realized using those constraints for the model predictive control. The efficacy of this method is verified via the numerical simulations.	computer simulation;numerical analysis;obstacle avoidance;robot;scara;wheels	Naito Suzuki;Kenichiro Nonaka;Kazuma Sekiguchi	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2015.7320650	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;robot control	Robotics	67.0491003299474	-20.678127104441916	132864

The main idea of this approach is the use of an ANN to learn the robot system characteristics rather than having to specify an explicit robot system model. Despite the fact that this is very difficult in practice, training data were recorded experimentally from sensors fixed on each joint for a six Degrees of Freedom (DOF) industrial robot. The network was designed to have one hidden layer, where the input were the Cartesian positions along the X, Y and Z coordinates, the orientation according to the RPY representation and the linear velocity of the end-effector while the output were the angular position and velocities for each joint, In a free-of-obstacles workspace, off-line smooth geometric paths in the joint space of the manipulator are obtained. The resulting network was tested for a new set of data that has never been introduced to the network before these data were recorded in the singular configurations, in order to show the generality and efficiency of the proposed approach, and then testing results were verified experimentally.	artificial neural network;jacobian matrix and determinant;serial manipulator	Ali T.

24c0b94d05f54b5af006699be88113ca0be82a06	a synchronization scheme for position control of multiple rope-climbing robots		The ability of rope-climbing robots in aloft operation is limited by its self-supporting and locomotion ability. In many applications, a given task is also too complex to be achieved by a single rope-climbing robot acting alone. The solution of multiple rope-climbing robots can overcome the limitations. However, existing control methods for rope-climbing robots are limited to single robot, and the open issue of coordination between multiple rope-climbing robots has not been systematically addressed. This paper presents a new synchronization scheme for position control of multiple rope-climbing robots, such that each robot moves to the corresponding desired position while synchronizing the heights between each other. Maintaining the same height is very important to guarantee the stability of the task-oriented manipulator installed among multiple robots, when it is performing the manipulation task. The development of the proposed controller is based on the singular perturbation approach, by treating the fast actuator dynamics as a perturbation of the slow robot dynamics, such that the lowest control complexity is achieved. The exponential stability of the overall system that consists of the fast and slow subsystems is proved by using Tikhonov’ s theorem. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.	hill climbing;robot locomotion;setpoint (control system);time complexity	Guangli Sun;Xiang Li;Peng Li;Yu Meng;Yang Zhou;Enzhi Xu;Yunhui Liu	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460484	control theory;task analysis;synchronization;control theory;control engineering;robot;actuator;engineering;exponential stability;robot kinematics;rope	Robotics	66.14193755703174	-21.141886766530945	133826

6f779ca303afcfa0dda18db1c7bf492113cc8048	trajectory folding-based path planning for automated parking system		In this paper, we propose a completely new path planning algorithm for automatic parking considering both physical constraints of a vehicle motion and computational complexity. The proposed algorithm provides a path for parking, whose curvature satisfies the clothoid constraint, so that the vehicle can smoothly follow the path. In the path planning, we introduce an innovative trajectory folding scheme which does not require a high-computational cost. Trajectory folding scheme can be used to create a general vehicle control path for longitudinal and lateral movement in desired parking slots. The folding scheme has an advantage that it can make a path satisfying the physical constraint of the vehicle while considering the surrounding obstacles. Finally, we introduce a completely automated parking system using the lateral motion control and a simple proportional control for longitudinal motion. The proposed scheme was validated via computational simulation results showing satisfactory performances on the tested scenario.

The control forces are calculated by defining four first-order sliding surfaces as a linear combination of the torso and the four joint tracking errors. The control approach is shown to guarantee that all trajectories will reach and stay on these surfaces during each step, while the walking cycle stability is maintained through a Lyapunov function. The criteria for asymptotic stability of the surfaces are presented and a numerical search method is implemented for the selection of the corresponding surface parameters. The paper further investigates the robustness of the controller in response to disturbances. Numerical simulations demonstrate the tracking stability of the biped’s multistep walk and its human-like response to an external disturbance.	algorithm;first-order predicate;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;robot;robust control;robustness (computer science);self-balancing binary search tree;simulation;system dynamics;trajectory optimization;underactuation	Mehdi Nikkhah;Hashem Ashrafiuon;Farbod Fahimi	2007	Robotica	10.1017/S0263574706003183	robust control;control engineering;von neumann stability analysis;simulation;sliding mode control;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.4399403796256	-17.203096335754147	134184

The utilization of I&I for tracking control is investigated and a tracking theorem is explicitly provided and proved. Based on this theorem, a tracking controller for the nonlinear system is designed. Furthermore, in order to deal with unknown parameters, we state and prove an adaptive tracking theorem. Using this theorem, the designed controller is extended in order to be able to estimate the current friction force. This renders the controller adaptive and enhances its tracking capability. Simulations as well as measurement results show the excellent performance of the adaptive I&I tracking controller.	computer simulation;control flow;flight simulator;immersion (virtual reality);mimo;nonlinear system;optimal control;rendering (computer graphics);state space	Philipp Rapp;Mario Klunder;Oliver Sawodny;Cristina Tarín	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426396	control engineering;simulation;controller;adaptive control;pneumatic actuator;engineering;invariant;friction;control theory;tracking	Robotics	66.5887232912755	-14.828999727689721	134306

Here, we treat the problem of designing motion primitives for cooperative manipulation such that the robots move in formation and are robust with respect to external disturbances. Individual robot trajectories are generated by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) and coupled by a formation control approach enabling the DMP-trajectories to preserve a given formation while performing the manipulation. The proposed control scheme achieves an increased adaptability under external disturbances. The approach is evaluated in a full-scale experiment with two prototypical cooperative manipulation and synchronized motion tasks.	consensus dynamics;experiment;full scale;relevance;robot;robotics	Jonas Umlauft;Dominik Sieber;Sandra Hirche	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2014.6906941	control engineering;engineering	Robotics	66.28273610504363	-22.034897030664773	134365

Instead of explicitly controlling the relative positions between the robots and the environment, we construct a lower-dimensional abstraction of the group that establishes a boundary for the group. We then synthesize feedback controllers that allow the abstracted group to navigate a two-dimensional environment to a desired goal position, while automatically adapting the shape of the boundary as well as the position and orientation of the group to avoid collisions between the virtual boundary and the environment. In contrast to previous approaches, we address the planning and control problems concurrently and are naturally able to establish bounds on the positions of the robots through the abstraction. The complexity of the method is independent of the number of robots which promises scalability to large teams.	automated planning and scheduling;robot;scalability	Nora Ayanian;Vijay Kumar	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509534	control engineering;navigation;simulation;shape;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;automatic control;control theory;motion planning;network topology;statistics	Robotics	58.62301417619615	-22.865177323593706	134372

Such acrobatic movement differs from simple lateral maneuvers or hover, and therefore requires additional considerations in the control strategy. Magnetic force was chosen to enable attachment to the vertical surface due to its simplicity. We show that by learning from previous failed attempts, the robotic fly could successfully perch on a magnetic wall after eight iterations.	aerial photography;attachments;control theory;iteration;lateral computing;lateral thinking;robot	Pakpong Chirarattananon;Kevin Y.

9dd389ec11a66eb52c97d559ad782a557c8bcd4d	distributed coordination of networked robots for perimeter surveillance tasks		Perimeter surveillance is a relevant task which can be performed in a more efficient manner using multiple robots than a single robot. This chapter addresses the perimeter surveillance tasks using a team of heterogeneous robots and assuming limited communications conditions and zones with different priorities. A partitioning strategy, where the whole perimeter is divided in segments and these segments are assigned to the different robots, is proposed. The robots patrol their assigned segments, while keeps at least periodic connectivity between them. The refresh time is used as criterion to optimize each zone surveillance, while an urgency criterion is proposed to allocate dynamically the robots among the zones based on their priorities. Different algorithms and protocols based on the coordination variables and the one-to-one coordination are proposed to coordinate the robots to converge to the desired partitioning strategy in a distributed manner. The presented system is fully decentralized and distributed, robots converge to a cooperative behavior from local decisions. A set of experimental and simulated results are provided to test, analyze and compare the convergence, efficiency, scalability and robustness of the proposed solutions.	algorithm;converge;distributed computing;iteration;memory management;one-to-one (data model);paging;peer-to-peer;perimeter;robot;scalability	Jose Joaquin Acevedo;Begoña C.

e55acc3c1c89d20fb6c56a2663532108ed891ef7	experimental validation of landing-gear dynamics for anti-skid control design		Aircraft control systems are in general difficult to test in their final deployment phases, as flight time has very high costs and entails possible dangerous working conditions. Thus, coming to test flights with control algorithms that have been thoroughly tested beforehand is paramount. As far an anti-skid control is concerned, the industrial practice is to have the anti-skid controller embedded in the landing gear, so that the initial test bench for controller design is a rig comprising all or parts of the landing gear system. In this work, we extend a previously designed dynamic model of the landing gear with the experimental characterization of the hydraulic braking system. Then, a test-rig is setup, which allows testing the contact between wheel and ground with a flywheel. Open-loop experiments to tune the simulator are conducted, and a final validation of the simulation model against experimental data is carried out.	algorithm;control system;controllers;deploy;embedded system;embedding;experiment;mathematical model;preparation;simulation;test bench	L.

This paper is focused on optimal control of the space manipulator in the postcapture phase so as to bring the tumbling non-cooperative satellite to rest in minimum time while ensuring that the magnitude of the interaction torque between the manipulator and target remains below a prescribed value. First, we seek fast detumbling maneuvers of the target satellite subjected to the torque restriction. The theory of optimal control and Pontryagin's principle are applied to obtain a closed-form solution for the optimal path planning problem, giving a great deal of insight: the vector of the interaction torque is aligned opposite to the direction of the instantaneous angular momentum vector. Second, a coordination control for combined system of the space robot and the target satellite, which acts as the manipulator payload, is developed so that the robot tracks the optimal path while regulating the attitude of the chase vehicle to a desired value.

The unique problems that arise due to the positivity of the string tensions required to maintain the static stability and desirable stiffness of the structural system are shown to bring about interesting opportunities to optimize for the redundancy in the actuation process. The static stability consideration, coupled with the nonlinear dynamics and the sensor models introduce additional algebraic constraints in implementation of both kinematic and model based dynamic controllers for tensegrity systems. Approaches to develop kinematic and dynamic control techniques are detailed in this paper. A bench top experimental setup consisting of a simple tensegrity system is utilized to demonstrate the efficacy of the output feedback control approach developed in the paper.

Compared with the previous passivity framework, the communication delays are assumed to be stochastic time varying. By feedback linearization, the nonlinear dynamics of the teleoperation system is transformed into two subsystems: local master/slave position control with unmodeled dynamics and delayed motion synchronization. Then, based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and Markov jump linear systems, adaptive fuzzy-control strategies are developed for the nonlinear teleoperators with modeling uncertainties and external disturbances by using the approximation property of the fuzzy logic systems. It is proven that the master-slave teleoperation system is stochastically stable in mean square under specific LMI conditions, and all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly bounded. Finally, the extensive simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	approximation;formal system;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;linear matrix inequality;linear system;markov chain;master/slave (technology);mean squared error;nonlinear system;simulation	Zhijun Li;Nan Ding;Xiaoqing Cao	2011	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979884	control engineering;mathematical optimization;adaptive control;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;markov process	Robotics	65.28571882882434	-10.317834202364955	135161

The target brachiation is basically divided into two actions: a swing action and a locomotion action. In order to realize the continuous brachiation effectively and stably, it is necessary to control these actions according to the total energy of the system. Because brachiation has been modeled as a pendulum-like motion and the amplitude of the oscillation determines whether the robot can grasp the target bar or not. In consideration of this point, an energy based control method is proposed and introduced into the swing action controller. The purpose of this method is to control the angular velocity of the swing action in order to satisfy the desired energy evaluated by the distance of bars. Experimental results show that the robot can successfully achieve smooth, continuous brachiation.	angularjs;robot;velocity (software development)	Hideki Kajima;Masahiro Doi;Yasuhisa Hasegawa;Toshio Fukuda	2005	Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570679	control engineering;motion control;simulation;network switch;angular velocity;engineering;control system;control theory;oscillation;quantum mechanics;satisfiability	Robotics	66.08915483839634	-22.75975302277939	135222

In motion planning of robots by the MDP, an efficient way to divide robot motion is essential because discrete expressions of states and transitions are used in the calculation. In preparing the discrete expressions of robot motion, it is important that the motion follows the MDP, second, that the time and the amount of memory for the planning calculation are reduced, and that the maneuverability and smoothness of the robot motion are not lost. This paper proposes a new discrete expression of robot motion that can meet these requirements considering the effect of robot dynamics to robot kinematics. The method uses a continuous-time continuous-variable neuron model, which has the stimulation and adaptation properties. The performance of the proposed method was examined by simulation of the motion planning of an under actuated underwater robot and under actuated manipulator with a free joint. The results show the high reliability and flexibility of the method.	artificial neuron;biological neuron model;humanoid robot;inverse kinematics;markov chain;markov decision process;markov property;motion planning;real-time transcription;requirement;robotics;simulation;state space	Hiroshi Kawano	2005	2005 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation	10.1109/CIRA.2005.1554283	motion control;simulation;genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;motion planning;robot control;reinforcement learning;artificial neural network;robot kinematics	Robotics	60.943434680841385	-23.21540389891902	135368

2fd410decf2611692e404e8e78f2d57035840de2	passive-adaptive flight control design for re-entry vehicles	flight control	This paper presents a passive-adaptive design technique intended for the very severe parameter variation problems encountered in lifting re-entry vehicles and in flight control of modern aircraft. The technique is illustrated by means of a detailed application to the pitch axis stability augmentation system of the X-15. The problem is to obtain satisfactory vehicle response to command inputs and gust disturbances, despite the extremely large variations in vehicle parameters, which are encountered when Mach number varies from 6.0 to 0.2, and altitude varies from 160,000 ft to ground level. The given time domain specifications are translated into approximately equivalent frequency response restrictions, enabling the design details to be executed in the frequency domain. This results in the maximum economy in the gain and bandwidth of the system loop transmission. The design is verified by finding the time responses for some of the extreme conditions. The practicality of the design is discussed in terms of the gain and bandwidth demands on the compensating networks, the higher order air frame dynamics, and the effects of any overdesign on the system saturation tendencies.

This model assumes that the hip height is fixed during the walk. In this paper, generating a fast walk is studied with the main focus on the effect of hip height movement. Our approach is based on modeling the hip height movement and learning its parameters in order to generate a fast walk. The hip height trajectory is generated using Fourier basis functions. The generated trajectory is the input to programmable Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) in order to modulate generated trajectories smoothly. The inverted pendulum model is utilized to model a balanced walking. A numerical approach is presented to control inverted pendulum dynamics. Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is employed to search for appropriate hip height trajectory and walking parameters that optimize walking speed. This approach has been tested not only to obtain fast forward walk but also a fast side walk. Experiments are conducted on both simulated and real NAO robots. The results show that the change from the learned forward walk to learned side walk is performed stably, which confirm the important role of using CPGs. The comparison of the results of the proposed gait model (and development approach) with those obtained using fixed hip height also shows that fixed height walking is slower than variable height walking.	robot	Nima Shafii;Nuno Lau;Luís Paulo Reis	2015	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-015-0191-5	central pattern generator;simulation	Robotics	63.52956191739865	-23.67220998547655	135857

The relative rotational motion between a pursuer and an evader is represented by an equation similar to the equation of motion for a spherical pendulum with a disturbance. A set of sufficient conditions for successful pursuit are derived, and it is proved that the conditions are satisfied by suitably choosing the gain parameters of the guidance law. For sufficiently large gains, a pursuer controlled by the guidance law catches a maneuvering evader while achieving motion camouflage.	angularjs;computer simulation;course (navigation);evasion (network security);lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis	Takateru Urakubo;Takeo Kanade	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		classical mechanics;acceleration;control engineering;motion control;angular velocity;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;physics;quantum mechanics	Robotics	64.88975869542098	-17.50636167857877	135877

Avoiding moving obstacles at their corresponding precise moment motivates the use of a robotic planner satisfying both dynamic and nonholonomic constraints, also referred as kynodynamic constraints.We present a proactive navigation approach with respect its environment, in the sense that the robot calculates the reaction produced by its actions and provides the minimum impact on nearby pedestrians. As a consequence, the proposed planner integrates seamlessly planning and prediction and calculates a complete motion prediction of the scene for each robot propagation. Making use of the Extended Social Force Model (ESFM) allows an enormous simplification for both the prediction model and the planning system under differential constraints. Simulations and real experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the success of the proactive kinodynamic planner.	computer simulation;experiment;kinesiology;kinodynamic planning;level of detail;proactive parallel suite;robot;robotic mapping;social force model;software propagation	Gonzalo Ferrer;Alberto Sanfeliu	2014	2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2014.6942788	mobile robot;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;kinodynamic planning;mobile robot navigation	Robotics	60.399219589942994	-22.615227700369264	136322

Furthermore, tuning the controller (and/or obtaining process models) requires extensive expertise and time. In this paper, a novel automatic tuning methodology for the accurate position control of pneumatic servo actuators is described. The methodology combines off-line model-based analysis with on-line iteration. Experiments performed on three actuators with distinct open-loop dynamics verified the auto-tuneru0027s effectiveness. The auto-tuning required 1/50 of the time needed for manual tuning and only non-expert supervision. The performance of the auto-tuned actuators is comparable to that achieved by other researchers using more complex and expensive hardware.	servo	Sarmad Aziz;Gary M.

The hierarchical control architecture consists of three layers: high, low, and intermediate levels. The upper-layer module deals with the vehicle motion control objective, which generates the desired longitudinal/lateral forces and yaw moment. The low-level module handles the braking control for each wheel based on the wheel slip dynamics. The intermediate-level controller generates the longitudinal slip reference for the low-level brake control module and the front-wheel steering angles. To cope with the unknown and nonuniform road condition parameters appearing in the actuator models, an adaptive law is designed for each wheel, and the convergence of the adaptive parameters is guaranteed under a certain persistency-of-excitation condition. The stability of the integrated control system is analyzed by utilizing a Lyapunov function approach. Simulation results are included to illustrate the proposed control scheme.	algorithm;autonomous robot;control system;control unit;coupling (computer programming);dynamic programming;high- and low-level;lateral thinking;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;simulation;velocity (software development);yaws	Changfang Chen;Yingmin Jia;Minglei Shu;Yinglong Wang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2015.2426211	control engineering;mathematical optimization;vehicle dynamics;adaptive control;aerodynamics;engineering;friction;automotive engineering;control theory	Robotics	63.92206138420826	-17.50667023201208	136430

Nine drivers executed a lane keeping task with visual occlusion of the upper or lower field of view restraining them to near or far road scene information. Three common driver models are applied to replicate driving behavior. An autoregressive model with exogeneous input (ARX) is identified using vehicle lateral lane deviation as input and steering wheel angle as output. Two output error models are identified using vehicle heading deviation angles with respect to near and far preview points as respective inputs and steering wheel angle as output. The results show that the driving behaviors induced in the experiment are significantly different in terms of lane keeping performance. In simulations, the output error models exhibit advantages over the ARX model in capturing driving behavior. However, the model natural frequency and the model simulation error show weak performance in discerning this varying driving behavior and are largely determined by track effects.	arx;autoregressive model;course (navigation);experiment;lateral thinking;self-replication;simulation;steering wheel	Peter Hermannstadter;Bin Yang	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377889	data modeling;estimation;simulation;system identification;behavioural sciences;computer science;trajectory;linearity;computational model;statistics	Robotics	60.59122642822986	-15.11861193604679	136780

Only a subset of these standard parameters: the base parameters have unique values identified with the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model and linear least squares techniques (IDIM-LS). Moreover, some of the base parameters are poorly identified when their effect on the joint torques is too small. They can be eliminated, leading to a new subset of essential (base) parameters. However, the consistency of the identified values of the base or the essential parameters cannot be guaranteed, regarding to the loss of the positive definiteness of the robot inertia matrix. The past methods proposed to verify the physical consistency of the identified parameters, relies on complicated, time consuming computations and even leads to non-optimal LS parameters. We propose a method that overcomes these drawbacks, calculating the set of optimal LS standard parameters closest to a set of a priori consistent dynamic parameters obtained through CAD data given by the robot manufacturers. This is a straightforward method, which relies on the use of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Cholesky factorization and the linear least squares techniques. The method is experimentally validated on a Stäubli TX-40, which is a 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) industrial robot. This example enlighten a strong result: the essential base parameters, which have significant identified values with respect to their small relative standard deviation, are consistent.	cholesky decomposition;column (database);computation;computer-aided design;experiment;industrial robot;linear least squares (mathematics);singular value decomposition	Maxime Gautier;Gentiane Venture	2013	2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2013.6697198	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory;singular value decomposition;statistics	Robotics	68.0087705764314	-19.766593601038828	136790

It is shown that due to the embedded integral action, the guidance law makes the vessels follow straight lines by compensating for the drift effect of environmental disturbances, such as currents, wind, and waves. The ILOS guidance is first applied to a 2-D model of surface vessels that includes the underactauted sway dynamics of the vehicle as well as disturbances in the form of constant irrotational ocean currents and constant dynamic, attitude dependent, and forces. The actuated dynamics are not considered at this point. A Lyapunov closed-loop analysis yields explicit bounds on the guidance law gains to guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) and uniform local exponential stability (ULES). The complete kinematic and dynamic closed-loop system of the 3-D ILOS guidance law is analyzed in the following and hence extending the analysis to underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for the 3-D straight-line path-following applications in the presence of constant irrotational ocean currents. The actuated surge, pitch, and yaw dynamics are included in the analysis where the closed-loop system forms a cascade, and the properties of UGAS and ULES are shown. The 3-D ILOS control system is a generalization of the 2-D ILOS guidance. Finally, results from simulations and experiments are presented to validate and illustrate the theoretical results, where the 2-D ILOS guidance is applied to the cooperative autonomous robotics towing system vehicle and light AUV.	autonomous robot;computer simulation;control system;embedded system;experiment;line-of-sight (missile);lyapunov fractal;mesh analysis;robotics;time complexity;underactuation;yaws	Walter Caharija;Kristin Ytterstad Pettersen;Marco Bibuli;Pedro Calado;Enrica Zereik;Jose Braga;Jan Tommy Gravdahl;Asgeir J.

The gain of ESO is automatically timely tuned to reduce the estimation errors of both states and “total disturbance” against the measurement noise. Furthermore, the satisfactory performance of the closed-loop system is achieved by compensation for uncertainties. This novel controller is applied to the air-fuel ratio (AFR) control of gasoline engine, which has large nonlinear uncertainties due to the unknown speed change, fuel film dynamics, etc. In addition, the measurement of AFR is polluted by sensor noise. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller can ensure high deviation precision of AFR despite both uncertain dynamics and measurement noise. Moreover, the experimental comparison validates the effectiveness of the AESO's gain by which the performance of ADRC on mitigating uncertainties can be improved.	alternate frame rendering;image noise;nonlinear system;rejection sampling;sensor	Wenchao Xue;Wenyan Bai;Sheng Yang;Kang Song;Yi Huang	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2015.2435004	control engineering;simulation;uncertainty;engineering;noise measurement;noise;control theory;physics	Robotics	67.27623826462103	-10.843765483603358	137031

This work1, presents a framework for the design and performance analysis of sampled-data iterative learning control (ILC) for piezoelectric motor. The design and analysis are carried out in the frequency domain. Monotonic convergence criterion is used in ILC design. Four ILC designs associated with different learning functions and filters are considered, namely, the P-type, D-type, D2-type and general filter. Criteria for the selection of each type are presented. In addition, a relationship is shown between the sampling-time selection and the ILC convergence. Theoretical work concludes with a guideline for the ILC designs. Further, based on the frequency-domain design tools, a successful experimental implementation on the piezoelectric motor is demonstrated.	data system;hard disk drive;iterative method;mechatronics;non-monotonic logic;piezoelectricity;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);system camera	Jian-Xin Xu;Khalid Abidi;Xuelei Niu;Deqing Huang	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/ISIE.2012.6237208	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.4174513305866	-10.745539954287992	137328

HILS is a computer-assisted simulation techniques used in the development and testing of complex embedded real-time systems. HILS has the ability to simulate UAV flight characteristics, sensor modeling, and modeling of actuators while communicating in real time with flight control hardware. HILS aims to test the reliability of UAV flight control hardware, integration test of Chemical monitoring systems, and tuning the control parameters. Advantages of using HILS are lower the development costs, improve safety, and streamline the development process. HILS provides development process without using actual UAV platform, but by using a mathematical equation to represent the UAV platform that will be used. HILS implement control system on Pixhawk then the output actuators used as model input. Hexacopter model will produce the attitude and position of hexacopter modeled as sensors model. The output of sensors model will be the input for computing the next control command of Pixhawk. HILS can be used to test the integration of UAV platform with Chemical sensor module to ensure Chemical monitoring missions can run well on the real situation.	adobe streamline;autonomous robot;control system;embedded system;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;integration testing;real-time clock;real-time computing;sensor;unmanned aerial vehicle	Rendy Wandarosanza;Bambang Riyanto Trilaksono;Egi Hidayat	2016	2016 6th International Conference on System Engineering and Technology (ICSET)	10.1109/ICSEngT.2016.7849648	control engineering;simulation;aerospace engineering;engineering	Robotics	61.36264702797982	-16.411041934230852	137625

The aim of the grasp capability analysis is to find the maximum external wrench that the multifingered robot hands can withstand, which is an important criterion in the evaluation of robotic systems. The study of grasp capability provides a basis for the task planning of force control of multifingered robot hands. For a given multifingered hand geometry, the grasp capability depends on the joint driving torque limits, grasp configuration, contact model and so on. A systematic method of the grasp capability analysis, which is in fact a constrained optimization algorithm, is presented. In this optimization, the optimality criterion is the maximum external wrench, and the constraints include the equality constraints and the inequality constraints. The equality constraints are for the grasp to balance the given external wrench, and the inequality constraints are to prevent the slippage of fingertips, the overload of joint actuators, the excessive forces over the physical limits of the object, etc. The advantages of this method are the ability to accomodate diverse areas such as multiple robot arms, intelligent fixtures and so on. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed with a numerical example of a trifingered grasp.	robot	Caihua Xiong;Youfu Li;Youlun Xiong;Han Ding;Qingshi Huang	1999	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	10.1016/S0921-8890(99)00007-X	constrained optimization;simulation;robotic arm;computer science;artificial intelligence;manipulator;robotics	Robotics	65.8147236043191	-21.641643625985118	137740

The proposed hybrid inverse NARX fuzzy-PID controller is implemented to control a PAM robot arm that is subjected to nonlinear systematic features and load variations in real time. First the inverse NARX fuzzy model is modeled and identified by a modified genetic algorithm (MGA) based on input/output training data gathered experimentally from the PAM system. Second the performance of the optimized inverse NARX fuzzy model is experimentally demonstrated in a novel hybrid inverse NARX fuzzy-PID position controller of the PAM robot arm. The results of these experiments demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the proposed control approach compared to traditional PID control strategies. Consequently, the good performance of the MGAbased inverse NARX fuzzy model in the proposed hybrid inverse NARX fuzzy-PID position control of the PAM robot arm is demonstrated. These results are also applied to model and to control other highly nonlinear systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A quasi-Newton nonlinear programming technique (super-linear convergence) is implemented to solve minimum torque-based human motion-planning problems. The explicit analytical gradients needed in the dynamics are derived using a matrix exponential formulation and Lie algebra. Cubic spline functions are used to make the search space for an optimal solution finite. Based on our formulations, our method is well conditioned and robust, in addition to being computationally efficient. To better illustrate the efficiency of our method, we present results of natural looking and physically correct human motions for a variety of human motion tasks involving open and closed loop kinematic chains.	algorithmic efficiency;body position;cognitive dimensions of notations;computation (action);computer animation;control system;cubic function;direct method in the calculus of variations;experiment;fits;gradient;graphics;human factors and ergonomics;iva <plant>;jack device component;kinematic chain;kinesiology;latex;mathematical optimization;motion planning;motion simulator;movement;newton;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimal control;poor posture;programming paradigm;rate of convergence;recursion (computer science);robustness (computer science);seizures;simulation;spline (mathematics);variational principle;video-in video-out;virtual reality;exponential;notation	Gang Huang;Dimitris N.

The main idea is to remove the servo control loop from the DSP (digital signal processor) to a FPGA (field programmable gate array), and utilize the high speed hardwired logic of the FPGA to enhance the computation capability and relieve the computing load on the DSP. The control algorithm is partitioned into a linear portion and a nonlinear portion. The linear portion with position/velocity feedback represents the major control loop and is implemented in the FPGA. The nonlinear portion acts as dynamic compensation to the linear portion to perform complex modeling related calculations, and is implemented in the DSP. A new FPGA-based motion control IC is designed to realize this new control hardware structure. Experiments were conducted on a Yamaha robot manipulator to compare new control architecture and the existing one, when the same control algorithm was used. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed new control architecture exhibits much improved motion performance especially during high-speed motions	algorithm;computation;control function (econometrics);control system;digital signal processing;digital signal processor;field-programmable gate array;integrated circuit;nonlinear system;robot;scara;sampling (signal processing);servo;velocity (software development)	Xiaoyin Shao;Dong Sun;James K.

A significant problem exists concerning contamination of the environment, especially air pollution, and the consequent climatic change. Considering that agricultural vehicles that use fossil fuels emit significant amounts of atmospheric pollutants, the main objective of this paper is to include techniques to reduce the fuel consumption in the controls system of robotic tractors used in agriculture tasks and thereby reduce the atmospheric emissions from these automated applications. To achieve this goal, the first step is to analyze fuel consumption in real time for each of the applications to be improved and to implement the consumption model of a robotic tractor for each task, considering the mechanical energy variations, the performance losses, the energy used to overcome friction and the energy required by the given task. For calculating the mechanical energy, the model considers the potential energy of the system, which is a function of the mass, elevation and gravity. The terrain elevations are estimated from GeoTIFF images of DEM data, which have a pixel size equal to 1arc second (approximately 30m at the Equator), and an accuracy of integer meters. Regarding the system mass, the possible loss of mass from applying the treatment is considered. For estimating the frictional forces, the rolling resistance coefficient of the terrain surface conditions is used.The consumption model has been validated experimentally using real agricultural vehicles and implements within the RHEA project (FP7-NMP 245986), in which the instantaneous fuel consumption was measured.This fuel reduction method is applied to three different treatments: weed control on herbaceous crops through the spraying of herbicides, weed control on fire-resistant crops with wide furrows through plowing and flame treatment, and pest control on trees through fumigation using insecticides.Finally, a fuel reduction procedure is applied to each task using the system model implemented to predict the energy requirements. This enables one to find the optimum path plan with respect to fuel consumption. These theoretical results are compared with the experimental results. In addition, the goal is to demonstrate the fuel reduction technique by performing field experiments to show that the use of this method of fuel reduction leads to an reduced fuel consumption and thus reduces atmospheric emissions from agricultural tasks. The results obtained revealed that this fuel reduction method significantly reduces the energy requirements, with the consequent reduction in fuel consumption and atmospheric pollutant emissions.	robot	Mariano Gonzalez-de-Soto;Luis Emmi;Isaías García;Pablo González de Santos	2015	Computers and Electronics in Agriculture	10.1016/j.compag.2015.04.003	simulation;environmental engineering;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;motion planning;efficient energy use;ecology	Robotics	57.59983796587721	-12.280877355908798	138107

It is based on the metrological redundancy paradigm, which simplifies their kinematic models by introducing additional proprioceptive sensors. By observing the mechanism legs, vision replaces advantageously these sensors by delivering, in a Cartesian frame, an exteroceptive measurement of the internal state of the mechanism. Formally, the latter is expressed by an original concept of vision-based kinematics for parallel mechanisms. Based on it, control is derived that visually servoes the direction of the legs, rather than the end-effector pose. The method is illustrated and validated on a Gough-Stewart platform simulation.	cylinder seal;programming paradigm;robot end effector;sensor;simulation	Nicolas Andreff;Arnaud Marchadier;Philippe Martinet	2005	Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2005.1570494	robust control;control engineering;computer vision;kinematics;calibration;error detection and correction;computer science;control theory;redundancy;stewart platform;visual servoing	Robotics	67.57742182295533	-22.71860989866593	138142

First, we present a randomized algorithm for constrained motion planning, that is used to generate collision-free statically balanced paths solving manipulation tasks. Then, we show that dynamic walking makes humanoid robots small-space controllable. Such a property allows to easily transform collision-free statically balanced paths into collision-free dynamically balanced trajectories. It leads to a sound algorithm which has been applied and evaluated on several problems where whole-body planning and walk are needed, and the results have been validated on a real HRP-2 robot.	humanoid robotics project;humanoid robot;motion planning;randomized algorithm	Sébastien Dalibard;Antonio El Khoury;Florent Lamiraux;Alireza Nakhaei;Michel Taïx;Jean-Paul Laumond	2013	I.

For path-planning approaches, a 3-D virtual dangerous potential field is constructed as a superposition of trigonometric functions of the road and the exponential function of obstacles, which can generate a desired trajectory for collision avoidance when a vehicle collision with obstacles is likely to happen. Next, to track the planned trajectory for collision avoidance maneuvers, the path-tracking controller formulated the tracking task as a multiconstrained model predictive control (MMPC) problem and calculated the front steering angle to prevent the vehicle from colliding with a moving obstacle vehicle. Simulink and CarSim simulations are conducted in the case where moving obstacles exist. The simulation results show that the proposed path-planning approach is effective for many driving scenarios, and the MMPC-based path-tracking controller provides dynamic tracking performance and maintains good maneuverability.	autonomous robot;coefficient;collision detection;lateral thinking;matlab;motion planning;quadratic programming;radar;real-time locating system;simulation;simulink;steering wheel;time complexity;yaws	Jie Ji;Amir Khajepour;Wael William Melek;Yanjun Huang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2555853	control engineering;simulation;tracking system;engineering;trajectory;process control;control theory;model predictive control	Robotics	62.190103609409135	-17.32067636622449	138426

We simulate such a robotic system in real time, demonstrating the expressiveness of the decentralized algorithmic musical output as well as a number of behaviors that arise out of the manipulation of the control parameters.	algorithm;algorithmic composition;consensus dynamics;nonlinear system;optimal control;robot;simulation	Aaron Albin;Gil Weinberg;Magnus Egerstedt	2012	2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2012.6385688	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;decentralised system;computer science;artificial intelligence;rhythm;control theory;distributed parameter system;robot kinematics	Robotics	58.95822545406005	-21.835452343191204	138920

They drive the systems away from their set points. It takes time for feedback control to reject them. The feedforward control offers great potentials for regulation performance if the disturbances are measurable. One obstacle for feedforward control implementation is that the theoretical one is unrealizable for various reasons. In this paper, a new feedforward control design approach based on frequency response approximation is proposed and performs much better than the existing method in the literature. A performance measure is defined to assess if the feedforward control can outperform feedback control alone and analytical conditions are derived to determine such a measure a prior.

This control scheme integrated the theory of variable structure control and the nonlinear mapping of neural network. a Radial Basic Function Neural Network (RBFNN) was used to adaptively learn the unknown bounds of system uncertainties. The chattering of sliding mode could be eliminated effectively. The control law could guarantee convergence of trajectory tracking error as well as robustness for external disturbances, parameter and unparameter uncertainties.

But this obliges the displacements or velocity perturbations of cars that are far down the chain to be vanishingly small and leads to anomalous behaviour. In this paper an alternative formulation is proposed wherein state space is the Banach space l, allowing the displacements or velocity perturbations of cars from their equilibria to be merely bounded. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

10c00c1f15e3a230287b063a73276084508a6568	improved parameter optimization method for complex assembly process in robotic manufacturing		Purpose#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#High precision assembly processes using industrial robots require the process parameters to be tuned to achieve desired performance such as cycle time and first time through rate. Some researchers proposed methods such as design-of-experiments (DOE) to obtain optimal parameters. However, these methods only discuss how to find the optimal parameters if the part and/or workpiece location errors are in a certain range. In real assembly processes, the part and/or workpiece location errors could be different from batch to batch. Therefore, the existing methods have some limitations. This paper aims to improve the process parameter optimization method for complex robotic assembly process.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Design/methodology/approach#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#In this paper, the parameter optimization process based on DOE with different part and/or workpiece location errors is investigated. An online parameter optimization method is also proposed.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Findings#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Experimental results demonstrate that the optimal parameters for different initial conditions are different and larger initial part and/or workpiece location errors will cause longer cycle time. Therefore, to improve the assembly process performance, the initial part and/or workpiece location errors should be compensated first, and the optimal parameters in production should be changed once the initial tool position is compensated. Experimental results show that the proposed method is very promising in reducing the cycle time in assembly processes.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Research limitations/implications#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#The proposed method is practical without any limitation.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Practical implications#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#The proposed technique is implemented and tested using a real industrial application, a valve body assembly process. Hence, the developed method can be directly implemented in production.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Originality/value#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#This paper provides a technique to improve the assembly efficiency by compensating the initial part location errors. An online parameter optimization method is also proposed to automatically perform the parameter optimization process without human intervention. Compared with the results using other methods, the proposed technology can greatly reduce the assembly cycle time.	mathematical optimization;robot	Heping Chen;Jing Xu;Biao Zhang;Thomas A.

717f7959fa5f34e720b83938cf209854799ab23c	composite controller design for pmsm direct drive sgcmg gimbal servo system		Comparing with the indirect drive gimbal servo system of single gimbal control moment gyroscope (SGCMG), direct drive gimbal servo system based on permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) can achieve higher precision and faster response. However, the difficulty of PMSM controller design increases, because PMSM has to endure larger multi-source and multi-band disturbances due to the lack of a decelerator. In this paper, PMSM direct drive system is described, importantly, based on SVPWM control strategy, a novel composite control strategy is proposed: an adaptive nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller (ANTSMC) with a disturbance sliding mode observer (SMO) is designed to achieve high precision speed closed-loop control and compensate uncertain large low frequency disturbances; a repetitive controller (RC) is designed to compensate high frequency disturbances. Simulation results show that the proposed controller has strong robustness and disturbance tolerance, and can achieve high precision and fast response control performances.	control theory;game controller;gimbal lock;multi-source;performance;servo;simulation	Ming Lu;Yingguang Wang;Yuewei Hu;Luhang Liu;Nuo Su	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2017.8014003	control engineering;control moment gyroscope;control theory;control theory;synchronous motor;gimbal;servomechanism;terminal sliding mode;computer science;servomotor;automatic frequency control	Robotics	67.92751418396786	-12.158052253891656	139310

The trajectory tracking control for a single nonholonomic robot is extended to the formation control for multiple mobile nonholonomic robots. Applying the backstepping approach, the asymptotically stable control law for formation control of the mobile robots are developed, which not only guarantee that the mobile robots achieve and maintain the desired formation, but also guarantee that each follower robot tracks its leader's time-varying trajectory. Stability analysis is provided by using Lyapunov theory. Finally, some simulation results are used to verify the theoretical results presented in this paper.	consensus dynamics;lyapunov fractal;mobile robot;optimal control;simulation	Zhaoxia Peng;Guoguang Wen;Ahmed Rahmani	2013		10.1145/2480362.2480408	simulation;backstepping	Robotics	64.62871975905978	-16.72984748923839	139325

An uneven energy distribution in a swarm of robots performing a mission may prevent completion of the group's mission or reduce its tolerance for adverse events that occur during mission execution. The goal of effectively managing energy use in a swarm is known as collective energy homeostasis. While previous works have mainly focused on achieving this goal by direct energy exchange methods (e.g., using battery charging mechanisms), this paper presents a novel bio-inspired approach for maintaining collective energy homeostasis in social robot swarms. The approach extends Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques for task selection and motion planning for individual robots by making them sensitive to the robot's energy state. The overall effect of this Energy-based PSO (EPSO) algorithm is to shift energy-intensive tasks towards robots in the swarm that have higher energy levels, i.e. energy load-leveling, which improves energy self-sufficiency and its homogeneity across the swarm. This can be considered a form of indirect energy exchange by task shifting. Experimental results show that the EPSO algorithm enables social robot swarms to maintain collective energy homeostasis more effectively than previous approaches, reducing the variance of energy between individuals by 49%, and extending the number of missions that a swarm can achieve, given a fixed initial energy budget.	algorithm;autonomous robot;battery charger;british informatics olympiad;energy level;homeostasis;motion planning;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;social robot	Xin Zhou;David Kinny	2013	2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)	10.1109/WI-IAT.2013.87	swarm robotics;mathematical optimization;multi-swarm optimization;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence	Robotics	57.1364525418001	-23.943032162298767	139438

When this passive walking helper is applied for guidance and obstacle avoidance, it is crucial to determine proper braking torques in accordance with user-applied force for avoiding the obstacles and reaching the desired location. Motivated by it, in this paper, we propose such an approach based on receding horizon control. The proposed approach is efficient in braking torque derivation and allows the walking helper to stop at the goal with parking control. With the desired location to reach, the proposed scheme first plans a smooth path for the walking helper to follow based on Dubins curve [13]. The process of torque derivation is then formulated into solving an optimization problem with constraints that guarantee system passivity. When the walking helper detects the obstacles, the obstacle avoiding strategy is activated to bring it to deviate from them, which is achieved by including the constraints for obstacle avoidance into the optimization process. Simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	computer simulation;experiment;mathematical optimization;mobile robot;obstacle avoidance;optimization problem	Chun-Hsu Ko;Yi-Hung Hsieh;Yao-Tse Chang;Sunil Kumar Agrawal;Kuu-Young Young	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2014.6899453	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;obstacle avoidance	Robotics	62.67339064487742	-17.86709383119701	139449

Then, an adequate selection of the projection planes makes it possible to simplify the controller without deteriorating the tip motion response and to obtain the desired motion in the null space of the manipulator. This is one of the remarkable features of the proposed approach. The validity of the proposed controller is confirmed by several numerical simulations.	projection plane	Toshiyuki Murakami;Klemens Kahlen;Rik W. De Doncker	2002	IEEE Trans.

c14cd6b724dc827706e0f8d629daac4af7d517c1	efficient photovoltaic solar panel with mirror actuation		This paper is to design and develop a microcontroller based solar mirror actuation system. In recent years solar energy has rapidly become an alternative means of power source all over the world. Solar energy becomes profitable when maximum irradiance is available on the surface of the panel, but during off-noon conditions, the irradiance on the surface reduces thereby resulting in less power generation by the panel. This paper deals with the design and construction of the solar-tracking system with a mirror by using ATmega168 microcontroller programmed by Arduino. The mirror reflecting more irradiance is used to maximize the efficiency. The mirror will travel from East to West and vice-versa, while the solar panel is kept in the North-South direction at a particular angle with respect to surface level. The prototype is a programmed ATmega168 microcontroller which controls the system by communicating with a current sensor, voltage divider measurements and motor driver based on the movement of the sun. The performance and characteristics of the proposed system are experimentally analyzed.

In this paper, we consider the problem of throwing a point-mass object to minimize uncertainty in the object's landing position, given uncertainty in (1) the robot's initial configuration and (2) friction at the joints. Our analysis assumes that the robot's throw is executed using open-loop torque commands, and it relies on the linearized sensitivities of (a) landing location with respect to release state, (b) release state with respect to initial robot configuration and (c) joint friction. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulations.	approximation algorithm;discretization;emoticon;experiment;human error;monte carlo method;robot;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle	Masafumi Okada;Alexander Pekarovskiy;Martin Buss	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139623	control engineering;simulation;uncertainty;sensitivity;engineering;trajectory;friction;mathematical model;control theory;statistics	Robotics	61.98300764040966	-17.945826332779493	139573

Adding mobile platforms, in particular nonholonomic mobile platforms, can expediently enlarge their working ranges but also introduces new challenges. The problem of the existing control methods for nonholonomic mobile manipulators is that they leave out the consideration of the differences between the mobile platform and the manipulator such as the dynamics differences and working condition differences. This may consequently result in some unnecessarily large errors for the motion tracking in the implementation. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new practical control method using the adaptive motion distribution and coordination between the mobile platform and manipulator to minimize the errors of the motion control and also automatically handle some unexpected events. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method were demonstrated through both simulation and experimental results.	mobile device;mobile manipulator;mobile operating system;real-time clock;real-time computing;risk management;robot end effector;simulation	Yunyi Jia;Ning Xi;Yu Cheng;Siyang Liang	2014	2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2014.6942774	control engineering;motion control;computer vision;mobile manipulator;control theory	Robotics	63.6676500055461	-22.8723175371713	139886
db869176381ced0a2ecd6caf7137e0d0570d82c6	learning controllers for industrial robots	robotics;neural networks;fuzzy controllers;multistrategy learning	One of the most significant cost factors in robotics applications is the design and development of real-time robot control software. Control theory helps when linear controllers have to be developed, but it doesn't sufficiently support the generation of non-linear controllers, although in many cases (such as in compliance control), nonlinear control is essential for achieving high performance. This paper discusses how Machine Learning has been applied to the design of (non-)linear controllers. Several alternative function approximators, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs), and Fuzzy Controllers are analyzed and compared, leading to the definition of two major families: Open Field Function Approximators and Locally Receptive Field Function Approximators. It is shown that RBFNs and Fuzzy Controllers bear strong similarities, and that both have a symbolic interpretation. This characteristic allows for applying both symbolic and statistic learning algorithms to synthesize the network layout from a set of examples and, possibly, some background knowledge. Three integrated learning algorithms, two of which are original, are described and evaluated on experimental test cases. The first test case is provided by a robot KUKA IR-361 engaged into the peg-into-hole task, whereas the second is represented by a classical prediction task on the Mackey-Glass time series. From the experimental comparison, it appears that both Fuzzy Controllers and RBFNs synthesised from examples are excellent approximators, and that, in practice, they can be even more accurate than MLPs.	algorithm;backpropagation;connectionism;control system;control theory;experiment;fuzzy logic;industrial robot;machine learning;memory-level parallelism;multilayer perceptron;nonlinear system;radial basis function;real-time transcription;robot control;robotics;sensor;test case;time series	Cristina Baroglio;Attilio Giordana;Roberto Piola;Michael Kaiser;Marnix Nuttin	1996	Machine Learning	10.1023/A:1018228822027	nonlinear control;function approximation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;time series;robot control;multilayer perceptron;evolutionary robotics;radial basis function network;receptive field;artificial neural network	Robotics	61.80004313280221	-11.202251590410862	139986

A heave motion model of an UAH is constructed for the purpose of capturing dynamic variations of thrust due to horizontal wind gusts. Additionally, through construction of an effective gust estimator, a promising and feasible feedback-feedforward Proportional Differential (PD) controller is developed, based on available measurements from onboard equipment. The controller dynamically and synchronously compensates for aerodynamic variations of heave motion resulting from gust influence, to increase the disturbance-attenuation ability of the UAH in a windy environment. Simulation results justify the reliability and efficiency of the suggested gust estimator when applied to the heave motion model of a small unmanned helicopter, and verify suitability of the recommended control strategy to realistic environmental conditions.	control theory;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;simulation;thrust;unmanned aerial vehicle	Xilin Yang;Hemanshu Roy Pota;Matthew Garratt	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5281074	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	62.38742618652519	-16.389981395562994	140004

In a sense, our result shows that for target assignment problems in robotic networks, local optimality also offers good guarantees on global optimality.	assignment problem;local optimum;maxima and minima;mobile robot	Jingjin Yu;Soon-Jo Chung;Petros G.

The main drawbacks of continuous-time analysis are its computational burden and the necessity for very high sampling frequencies. These inconveniences can be avoided by the use of numerical methods conceived for the solution of systems of differential-algebraic equations. Such an approach naturally leads to a predictive control scheme. As a consequence, in the control process a basic dynamic model of the flexible-joint robot can be used, which is much less complex than in the classical inverse dynamics solution. At the same time, the simplified inverse dynamics approach discussed here accepts low sampling frequencies. Control algorithms are presented and their properties are discussed.

Although a number of learning models for the visual feedback controller have been proposed, none has been able to establish a definitive approach. In our previous work, we have suggested a learning model that uses disturbance noise and the feedback error signal to learn the human visual feedback controller's coordinate transformation. However, the model does not fully consider the time delay in the visual feedback control loop. This paper presents a modified learning model taking into account the time delay and the convergence properties of the model. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.		Eimei Oyama;Karl F.

054786857316eaf376a912558c37ff78d50de9f7	controlling flight vehicle spatial motion along a given route		The problem of the unmanned flight vehicle moving along the given route in a perturbed environment comes down to that of pursuing a target which simulates motion of the reference flight vehicle in compliance with its task. A scheme was proposed of a control system selecting the control strategy according to the current states of the flight vehicle and target. Consideration was given to the issues of the lead determination of the point of meeting of the flight vehicle with the target and rearrangement in the transfer functions of the equations of longitudinal and lateral motions of the flight vehicle in a restless atmosphere. The systems of automatic stabilization of the pitch and yaw angles with autopilot are used as the internal control loops. In the experimental part of the paper, the FV motion is modeled under the control constraints.

Possible applications concern magnetic levitation systems, one of which will be used, in this paper, to design the proposed controller. Theoretical aspects regarding feasibility, stability and optimality will be readily described in a constructive and systematical manner, emphasizing flexibility of this procedure and further extensions. Special attention is being payed to practical concerns like singularity avoidance inside feedback loop. Lastly, we deal with sine wave tracking problem, by actually comparing simulation results, with other linear and nonlinear control design techniques already existing in the literature, in terms of robustness and performance. We hope to show that, our ‘engineer’ controller synthesis proves interesting enough, by effectively manipulating theoretical concepts with numerical applicability.	dynamical system;feedback;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;simulation;singularity project	Catalin-Stefan Teodorescu;Noboru Sakamoto;Sorin Olaru	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2010.5611285	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.63247994369485	-10.96128184527657	140517
39c99f87d71403c4b4d9f445b9bf103c0f114c3d	almost globally stable tracking on compact riemannian manifolds		In this paper we present a tracking controller for a fully actuated simple mechanical system (SMS) on a compact Riemannian manifold. The controller is derived from an error function which is the composition of a configuration error and a navigation function, and depends on the choice of these two maps. Error functions present in literature have been used for the purpose of stabilization and tracking for an SMS on a Riemannian manifold. However, these control laws are local and require the initial conditions of the system trajectory to lie in a neighborhood of the reference trajectory. The control law we propose achieves almost-global asymptotic tracking of any bounded, smooth reference trajectory where ”almost-global asymptotic tracking” means tracking from almost all initial conditions with asymptotic convergence. We demonstrate the results of this tracking controller for a pendulum on S and an externally actuated rigid body which is an SMS on SO(3).	computable function;initial condition;map;navigation function;optimal control	Aradhana Nayak;Ravi N.

14aad212533b9b5e9f109f78c70cc8f113fe6178	triple-integral control for reduced-g atmospheric flight		In order to address the need for an autonomous reduced-gravity enabling platform, a novel flight-control architecture is formulated. The chosen control law employs a chain of three integrators, which takes advantage of the internal model principle to counteract the non linear aerodynamic forces impeding the vehicle's constant acceleration during parabolic flight. The control architecture and design is experimentally validated through flight tests on a variable-pitch multi-rotor by performing a Martian parabola (0.378 G), with a mean within 0.6% from the desired value and an RMSE of 0.0426 G. To the author's knowledge, this appears to be one of the few cases where the presence of a parabolic disturbance requires a triple-integral control architecture.	autonomous robot;experiment;optimal control;parabolic antenna;r.o.t.o.r.

In the proposed control scheme, we employ closed-loop control with the use of two position feedback signals: relative positions of the micropart with respect to the microgripper measured by the vision-control system and absolute displacements of the micropart measured by linear encoders. To improve the grasping efficiency and success rate, a two-stage grasping strategy is employed: (1) the bonded microgripper is controlled to directly reach a specific position adjacent to the mating edge of a designated micropart with the same y coordinate, by matching the patterns of the microgripper and the micropart only once, and (2) finely align the micropart with the microgripper along the x and y translation axes of the microassembly robot in the horizontal plane by employing the proposed visual servo control, until the micropart is completely grasped. Experiments conducted with a 6-DOF microassembly robot demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed control approach and grasping strategy.	align (company);control system;control theory;encoder;list of version control software;robot;servo;visual servoing	Lu Ren;Lidai Wang;James K.

In some cases, like locomotion, the mechanics of the body dominate in determining the energetically optimal course of action. In other tasks, such as manipulation, energetic costs depend critically upon the variable properties of objects in the environment. Can the brain identify and follow energy-optimal motions when these motions require moving along unfamiliar trajectories? What feedback information is required for such optimal behavior to occur? To answer these questions, we asked participants to move their dominant hand between different positions while holding a virtual mechanical system with complex dynamics (a planar double pendulum). In this task, trajectories of minimum kinetic energy were along curvilinear paths. Our findings demonstrate that participants were capable of finding the energy-optimal paths, but only when provided with veridical visual and haptic information pertaining to the object, lacking which the trajectories were executed along rectilinear paths.	area striata structure;complex dynamics;dominant hand;double pendulum;execution;haptic device component;haptic technology;kinetics;mechanics;motion;movement;regular grid	Ali Farshchiansadegh;Alejandro Melendez-Calderon;Rajiv Ranganathan;Todd D.

5593e76bdf3c9140290b5d9d566b28cd37532786	mesh-based switching control for robust and agile dynamic gaits		In this paper, we describe and analyze mesh-based tools to control bounding motions of an 8 degree-of-freedom planar quadruped model with limited footholds on terrain. There are two complementary goals in our presentation. First, we aim to clarify potential advantages and disadvantages of our mesh-based approach in planning agile motions for a legged system. A key advantage is the ability to map the reachable states and their feasible transitions, given a relatively high-dimensional nonlinear dynamic system for which traditional meshing techniques would be impractical. A suspected disadvantage is that meshing has finite resolution, and robustness of mesh-based results should correspondingly be considered. Our second goal is to discuss appropriate frameworks for optimizing agility. Unlike typical locomotion optimization studies, in which control is designed for a limit cycle behavior that minimizes energy use or improves robustness to perturbations, here we focus on quantifying the performance of sets of controllers that together enhance reachability of the controlled system. In planning agile motions for our legged system model, we find that our mesh-based policies predict future dynamics robustly for plans up to about a 5-step horizon, and in quantifying controller sets, we emphasize that both the number of and parameterizations for such controllers should be considered in tandem during optimization.	agile software development;dynamical system;high- and low-level;initial condition;iteration;limit cycle;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;nonlinear system;reachability;simulation;state space;velocity (software development)	Katie Byl;Tom Strizic;Jason Pusey	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963802	robustness (computer science);computer science;limit cycle;control engineering;control theory;nonlinear system;agile software development;control theory;gait;system model;control system	Robotics	61.03294017715783	-17.805104693008733	141544

This assumption of quasi-static stability fails to hold when the robot moves at high speed as the inertial forces become significant compared to the static gravitational force. On the other hand, the momentum of the moving structure can be exploited to enhance stability if it is dynamically controlled. This principle was exploited to build a gyroscopically stabilized single-wheeled robot by researchers at Carnegie Melon University (CMU). Our design follows the same principle for stability but uses a different mechanism to effect forward and reverse motion.	mobile robot	Tanveer Saleh;Yap Haw Hann;Zhu Zhen;Abdullah Al Mamun;Prahlad Vadakkepat	2004	IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics, 2004.		control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory	Robotics	66.14348708615945	-21.586967374362157	141721

Modal matching exploits the nonlinearity of the rigid multi-body dynamics (and the variability of the elastic transmissions) as degree of freedom to fit the natural plant dynamics to the desired dynamics of the task. Modal matching achieves a desired intrinsic oscillation behavior, which is locally equivalent to the dynamics of the basic spring-loaded inverted pendulum or pogo-stick model (both implementing a linear inertia acting on a linear spring), well established in locomotion analysis and control. Using the concept of modal matching, an efficient and effective methodology to natural jumping control is introduced.	biological system;inverted pendulum;jacobian matrix and determinant;linear equation;modal logic;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;nonlinear system;pogo browser;spatial variability;stiffness matrix;system of linear equations;the matrix	Dominic Lakatos;Alin Albu-Schäffer	2016	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters	10.1109/LRA.2016.2519601	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.92169787929573	-19.7501091244924	141820

We use a hybrid systems framework to characterize the dynamic transitions of a planar “legged” rigid body from rest on level ground to a fully aerial state. The various contact conditions fit together to form a topologically regular structure, the “ground reaction complex”. The body's actuated dynamics excite multifarious transitions between the cells of this complex, whose regular adjacency relations index naturally the resulting “leaps” (path sequences through the cells from rest to free flight). We exhibit on a RHex robot some of the most interesting “words” formed by these achievable path sequences, documenting unprecedented levels of performance and new application possibilities that illustrate the value of understanding and expressing this vocabulary systematically.	aerial photography;dynamical system;excite;formal methods;hybrid system;rhex;robot;software documentation;tau-leaping;vocabulary	Aaron M.

In this paper, the development and performance evaluation of a novel intelligent visual servo controller for a robot manipulator using neural network Reinforcement Learning is presented. By implementing machine learning techniques into the vision based control scheme, the robot is enabled to improve its performance online and to adapt to the changing conditions in the environment. Two different temporal difference algorithms (Q-learning and SARSA) coupled with neural networks are developed and tested through different visual control scenarios. A database of representative learning samples is employed so as to speed up the convergence of the neural network and real-time learning of robot behavior. Moreover, the visual servoing task is divided into two steps in order to ensure the visibility of the features: in the first step centering behavior of the robot is conducted using neural network Reinforcement Learning controller, while the second step involves switching control between the traditional Image Based Visual Servoing and the neural network Reinforcement Learning for enabling approaching behavior of the manipulator. The correction in robot motion is achieved with the definition of the areas of interest for the image features independently in both control steps. Various simulations are developed in order to present the robustness of the developed system regarding calibration error, modeling error, and image noise. In addition, a comparison with the traditional Image Based Visual Servoing is presented. Real world experiments on a robot manipulator with the low cost vision system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Then the stability is stimulated with Adams, and the upper accelerations which can stabilize the motion is thus obtained. Finally, validated on a designed robot model, the static and dynamic stability is confirmed.

Gyrocycle is designed to be a future personal vehicle to carry a human operator that stands on and drive it. The vehicle uses the gyro effect induced by two flywheels to maintain balance itself. One of critical condition for the balancing stability is to control the tilt angle of the flywheels. However, the flywheels tend to lean against one direction. This leads to the instability of the system. To remedy this behavior, a PD control method with gain scheduling algorithm is used for controlling the balancing angle. Its balancing control performance is empirically confirmed.	algorithm;gyro;instability;scheduling (computing)	Minsoo Ha;Seul Jung	2013	IEEE ISR 2013	10.1109/ISR.2013.6695637	mobile robot;transport;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;flywheel	Robotics	63.02031138363174	-16.344715803922643	142741

The torque response is fast and precise, the wheel speed can be easily estimated and the small dimensions of the motors allow mounting of multiple motors on the same vehicle, each one driving a single wheel. Taking advantage of such characteristics will allow a standard motor controller to integrate feature such as traction-control system (TCS), anti-lock braking system (ABS) and direct yaw control (DYC). This paper presents a novel technique to estimate both the slip ratio and the road friction characteristic without any hardware outside a standard motor controller. Such technique is unaffected by external forces acting on the vehicle. It works by adding a small oscillation to the set torque and then measuring the gain and the phase shift of the wheel speed oscillation. These values can be correlated to the transfer function obtained linearising the vehicle model around an operating point, which is function of the slip ratio and the road characteristics. A SIMULINK simulation is used to validate the method.	control system;is functions;norm (social);operating point;optimization problem;simulation;simulink;torque;traction teampage;transfer function;yaws	Marco Cecotti;James Larminie;Brian Azzopardi	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Electronics and Safety (ICVES 2012)	10.1109/ICVES.2012.6294285	control engineering;engineering;automotive engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.49495645564635	-13.214756792120937	142762

During object's navigation, the virtual force is generated and affected to the manipulator's horizontal trajectory movement. In this paper, the different rotational angle of an object's trajectory which reflects to different movement direction of produced force, will be studied and evaluated.

966e4e5f86a5a9d867632508116843b4e5f9c2e8	decentralized mpc based obstacle avoidance for multi-robot target tracking scenarios		Ahstract- In this work, we consider the problem of decentralized multi-robot target tracking and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments. Each robot executes a local motion planning algorithm which is based on model predictive control (MPC). The planner is designed as a quadratic program, subject to constraints on robot dynamics and obstacle avoidance. Repulsive potential field functions are employed to avoid obstacles. The novelty of our approach lies in embedding these non-linear potential field functions as constraints within a convex optimization framework. Our method convexifies nonconvex constraints and dependencies, by replacing them as pre-computed external input forces in robot dynamics. The proposed algorithm additionally incorporates different methods to avoid field local minima problems associated with using potential field functions in planning. The motion planner does not enforce predefined trajectories or any formation geometry on the robots and is a comprehensive solution for cooperative obstacle avoidance in the context of multi-robot target tracking. We perform simulation studies for different scenarios to showcase the convergence and efficacy of the proposed algorithm.	aerial photography;algorithm;automated planning and scheduling;convex optimization;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;motion planning;nonlinear system;obstacle avoidance;precomputation;quadratic programming;robot;simulation	Rahul Tallamraju;Sujit Rajappa;Michael J.

In this system, one agent acts as the leader which is able to plan and manipulate the omnidirectional motion of an object. Other agents referred to as followers cooperatively transport the object by keeping a constant position relative to the object. During the transportation operation, the leader robot can not only plan the motion of the object but also broadcast the local velocity of the object to other agents. Then, each follower receives such information and generates its own velocity in the local coordinate using a mapping process. In this paper, neural network (NN) and genetic algorithm (GA) are tested in identifying the mapping process. Simulation results show an acceptable performance of the present concept."""

Motivated by a fixed-speed, fixed-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that tracks an unpredictable target, we seek to control the turning rate of a planar Dubins vehicle. We introduce stochasticity in the problem by assuming the target performs a random walk, which both aides in the computation of a smooth value function and further accounts for all realizations of target kinematics. A Bellman equation based on an approximating Markov chain that is consistent with the stochastic kinematics is used to compute a control policy that minimizes the expected value of a cost function based on a nominal UAV-target distance. Our results indicate how uncertainty in the target motion affects the control law, and simulations illustrate that the control can further be applied to any continuous, smooth trajectory with no need for further computation.	aerial photography;approximation;bellman equation;brownian motion;computation;course (navigation);feedback;initial condition;iteration;markov chain;markov decision process;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;offset binary;online and offline;optimal control;robust control;simulation;state space;stochastic process;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	Ross P.

A combination of the virtual structure and path-tracking approaches is used to derive the formation architecture. Each individual robot has only position and orientation available for feedback. For each robot, a coordinate transformation is first derived to cancel the velocity quadratic terms. An observer is then designed to globally exponentially/asymptotically estimate the unmeasured velocities. An output feedback controller is designed for each robot. The controller is designed in such a way that the path derivative is left as a free input to synchronize the robots’ motion. Simulations illustrate the soundness of the proposed controller.

This paper uses the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) which is composed of zero moment point (ZMP) and center of mass (CoM). Based on LIPM, the proposed method consists of feedforward control and feedback control for walking pattern generation of humanoid robots. The linear quadratic regulator(LQR) as a feedback controller tracks the desired ZMP according to footprints of humanoid robots and makes poles of LIPM stable. The feedback controller, pole-zero cancelation by series approximation (PZCSA) plays a role of reducing the inherent property of LIPM and approximating the transfer function of the overall system including LIPM and controllers to be unity. The usefulness of the proposed method is verified by simulations such as arbitrary time intervals of support phases, arbitrary desired ZMP position and sudden changed desired ZMP position. And the validity of the proposed method is confirmed by the experiment of a humanoid robot using a joystick.	approximation;control theory;experiment;feed forward (control);feedback;feedforward neural network;humanoid robot;inverted pendulum;joystick;simulation;transfer function;zero moment point	Seokmin Hong;Yonghwan Oh;Doik Kim;Syungkwon Ra;Bum-Jae You	2009	RO-MAN 2009 - The 18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication	10.1109/ROMAN.2009.5326061	simulation;adaptive control;computer science;humanoid robot;feedback;transfer function;feed forward	Robotics	64.3904529945287	-14.573440491095367	143523

This framework combines multiobjective control with motion capture techniques. Each motion-tracking task is associated with a task wrench. Bounds are imposed on lower priority task wrenches to ensure the controller performance of higher priority tasks. An optimization problem is solved to compute optimal task wrenches that are based on wrench bounds. Finally, joint torques are computed using the optimal task wrenches. The novelty of our wrench-bound method is that it can handle inequality constraints on a higher priority task and maintain passivity as well. This control framework allows an operator to interact with the VH in real time, without the necessity of compromising the VH's balance. It also allows the VH to generate appropriate motions to handle interactions with the virtual environment, rather than to simply emulate captured motions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by a VH performing reaching and manipulation tasks.	humans;interaction;mathematical optimization;motion capture;optimization problem;social inequality;virtual reality	Mingxing Liu;Alain Micaelli;Paul Evrard;Adrien Escande;Claude Andriot	2012	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2012.2208829	control engineering;motion control;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;control theory	Visualization	64.06021569776873	-22.869505879690756	143597

At the same time one of the topics of interest in the mobile robot's community is how to generate their new behaviors, using state machines, automatically. This paper discusses how to create mobile robots' behaviors using genetic algorithms (GAs), implementing them in programmable logic devices (FPGAs) and how these behaviors can be programmed by students in a mobile robotics course. The behaviors are encoded as algorithm state machines and using feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN). In the state-machine approach, each individual's chromosome represents, given a set of inputs coming from the sensors and the current state, both the next state and the outputs that control the robot's movements. In the ANN approach, whose weights are found also with GAs, a pipeline architecture was built to perform it, each pipeline executes a layer of the ANN, thus once the pipeline is full the execution speed of the ANN is one sensors' clock cycle. We evaluate the behaviors generated by the GA according to a fitness function that grades their performance for avoiding obstacles. The inputs to such a robot are infrared sensors to detect obstacles, the outputs are the velocities of its wheels. Our objectives are first, to prove that GAs are a good option as a method for finding behaviors for mobile robots' navigation, and second, that these behaviors can be implemented in an efficient way in FPGAs. We tested both behaviors in a small mobile robot, that is build in an electrical engineering course that teaches how to build mobile robots.	artificial neural network;clock signal;computer engineering;electrical engineering;field-programmable gate array;finite-state machine;fitness function;genetic algorithm;logic gate;mobile robot;obstacle avoidance;pipeline (computing);programmable logic device;robotics;sensor;software release life cycle;state machine replication;wheels	Jesús Savage;Jesus Cruz;Mauricio Matamoros;David A.

3aca1c62f776eda8e2acfb2fde64ed937248b559	model predictive trajectory optimization and tracking for on-road autonomous vehicles		Motion planning for autonomous vehicles requires spatio-temporal motion plans (i.e. state trajectories) to account for dynamic obstacles. This requires a trajectory tracking control process which faithfully tracks planned trajectories. In this paper, a control scheme is presented which first optimizes a planned trajectory and then tracks the optimized trajectory using a feedback-feedforward controller. The feedforward element is calculated in a model predictive manner with a cost function focusing on driving performance. Stability of the error dynamic is then guaranteed by the design of the feedback-feedforward controller. The tracking performance of the control system is tested in a realistic simulated scenario where the control system must track an evasive lateral maneuver. The proposed controller performs well in simulation and can be easily adapted to different dynamic vehicle models. The uniqueness of the solution to the control synthesis eliminates any nondeterminism that could arise with switching between numerical solvers for the underlying mathematical program.

added65f8449a3a181831f3413e1649ba4e89369	semi-autonomous bilateral teleoperation of hexapod robot based on haptic force feedback		With the widespread use of multi-legged robots in various applications, new challenges have arisen in terms of designing their control systems, one of which is posed by the multiple degrees of freedom of the robotic legs. This paper proposes a novel method for the bilateral teleoperation control of a hexapod robot by using a semi-autonomous strategy. In this teleoperation system, the body velocities of the slave robot and the displacements of the master robot are mapped to each other. The angular velocities of the joints of the legs rely on independent planning to achieve a horizontal movement. A controller is designed based on the difference between the expected velocity and the actual velocity of the body, and the difference is fed back to the operator in the form of haptic force. Therefore, the transparency of the control system is guaranteed by increasing the damping compensation both in the master and slave robots. In addition, the stability of the bilateral teleoperation control system of the hexapod robot is guaranteed by passivity theory, and the proposed method is verified by conducting semi-physical simulation experiments.	autonomous robot;bilateral filter;haptic technology;semiconductor industry	Bo You;Jiayu Li;Liang Ding;Jiazhong Xu;Weihua Li;Kaixin Li;Haibo Gao	2018	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-017-0738-8	robot;control theory;control theory;control engineering;operator (computer programming);passivity;hexapod;haptic technology;engineering;teleoperation;control system	Robotics	65.1268324982431	-20.80365729917128	143767

A finite-time generalized H2 measure and its performance criterion are given for the LTV system in this paper, which can be calculated by solving a differential Riccati equation with improved Davison-Maki method.

The proposed method considers the multi-arm manipulator as a system when formulating its kinematic model and obtains a global solution to the system, as opposed to individual arm solutions. For PTP motion control between two arm configurations, a simple trajectory is first assumed by defining joint velocity profiles and maximum allowable task space errors between the two end effectors of the manipulator. The task space errors during the motion are then continuously monitored to take corrective action when necessary to prevent those errors from exceeding the given tolerance limits. The main objective of this method is to reduce the number of inverse kinematics solutions during the real-time control of the two-arm system. The algorithm is illustrated by a numerical example for an eight degree-of-freedom kinematically redundant planar two-arm system.	algorithm;inverse kinematics;numerical analysis;planar (computer graphics);point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);real-time clock;velocity (software development)	Beno Benhabib;G.

In this model, the pursuer’s objective is to herd the evader to a certain location in the Euclidian co-ordinate system over the shortest path. First, the problem is modeled as a constrained optimization problem. Then the optimal trajectory that the pursuer should follow is obtained as the solution for that problem. After that, the derived solution is applied to a non-holonomic realization of the problem.		Samy A. Shedied	2013	Int. J.

For a given pushing motion, an assembly is classified into one of three categories: (P = possible) any force necessary to assure stability of the assembly can be generated by the pushing contacts; (I = impossible) stability of the assembly is impossible; and (U = undecided) pushing forces may or may not be able to stabilize the assembly. This classification is made based on the solution of linear constraint satisfaction problems. If the pushing contacts are frictionless, motions labeled P are guaranteed to preserve the assembly. The results are based on bounds on the possible support friction acting on individual parts in the face of indeterminacy in the distribution of support forces. Experimental results supporting the analysis are given.	assembly language;constraint satisfaction problem;nondeterministic algorithm	Jay Bernheisel;Kevin M.

The configuration of the body is its position and orientation, given by (x, y, θ) coordinates, and the rotations and translations are velocities (ẋ, ẏ, θ̇) that are constant in the frame of the robot. There are no obstacles in the plane. We completely describes the structure of the fastest trajectories, and present a polynomialtime algorithm that, given a set of rotation and translation controls, enumerates a finite set of structures of optimal trajectories. These trajectories are a generalization of t he well-known Dubins and Reeds-Shepp curves, which describe the shortest paths for steered cars in the plane.	algorithm;fastest;pose (computer vision);shortest path problem	Andrei A.

This paper applies it to the on-demand optimal gaits generation of a compass biped robot walking on the level ground. The double generating function method is employed to generate reference optimal gaits and inputs considering the energy consumption by linearizing the compass biped robot. The simulation result shows that the modeling error caused by the linearization is small when the robot walks with a reasonable step length and a appropriate time period. This implies that the optimal states and inputs for the linearized system can be treated as the optimal ones for the original nonlinear system. The biggest advantage of the double generating function method is that it can generate a parametrization of optimal gaits for different boundary conditions and different time periods. Therefore, it is very useful to generate the optimal states and inputs on demand and in real time for the real biped robots.	linear system;mobile robot;nonlinear system;optimal control;simulation	Zhiwei Hao;Kenji Fujimoto;Yoshikazu Hayakawa	2013	2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2013.6696797	control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;motion planning	Robotics	64.15728517748839	-19.633994743724518	145395

The key control objective of the inverted-pendulum-type underactuated systems is not only to maintain the pendulum at the upright position, but also to force the actuator to return its starting point. In order to investigate and realize the properties of pendulum-like systems, the linearized system around its equilibrium point is introduced and analyzed in advance. And then, the nonlinear backstepping controller is successfully developed for balancing target of the pendulum-like systems according to the information from the linear design. In addition, the partial feedback linearization is applied to reduce the complexity of pendulum-like systems in the design process. Finally, some simulation results are given to illustrate the excellent performance of nonlinear backstepping scheme applied to pendulum-like systems, including the cart-pole pendulum and the Furuta pendulum.	double pendulum;inverted pendulum;nonlinear system;simulation;underactuation	Wang-Sheng Man;Jung-Shan Lin	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2010.5611126	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.49894054828826	-13.902924434364023	145486

However, their inherent anisotropy often leads to a significant deviation of the model results from experimental data. Here we propose a computationally efficient isotropic CA with the standard Moore neighborhood. Our model exploits a single postulate: the information transfer in an isotropic medium occurs at constant rate. To fulfill this requirement we introduce in each cell a local counter keeping track of the distance run by the wave from its source. This allows maintaining the wave velocity constant in all possible directions even in the presence of nonconductive local areas (obstacles) with complex spatial geometry. Then we illustrate the model on the problem of real-time building of cognitive maps used for navigation of a mobile robot. The isotropic property of the CA helps obtaining “smooth” trajectories and hence natural robot movement. The accuracy and flexibility of the approach are proved experimentally by driving the robot to a target avoiding collisions with obstacles.	algorithmic efficiency;automata theory;cellular automaton;cognitive map;experiment;mobile robot;moore neighborhood;real-time clock;real-time transcription;robotic mapping;simulation;velocity (software development)	Carlos Calvo;José Antonio Villacorta-Atienza;V.

However, in some practical situations slipping can be useful. The purpose of this work is construct a motion planning strategy for tail-slide vehicles where the rear wheel is slipping. First we develop a dynamic model of a four-wheeled vehicle by combining an extended 2D-model of the Coulomb friction and the nonholonomic rolling constraints. We then show that, compare to model ignoring sliding, the turning radius of the vehicle can be made smaller by using the tail-slide. After revealing the realizability condition of the tail-slide, we construct a motion planning strategy for steady-state cornering by combining the tail-slide and nonholonomic motion maneuvers. The feasibility of the motion planning strategy is tested under simulation.	feed forward (control);mathematical model;mathematical optimization;motion planning;simulation;steady state;tail call;velocity (software development)	Akihiro Morinaga;Mikhail M.

The virtual torque control method is a well-established carrying system control technique, which needs no sensors between the pilot and the human-machine interface, instead, the controller estimates, based on measurements from the exoskeleton suits only, how to move so the pilot feels very little force. However, its main disadvantage lies on solveing the inverse dynamic model that is not easily obtained, which also need an exactly known dynamic model that is not realizable in practice. To overcome this issue, we propose building a virtual prototype model of the lower extremetry exoskeleton in SimMechanics. Using torque input and joint angle output data of the the virtual prototype model, the wavelet neural network is trained to building the inverse dynamics model which take the joint angle data as input and the torque data as output. In cases where some of the parameters of the plant undergo a change or the system is disturbed, poor performance may result. To cope with this drawback, based on Lyapunov stability principle, the rapid terminal sliding-mode robust adaptive controller is designed to control the serious nonlinear lower extreme exoskeleton system, and the convergence performance of the controller is analysed. Theoretical analyse and simulation results test the feasibility and validity of this control method.	artificial neural network;inverse dynamics;lopes (exoskeleton);lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;nonlinear system;prototype;robust control;sensor;simulation;user interface;wavelet	Xiuxia Yang;Hongchao Zhao;Yi Zhang;Xiaowei Liu	2014	JCP	10.4304/jcp.9.1.202-208	simulation;control theory	Robotics	67.47542213116483	-12.510080864249183	145852

This method computes both object and finger trajectories as well as the finger relocation sequence. Its specificity is to use a special structuring of the research space that allows to search for paths directly in the particular subspace GSn which is the subspace of all the grasps that can be achieved with n grasping fingers. The solving of the dexterous manipulation planning problem is based upon the exploration of this subspace. The proposed approach captures the connectivity of GSn in a graph structure. The answer of the manipulation planning query is then given by searching a path in the computed graph. Simulation experiments were conducted for different dexterous manipulation task examples to validate the proposed method.	experiment;hippi;mathematical optimization;motion planning;plan;relocation (computing);robot;sensitivity and specificity;simulation	Jean-Philippe Saut;Anis Sahbani;Sahar El-Khoury;Véronique Perdereau	2007	2007 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2007.4399090	computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;motion planning;statistics	Robotics	54.12088134055277	-22.969499614164377	145923

This is exponental in the number of degrees of freedom of the robot. It is preferable to consider only certain key aspects of each problem, and to generate a plan based only on these aspects. This approach possesses two advantages: (1) it permits reuse of plans in similar situations, which reduces (or even eliminates) the cost of searching among alternative maneuvers. and (2) it reduces the number of aspects of the situation that must be sensed by the system, which reduces the sensory cost. In this paper, it is shown how to classify path planning problems according to their algebraic structure. A technique is given that is applicable to robots whose actions are reversible. Each class of problems is characterized by a particular set of maneuvers that solves all problems in the class.	motion planning	D.

Two sagittal-plane models, one with and one without torso compliance, are developed in a template setting. The models feature non-trivial leg mass, and are coupled with a simple leg recirculation controller to generate bounding motions. Despite their simplicity, the proposed models are sufficiently expressive to capture the energetics of bounding motions and to assess the contribution of torso flexibility to gait efficiency measured by the cost of transport. Comparisons reveal that torso compliance promotes locomotion performance by reducing energy consumption only at speeds that are sufficiently high.	robot locomotion	Qu Cao;Ioannis Poulakakis	2014	2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2014.6943259	simulation;torso;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;computational model;statistics	Robotics	67.19410465169469	-19.580515431754936	146077

We propose a control-aware planner based on the paradigm of tight coupling between planning and control. Such paradigm is especially useful in aerial manipulation, where the separation between planning and control is not advisable. The proposed sampling based motion planner uses a controller composed of a second-order inverse kinematics algorithm and a dynamic tracker, as a local planner, thus allowing a more natural consideration of the closed-loop system dynamics. For task-constrained motions, this method let us to sample directly in the reduced and more relevant task space, predict the behavior of the controller avoiding motions that bring to singularities or large tracking errors, and guarantee the correct execution of the maneuver. The method is tested in simulation for a multidirectional-thrust vehicle endowed with a 2-DoF manipulator. The proposed approach is very general, and could be applied to ground and underwater robotic systems to perform manipulation or inspection tasks.

In order to achieve variable speed running, a set of desired gaits (each at a di®erent speed) is designed with the controlled Lagrangian method for the under-actuated robot.

At last a transitional control law is developed for smooth transitions between di®erent running gaits.

The stabilization of the desired equilibrium is obtained via energy shaping and damping injection. The DoD is an underactuated mechanical system composed of two disks arranged one on top of the other. The top disk, which we call the object, is free to roll without slipping on the lower disk, which we call the hand. The hand is actuated by a controlled torque, while the object is unactuated. The control objective is to balance the object at the upright position and drive the hand to a desired angle. We design an energy shaping controller without solving the partial differential equations, which rise from the matching equation. We assess the performance of the controller by both simulations and experiment results, which also verify the practical applicability of the design approach.	computer simulation;control theory;controller (computing);experiment;noise shaping;ph (complexity);periodic boundary conditions	Alejandro Donaire;Fabio Ruggiero;Luca Rosario Buonocore;Vincenzo Lippiello;Bruno Siciliano	2017	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2016.2637719	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.67725444006817	-14.236617957250052	147235

The proposed laws are obtained as state-feedback solutions of linear quadratic optimal control problems to minimize the time varying energy cost with terminal constraints on position and velocity. Since the proposed laws are able to control the flight time, they are possible to make all vehicles join the formation concurrently at a specified time. A method to compensate the acceleration or maneuver of the formation leader is included in the guidance laws. And an inter-vehicle collision avoidance scheme is also considered. The performance of the guidance laws is tested via various numerical simulations.	unmanned aerial vehicle	Chang-Kyung Ryoo;Yoon-Hwan Kim;Min-Jea Tahk	2006	Int. J.

The navigation in un­structured environments, such as surgical operations, presents a potential application of the use of such robots. In this paper, a new formulation of a continuum robot forward kinematics is presented firstly. In a second step, an analytical inverse kinematics of the continuum robot is developed. It computes the continuum robot bellows length as a function of the robot end-tool position and orientation in the task space. Then a resolution of the inverse kinematics is shown based on the use of interval analysis. This technique has the advantage of dealing with uncertainties that may occur in the system modeling, parameter identification and could be used as well for robot control. System redundancies when computing the inverse kinematics are solved by a branch and bound based algorithm that minimizes a given quadratic criterion.	algorithm;apache continuum;branch and bound;computation;computer simulation;forward kinematics;interval arithmetic;inverse kinematics;mathematical optimization;robot control;robot end effector;systems modeling;triune continuum paradigm	Sohail Iqbal	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2009.5420395	control engineering;monte carlo localization;kinematics;cartesian coordinate robot;simulation;continuum mechanics;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;arm solution;inverse kinematics;control theory;robot control;branch and bound;robot kinematics;robot calibration	Robotics	63.43616624077862	-21.523262016171294	147597

The control is based on gain-scheduled proportional integral derivatives (PIDs) (known as NPID in related literature) and adaptive approximation of uncertainties. NPID and adaptive approximation are combined in a constructive way to inherit advantages and overcome limitations of the single methods. In particular, NPID is used to stabilize the nominal plant, and its gains are scheduled so as to minimize the effects of friction and other uncertainties. Adaptive approximation is used to compensate further effects of nonlinearities and obtain a better overall tracking accuracy.

This methodology consists of two approaches. 1) A previous robot behavior control technique that utilizes external interaction force among robots is improved. This enables robots to reduce velocity not only for the jam preceding them, but also for the decelerating robot immediately in front. 2) An environmental rule in connection with the interaction force is designed and provided on congested lanes where robots move slowly. Thus, amplified interaction force affects the robots, and they move more slowly in the congested lanes. The improved interaction force and environmental rule are implemented in simulation experiments and compared to the previous robot behavior control technique and an adaptive cruise control (ACC) that has been proposed for autonomous vehicles. The interaction force and environmental rule can be implemented in the ACC; then, the resulting ACC improvement is discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the usage of the improved interaction force and environmental rule for multi-robot coordination in congested systems with bottlenecks is shown.	autonomous robot;bottleneck (software);experiment;jam;mobile robot;simulation;velocity (software development)	Satoshi Hoshino	2011	2011 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2011.6094438	damping;control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;shock absorber;control theory;force;robot kinematics	Robotics	63.07593147546773	-16.488445901707692	147774

Before departure, the speed profile for an entire route is optimized in a distance domain by using characteristics of the drivetrain and road conditions. Then, while driving, the speed at only the next location is controlled to follow the optimal speed profile and adapt it for traffic conditions, which allows for real-time adaptation, maintaining optimal driving in the long term. To localize the change of the optimal speed profile due to traffic conditions, models for fuel rate of a conventional vehicle and vehicle propulsion systems were formulated in a distance domain, and a distance-based optimal speed profile was generated. The proposed eco-driving scheme is optimized by the quadratic programming method, and its validity is tested by simulation.	long short-term memory;mathematical optimization;program optimization;quadratic programming;real-time locating system;simulation	Hansang Lim;Wencong Su;Chunting Chris Mi	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2574643	simulation;gear;engineering;automotive engineering;transport engineering;torque	Vision	55.91397644120812	-12.360408022257884	147866

A tracking controller is proposed such that it combines the inverse dynamics control technique and an adaptive robust PID control strategy to preserve robustness to both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties. A SPR-Lypunov stability analysis demonstrates that tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and exponentially converge to a small ball containing the origin. The proposed inverse dynamics tracking controller is successfully applied to a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot (WMR) and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

A quasi-tracking variable is introduced, and a terminal sliding mode controller is developed to achieve finite-time convergence of the quasi-tracking variable to a properly pre-defined trajectory. This subsequently provides a set of boundary conditions to explicitly solve the corresponding boundary-value problem and prove finite-time regulation. End-point tracking control is also investigated. It is shown that the error between the end point of the beam and the pre-defined trajectory, though does not decay to zero, is always bounded by a small time-varying bound. A method to reduce the error bound is also given. The approach does not invoke any model truncation procedure, hence the problem of observation/control spillovers, which exists in the conventional truncated-modelbased controller design methods, is essentially avoided. Satisfactory simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach. ( 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1afa4720b4163ad7a210b58a64d2dd6ac2bdf847	analysis of cooperative driving strategies for nonsignalized intersections	ad hoc negotiation;cooperative driving;non-signalized intersection;planning	In this paper, we study the difference between two major strategies of cooperative driving at nonsignalized intersections: namely the “ad hoc negotiation-based” strategy and the “planning-based” strategy. The fundamental divide of these two strategies lies in how to determine the passing order of vehicles at intersections. The “ad hoc negotiation-based” strategy makes vehicles roughly follow first-come-first-served order but allows some adjustments. This leads to a local optimal solution in many situations. The “planning-based” strategy aims to find a global optimal passing order of vehicles. However, constrained by the planning complexity and time requirement, we often stop at a local optimal solution, too. We carry out a series of simulations to compare the solutions found by two strategies, under different traffic scenarios. Results indicate the performance of a strategy mainly depends on the passing order of vehicles that it finds. Although there exist several trajectory planning algorithms associating with the solving process of passing orders, their differences are negligible. Moreover, if the traffic demand is very low, the performance difference between two strategies is small. When the traffic demand becomes high, the “planning-based” strategy yields significantly better performance since it finds better passing orders. These findings are important to cooperative driving study.	algorithm;existential quantification;hoc (programming language);left 4 dead 2;simulation	Yue Meng;Li Li;Fei-Yue Wang;Keqiang Li;Zhiheng Li	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2780269	computer network;automation;computer science;trajectory;distributed computing	Robotics	55.202707242969694	-21.224212314677022	148411

This system realizes omni-directional motion on flat floor using special wheels and passes over non-flat ground in forward or backward direction using the passive suspension mechanism. In order to realize the high mobile performance during step climbing, it is required to reduce wheel slippage for maximizing wheel traction. This paper proposes a new plural wheel control method based on wheel slip estimation. Our key idea is estimation of wheel slippage comparing with the loads and rotation velocities of all actuated wheels, and using this result for wheel control of the vehicle for reducing wheel slippage. The controller can adjust control tractions of plural wheels when the wheel begins to slip and can improve the mobile performance of the vehicle.

The disturbances considered here include not only internal disturbances caused by model mismatches, but also external disturbances. The observer is employed to estimate the disturbances of the closed-loop system, and the estimation is used for feedforward compensation design to reject disturbances.

However, in the real world the ground is rarely completely flat. More research on locomotion on less structured surfaces is needed. In this study, we investigated a control design method that searches for suitable control and trajectory parameters using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Many sets of parameters are generated through the search and the best set is selected based on a robustness measure developed from the linearized Poincaré map. This technique reduces tedious analysis and is favorably applicable to the design for locomotion on unstructured surfaces, for which analytical approaches are less appropriate. Simulations have been performed. Control parameters for different slopes were obtained and stored in a database. During the control, the control parameters suitable for the current surface slope were retrieved and the trajectory for a level surface was modified according to the surface slope. The control parameters changed values according to the terrain. Simulation results were promising.	robot locomotion	M.-Y. Cheng;C.-S.

This approach, oblique coordinate control, decouples tasks. Even though a system is large, they can be designed by a combination of small tasks. Therefore, tasks can be regarded as reusable components. In this study, micro-macro bilateral control is achieved as a complicated task. Small objects can be manipulated as large objects in micro-macro bilateral control. However, ideal micro-macro bilateral controllers are usually derived only for single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) systems. Then, we propose a micro-macro bilateral controller for multi-DOF on the basis of oblique coordinate control. To obtain multi-DOF bilateral control, we first derive control goals as kinematic relations.

6ed0382cb955d78970a3d4a9800656f9753c1b75	waiter robot application: balance control for transporting objects		Dynamic balance control for humanoid robots encounters difficulties such as stability, speed, and smoothness. In most of the previous studies, joints act as controller of the Center of Mass (CoM)supported using a simplified mathematical model. Then, the stability of the motion is guaranteed using the Zero Moment Point (ZMP)stability criterion. In this video, a humanoid robot [1] will carry a tray secured to the wrist and the objects to be transported will be placed on the tray. This condition implies that the object is not grasped and therefore, the robot arm will be the only point of support of the object through the tray. Thus, the manipulation control system must be able to detect the stability of the object and act according to the different perturbations applied to it. A 3D balance control system for non-grasping tasks is presented and it is based on the ZMP criterion and 3D inverted pendulum equations. The perception system required is based on the use of Force-Torque sensors [2], computer vision [3], and their integration. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is being investigated with the humanoid robot TEO.

122502c6d6da861c21d6307df0d79d73b30c16c4	a predictive path-following approach for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles in presence of wind disturbances		In this paper we address the path-following problem for fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in presence of wind disturbances. Given a desired path with a specified airspeed profile assigned on it, the goal is to follow the desired maneuver while minimizing the control effort. We propose a predictive path following control scheme based on trajectory optimization techniques, to compute feasible UAV trajectories, combined with a sample-data Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach, to handle the wind field. By explicitly addressing the wind field, the UAV exploits the surrounding environment thus extending its capabilities in executing the desired maneuver. We provide numerical computations based on straight line and circular paths under various wind conditions. The computations allow us to highlight the benefits of the proposed control scheme.	aerial photography;unmanned aerial vehicle	Alessandro Rucco;Antonio Pedro Aguiar;Fernando M.

Parameter perturbations in plant mechanism and/or actuator generally deteriorate the positioning performance. In order to realize the desired positioning performance with robust property against the perturbations, the mode-switching control with the IVC is one of the promising approaches, where the timing of the mode switching and the time interval of the IVC critically affect the compensation performance. However, the shortening in the IVC operation interval causes an increase in the input amplitude, which leads to deterioration of the positioning performance due to saturation in control input. In this paper, therefore, a split IVC based on input-shaping techniques is applied to prevent the input amplitude from being saturated and to provide adaptiveness and robustness against unknown parameter perturbations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified by experiments using a prototype of galvanoscanners.	experiment;input shaping;mechatronics;noise shaping;precise point positioning;prototype	Yoshihiro Maeda;Masatake Wada;Makoto Iwasaki;Hiromu Hirai	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2012.2188263	control engineering;electronic engineering;mechatronics;linear matrix inequality;gain;engineering;control theory;initial value problem;actuator	Robotics	67.71152911261622	-10.289117882428926	149136
e889eb76c6789a6d8178c96a8614a789c3710385	scottyactivity: mixed discrete-continuous planning with convex optimization		The state of the art practice in robotics planning is to script behaviors manually, where each behavior is typically generated using trajectory optimization. However, in order for robots to be able to act robustly and adapt to novel situations, they need to plan these activity sequences autonomously. Since the conditions and effects of these behaviors are tightly coupled through time, state and control variables, many problems require that the tasks of activity planning and trajectory optimization are considered together. There are two key issues underlying effective hybrid activity and trajectory planning: the sufficiently accurate modeling of robot dynamics and the capability of planning over long horizons. Hybrid activity and trajectory planners that employ mixed integer programming within a discrete time formulation are able to accurately model complex dynamics for robot vehicles, but are often restricted to relatively short horizons. On the other hand, current hybrid activity planners that employ continuous time formulations can handle longer horizons but they only allow actions to have continuous effects with constant rate of change, and restrict the allowed state constraints to linear inequalities. This is insufficient for many robotic applications and it greatly limits the expressivity of the problems that these approaches can solve. In this work we present the ScottyActivity planner, that is able to generate practical hybrid activity and motion plans over long horizons by employing recent methods in convex optimization combined with methods for planning with relaxed plan graphs and heuristic forward search. Unlike other continuous time planners, ScottyActivity can solve a broad class of robotic planning problems by supporting convex quadratic constraints on state variables and control variables that are jointly constrained and that affect multiple state variables simultaneously. In order to support planning over long horizons, ScottyActivity does not resort to time, state or control variable discretization. While straightforward formulations of consistency checks are not convex and do not scale, we present an efficient convex formulation, in the form of a Second Order Cone Program (SOCP), that is very fast to solve. We also introduce several new realistic domains that demonstrate the capabilities and scalability of our approach, and their simplified linear versions, that we use to compare with other state of the art planners. This work demonstrates the power of integrating advanced convex optimization techniques with discrete search methods and paves the way for extensions dealing with non-convex disjoint constraints, such as obstacle avoidance. c ©2018 AI Access Foundation.

a1de65dda569f6252af278cfccd6a66c260adfda	architecture for testing learning-based autonomous vehicle control design		This paper presents the architecture for the testing of autonomous vehicle controllers designed using machine learning. A localization system feeds measurement data into a ground station. The ground station processes this data and provides the position of the vehicle to the controller, which has been tuned offline via machine learning. Control inputs are then generated and provided to the vehicle in order to accomplish the desired mission. The performance of the learned controller is compared to a nominal case. During the offline tuning process, a vehicle model is used to simulate the actual vehicle. Once tuning is complete, the parameters are used to control a real vehicle in order to accomplish the desired mission. The proposed architecture was tested by tuning a model predictive controller to guide a differential drive robot to a series of waypoints using a Reinforced Learning technique known as Learning Automata. The controller was then tested online with a similar but different problem on a real differential drive robot. The results showed that after tuning, the vehicle performed significantly better. This demonstrated that offline learning techniques can be used to optimally select controller parameters.	automaton;autonomous robot;learning automata;machine learning;offline learning;online and offline;simulation	Michael Kogan;Peter T.

The widely used formulation of the SLAM problem has been the augmented state approach in an estimation theoretic framework. Although, many related issues of SLAM such as computational complexity, loop closing and data association have received much attention, the observability issue has largely remained ignored. System observability is an important aspect in any state estimation problem. Observability analysis provides for understanding of the fundamental limits of the solution obtainable, regardless of process and measurement noises. The standard world-centric SLAM formulation is a highly non-linear system. Thus the direct use of linear observability tools and criteria in the analysis of its observability yields incorrect and inconsistent results. In this paper an appropriate method of analysis of the observability of nonlinear systems is applied to investigate the properties of the standard SLAM formulation. Contrary to popular belief, it is shown through theoretical analysis that the standard 2D planar world-centric SLAM formulation involving odometry inputs for robot speed and heading, and range/bearing measurements to features in the environment is unobservable. It is also shown that for the system to be observable, it requires at least two absolutely known feature point positions, thus questioning the very meaning implied by SLAM.

It has been derived in the previous work that this problem can be reduced to computing the intersection of the ray originating from the origin along the required wrench with the boundary of the grasp wrench set. Noticing that the grasp wrench set is fixed once contact positions are determined, we propose an algorithm to precompute a hierarchy of polytopes in the grasp wrench set and a list of facets from the interior of the grasp wrench set to its boundary. Then, the ray’s intersection can be quickly found by searching the list of facets and optimal contact forces can be computed in real time. Numerical examples show that the online computation of the proposed approach is one order of magnitude faster than the latest algorithm to compute the ray’s intersection and two orders of magnitude faster than general-purpose optimization algorithms. This approach to contact force distribution is an iterative solution that can run until reaching a desired accuracy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The system is modeled by a non-deterministic hybrid system in which transitions represent the discrete control actions, mode invariants the constraints and the transition relation encodes sequencing requirements. The control algorithm examines at runtime the possible traces into the future by determining at which time point to switch to which mode. Based on these predictions the next control move is performed. We demonstrate our approach by controlling a car-like robot though a maze without any pre-runtime path planing.	algorithm;control function (econometrics);game controller;hybrid system;planning;requirement;robot;run time (program lifecycle phase);tracing (software)	Martin von Mohrenschildt	2005			robot control	Robotics	60.59660492929508	-18.59877972998718	149715

This interesting point encourages us to exploit its flying natural dynamics so as to control the flying robots on energy efficient and robust gaits. In doing so, we study the albatross dynamic soaring from analytical and biological perspectives and realize that to generate the dynamic soaring instead of trajectory control, the mechanical energy should be regulated. Accordingly, the control objective is set to mechanical energy regulation, and the bank angle and lift coefficient are computed to satisfy this objective. The presented method is simulated on a standard albatross model and generates two different types of dynamic soaring; O-shaped and a-shaped patterns. In addition, by means of simulations, it is investigated that the presented method is robust in face of variations in initial conditions and unexpected disturbances in the environment's model; i.e., they cannot disturb the stability and cyclic behavior of the system. Moreover, the simulation results are compared with pieces of natural evidence from albatross and interesting similarities are observed.

e11c3fd0fe01920b8e5cff466ff393ece0b6f8c0	real-time obstacles avoidance for vehicles in the urban grand challenge	real time;obstacle avoidance	In this paper, the real-time trajectory planning problem is considered for vehicles in the urban grand challenge. Typically, reference paths generated by a high level path planner are not feasible for vehicles and need improvement. In addition, moving obstacles in the environment are generally not known apriori, which also requires the paths to be able to be replanned in real-time. The proposed method presents three novel features to satisfy those requirements. First, all the paths satisfying boundary conditions and the vehicle’s kinematic constraints are parameterized in terms of polynomials of sufficient order. Then, a collisionfree criterion is developed for avoiding “hard” and “soft” obstacles detected. In the third step, a L2-norm performance index is introduced to find the best path among the class of collisionfree paths. The performance index is chosen such that a path analogous to the shortest path can be analytically solved. The proposed method provides a systematic and analytical solution to find the feasible path while addressing obstacle avoidance and guaranteeing performance.

A technique is developed which can, in real time, calculate the existence of a safe path for navigating a robotic manipulator arm between obstacles without collision and accurately generating an efficient path between them. A map of the environment is created in the control servo domain using existing environment data where each dimension of the map space represents one of the degrees of freedom of the manipulator. The map is a multi-dimensional space that represents the control ranges of the manipulator and which contains obstacles to be avoided. The start and desired locations of the arm end effector can be converted into this space so that a path can be generated between them. The space is split into a graph of nodes, and a Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm is used to generate a safe trajectory.

The manipulators are designed to tolerate “free swinging” prismatic actuator faults in which the failed actuator moves freely but cannot exert any force. For these “free swinging” failures, this paper introduces a new, stricter concept of fault tolerance termed “Robust Fault Tolerance” (RFT). This new concept of fault tolerance is stronger than earlier approaches, yet this paper finds a seven parameter class of machines that are RFT. To illustrate the power of this new approach, the algorithm is used to redesign a manipulator currently aboard the International Space Station to make it decoupled and RFT while reducing the actuator size by more than a factor of two.	algorithm;coupling (computer programming);fault tolerance;image scaling;nominal type system;optimal design;request for tender	John E.

The partial feedback linearization control synthesized by the differential geometric structure algorithm is an input-output decoupling and linearization feedback law capable of precise rigid-body-motion-based trajectory tracking, but the zero dynamics of the unobservable nonlinear elastic subsystem remains unstable. In order to actively suppress the elastic vibrations, it is necessary to sacrifice the perfect rigid-body-motion-based tracking capability somewhat by introducing a robust stabilization control in the vicinity of the desired trajectory.

Firstly, an interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller designed for the kinematic model of the WMR is introduced, and then the IT2-FTSMDC is developed for the dynamic model of the WMR, which is a combination of the interval type-2 fuzzy logic control (IT2-FLC) and the terminal sliding-mode dynamic control (TSMDC). The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated via computer simulations. The simulation results show that the tracking performance of the IT2-FTSMDC is better than that of the FTSMDC.	american and british english spelling differences;computer simulation;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;logic control;mathematical model;mobile robot	Ming-Ying Hsiao;Shun-Hung Tsai;Tzuu-Hseng S.

An important part of this is the ability to choose between different gaits in order to travel optimally at a certain speed or to robustly deal with unanticipated perturbations. In this paper, we present a control framework for a quadrupedal robot that is capable of locomoting using several gaits. We demonstrate the flexibility of the algorithm by performing experiments on StarlETH, a recently-developed quadrupedal robot. We implement controllers for a static walk, a walking trot, and a running trot, and show that smooth transitions between them can be performed. Using this control strategy, StarlETH is able to trot unassisted in 3D space with speeds of up to 0.7m/s, it can dynamically navigate over unperceived 5-cm high obstacles and it can recover from significant external pushes.	algorithm;control system;control theory;experiment;motion controller;robot;simulation	Christian Gehring;Stelian Coros;Marco Hutter;Michael Blösch;Mark A.

The proposed scheme utilizes fractional-order integration in the parameter tuning stage. The controller parameters are tuned such that the system under control is driven toward the sliding regime in the traditional sense. After a comparison with the classical integer-order counterpart, it is seen that the control system with the proposed adaptation scheme displays better tracking performance, and a very high degree of robustness and insensitivity to disturbances are observed. The claims are justified through some simulations utilizing the dynamic model of a 2-DOF direct-drive robot arm. Overall, the contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the response of the system under control is significantly better for the fractional-order integration exploited in the parameter adaptation stage than that for the classical integer-order integration.	arm architecture;acclimatization;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;addresses (publication format);cns disorder;controllers;deny (action);differintegral;fuzzy control system;inference engine;integer (number);mathematical model;neuro-fuzzy;numerous;population parameter;rejection sampling;robotic arm;simulation;triple modular redundancy	Mehmet Önder Efe	2008	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2008.928227	adaptive control;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.36534962498187	-10.338833310317263	150739

The dynamic model is obtained using the Euler-Lagrange formulation considering the aerodynamic forces and torques exerted on the horizontal and vertical stabilizers, and fuselage. For control design purposes, the equations of motion are linearized around different operation points to cover a large range of forward velocity. Based on these linearized dynamic models, a mixed H2/H∞ robust controller is designed for each operation point. Therefore, an adaptive mixing scheme is used to perform an on-line smooth gain-scheduling between them. Simulation results show the control strategy efficiency when the UAV is designated to have a forward acceleration and perform a circular trajectory subject to a wind disturbance.	autonomy;control theory;euler;euler–lagrange equation;experiment;mathematical model;online and offline;r.o.t.o.r.;scheduling (computing);simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle;velocity (software development)	Daniel Neri Cardoso;Guilherme V.

A novel joint-velocity decomposition scheme that complements and avoids some drawbacks of a previous study based on the Singularity-Consistent method is introduced. As a result, it becomes possible to follow almost any singular path in workspace, including paths passing through bifurcations (nondegenerate singular paths). Further on, the algorithmic singularity introduced in the previous study (the “inner obstacle”) disappears in the new formulation. The problem of wrist singularity is also addressed and solved via a proper self motion component. Only a limited subset of singular paths cannot be handled with the method: those that pass through the double elbow-wrist singularity (an isolated point at the workspace boundary). The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via numerical simulations.	computer simulation;global optimization;inverse kinematics;numerical analysis;smartwatch;the singularity;velocity (software development);workspace	Shota Taki;Dragomir N.

There is always a delay between the decision to commit and the moment of actual launch or recovery. This paper presents an artificial neural network trained using singular value decomposition methods, genetic algorithms and conjugate gradient methods for the real time prediction of ship motions. These predictions assist in determining the best moment of commitment to launch, or recovery. Predictions generated using these algorithms allow improvements in safety, by facilitating deployment and recovery of air vehicles commonly used on ship platforms.  It is shown that the artificial neural network produces excellent predictions and is able to predict the ship motion satisfactorily for up to 7 seconds.	autonomous robot	Ameer A. Khan;Kaye E.

The proposed obstacle avoidance approach is based on changing the curvature in case of Pythagorean Hodograph curves. However this may result in an increase in the length of the path. Furthermore in some cases obstacle avoidance by changing the curvature of the path may result not only in an increase in path length but also to a tremendous increase in bending energy. An increase in bending energy of a path as a result of curvature change above certain limit makes the path very difficult or impossible to fly.	bézier curve;motion planning;obstacle avoidance;quintic function;resultant	M.

The significant task of controller design is to determine optimized control gains in a short period of time. With this purpose in mind, a combination of the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm and the evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm is introduced in this article. The benefit of this integration algorithm is the creation of new best-parameters for control design schemes. The proposed controller designs are then demonstrated to have the best performance for nonlinear micro air vehicle models.	algorithm;american and british english spelling differences;controllers;evolutionary programming;expectation propagation;ise;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;pid;particle swarm optimization;performance;settling time;yaws;benefit	Huu-Khoa Tran;Juing-Shian Chiou	2016		10.3390/mi7090168	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	60.268775744892274	-11.778690564167599	151343

These simplifications are based on the structure of manipulator dynamics, on simplifications that arise from common manipulator geometries, and from other heuristic simplification rules. This algorithm has been implemented in a lisp-based program, EMDEG (Efficient Manipulator Dynamic Equation Generator). The development of the algorithm, the derivation of simplification rules, and some implementation aspects are discussed; and an example is presented.	algorithm;time-scale calculus	Joel W.

The approach follows the idea of shaping the link side dynamics such that the closed loop dynamics follows a given reference trajectory while injecting additional damping for improving vibration suppression. The modification of the apparent link side dynamics is amended by a desired dynamics on the motor side. In contrast to classical feedback linearization the design aims at only a minimal modification of the dynamics, both for the link side and the motor side. The time-varying closed loop dynamics is shown to be globally, uniformly stable. The effectiveness of the resulting feedback control law was evaluated by simulations as well as experiments on a highly nonlinear and highly compliant robot arm.	closed-loop transfer function;experiment;feedback;noise shaping;nonlinear system;optimal control;robot;robotic arm;simulation;zero suppression	Manuel Keppler;Dominic Lakatos;Christian Ott;Alin Albu-Schäffer	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798482	damping;control engineering;dynamics;simulation;engineering;control theory;elasticity;robot kinematics;actuator	Robotics	67.30313456254514	-17.414420644704098	151600

A new finite-time disturbance observer is incorporated into the proposed finite-time tracking control (FTTC) structure that facilitates faster convergence and better robustness to disturbances. Hence, in the presence of unknown disturbances, the ARFTTC can cause tracking error to converge to zero in a finite time. Simulation studies and comprehensive comparisons with conventional backstepping technique demonstrate remarkable performance and superiority of the ARFTTC in terms of both tracking accuracy and robustness.	converge;emoticon;fiber to the x;performance;scott continuity;settling time;simulation;steady state	Ning Wang;Chunjiang Qian;Jing-Chao Sun;Yancheng Liu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2015.2496585	control engineering;simulation;uncertainty;tracking system;engineering;trajectory;control theory;mathematics;physics;statistics;robustness	Robotics	66.05544922860753	-11.583841823472344	151714

Despite recent advances, the understanding, prediction and control of biped balance in realistic dynamical situations remain an unsolved problem and the subject of much research in robotics and biomechanics. Here we study the fundamental mechanics of the rotational stability of multi-body systems with the goal of identifying a general stability criterion. Our research focuses on H/sub G/, the rate of change of centroidal angular momentum of a robot, as the physical quantity containing its stability information. We propose three control strategies using H/sub G/ that can be used for stability recapture of biped robots. For free walk on horizontal ground, a derived criterion refers to a point on the foot/ground surface of a robot where the total ground reaction force would have to act such that H/sub G/=0. This new criterion generalizes earlier concepts such as GCoM, CoP, ZMP, and FRI point, and extends their applicability.	angularjs;balance theory;biological system;c object processor;dynamical system;robot;robotics;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;zero moment point	Ambarish Goswami;Vinutha Kallem	2004	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2004.

However, some models have shown superior performances to others that generate a large computational cost. This is the case of recurrent neural networks, which due to the temporal relationship existing allows satisfactory answers. Furthermore, training used by traditional algorithms, require a relatively high convergence time for some applications, especially those that are on-line. Given this problematic, this paper suggests use Echo State Networks (ESN) to perform such tasks. Additionally, results are presented for two sets of predefined tests, which were used to validate control behavior of trajectories in a manipulator embedded in a mobile platform. The results presented are related to the planar control of the manipulator in a closed loop.	arm architecture	Cesar H. Valencia;Marley M. B. R.

Unlike existing works based on the assumption that neural network models are free of external disturbances, four common forms of time-varying disturbances suppressed by the proposed RZND model are investigated in this paper. In addition, theoretical analyses on the antidisturbance performance are presented in detail to prove the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed RZND model with time-varying disturbances suppressed for solving the inverse kinematics problem of mobile robot manipulators. That is, the RZND model converges toward the exact solution of the inverse kinematics problem of mobile robot manipulators with bounded or zero-oriented steady-state position error. Moreover, simulation studies and comprehensive comparisons with existing neural network models, e.g., the conventional Zhang neural network model and the gradient-based recurrent neural network model, together with extensive tests with four common forms of time-varying disturbances substantiate the efficacy, robustness, and superiority of the proposed RZND approach as well as its time-varying disturbances suppression model for solving the inverse kinematics problem of mobile robot manipulators.	arabic numeral 0;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia;converge;gradient;inverse kinematics;mobile manipulator;mobile robot;network model;neural network simulation;neural tube defects;recurrent neural network;steady state;zero suppression	Dechao Chen;Yunong Zhang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2764529	artificial intelligence;robustness (computer science);machine learning;simulation;artificial neural network;mobile robot;bounded function;control theory;kinematics;inverse kinematics;recurrent neural network;computer science;position error	Robotics	63.04425032865229	-10.412372993023196	151918

This paper demonstrates the implementation of two model-based parameter estimation algorithms, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), which are capable of working with a four degree of freedom, nonlinear vehicle model. While the EKF requires analytical linearization of the vehicle model at each step, the UKF approximates the parameter distribution with discrete sigma points and propagates them through the original nonlinear system. Simulation of a double lane change in CarSim illustrates the superior performance of the UKF for vehicle inertial parameter identification.	algorithm;approximation;estimation theory;extended kalman filter;nonlinear system;obstacle avoidance;simulation;yaws	Sanghyun Hong;Tory Smith;Francesco Borrelli;J.

The consensus algorithm is employed to enable the positions and velocities of sensor nodes to quickly track the position and velocity of a virtual leader in finite time. The event-triggered rule is used to reduce the updating frequency of controllers in order to save the computational resources of sensor nodes. Some stability conditions are derived for mobile sensor networks with the proposed control scheme under both a fixed communication topology and a switching communication topology. Finally, simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme for the problem of environmental monitoring.	anatomy, regional;chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;computational resource;consensus dynamics;execution;node - plant part;sensor node;simulation;velocity (software development)	Qiang Lu;Qing-Long Han;Botao Zhang;Dongliang Liu;Shirong Liu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2016.2601110	computer science;distributed computing;mobile wireless sensor network;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	57.267728820133954	-22.41414213654933	152173
e5ac6f24ec90a85c3e357bb778d9cafebaa51c02	kullback leibler control approach to rubber band manipulation		In this paper, we study robot manipulation of rubber bands and focus on a task where a robot winds a rubber band around objects since such a task is very common in daily life. Rubber bands are highly flexible and deformable objects whose shape is changed by a force; thus, it is not easy for a robot to autonomously operate such tasks with a rubber band due to the difficulties of accurate shape modeling and shape measurement. A key insight for overcoming these difficulties is based on observing human skills; we generally pull and stretch a rubber band by applying certain force. The following are the potential benefits of stretching and pulling a rubber band: 1) reduction of the shape diversity and 2) increased friction generated on the contact points for strengthening the contact with the object. In this paper, we propose a manipulation planning method for winding rubber bands around objects that maintains the rubber band that is being stretched during the manipulation to avoid shape modeling and shape measurement difficulties. Such a method is formulated by a stochastic optimal control problem called Kullback-Leibler control. Real-world experiments were conducted with a dual-arm Baxter robot to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our robot manipulated a rubber band and wound around an object with different numbers of windings and magnitudes of applied forces by changing the parameters in the cost function.	baxter (robot);experiment;kullback–leibler divergence;loss function;optimal control;robot	Masaki Murase;Kimitoshi Yamazaki;Takamitsu Matsubara	2017	2017 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII)	10.1109/SII.2017.8279300	task analysis;control engineering;kullback–leibler divergence;natural rubber;engineering;rubber band;stochastic control;hidden markov model	Robotics	62.23856092467349	-23.404574410582857	152184

689cc10ce7f59a446a1307246435569cc2ac6e9b	switched modeling and task-priority motion planning of wheeled mobile robots subject to slipping		This study is devoted to the modelling and control of Wheeled Mobile Robots moving with longitudinal and lateral slips of all wheels. Due to wheel slippage we have to deal with systems with changing dynamics. Wheeled Mobile Robots can be thus modeled as switched systems with both autonomous switches (due to wheel slippage) and smooth controls (due to control algorithm). It is assumed that the slipping is counteracted by the slip reaction forces acting at contact points of the wheels with the ground. A model of these reaction forces, borrowed from the theory of automotive systems, has been adopted and included into the Lagrangian dynamic equations of the robot. A framework for designing motion planning schemes devoid of chattering effects for systems with changing dynamics is presented. A task–priority motion planning problem for wheeled mobile robots subject to slipping is addressed and solved by means of Jacobian motion planning algorithm based on the Endogenous Configuration Space Approach. Performance of the algorithm is presented in simulations of the Pioneer 2DX mobile platform. The robot dynamics equations are derived and 4 variants of motion are distinguished. The motion planning problem is composed of two sub-tasks: robot has to reach a desired point in the task space (proper motion planning) and the motion should minimize either the control energy expendinture or the wheel slippage. Performance of the motion planning algorithm is illustrated by a sort of the parking maneuver problem.	motion planning;robot	Katarzyna Zadarnowska	2017	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-016-0397-1	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	63.239848112090584	-18.090271129615108	152488
4f602e0b1e09e384a00ab844c935976be27278fc	optimal cooperative guidance law for salvo attack: an mpc-based consensus perspective		In this paper, a model-predictive-control (MPC)-based cooperative guidance law is presented to perform a salvo attack against a stationary target, which guarantees that multiple missiles hit the target simultaneously. Inspired by the concept of consensus in the multiagent systems, the impact time coordination is reformulated as a consensus on the ranges and range rates of the missiles, leading to a solution without explicitly exploiting the time-to-go or its estimate. By the virtue of an MPC framework, constraints on the normal acceleration and field-of-view are also addressed, and the finite-horizon optimality is guaranteed. Three numerical simulation cases are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	agent-based model;computer simulation;multi-agent system;stationary process	Shen Kang;Jian'an Wang;Guang Li;Jiayuan Shan;Ian R.

664f84c322c306a1f86973ae90c7e44595340606	speed profile optimization for enhanced passenger comfort: an optimal control approach		Autonomous vehicles are expected to start reaching the market within the next years. However in practical applications, navigation inside dynamic environments has to take many factors such as speed control, safety and comfort into consideration, which is more paramount for both passengers and pedestrians. In this paper, a novel speed profile planner based on an optimal control approach considering passenger comfort is proposed. The approach is accomplished by minimizing jerk under certain comfort constraints, which inherently gives a speed profile for the central nervous system to follow naturally. Imposed with the same conditions, the widely used Jerk Limitation method is interpreted as an equivalent of the minimum time control method, the latter being used to verify that our method can ensure better continuity and smoothness of the speed profiles. A validation test was specifically designed and performed in order to show the feasibility of our method.

The study provides controllability results for the five most common types of robot vehicles: Dubins, Reeds-Shepp, differential drive, car-like and convexified Reeds-Shepp. The challenge of achieving controllability of such systems is that their admissible control domains depend on configuration variables. A theorem of controllability specifical for such systems has been obtained based on known controllability theorems. As a result, we show that pairs of the latter three types are completely controllable, i.e. can be steered between any two arbitrary configurations. The same does not hold for pairs of Dubins or Reeds-Shepp vehicles, and a description of the reachable sets in these cases is provided. Finally, as direct extension of controllability results of pairs of identical vehicles, the controllability results for two kinds of formation of n identical vehicles are presented.

The formation dynamics are modeled as controlled Lagrangian systems on Jacobi shape space, and measurements of shape variables are used as feedback to control the entire formation. This geometric approach allows each member of the formation, modeled as a Newtonian particle, freedom to choose different coordinate frame and shape variables to describe observed orientation and shape of the formation. We derive a class of cooperative control laws and shape consensus algorithms with provable convergence. They can be implemented in a distributed fashion thanks to gauge covariance and coordinate independence associated with the geometric approach.	algorithm;computation;consensus dynamics;distributed computing;feedback;jacobi method;provable security	Fumin Zhang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2010.2040508	jacobian matrix and determinant;lagrangian system;control engineering;motion control;mobile robot;systems modeling;consensus;adaptive control;graph theory;covariance;shape analysis;control theory;feedback;mathematics;geometry;orientation;solid modeling;cooperation;robot kinematics	Robotics	59.807402798994836	-17.921365211817303	152914

However, in redundant robotic systems, the inverse kinematics from task-description space to joint space becomes ill-posed. Therefore the problem of determination of joint motions becomes difficult. In order to avoid this ill-posedness, many methods have been proposed, most of which introduce an additional input term calculated from minimization of some intentionally introduced artificial index of performance. This paper treats a 4-D.O.F. redundant handwriting robot by using a novel and simple control method and resolving the problem of such ill-posedness based on sensory feedback in task-coordinates. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated through computer simulation and a preliminary experiment.	computer simulation;feedback;inverse kinematics;robot;well-posed problem	Hiroe Hashiguchi;Suguru Arimoto;Ryuta Ozawa	2004	2004 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) (IEEE Cat.

For this general class of systems, we can construct (and check the existence of) bounded controls driving the system from initial to final regions of the state space. This can be used for tasks requiring repositioning or changing the velocity of the vehicle under constraints on both controls and state. We illustrate the procedure by solving the problem of changing the angular velocity of a parallelepiped aircraft under velocity and control constraints imposed by the task. The method should be seen as a """"maneuver"""" procedure, allowing automatic generation of control laws for bringing the system in a desired region of its state space.

Each agent can get partial measuring states information from its neighboring agent and obstacle. Coordinated obstacle avoidance here represents not only the agents moving without collision with an obstacle, but also the agents bypassing and assembling at the opposite side of the obstacle collectively, where the opposite side is defined according to the initial relative position of the agents to the obstacle. We focus on the collective obstacle avoidance algorithms for both agents with first-order kinematics and agents with second-order dynamics. In the situation where only a fixed fraction of agents can sense obstacle information for agents with first-order kinematics, we propose a collective obstacle avoidance algorithm without velocity measurements. And then we extend the algorithm to the case in switched topology. We show that all agents can bypass an obstacle and converge together, and then assemble at the opposite side of the obstacle in finite time, if the agents@? topology graph is connected and at least one agent can sense the obstacle. In the case where obstacle information is available to only a fixed fraction of agents with second-order kinematics, we propose two collective obstacle avoidance algorithms without measuring acceleration when the obstacle has varying velocity and constant velocity. The switched topology is considered and extended next. We show that agents can bypass the obstacle with their positions and velocities approaching consensus in finite time if the connectivity of switched topology is continuously maintained. Several simulation examples demonstrate the proposed algorithms.	obstacle avoidance	Jiaojie Li;Wei Zhang;Housheng Su;Yupu Yang;Hongtao Zhou	2014	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2014.02.038	simulation;consensus;computer science;circular motion;control theory;obstacle avoidance	Robotics	57.31867639098408	-21.56892209496119	153675

This strategy differs from the traditional robot control in that it only partially specifies/controls the phase space trajectory, pushing the system into a desired natural dynamics, letting it do the job. As the first example of such a strategy, we investigated a ”roll-andrise” motion, a fully dynamic whole-body motion with unpredictable perturbations due to multiple contacts with the ground. The ”knacks” of the motion are identified and analyzed by a systematic search of the phase space.

The effects of quantization and simple velocity estimation on DSM quality are analyzed. It is shown that the introduced and amplified quantization noise degrades sliding motion into the quasi-sliding mode and threatens to provoke chattering. Furthermore, a new DSM control algorithm is proposed, featuring a two-scale reaching law and a supplemental integral action. This algorithm avoids chattering and provides excellent performance. The developed DSM controller has been experimentally tested in an induction motor position control.	algorithm;euler;experiment;quantization (signal processing);velocity (software development)	Boban Veselic;Branislava Perunicic-Drazenovic;Cedomir Milosavljevic	2010	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2010.2042416	control engineering;electronic engineering;quantization;computer science;engineering;servomechanism;control theory;induction motor	Robotics	68.28043323160652	-10.80622858672481	153783

The estimation and prediction of hazardous situations are preliminary steps in the design of active security devices. If numerous metrics have already been defined for on-road vehicles, few approaches are suitable for fast motions in a natural environment (mainly due to tire/ground contact specificity and variability). This paper proposes an algorithm dedicated to the estimation and prediction of one metric, namely lateral load transfer (LLT), in order to anticipate rollover situations on an irregular and natural ground. It is based on a vehicle dynamic model, used jointly with a backstepping observer. It allows to take into account tire/ground contact nonlinearities and variability, which impact the rollover tendency. The efficiency of the metric is investigated through advanced simulations and full scale experiments on a Kymco quad bike.	algorithm;archaeopteryx;computer simulation;experiment;full scale;heart rate variability;lateral computing;lateral thinking;mathematical model;nonlinear system;on-board data handling;online and offline;relevance;rollover (key);sensitivity and specificity;spatial variability;structural load;yaws	Nicolas Bouton;Roland Lenain;Benoit Thuilot;Philippe Martinet	2008	2008 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2008.4650648	control engineering;estimation;vehicle dynamics;simulation;engineering;sensor;automotive engineering;natural environment;computational model;statistics	Robotics	62.53622240886903	-15.575191629952792	154072

The control system was designed so that the car is controlled at low speeds, where the main applications for the vehicle's autonomous operations include parking and urban adaptive cruise control. A longitudinal model of the car was used in the control loop to compensate the nonlinear behavior of its dynamics. Since the determination of the vehicle's model is a difficult step in the design of model-based controllers, the main contribution of this paper is the use of an empirically determined model to this end. In this paper, the structure of the model was conceived from the car's physics equations, but its parameters were estimated using data-based identification techniques. An important contribution of this paper is the fact that, although the model is strictly linear, we can change its parameters as a function of the operation point of the vehicle to represent the engine's and the transmission's nonlinear behaviors. Moreover, in this paper, we propose a way to include changes in the longitudinal dynamics caused by the automatic gear shifting. The validation of the proposed controller was conducted by computer simulations and real-world experiments.	autonomous car;autonomous robot;cc system;computer simulation;control flow;control system;embedded system;experiment;inner loop;mathematical model;nonlinear system;real-time clock;real-time computing;recurrence relation;resultant;system identification;velocity (software development)	Jullierme Emiliano Alves Dias;Guilherme A.

a2dc6f3137e107735dea02a75ca878a74ae7bbfa	experimental verifications of control effects for severe conditions at elevator emergency stop based on the safety standards		The number of skyscrapers may be one of the barometers in showing the economic power of the country. Such powerful countries continue to build high-rise buildings with various facilities for comfort and safety, based on advanced technologies. As transportation means in such buildings are mainly elevators, the strict “Safety Standards” for them are provided. It is because the elevators in the high-rise buildings have large potential energy enough to take away the lives of elevator-passengers. “Emergency Stop Device” for speedily stopping the elevator is a key item to save the lives. However, because of the impact force received from this device at the sudden emergency stop, many injured people are occurring at present. In our previous papers, we proposed an emergency stop device with a semi-active magneto rheological fluid damper to soften the impact force at an emergency stop and showed its effectiveness by digital simulations. In this study, by using a small size elevator apparatus, we will perform many experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposing control, based on EN and JIS Standards.	computational fluid dynamics;damper device component;elevator;experiment;paper;semiconductor industry;shift jis;simulation;standards characteristics	Keisuke Kawase;Naoki Kobayashi;Toshiko Nakagawa	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216514	safety standards;control engineering;automotive engineering;elevator;engineering;damper;economic power;impact	EDA	56.1064855715153	-13.611159602206136	154603

Spacecraft proximity operations will play an important role in guaranteeing the success of such missions. In this paper, we technically propose a tracking control scheme for proximity operations between a target and a pursuer spacecraft that ensures accurate relative position tracking as well as attitude synchronization. Specifically, an integrated six degrees of freedom dynamics model is first established to describe the relative motion of the pursuer with respect to the target. Then, a robust fault-tolerant controller is derived by combining the sliding mode control and the adaptive technique. The designed controller is proved to be not only robust against unexpected disturbances and adaptive to unknown and uncertain mass/inertia properties of the pursuer, but also able to accommodate a large class of actuator faults. In particular, by incorporating a novel time-varying forcing function into the sliding dynamics, the proposed control algorithm is able to guarantee the finite-time convergence of the translational and rotational tracking errors, and the convergence time as an explicit parameter can be assigned a priori by the designers. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis is also presented to assess the fault tolerance ability of the designed controller. Finally, numerous examples are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and demonstrate the benefits of the overall control approach.

The optimal motion planning problem is converted into a finite dimensional nonlinear programming by means of parameter optimizations with quintic B-splines. We introduce the concept of the minimum-overload trajectories in which the motion time is specified to be faster than the motors can handle, and the actuator overloads are minimized during the motion. By successive searches for the minimum-overload trajectories, the minimum-time motions are determined for a spatial 6-link manipulator without simplifying any of the kinematic, dynamic or geometric properties of the manipulator or the obstacles. In the resultant minimum-time motions, almost all of the joint actuators are close to saturation during the motions.		Jong-keun Park;James E.

82e64d6be054706c00a29a4993afb2b185ee40bb	quadcopter formation flight control combining mpc and robust feedback linearization		This paper presents an integrated and practical control strategy to solve the leader–follower quadcopter formation flight control problem. To be specific, this control strategy is designed for the follower quadcopter to keep the specified formation shape and avoid the obstacles during flight. The proposed control scheme uses a hierarchical approach consisting of model predictive controller (MPC) in the upper layer with a robust feedback linearization controller in the bottom layer. The MPC controller generates the optimized collision-free state reference trajectory which satisfies all relevant constraints and robust to the input disturbances, while the robust feedback linearization controller tracks the optimal state reference and suppresses any tracking errors during the MPC update interval. In the top-layer MPC, two modifications, i.e. the control input hold and variable prediction horizon, are made and combined to allow for the practical online formation flight implementation. Furthermore, the existing MPC obstacle avoidance scheme has been extended to account for small non-apriorily known obstacles. The whole system is proved to be stable, computationally feasible and able to reach the desired formation configuration in finite time. Formation flight experiments are set up in Vicon motion-capture environment and the flight results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation flight architecture.

Robots used for transportation tasks usually have a non-circular footprint. In this work, we present a navigation strategy for a holonomic mobile robot with anyshape footprint. Our technique introduces an efficient navigation method based on a strategy that makes use of discrete and continuous techniques. We introduce compact discrete intervals to represent the free space for computing fast-to-update plans. Based on these, we provide a continuous motion generation approach to generate smooth motions that are fast to compute. We evaluated our approach by running simulated experiments and by using a real holonomic L-shaped robot. Our experiments demonstrate that our technique can be carried out online and is able to smoothly drive the robot to its goal locations even in dynamic environments.	experiment;graph (abstract data type);holonomic (robotics);lyapunov fractal;mobile robot;motion planning;robotic mapping;smoothing	Marija Dakulovic;Christoph Sprunk;Luciano Spinello;Ivan Petrovic;Wolfram Burgard	2013	2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2013.6696729	control engineering;mobile robot;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;control theory;motion planning;mobile robot navigation	Robotics	61.0626083064127	-20.551072101263404	155433

To do so, we suggested algorithm which partitions a given region into several smaller regions and plans the covering path which can completely cover these divided areas. The algorithm also allocates the planed areas to cleaning robots sequentially and generates the paths which robots can take, when moving from an area to another area, in the shortest time. For partitioning the given region into several small areas, the Virtual Door Algorithm is used, and for planning the paths, the template-based approach is used. Previously generated look-up table, which uses the Dijkstra algorithm, is used for determining the path from one are to another. The Task Area Allocation Algorithm, which allocates the divided areas to cleaning robots using look-up table, is used for planning paths that cover the area completely. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our algorithms which can completely cover the given region regardless of the number of cleaning robots and verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through computer simulations.	computer simulation;dijkstra's algorithm;lookup table;motion planning;plasma cleaning;robot;sputter cleaning	Jeong Hee Lee;Beom Hee Lee;Jeong-Sik Choi;Kong W.

The environment in which the agents operate is one determinant of the resulting behaviors. This work shows how automatic enumeration of environments enables exploration of various collective behaviors that perform useful group functions (e.g. segregation, corralling, shape formation). Although groups of agents, such as mobile robots, can be manipulated through explicit control, this study shows that these systems can be usefully manipulated without resorting to such imperative means. This method has obvious uses for heterogeneous robot systems, especially those which include large numbers of simple agents. The method introduced is general, in that it takes as input: (1) algorithmic specifications of the environment generation, (2) a black-box model of the individual agent's control laws, and (3) a mathematical description of the task objective. To show the validity of the proposed method this investigation studies two behaviors (splitting and corralling) for three commonly studied motion models, including the well known Reynold's model. Simulations and physical multi-robot trials show that automatically generated environments can elicit pre-specified behaviors from a group of individual agents. Additionally, this work investigates the effects of a group's emergent properties on the ability to elicit the specified behavior via the environment. The findings suggest that automatically exploring environments can lead to better exploration and understanding of collective behaviors, including the identification of previously unknown emergent behaviors.	black box;emergence;imperative programming;mobile robot;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Benjamin T.

The solution to this problem unfolds into two basic subproblems. In the first step, a path-following controller is derived to force each underactuated ship to follow a reference path subject to constant disturbances induced by wave, wind, and ocean current. The controller is designed such that the ship moves on the path while its total velocity is maintained tangential to the path. In the second step, the speeds of the vehicles are adjusted so as to synchronize the positions of the corresponding virtual targets (or so-called coordination states), in the sense that the derivative of each path is left as a free input to synchronize the ships' motion. The proposed coordination controller uses a combination of Lyapunov direct method, backstepping, and concepts from graph theory. When dealing with the path-following coordination problem, it is considered that each ship transmits its coordination state to other ships with a varying time delay as determined by the communication topology. The coordination errors' convergence is achieved based on a proposed Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	broadcast delay;direct method in the calculus of variations;graph theory;lyapunov fractal;simulation;underactuation;velocity (software development)	Jawhar Ghommam;Faïçal Mnif	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2028362	direct method;control engineering;simulation;backstepping;engineering;graph theory;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.24797416259291	-18.01251932592555	156341
60cdaa615de6bd533c94ae1eb722f1dd91eae668	mobile robot path planning with surrounding point set and path improvement	mobile robot;path planning;particle swarm optimization;surrounding point set	The objective of the path planning problem for a mobile robot is to generate a collision-free path from a starting position to a target position with respect to a certain fitness function, such as distance. Although, over the last few decades, path planning has been studied using a number of methodologies, the complicated and dynamic environment increases the complexity of the problem and makes it difficult to find an optimal path in reasonable time. Another issue is the existence of uncertainty in previous approaches. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to solve the path planning problem in two steps. First, the surrounding point set (SPS) is determined where the obstacles are circumscribed by these points. After the initial feasible path is generated based on the SPS, we apply a path improvement algorithm depending upon the former and latter points (PI_FLP), in which each point in the path is repositioned according to two points on either side. Through the SPS, we are able to identify the necessary points for solving path planning problems. PI_FLP can reduce the overall distance of the path, as well as achieve path smoothness. The SPS and PI_FLP algorithms were tested on several maps with obstacles and then compared with other path planning methods As a result, collision-free paths were efficiently and consistently generated, even for maps with narrow geometry and high complexity.	mobile robot;motion planning	Jihee Han;Yoonho Seo	2017	Appl.

This paper studies the globally stabilizing control problem for multiple-RTAC systems by considering that the actuators are constrained in torque amplitudes and velocity signals are unavailable for feedback. More precisely, by carefully analyzing the system energy storage function and respecting the maximum allowable control torques, a novel amplitude-restricted control law is developed without requiring velocity feedback, which can stabilize multiple-RTAC systems from any initial condition theoretically. It is beneficial that the proposed control law does not involve any plant parameters, which consequently makes it insensitive to parameter uncertainties. The stability and convergence characteristics of the designed control system are rigorously supported with Lyapunov techniques. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed controller is the first one that can stabilize a multiple-RTAC system while simultaneously ensuring the practical control amplitude-restricted constraints, by using only output feedback. Both numerical simulation and hardware experiments are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.	block cipher mode of operation;computer simulation;control system;experiment;initial condition;lyapunov fractal;mechatronics;nonlinear system;optimal control;velocity (software development)	Ning Sun;Yiming Wu;Yongchun Fang;He Chen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2643598	control engineering;variable structure control;mechatronics;nonlinear control;sliding mode control;engineering;potential energy;control theory;lyapunov redesign;feed forward;quantum mechanics;actuator;mechanical engineering	Robotics	67.58061554176541	-13.970808625970891	156859

Instead of the classic modelling approach, where the robot position coordinates (x, y) are utilized as state variables (resulting in a non linear model), the proposed discrete model is based on the travelled distance increment ∆l. Thus, the resulting model is linear and time invariant and it can be identified through classical methods such as Recursive Least Mean Squares. This approach has a problem: ∆l can not directly measured. In this paper, this problem is solved using an estimate ∆̃l based on a second order curve approximation. Experimental data were colected and the proposed method was used to identify the model of a real robot.	approximation;least mean squares filter;least squares;linear model;linear system;mathematical model;mobile robot;recursion (computer science);sampling (signal processing);time-invariant system	Patrícia N.

99f15c4fe7076b3e30947d0c53559192062b3191	adaptive neural network controller of an intelligent commode robot for trajectory tracking		An intelligent commode robot with omnidirectional mobility has been developed for the elderly and the disable to improve their life quality. Considering a load change and a shift of the center of gravity due to different users, an adaptive controller based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is designed to track a desired trajectory of the commode robot system. The unknown parameters in dynamics of the system are estimated on-line by the RBFNN. The e1-modification algorithms are used to tune the weights of the RBFNN and a learning rate dependent on time is designed to update the weights to accelerate the training rate of the neural network. Furthermore, a sliding mode control term is selected to compensate estimation errors of the dynamic function and unknown bounded disturbances. For the bounded predefined trajectory, the uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the tracking errors and neural network weight errors has been demonstrated based on the Lyapunov theory. Simulation results showed that the proposed controller can precisely follow the desired trajectory with the load change and the shift of the center of gravity, which will greatly improve the reliability and safety of the commode robot in movement.	algorithm;artificial neural network;lyapunov fractal;network interface controller;online and offline;radial (radio);radial basis function;robot;simulation	Jia Ma;Huaxin Liu;Shuoyu Wang;Qiang Huang	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Cyborg and Bionic Systems (CBS)	10.1109/CBS.2017.8266121	artificial neural network;sliding mode control;lyapunov function;control theory;control theory;bounded function;trajectory;mobile robot;robot kinematics;computer science	Robotics	64.0305209832855	-10.501425830356096	157142

These disturbances can be described with good accuracy by stochastic models. Although methods for the stability analysis of dynamic systems, which are subject to stochastic disturbances, are readily available, they are not widely used in practical applications. Instead, a control design is often performed for a nominal system model, while its robustness is commonly evaluated separately by numerous simulations (e.g. Monte-Carlo techniques) aiming at a quantification of the influence of disturbances. For this reason, methods are presented in this paper which are both applicable to the stability analysis of control and observer structures for ship cranes and to the enhancement of robustness properties by directly accounting for the stochastic nature of disturbances during control design. Suitable simulation results are presented which highlight the applicability of the presented methods for the trajectory control task of ship-mounted boom cranes.	control engineering;control flow;control theory;dynamical system;feedback;heuristic;linear matrix inequality;microsoft outlook for mac;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;paul moskowitz;simulation;state space;stochastic process	Andreas Rauh;Luise Senkel;Jovanka Gebhardt;Harald Aschemann	2014	2014 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2014.6862370	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.45393260282424	-11.312189271943698	157192
bc3725c1059b3cd4a36dce8764b4fb3239e73194	a discrete-time norm-optimal approach to iterative learning control of a bridge crane		In this contribution, a norm-optimal iterative learning control (NOILC) for the two main axes of a bridge crane is presented. For each axis, the NOILC operates in parallel to a linear-quadratic (LQ) state feedback of the tracking error. Regarding the tracking of repetitive trajectories, the ILC part contributes to a significant reduction of the tracking error from iteration to iteration, up to an accuracy that is determined by the quality of the measurement signals. In this paper, the ILC law is based on the minimization of a cost functional and involves both feedforward and feedback control actions. The control structure has been implemented at a bridge crane test rig with three axes, where the lateral rope deflections are determined by means of a CMOS camera. Experimental results show that a fast error convergence and a small remaining tracking error can be achieved with the proposed control structure.	algorithm;control flow;control system;feedback;feedforward neural network;iteration;iterative method;lateral computing;lateral thinking;letter-quality printer;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;optic axis of a crystal;system camera;system dynamics	Harald Aschemann;Alexander Wache;Ole Kraegenbring	2017	2017 22nd International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2017.8046846	iterative learning control;deflection (engineering);computer science;control theory;control engineering;discrete time and continuous time;feed forward;feedforward neural network;tracking error;trajectory;rope	Robotics	67.95414253240546	-10.765739928315018	157299

The robotic agents (RA) move guided by a potential field along the lanes. At the intersections an intersection agent (IA) controls the flow of traffic by assigning priorities to the agents that are about to enter the intersection. The priorities are computed based on the density of RA in a lane and the flow rate of traffic in those lanes. The RAs integrate these assigned priorities into their potential field computations. The modified potential field computations help the RAs to move through the intersection avoiding collisions. An elegant mixed autonomy scheme is thereby achieved where the IAs decide upon the priorities at the intersection while the low level collision avoidance maneuvers are left with the individual RAs. This scheme preserves the distributed nature and the autonomy of potential field maneuvers while simultaneously balancing the computation load between the IA and RAs. We compare this method with a method where the RAs navigate the intersection without a superior direction from the IAs through priorities or when IAs direct the RAs based on priorities computed on a first come first served basis. We show performance gain over both these methods in simulations.	algorithm;computation;multi-agent system;robot;security controls;simulation;traffic collision avoidance system	Aditya Teja;D.

0ecbd562c5dbf60103559a33feadae085cd8bb23	comparison of trajectory parametrization methods with statistical analysis for dynamic parameter identification of serial robot		This paper introduces an approach for designing exciting trajectories for parameter identification of serial robots based on a combination of Fourier Series (FS) and Schroeder Phased Harmonic Sequence (SPHS). An initial estimation of the trajectory is designed for each link using SPHS. Afterwards, the initial trajectory enable to find the initial parameters of the FS which are fed to an optimization process that finds the optimal parameters of the FS used for identification purpose. Like this, we can take the advantages of both FS and SPHS and eliminate the disadvantages of each of them. Moreover, a comparison of results between; the proposed method, original FS, and SPHS is taking place to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach. In this vein, a one-way analysis of variance is conducted to compare whether there are significant improvement or not. An PA10 7DoF arm robot serves as test bed for conducting experiments. Findings shows that the optimal trajectory found through the proposed approach requires less computation time compared to original FS which can be an advantage for fast and robust identification.	benchmark (computing);computation;experiment;mathematical optimization;needham–schroeder protocol;one-way function;robot;statistical model;testbed;time complexity	Fares J.

The /spl infin/-norm is preferred to the 2-norm in the minimization of the joint torques since the torques of the actuators are limited by their maximum values in magnitudes. To obtain the minimum /spl infin/-norm torque solution, we devised a new method that uses the acceleration polyhedron representing the end-effector's acceleration capability. Usually the torque minimization has the instability problem for the long trajectories of the end-effector. To suppress this instability problem, an inequality constraint, named the stabilization constraint, is developed from geometrical relations between the desired end-effector acceleration and the acceleration polyhedron. The minimization of the /spl infin/-norm of the joint torques subject to the stabilization constraint is shown to improve the performances through the simulations of a 3-link planar redundant manipulator.	mathematical optimization	Ick-Chan Shim;Yong-San Yoon	1997		10.1109/ROBOT.1997.619321	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;redundancy	Robotics	66.18013424617706	-20.398143248464756	158354

In this paper, we present cooperative and non cooperative models for foraging that exploit stigmergy in the context of the classical Army Ant Raid model. Such models use the Stigmergic Multi-Ant Search Area (S-MASA) algorithm that produces a gradual search around the nest which provides less time for locating closest food and provides close-to-optimal paths using only the pheromone concentration. The proposed models have been evaluated under simulation with respect to models based on the reference c-marking algorithm. The obtained results show that the proposed models, specifically the cooperative one outperforms the c-marking based models both in obstacle-free and obstacle environments.	algorithm;item unique identification;raid;robot;simulation;stigmergy;swarm robotics	Ouarda Zedadra;Hamid Seridi;Nicolas Jouandeau;Giancarlo Fortino	2015	2015 IEEE 19th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)	10.1109/CSCWD.2015.7230938	simulation;ant robotics;artificial intelligence	Robotics	56.93701043167742	-23.919508854920565	158651

Aircraft are assumed to cruise within a given altitude layer and are modeled as a kinematic system with constant velocity and curvature bounds. Aircraft cannot get closer to each other than a predefined safety distance. For such system of multiple aircraft, we consider the problem of planning optimal paths among given waypoints. Necessary conditions for optimality of solutions are derived and used to devise a parameterization of possible trajectories that turns into efficient numerical solutions to the problem. Simulation results for a realistic aircraft conflict scenario are provided. A decentralized implementation of the optimal conflict resolution scheme is introduced that may allow free-flight coordination in a cooperative airspace management scheme. Impact of decentralization on performance and safety is finally discussed with the help of extensive simulations.	numerical analysis;simulation;velocity (software development);waypoint	Antonio Bicchi;Lucia Pallottino	2000	IEEE Trans.

The role of this component has been completely ignored in past studies on self motion. It is shown that Jacobian pseudoinverse-based resolution - the usual resolution method for nonlinear self-motion - yields poor dynamic performance. A special type of self motion is identified based on the natural metric on the self-motion manifold and the energy conservation principle. This type of self motion is shown to have superior dynamics in terms of torque requirement and to avoid abrupt fluctuations in acceleration in the vicinity of singular points.	jacobian matrix and determinant;nonlinear system;robot	Yoshikazu Kanamiya	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152181	classical mechanics;acceleration;robot;control engineering;dynamics;singular point of a curve;energy conservation;manifold;computer science;humanoid robot;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;torque;redundancy	Robotics	66.6226556647915	-20.421279284578247	158914

They are analogous in morphology to snakes, tentacles, and elephant trunks. We propose a novel method of navigating a snake-like robot based on the Harmonic Field with Optimized Boundary Conditions (HFOBC) and a boundary following algorithm. We apply the HFOBC navigation function using a number of fictitious charges equally spaced on each link. These charges actively follow the potential field towards the target. Futhermore, a generalized mathematical model for an n-link snake-like robot based on Lagrange formulation has also been proposed in this paper.	motion planning;quantum harmonic oscillator;robot	M.

The high gain controller with forced sliding motions is used to secure adaptability in the wide region of the aircraft model parameters. The shunting method is applied to ensure the closed-loop system stability in the face of the lack of the aircraft state information. The sequential reference model is used to assign the desired closed-loop system performance. An example illustrating a typical design procedure for aircraft attitude control in the horizontal plane for different flight conditions is given. The system robustness with respect to uncertain plant parameters is studied. The simulation results demonstrate efficiency and high robustness of the suggested control method.	autopilot;control system;flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft);reference model;simulation;systems design	Alexander L.

First, we define a set of variables that best characterize its dynamic performance in the required motion task. Second, driving forces/torques are properly assigned in order to achieve the required dynamic performance in an efficient way. The usual performance requirements are for positioning accuracy, movement execution time, and energy expenditure. We consider complex biomechatronic systems (BMS) like human with active orthosis or robotic arm that have to perform two main types of motion tasks: goal-directed movements and motion/posture stabilization. We propose new design concepts and criteria for BMS based on necessary and sufficient conditions for their robust controllability. Using simplified, yet realistic, models, we give several important examples in robotics and rehabilitation to illustrate the main features and advantages of our approach.	intelligent control;robotics	Petko Kiriazov;Gergana Nikolova;Ivanka Veneva	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-25489-5_30	control engineering;design;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.63644701810125	-21.469268904378815	159097
d8769affa187eabe50032bb1e0d18f9497fdd7c6	two coupled pursuit-evasion games in target-attacker-defender problem		This paper addresses a differential game with three players: a target, an attacker and a defender, where the Attacker aims to capture the Target while avoiding being captured by the Defender, and the Defender tries to defend the Target from being captured by the Attacker while trying to capture the Attacker. There are two coupled pursuit-evasion problems in this game: Attacker-Target and Defender-Attacker. Firstly, a game of kind in this differential game is considered and a so-called barrier is constructed to divide the space into three disjoint regions: the win region of the Attacker, the win region of the team of the Target and Defender and the uncertain region in which neither of three players can win the game. Secondly, a game of degree is considered by introducing a payoff function. Some explicit expressions of optimal strategies for the players are obtained. Finally, the numerical solutions of optimal strategies and the corresponding optimal trajectories for three players with different initial conditions are provided.	dvd region code;degree (graph theory);evasion (network security);initial condition;numerical analysis;pursuit-evasion;radio jamming;simulation	Li Liang;Zhihong Peng;Fan Zhang;Xinxing Li	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8264503	differential game;computer science;mathematical optimization;expression (mathematics);stochastic game;trajectory;optimal control;disjoint sets;pursuit-evasion	AI	56.787871093722146	-20.952072938556267	159396

The block control approach is used to design a nonlinear sliding surface such that the resulting sliding mode dynamics is described by a desired linear system. The neural network learning is performed on-line by Kalman filtering. The local controller for each joint uses only local angular position and velocity measurements. The applicability of the proposed control scheme is illustrated via simulations.	angularjs;artificial neural network;kalman filter;linear system;nonlinear system;online and offline;optimal control;recurrent neural network;robot;robotic arm;simulation;velocity (software development)	Ramón García-Hernández;Edgar N.

To reduce the computational costs, only two radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are applied to approximate the lumped unknown nonlinearities of the velocity subsystem and the altitude subsystem, while guaranteeing the exploited controller with satisfactory robustness against system uncertainties. Furthermore, a minimal-learning parameter (MLP) approach is employed to update the norm rather than the elements of RBFNNs’ weight vectors, which yields a low computational load design. By constructing a novel auxiliary system to compensate the desired control laws, the effects of magnitude constraints on actuators are tackled. The Lyapunov synthesis proves that the closed-loop uniformly ultimately bounded stability can be achieved even when the physical limitations on actuators are in effect. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the addressed control strategy in the presence of uncertain parameters, external disturbances and control input constraints. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;control theory;lyapunov fractal;memory-level parallelism;radial (radio);radial basis function;simulation;velocity (software development)	Xiangwei Bu;Xiaoyan Wu;Daozhi Wei;Jiaqi Huang	2016	Inf.

20ba0f36166d22224f926a0b8d28624f19c4c4c0	distributed intermittent connectivity control of mobile robot networks	distributed ltl based planning multi robot networks intermittent communication;robot kinematics communication networks robot sensing systems mobile robots synchronization model checking	In this paper we develop an intermittent communication framework for teams of mobile robots. Robots move along the edges of a mobility graph and communicate only when they meet at the vertices of this graph, giving rise to a dynamic communication network. We design distributed controllers for the robots that determine meeting times at the nodes of the mobility graph so that connectivity of the communication network is ensured over time, infinitely often. We show that this requirement can be captured by a global Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that forces robots to meet infinitely often at the meeting points. To generate motion plans that satisfy the LTL expression, we propose a novel technique that approximately decomposes the global LTL formula into local LTL formulas and assigns them to the robots. Since the approximate decomposition of the LTL formula can result in conflicting robot behaviors, we develop a distributed conflict resolution scheme that generates conflict-free motion plans that satisfy the global LTL expression. By appropriately introducing delays in the execution of the generated motion plans we show that the proposed controllers can be executed asynchronously.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;deadlock;distributed control system;encapsulation (networking);high- and low-level;linear temporal logic;mobile robot;norm (social);telecommunications network	Yiannis Kantaros;Michael M.

The variator enables a stepless variation of the transmission ratio within a finite range. A conventional control design for the variator is typically obtained by the use of a variator model, which incorporates large uncertainties and, therefore, limits the variator efficiency. In this paper, a control design for the variator is discussed, which improves the variator efficiency and limits the number of sensors. The relation between inputs and outputs of the variator is investigated, from which one input-output map is identified, which exhibits a maximum. This maximum indicates performance in terms of the variator efficiency. For this reason, this input-output map is maximized by means of extremum seeking control (ESC), which omits the use of a variator model. Experiments illustrate that the approach is feasible and show that a conventional control design for the variator is outperformed.	experiment;maxima and minima;sensor	Stan van der Meulen;Bram de Jager;Erik van der Noll;Frans Veldpaus;Francis van der Sluis;Maarten Steinbuch	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5281021	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	68.1659229231633	-11.876594245735436	160023
