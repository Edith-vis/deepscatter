Recently it has been shown that Pascal matrix allows the appropriate transformation for design of the low-pass, high-pass, and bandpass digital filters. Unfortunately, this method is difficult to use in case of transforming H/sub a/(s) to the high-order bandpass filter. This letter proposes a similar method, especially suitable for design of the bandpass and bandstop filters without order limitation. The presented design algorithm is illustrated by a numerical example.	algorithm;digital filter;infinite impulse response;low-pass filter;numerical analysis;prototype filter;transfer function	Jacek Konopacki	2005	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2004.839694	butterworth filter;adaptive filter;network synthesis filters;x-ray filter;computer vision;digital filter;voltage-controlled filter;low-pass filter;computer science;2d filters;root-raised-cosine filter;linear filter;control theory;mathematics;band-pass filter;transfer function;constant k filter;electronic filter topology;filter design;prototype filter;high-pass filter;infinite impulse response;capacitor-input filter;active filter;composite image filter;m-derived filter	EDA	59.88280216155225	17.366200062056837	65595

For this, the generalized pseudo-Bayesian second-order-extended Viterbi (GPB2-EV) and the interacting multiple-model-extended Viterbi (IMM-EV) algorithms are presented. The derivations of these new algorithms rely on a nontrival incorporation of some functional mechanisms of a new extended Viterbi algorithm into the GPB2 and the IMM methods for hypothesis reductions in order to improve computational efficiency and/or estimation performance. The IMM-EV (and the GPB2-EV) algorithm and the IMM (and the GPB2) algorithm have some common components, but their schemes for the calculation of weights and for the combination of the inputs and outputs are different. Indeed, the IMM-EV (and the GPB2-EV) algorithm spans the continuum from hard-decision methods with merged-hypothesis-tree style to the IMM (and the GPB2) algorithm inclusive. The proposed algorithms are well suited to state estimation problems in maneuvering target tracking. Simulations demonstrate that an IMM-EV algorithm can be an improvement to the IMM, the GPB2, and the variable-structure multiple model with likely-model set methods for tracking a target undergoing various types of maneuvers at some unknown times.	algorithmic efficiency;apple a5;computer simulation;extended validation certificate;interaction;logical volume management;markov chain;maximal set;missile guidance;radar tracker;recursion;triune continuum paradigm;viterbi algorithm	Tan-Jan Ho;Bor-Sen Chen	2006	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2005.861753	forward algorithm;mathematical optimization;soft output viterbi algorithm;viterbi algorithm;machine learning;mathematics;markov process;iterative viterbi decoding;statistics	ML	56.127253805382146	6.450902194319113	65764
06b4e456aad3ef478d26ca413615f0ef9889bf26	blind channel equalization using fourth-order cumulants and a neural network	blind channel equalization;fourth order cumulants;neural network equalizer	This paper addresses a new blind channel equalization method using fourth-order cumulants of channel inputs and a three-layer neural network equalizer. The proposed algorithm is robust with respect to the existence of heavy Gaussian noise in a channel and does not require the minimum-phase characteristic of the channel. The transmitted signals at the receiver are over-sampled to ensure the channel described by a full-column rank matrix. It changes a single-input/single-output (SISO) finite-impulse response (FIR) channel to a single-input/multi-output (SIMO) channel. Based on the properties of the fourth-order cumulants of the over-sampled channel inputs, the iterative algorithm is derived to estimate the deconvolution matrix which makes the overall transfer matrix transparent, i.e., it can be reduced to the identity matrix by simple recordering and scaling. By using this estimated deconvolution matrix, which is the inverse of the over-sampled unknown channel, a three-layer neural network equalizer is implemented at the receiver. In simulation studies, the stochastic version of the proposed algorithm is tested with three-ray multi-path channels for on-line operation, and its performance is compared with a method based on conventional second-order statistics. Relatively good results, withe fast convergence speed, are achieved, even when the transmitted symbols are significantly corrupted with Gaussian noise.	artificial neural network	Soowhan Han	2005	Int.

The formalism is based on the finite Zak transform (FZT), which provides an important tool for the analysis of images that by their very nature are spatially nonstationary. The discrete Zak transform is extended to two spatial dimensions, and fundamental properties of the two-dimensional FZT are discussed, emphasizing the direct relationship that exists between the Zak transform and the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm. Subsampling and interpolation are considered in the context of various mappings into the combined space. The two-dimensional FZT is applied to image representation and image analysis in computation of the Gabor expansion coefficients with arbitrary resolution. A technique for stable reconstruction is implemented and illustrated.	zak mckracken and the alien mindbenders	Yehoshua Y. Zeevi;Izidor Gertner	1992	J.

2e29eaf0940f1b68c4e69118a7883da5d7411f01	consensus seeking in heterogeneous second-order multi-agent systems with switching topologies and random link failures		Abstract In this paper, we consider the issue of consensus among the agents with heterogeneous dynamics under random link failures that obey Bernoulli distribution. The heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) are composed of hybrid dynamic agents including first-order dynamic agents and second-order dynamic agents, and the communication topologies are assumed to be directed and time-varying. The failure control protocol is designed by randomly utilizing the previous one- or two-step states information sent by the neighbors. A criterion for the heterogeneous consensus is established by constructing augmented systems with nonnegative random coefficient matrices for the switching topologies. With the help of graph theory and stochastic matrix theory, a sufficient condition related to switching topologies is established to ensure the realization of heterogeneous consensus. Numerical examples are finally provided to validate the theoretical result.	multi-agent system	Yuhua Cheng;Yangzhen Zhang;Lei Shi;Jin-Liang Shao;Yue Xiao	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2018.08.051	multilevel model;graph theory;machine learning;mathematical optimization;network topology;stochastic matrix;multi-agent system;matrix (mathematics);mathematics;bernoulli distribution;artificial intelligence	AI	64.6419108782215	5.807460448056633	66148

The computational cost of a conventional Kriging analysis of N data points is dominated by the m iterations of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) optimization, resulting in a computational cost of O(mN^3). We propose two fast methods for estimating the hyperparameters in the frequency domain: frequency-domain maximum likelihood estimate (FMLE) and frequency-domain sample variogram (FSV), both of which reduce the cost of the optimization to O(N^2+mN) in the case of a regular Fourier transform (FT), and to O(NlnN+mN) in the case of a fast Fourier transform (FFT). In addition to this speed up, problems concerning positive definiteness of the gain matrix - which limit the robustness of the conventional approach - vanish in the proposed methods.	kriging	J. H.

Through minimizing the mean square error for each sensor, the optimal distributed Kalman filter (ODKF) based on matrix weights is derived. To deal with the computation complexity of ODKF, a suboptimal distributed filter is proposed, which keeps the consistent property of estimation. With the general assumption on the overall observability, the stability of the novel distributed algorithm is analyzed. Finally, a numerical simulation is presented so as to show the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.	computation;computer simulation;distributed algorithm;kalman filter;mean squared error;stochastic process	Xingkang He;Wenchao Xue;Haitao Fang	2016	2016 14th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)	10.1109/ICARCV.2016.7838826	kalman filter;minimum mean square error;algorithm design;covariance intersection;mathematical optimization;invariant extended kalman filter;ensemble kalman filter;fast kalman filter;computer science;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;statistics;alpha beta filter	Robotics	56.973829334529135	4.404872887893385	66480
7785f1ea3ec6061c028b9a618f3fcd18ef3abf89	decomposition of nonlinear dynamical networks via comparison systems		In analysis and control of large-scale nonlinear dynamical systems, a distributed approach is often an attractive option due to its computational tractability and usually low communication requirements. Success of the distributed control design relies on the separability of the network into weakly interacting subsystems such that minimal information exchange between subsystems is sufficient to achieve satisfactory control performance. While distributed analysis and control design for dynamical network have been well studied, decomposition of nonlinear networks into weakly interacting subsystems has not received as much attention. In this article we propose a vector Lyapunov functions based approach to quantify the energy-flow in a dynamical network via a model of a comparison system. Introducing a notion of power and energy flow in a dynamical network, we use sum-of-squares programming tools to partition polynomial networks into weakly interacting subsystems. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed method of decomposition.

By using the homogeneous function, we firstly give a finite-time consensus protocol for high-order linear multiagent systems. Then, we present the finite-time consensus and tracking protocols for strict feedback nonlinear multiagent systems.

The conventional SEMs, however, have such a drawback that they are very sensitive to Gaussian noise. To overcome this drawback, the robust super-exponential methods (RSEMs) were proposed for single-input single-output infinite impulse response (SISO-IIR) channels and for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) static channels (instantaneous mixtures). While the conventional SEMs use the second-and higher-order cumulants of observations, the RSEMs use only the higher-order cumulants of observations. Since higher-order cumulants are insensitive to Gaussian noise, the RSEMs are robust to Gaussian noise. We proposed an RSEM extended to the case of MIMO-FIR channels (convolutive mixtures). To show the validity of the proposed RSEM, some simulation results are presented.	blind deconvolution;finite impulse response;infinite impulse response;mimo;mimo-ofdm;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;time complexity	Kiyotaka Kohno;Yujiro Inouye;Mitsuru Kawamoto	2007	2007 15th European Signal Processing Conference		gaussian noise;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;blind deconvolution;statistics	ML	58.33082605107291	11.593477457991273	67012

In this paper, we present a new class of LTI causal FIR filters for converting a set of autocorrelation samples representing the input to a prescribed set of output autocorrelation samples. The input autocorrelation samples may represent a MA, AR, or ARMA process, with or without additive white noise, whose stable model is minimum or non-minimum phase. In contrast to the existing methods, derivation of a FIR filter of this class is direct requiring no intermediate step and no direct application of orthogonality principle or minimization of a cost function. The FIR filter is minimum-phase and its output autocorrelation lags, except the lag zero, match the set of prescribed values precisely. We characterize the filters solution space and present a novel time-domain algorithm for finding a unique invertible FIR filter of minimum-order in the solution space. We refer to the solution filter as an ''optimal invertible FIR (OIFIR)'' filter, in general, and as a ''semi-whitening filter (SWF)'', in particular, when the prescribed output autocorrelation lags, except the lag zero, are all equal to zero. It is shown that the whitening filter obtained by Yule-Walker equations (or by the orthogonality principle) belongs to the solution space of SWF only if the set of input autocorrelation samples accurately represents an AR process of finite order. Examples show performance of the proposed class of filters in spectral shaping applications including the AR modeling of a stationary process.	finite impulse response;noise shaping	Issa M. S.

Despite their highly desirable properties, the transfer of VFs and HOS to real-world signal processing problems has been hindered by the requirement of very large data records needed to obtain reliable estimates. The identiication of VFs and the estimation of HOS both fall into the category of ill-posed estimation problems. In this paper, we develop penalized least squares (PLS) estimation methods for VFs and HOS. It is shown that PLS is a very eeective way to incorporate prior information of the problem at hand without directly constraining the estimation procedure. Hence, PLS produces much more reliable estimates. The main contributions of this paper are the development of appropriate penalizing functionals and cross-validation procedures for PLS based VF identiication and HOS estimation.

The pre-processor which adds uncorrelated components to the original received stereo signals improves the adaptive lter convergence even in the conventional con guration. However, because of the inaudibility restriction, the preprocessed signals still include a large amount of the original stereo signals which are often highly crosscorrelated. Therefore, the improvement is limited. To overcome this, our new stereo echo canceller includes exclusive adaptive lters whose inputs are the uncorrelated signals generated in the pre-processor. These exclusive adaptive lters converge to true solutions without su ering from cross-correlation between the original stereo signals. This is demonstrated through computer simulation results.	computer simulation;converge;cross-correlation;data pre-processing;echo suppression and cancellation;naruto shippuden: clash of ninja revolution 3;nonlinear system;preprocessor	Suehiro Shimauchi;Youichi Haneda;Shoji Makino;Yutaka Kaneda	1998		10.1109/ICASSP.1998.679683	computer simulation;adaptive filter;computer vision;speech recognition;computer science	Vision	60.382059514286766	14.534345294927006	67422
a5a7356600988fd4817b58480fc89451755b8caf	a design method for distributed luenberger observers		The paper addresses the problem of designing distributed observers for discrete linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with distributed sensor nodes subjected to bounded measurement noise. A solution is proposed in terms of a distributed LTI Luenberger observer, thus departing from common linear time-varying solutions rooted in consensus-based distributed estimation techniques, and dispensing with the need for the exchange of covariance matrices. It is shown, under the conditions of collective observability, strong connectivity of the sensor communication network, and invertibility of the state transition matrix, that the resulting observer yields ultimate boundedness of the estimation error. A design example is given where the asymptotic performance of the proposed observer is shown to be similar to that obtained using a time-varying distributed Kalman filtering approach.	kalman filter;linear time-invariant theory;plug and play;progressive scan;sensor;simulation;stochastic matrix;telecommunications network;time complexity;time-invariant system	Francisco F.

This improvement has been achieved by formulating a recursive least square (RLS) training mechanism. However, FLANN-RLS ANC systems are not effective in noise mitigation when implemented in a finite word length scenario. A QR-RLS based training mechanism has been designed to improved convergence even in reduced word length implementations. A simulation study has been carried out to study the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving convergence when finite word length implementation is attempted. The proposed FLANN-QRRLS scheme has been shown to improve convergence behaviour in comparison with other schemes compared.	algorithm;artificial neural network;control system;nonlinear system;qr decomposition;rate of convergence;recursion;recursive least squares filter;simulation;string (computer science)	Raj Shah;Sandeep Reddy;Vinal Patel;Nithin V.

Nevertheless, the instantaneous value of the modeling error alone does not convey sufficient information about the accuracy of the estimated model in representing the underlying structure of the data. In this paper, we propose an extension to the traditional MSE cost function, a regularization term based on the incremental errors in model output. We demonstrate the stochastic equivalence between the proposed regularization term and the error entropy. Finally, we derive an RLS-type algorithm for the proposed cost function, which we call recursive least squares with entropy regularization (RLSER) algorithm. The performance of RLSER is shown to be better than RLS in supervised training with noisy data.	adaline;algorithm;computational complexity theory;loss function;matrix regularization;monte carlo method;noise reduction;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;rejection sampling;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;turing completeness;white noise	Deniz Erdogmus;Yadunandana N.

The estimator, referred to as SAS-Est (Subspace Aligning and Separating Estimator), simultaneously seeks to separate the steering vectors from the noise subspace and align them to the signal subspace. The angles between subspaces and the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence are used in characterizing the alignment and separation. Minimizing the divergence leads to maximal subspace separation and best alignment, thus allowing improved performance. Simulations in additive white Gaussian noise show that the new estimator offers an improvement for both model order and frequency estimation. When compared with other methods, the improvement is more pronounced for high model orders and low signal-to-noise ratio values.	additive white gaussian noise;align (company);autocorrelation;computer simulation;kullback–leibler divergence;loss function;maximal set;optimization problem;sas;signal subspace;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral density estimation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Runyi Yu;Erhan A.

In this paper, the cause of this unexpected weak performance is analyzed. Based thereon an algorithm combining the idea of the ORT method with the algorithm of the CCA (canonical correlation analysis) method is proposed. Presented simulation results of this algorithm illustrate its enhanced reliability (i.e. determination of a correct model) in comparison to existing methods. This concerns the rejection of arbitrarily colored disturbances within linear systems and the identification of realistic processes like the Tennessee Eastman Process.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);linear system;mimo;rejection sampling;simulation;state space	Andreas Bathelt;Dirk Söffker;Mohieddine Jelali	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7402725	algorithm design;econometrics;mathematical optimization;yttrium;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;linear system;matrix decomposition;correlation;statistics	EDA	57.539725116702506	6.002786422310164	68376

Consider also a 'datum', that is, a piece of information, like a report of an emergency condition in a sensor network, a national traditional song, or a mobile phone virus. How often should nodes transmit the datum to each other, so that the datum can survive (or, in the virus case, under what conditions will the virus die out)? Clearly, the link and node fault probabilities are important - what else is needed to ascertain the survivability of the datum? We propose and solve the problem using non-linear dynamical systems and fixed point stability theorems. We provide a closed-form formula that, surprisingly, depends on only one additional parameter, the largest eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix. We illustrate the accuracy of our analysis on realistic and real settings, like mote sensor networks from Intel and MIT, as well as Gnutella and P2P networks.	adjacency matrix;approximation error;bluetooth;computer virus;dynamical system;emoticon;experiment;fixed point (mathematics);geodetic datum;gnutella;initial condition;mp3;mathematical optimization;mobile malware;network topology;nonlinear system;optimization problem;peer-to-peer;retransmission (data networks);sensor node;stepping level;systems design;whole earth 'lectronic link	Deepayan Chakrabarti;Jure Leskovec;Christos Faloutsos;Samuel Madden;Carlos Guestrin;Michalis Faloutsos	2007	IEEE INFOCOM 2007 - 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFCOM.2007.156	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Robotics	59.907391492893574	4.646965703816275	68566

This effect becomes prominent when the impact of additive noise vanishes, that is at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Based on both analytic derivation of the AC lag terms and simulation experiments we show that data windowing can mitigate the limitations caused by the phase dependence. Thus with proper windowing, the variance of the frequency estimate is no more eclipsed by phase dependence, but it continues to decrease linearly with increasing SNR. The study covers both the cases of a single sinusoid and two sinusoids closely spaced in the frequency with the Pisarenko frequency estimator, MUSIC and Principal Component Autoregressive frequency estimators. The trade-offs between the spectral broadening and the achieved minimum variance level due to the data window are analyzed in detail.	additive white gaussian noise;autocorrelation matrix;autoregressive model;experiment;pisarenko harmonic decomposition;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density estimation;toeplitz hash algorithm;utility functions on indivisible goods	Mustafa A.

Many sub-Nyquist reconstruction algorithms (e.g., greedy relax and convex optimization) have been developed to reconstruct the real frequency-sparse signal by utilizing its sparsity. However, greedy algorithms require a large memory size and convex optimization algorithms exhaust a long calculation time. Unlike previous schemes, in this paper, we propose a frequency-domain adaptive sparse signal reconstruction scheme under sub-Nyquist to achieve better performance and lower computational time. Specifically, discrete Hartley transform (DHT) is adopt to find a sparse representation in frequency domain accompanying with sub-Nyquist random demodulation sampling rate and £0-NLMS algorithm is utilized to reconstruct sparse signal. Experiment results are conducted to confirm the advantages of the proposed method in terms of computational time and mean square error.	computation;convex optimization;discrete hartley transform;distributed hash table;greedy algorithm;hartley (unit);mathematical optimization;mean squared error;nyquist rate;sampling (signal processing);signal reconstruction;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;time complexity	Beiyi Liu;Guan Gui;Ying Zhu;Li Xu	2016	2016 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)	10.1109/ICCChina.2016.7636810	mathematical optimization;theoretical computer science;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	61.932977609753486	11.709780120217829	69060

Under the edge agreement framework, we introduce an important concept about the essential edge Laplacian and also obtain a reduced model of the edge agreement dynamics based on the spanning tree subgraph. The quantized edge agreement problem of second-order nonlinear multi-agent system is studied, in which both uniform and logarithmic quantizers are considered. We do not only guarantee the stability of the proposed quantized control law, but also reveal the explicit mathematical connection of the quantized interval and the convergence properties for both uniform and logarithmic quantizers, which has not been addressed before. Particularly, for uniform quantizers, we provide the upper bound of the radius of the agreement neighborhood and indicate that the radius increases with the quantization interval. While for logarithmic quantizers, the agents converge exponentially to the desired agreement equilibrium. In addition, we figure out the relationship of the quantization interval and the convergence speed and also provide the estimates of the convergence rate. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the theoretical analysis.	agent-based model;consensus dynamics;converge;directed graph;file spanning;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;optimal control;quantization (signal processing);rate of convergence;simulation;spanning tree	Zhiwen Zeng;Xiangke Wang;Zhiqiang Zheng	2015	CoRR			AI	64.61368488875735	6.37636007433009	69240

The filters can be described as a uniform exponential distribution of poles along the negative-real axis of the s plane, with zeros interleaving them. Arbitrary spectral slopes are obtained by sliding the array of zeros relative to the array of poles, where each array maintains periodic spacing on a log scale. The nature of the slope approximation is close to Chebyshev optimal in the interior of the pole-zero array, approaching conjectured Chebyshev optimality over all frequencies in the limit as the order approaches infinity. Practical designs can arbitrarily approach the equal-ripple approximation by enlarging the pole-zero array band beyond the desired frequency band. The spectral roll-off slope can be robustly modulated in real time by varying only the zeros controlled by one slope parameter.

Considering the bandwidth of noise reduction, the analog controller is more beneficial due to its shorter delay compared with the digital one. Analog controllers with fixed circuit structures are preferable for practical implementation. However, fixed-order controllers with low complexity, such as a biquad filter, are difficult to design for a high reduction level. On the other hand, a high order one, getting from the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$H_{\mathrm { {inf}}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-norm optimization, is costly due to a larger number of circuit components.

Harmony Search is an evolutionary algorithm, which emulates the improvisation process of musicians. We have modified the algorithm by setting the bandwidth equal to the standard deviation of the vectors in the harmony memory, and by introducing a penalty function to ensure IIR filter stability. The proposed variant has been applied to the design of low-pass, high-pass, band pass and band stop filters, by minimizing the L1 and L2 norm approximation errors and the maximum pass band and stop band ripples. The algorithm has been compared with the TIA approach.

Given a bound on the maximum kernel matrix size, we define the set of all obtainable sizes as the resizing range. We then propose a simple online technique that resizes the kernel matrix within the resizing range. The modified algorithm is applied to the nonlinear system identification problem that was used to evaluate the original algorithm. Results show that an increase in performance is achieved without increasing the original algorithm's computation time.	algorithm;computation;gramian matrix;kernel (operating system);nonlinear system identification;recursion;recursive least squares filter;time complexity	Brian J.

Despite its high computational cost, the method has the advantage of being efficient in the Gaussian case. A comparative study with existing methods is then carried out and points out the efficiency of our approach especially when the number of samples is small.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithmic efficiency;autoregressive model;colors of noise;computation;newton's method;online and offline;utility functions on indivisible goods	Roberto Diversi;Hiroshi Ijima;Eric Grivel	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638845	gaussian noise;additive white gaussian noise;econometrics;value noise;pattern recognition;mathematics;estimation theory;statistics	Robotics	57.17614685950935	10.909027308563928	71235

An estimator based on matching in a weighted least-squares sense the sample correlation sequence to the theoretical sequence is presented. The asymptotic properties of the estimator are analyzed. A lower bound on the estimation of the parameters from sample covariances is derived. This bound is shown to be attainable by appropriately choosing the weighting matrix. However, the unweighted nonlinear least-squares estimate performance is shown to come close to the lower bound. The influence of the number of samples, the number of correlation samples, and the lowpass envelope characteristics are studied. Finally, a comparison with Yule-Walker (YW) methods is given.

The transformation is based on a previously introduced aliasing compensated frequency warping operator having a residual error because of finite output dimension. By adding some redundancy, the effect of an infinite output dimension can be taken into account in a compressed way, based on an analytical factorization. In the reconstruction process, the additional redundant samples are expanded, making the inverse transform differ from the direct one, but guaranteeing perfect reconstruction.	aliasing;bilinear transform	Salvatore Caporale;Luca De Marchi;Nicolò Speciale	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495740	image warping;mathematical optimization;kernel;speech recognition;theoretical computer science;signal processing;zinc;filter bank;mathematics;redundancy	Visualization	56.90604875557126	17.91503959901632	71581

By transforming all components to SFM signals through square calculation, we may then apply singular value decomposition to determine the generalized period and the modulation frequency of the SFM signal. The modulation index and carrier frequency are determined by searching for discrete points and optimizing calculations. The initial phase can be determined by calculating the inner product. Finally, given that the pseudo-random binary code is a real signal, the PN (Pseudo-noise) sequence and the amplitude can be estimated. Our proposed method can estimate the SNR by using the method of subspace-based decomposition, and the estimated SNR can be used to adaptively stop separation.

We consider a linearized SusceptibleInfected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic spreading model in which agents in the network are able to allocate vaccination resources (for prevention) and antidotes (for treatment) in the presence of a contagion. We express our epidemic control condition as a spectral constraint involving the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue, and formulate the resource allocation problem as a Geometric Program (GP). Next, we separate the network-wide optimization problem into subproblems optimally solved by each agent in a fully distributed way. We conclude the paper by illustrating performance of our solution framework with numerical simulations.	algorithm;augmented lagrangian method;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);convex optimization;geometric programming;mathematical optimization;matrix multiplication;numerical analysis;optimization problem;rate of convergence;simulation;telephone exchange	Chinwendu Enyioha;Ali Jadbabaie;Victor M.

A number of conditions are established in terms of the properties of the cooperative steering control for achieving cooperative behaviors. Under assumptions that the considered individual nonlinear system is controllable and there exists a steering control in either feedback or open-loop form to move the system from one state to the other in nite time, the sampled-data cooperative steering control law can be designed based on the information received from the neighboring systems within the current sensor range. It is proved that the proposed cooperative steering control is cooperatively stabilizing if network is connected over time together with a mild condition imposed on sampling time. As an illustrative application case, cooperative steering control algorithms in closed form are presented to address the consensus problem of nonholonomic robot systems in chained form. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;consensus (computer science);consensus dynamics;dynamical system;nonlinear system;optimal control;robot;sampling (signal processing);self-stabilization;simulation	Jing Wang;Zhihua Qu;Morrison S.

1da85dca1ce7045f135b9f9dcd4f6de7db6e74d5	spectral estimation by computationally reduced kalman filter	kalman filtering;adaptive filtering;computational order;convergence time	This paper introduces an innovative frequency estimation approach that relies on a new and innovative structure for Kalman Filter (KF) in signal processing. Kalman Filtering, because of its state estimating nature, excels other methods in realtime processing. However, the main drawback of Kalman Filtering is that it involves time-consuming matrix operations which makes it inferior to faster methods like fast Fourier transform (FFT). The most evident privilege of the new structure is that it “synthesizes” the components rather than “extracts” them as standard Kalman Filter does. This parallel synthesis of signal components reduces the computational order of the Kalman Filter dramatically. In addition, in the proposed parallel structure, each component can be controlled separately by adjusting its own parameters. Hence, the convergence time and signalto-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved. This capability surpasses the proposed structure to both KF and FFT. Equations needed for these adjustments are derived analytically and by simulation.	computation;fast fourier transform;frequency band;kalman filter;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density estimation;the matrix;xfig	Reza Kazemi;Mohammad Rasouli;Fereidoon Behnia	2012	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-012-9429-7	adaptive filter;kalman filter;control engineering;mathematical optimization;invariant extended kalman filter;ensemble kalman filter;fast kalman filter;computer science;unscented transform;machine learning;root-raised-cosine filter;filtering problem;control theory;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;alpha beta filter	Robotics	61.32538868467427	14.001140440470135	72526

This is the case, for example, in speech processing, spike signals deconvolution or microarray data analysis. In this paper, we propose a simple method to reduce computational time for the inversion of Wiener systems or the separation of post-nonlinear mixtures, by using a linear approximation in a minimum mutual information algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that linear spline interpolation is fast and accurate, obtaining very good results (similar to those obtained without approximation) while computational time is dramatically decreased. On the other hand, cubic spline interpolation also obtains similar good results, but due to its intrinsic complexity, the global algorithm is much more slow and hence not useful for our purpose.	algorithm;computation;cubic hermite spline;cubic function;deconvolution;gradient;linear approximation;microarray;mutual information;nonlinear system;signal processing;simulation;source separation;speech processing;spline (mathematics);spline interpolation;time complexity	Jordi Solé i Casals;Cesar F.

The method of choice depends on the dimension of the problem as well as the structure of the covariance-(Σ) or precision matrix (Q). The most common black-box routine for computing a sample is based on Cholesky factorisation. In high dimensions, computing the Cholesky factor of Σ or Q may be prohibitive due to massive fill-in. We compare different methods for computing the samples iteratively adapting ideas from numerical linear algebra. These methods assume that matrix-vector products, Qv, are fast to compute. We show that some of the methods are competitive and faster than Cholesky sampling and that a parallel version of one method on a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) using CUDA can introduce a speed-up of up to 30x. Moreover, one method is used to sample from the posterior distribution of petroleum reservoir parameters in a North Sea field, given seismic reflection data on a large 3D grid.	black box;cuda;cholesky decomposition;graphics processing unit;iterative method;monoid factorisation;numerical linear algebra;numerical method;sampling (signal processing)	Erlend Aune;Jo Eidsvik;Yvo Pokern	2013	Statistics and Computing	10.1007/s11222-012-9326-8	sampling;mathematical optimization;reflection;theoretical computer science;approximation;mathematics;numerical linear algebra;minimum degree algorithm;cholesky decomposition;statistics;technology	HPC	65.4884662364911	14.090956267032832	72842

A univariate grid hierarchy is regular if all knots are equidistant on each level, and irregular otherwise. We use L-systems to design a wide class of systematically described irregular grid hierarchies. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions on the L-system which guarantee that the subdivision scheme, based on the non-uniform B-spline of degree d defined on the initial knot grid, is uniformly convergent. If n is the number of symbols in the alphabet of the L-system, this subdivision scheme is defined with a finite set of masks (at most n^d^+^1) which does not depend on the subdivision step. We provide an implementation of such schemes which is available as a worksheet for Sage software.	b-spline;converge;high- and low-level;l-system;multiresolution analysis;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);subdivision surface;the matrix;variable shadowing;whole earth 'lectronic link	Vincent Nivoliers;Cédric Gérot;Victor Ostromoukhov;Neil F.

A breeder genetic algorithm was needed due to the epistiasis phenomena, which is present for this type of adaptive filter. The results of the genetic algorithm were compared to the traditional statistical method and, we found that the breeder genetic algorithm was clearly superior (in accuracy) in most of the cases. However, the statistical least mean squares method is faster then the genetic algorithm. For this reason we suggest using the genetic algorithm for off-line adaptation.

In this paper, we propose a new method called vector-array decomposition (VAD) for decomposing the M-D complex array into the products of complex vectors and real arrays. Based on the VAD, the difficult problem of designing variable digital filters can be reduced to some easier subproblems that require one-dimensional (1-D) constant filter designs and M-D polynomial approximations. Since 1-D constant filters can be easily obtained by applying the well developed design techniques, and M-D polynomials can be obtained by utilizing least-squares curve-fitting, variable filters can be indirectly designed through solving the easier sub-problems. The VAD-based approach is straightforward and particularly efficient for designing variable filters with arbitrary variable magnitude responses and arbitrary phases.	digital filter	Tian-Bo Deng	2003		10.1109/ISCAS.2003.1205078	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;digital filter;information science;electrical engineering;mathematics;singular value decomposition;statistics	EDA	60.39277023808971	17.185881731106235	73642

The systems are driven by random stationary white processes (i.i.d. random input sequences) and disturbed by a zero-mean stationary, white or coloured, random noise. The prior knowledge about non-linear characteristics is non-parametric excluding implementation of standard parametric identification methods. To recover non-linearities, a class of Daubechies wavelet-based models using only input-output measurement data is introduced and their accuracy is investigated in the global MISE error sense. It is shown that the proposed models converge with a growing collection of data to the true non-linear characteristics (or their versions), provided that the complexity of the models is appropriately fitted to the number of measurements. Suitable rules for optimum model size selection, maximizing the convergence speed, are given and the asymptotic rate of convergence of the MISE error for optimum ...	daubechies wavelet;linear system;nonlinear system	Zygmunt Hasiewicz;Przemyslaw Sliwinski	2002	Int.

The switching in the graph of the sensor network may be due to local communication failures of the neighboring sensors or due to their movements. The network may have heterogeneous sensors with different measurement vectors of various combinations of states. Using a Kalman filter, the states of the target system are estimated at each node having only its local neighboring information. The network nodes cooperate locally with a packet-based communication to improve the estimation. Finally, numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the scheme. The results are compared with the centralized and local estimations.	centralized computing;kalman filter;network packet;numerical analysis;numerical method;sensor;stochastic process	Mazda Moattari;Vahid Johari Majd	2018	Inf.

The equivalence between the iterative update for following the path defined by this homotopy function and the general RLS update is derived.

Other design algorithms minimize the distortion using more or less realistic models of quantizers. In contrast, we propose a new type of alias compensation based on the reasonable assumption that perfect or even near-perfect reconstruction in general cannot be attained if the subband signals are manipulated in some way. Therefore, a mostly time-invariant behaviour of the overall system seems to be more desirable. The proposed algorithm is capable of designing a compensation lter bank which reduces aliasing while the desired time-invariant part of the original system is preserved as far as possible.	algorithm;aliasing;distortion;quantization (signal processing);sub-band coding;time-invariant system	Frank Heinle	1997		10.1109/ICASSP.1997.599572	signal reconstruction;sub-band coding;computer vision;transform coding;speech recognition;digital filter;computer science;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;band-pass filter;filter design	Vision	59.068611885023635	17.574085841121903	73754

A class of large-scale systems with decentralized information structures such as multi-agent systems can be represented by this form. In this paper, we investigate fundamental properties of such a system in terms of controllability, observability, and stability. Specifically, we first derive necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee controllability and observability of the system Q(s) based on those of subsystems Go(s) and 1/Phi(s). Then we present Nyquist-type stability criterion which can be reduced to a linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibility problem. Finally, we apply the results to stability analysis of a class of formation control and confirm the effectiveness of the approach as a general framework which can unify variety of results in the field.	computable function;consensus dynamics;control theory;information exchange;interconnection;linear matrix inequality;linear system;lyapunov fractal;multi-agent system;social inequality;system analysis;transfer function	Shinji Harat;Tomohisa Hayakawa;Hikaru Sugatat	2007	2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2007.4435000	control engineering;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	66.38325595435884	4.482422297377432	73921

Agents receive private signals about an unknown state of the world. The underlying state is globally identifiable, yet informative signals may be dispersed throughout the network. Using an optimization-based framework, we develop an iterative local strategy for updating individual beliefs. In contrast to the existing literature which focuses on asymptotic learning, we provide a finite-time analysis. Furthermore, we introduce a Kullback-Leibler cost to compare the efficiency of the algorithm to its centralized counterpart. Our bounds on the cost are expressed in terms of network size, spectral gap, centrality of each agent and relative entropy of agents' signal structures. A key observation is that distributing more informative signals to central agents results in a faster learning rate. Furthermore, optimizing the weights, we can speed up learning by improving the spectral gap. We also quantify the effect of link failures on learning speed in symmetric networks. We finally provide numerical simulations for our method which verify our theoretical results.	algorithm;centrality;centralized computing;computer simulation;information;iterative method;kullback–leibler divergence;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;network topology;numerical analysis	Shahin Shahrampour;Alexander Rakhlin;Ali Jadbabaie	2016	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2015.2506903	algorithm design;entropy;estimation;convergence;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;control theory;mathematics;silicon;statistics	ML	63.05651856337656	8.169270322917122	75140
67e99c791193c70dfab5f09fdfe1489f749a5f9d	joint state and parameter estimation for hidden wide-sense stationary arma processes under unknown noise		The wide-sense auto-regressive moving-average (ARMA) model is widely applied into varieties of fields. The unknown bounded parameter estimation of an ARMA model is an extremely vital research subject. Up to recent, most research is conducted with the known disturbing environment noise or the model of the known noise with the unknown variance. Actually the disturbing noise in the modern control system is really complex and unknown. To the best of our knowledge, less attention on the unknown boundary parameter estimation for the wide-sense stationary hidden ARMA process with unknown noise is paid. In this paper, a dual particle filter-based method to estimate the state and unknown bounded parameter jointly for the hidden wide-sense ARMA processes under the unknown noise is presented, which includes two steps. In the first step, the kernel smoothing particle filter algorithm is utilized to estimate the unknown bounded ARMA model parameter. And sufficient statistics based on Beta distribution is utilized to approach the posterior distribution of the parameter. In the second step, the particle filter algorithm is utilized to estimate the state of an ARMA model with the model parameter obtained in the first step. For the noise model is extremely unknown, the Gaussian mixture model is adopted to approach the posterior probability function in the EM algorithm. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	control system;estimation theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;marginal model;mixture model;particle filter;peterson's algorithm;simulation;smoothing;stationary process	Shuhui Li;Xiaoxue Feng;Feng Pan	2017	2017 20th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)	10.23919/ICIF.2017.8009792	expectation–maximization algorithm;stationary process;mixture model;particle filter;hidden markov model;estimation theory;kernel smoother;mathematical optimization;autoregressive–moving-average model;mathematics	ML	56.18500912409106	6.377540954061257	75203

Cojugate gradient is well known as a fast algorithm for linear quadratic problems. Here we develop a nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm for the ℓ1 penalized least squares problem. This new method uses no line search and is found to be very stable.

By using a lemma in algebraic graph theory and introducing a projection operator in adaptive law, a novel distributed adaptive state feedback controller is designed with quantised relative state information. It is shown that the practical consensus for multi-agent systems with a uniform quantiser is achieved via the Lyapunov theory and the non-smooth analysis. In contrast with the existing quantised controllers, which rely on the minimum nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, the developed controller is only dependent on the number of nodes. Furthermore, a dynamic output feedback controller based on quantised relative output information is proposed. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.	multi-agent system	Chao Deng;Guang-Hong yang	2017	Int. J.

The concept of control topology is introduced to describe the whole controller structure, which consists of some directed connections between nodes. The control topology can be designed either to be the same as the non-delayed coupling topology of the network, or to be independent of the intrinsic network topology. Based on the concept of control topology, an impulsive controller is designed to achieve the exponential synchronization of CDNs, and moreover, the exponential convergence rate can be specified. Illustrated examples have been given to show the effectiveness of the proposed impulsive distributed control strategy.	control theory;coupling (physics);distributed control system;network topology;rate of convergence;time complexity	Zhi-Hong Guan;Zhi-Wei Liu;Gang Feng;Yan-Wu Wang	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2009.2037848	control engineering;real-time computing;complex dynamics;convergence;computer science;control theory;network topology	Embedded	66.50073774407278	5.529251416825798	75811

The problem is transformed into an unconstrained one by choosing a null matrix orthogonal to the derivative constraint matrix. In this paper, subband decomposition using wavelet filters is employed to construct the null matrix. Taking advantage of the vanishing moment property of the wavelet filters, the proposed method can adjust the null width of the notch filter for eliminating the intractable iterference by controlling the regularity of the wavelet filters. Simulation results show that the new method can offer comparable performance as those of the existing full-rank-based ones and thus provides a promising alternative to the existing works. key words: notch filters, subband decomposition, wavelet filters	computational complexity theory;finite impulse response;frequency response;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;qr decomposition;simulation;wavelet transform	Yung-Yi Wang;Ying Lu	2007	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietfec/e90-a.6.1224	mathematical optimization;computer science;electrical engineering;control theory;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;band-stop filter	Robotics	60.1184092472554	15.844368364538084	75941

The class of transformations used is that of Box and Cox[1], in which the actual transformation is defined by a single parameter λ, unknown a priori. The relevant Bayesian analysis is indicated, after which an expected quadratic approximation to the response surface in the vicinity of the optimum is developed. The procedure of the previous paper[5] can be applied to this approximation, but the posterior variances now include terms representing uncertainties in both parameters and model. The resultant criterion is similar to that for pure quadratic surfaces, but contains extra terms in the ‘D’ matrix, one of which terms is non-linear (but easily linearized).	experiment;response surface methodology	T.

The group cooperative objective is to achieve finite-time formation control for the upper layer of leaders and containment control for the lower layer of followers. Two kinds of cooperative strategies, including centralized-distributed control and distributed-distributed control, are proposed for two types of switching laws: 1) random switching law with the dwell time and 2) Markov switching law with stationary distribution. Utilizing the state transition matrix methods and matrix measure techniques, some sufficient conditions are derived for asymptotical containment control and exponential almost sure containment control, respectively.

b996bbc643b178c9218ac8cc67c162ca9d07c557	optimal design techniques for distributed parameter systems		A wide number of inverse problems consist in selecting best parameter values of a given mathematical model based fits to measured data. These are usually formulated as optimization problems and the accuracy of their solutions depends not only on the chosen optimization scheme but also on the given data. The problem of collecting data in the “best way” in order to assure a statistically efficient estimate of the parameter is known as Optimal Design. In this work we consider the problem of finding optimal locations for source identification in the 3D unit sphere from data on its boundary. We apply three different optimal design criteria to this 3D problem: the Incremental Generalized Sensitivity Function (IGSF), the classical D-optimal criterion and the SE-criterion recently introduced in [3]. The estimation of the parameters is then obtained by means of the Ordinary Least Square procedure on the resulting optimal observation points and compared to that for a uniform observation mesh.. In order to analyze the performance of each strategy, the data are numerically simulated and the estimated values are compared with the values used for simulation.	approximation error;authorization;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;eisenstein's criterion;fits;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;nl (complexity);nl-complete;numerical analysis;numerical aperture;operational amplifier;optimal design;optimization problem;ordinary least squares;pseudorandom noise;simulation	H.

The two theorems complement each other in the sense that the first one is formulated in terms of the states of the agents in the multi-agent system, whereas the second one is formulated in terms of the pairwise states for each pair of agents in the multi-agent system. In the first theorem, under the assumption that the interconnection topology is uniformly strongly connected and that the agents are contained in a compact set, a strong form of attractiveness of the consensus set is assured. In the second theorem, under the weaker assumption that the interconnection topology is uniformly quasi strongly connected, the consensus set is guaranteed to be uniformly asymptotically stable.	interconnection;lyapunov fractal;multi-agent system;strongly connected component	Johan Thunberg;Xiaoming Hu	2013	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	AI	64.81182717147153	5.93715479750212	78144

Due to the intrinsic nature of the measurement noises, a strategy of lowpass filtering followed by instantaneous sampling is used for obtaining data from the system. A previously developed covariance function based parameter estimation method is first slightly improved. Thereafter, it is analyzed by evaluating the covariance matrix of the estimated parameter vector. Three different expressions for a generic element of an intermediate matrix in the expression for the covariance matrix are derived. One exact but computationally demanding, one approximate valid for small sampling intervals, and one exact for the case when the sampling interval tends to zero. The covariance matrix can be used for studying the influence of some user parameters, including the choice of the lowpass filter, on the quality of the estimated parameter vector.	approximation algorithm;density matrix;errors-in-variables models;estimation theory;low-pass filter;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;newton's method;profiling (computer programming);sampling (signal processing)	Magnus Mossberg	2016	2016 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2016.7810480	estimation of covariance matrices;econometrics;covariance intersection;covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;covariance;mathematics;statistics;covariance function	ML	55.49834943729072	11.907633618163779	78193

However, the OBE convergence rate is dependent on the pointwise “tightness” of the model error-bound estimates. Since the least upper bound on the model error is often unknown, the convergence rate is compromised by the need to overestimate errorbounds lest the integrity of the process be violated by underestimation. We present an effective underbounding safeguard against system model violations in OBE processing. Simulation examples in state estimation and speech processing demonstrate the efficacy of the under-bounding safeguard.	algorithm;rate of convergence;simulation;speech processing	Dale Joachim;John R.

Based on noncausal autoregressive (AR) modeling of the output signals and three theorems, these equations are derived for the cases of 2nd-, 3rd and 4th-order cumulants, respectively, and can be expressed as identical or similar forms. The algorithms constructed from these equations are simpler in form, but can offer more accurate results than the existing methods. Since the inverse filter coefficients are simply the solution of a set of linear equations, their uniqueness can normally be guaranteed. Simulations are presented for the cases of skewed series, unskewed continuous series and unskewed discrete series. The results of these simulations confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the algorithms.

Both leader-follower and leaderless networks are studied. For leader-follower networks, sufficient conditions are established regarding the connectivity of communication graphs for the network to achieve global exponential or asymptotic synchronization, respectively, for directed and undirected communications. For leaderless networks, sufficient conditions for asymptotic norm synchronization are established, respectively, for directed and undirected communications, in the sense that the norm of agents' states converges to a common value. We also show that if the communication graph is fixed, norm synchronization leads to state synchronization. The results reveal some important similarities and differences between leaderless and leader-follower networks for synchronization under directed switching communication graphs.	graph (discrete mathematics);linear time-invariant theory;multi-agent system;time complexity;time-invariant system	Tao Yang;Ziyang Meng;Guodong Shi;Yiguang Hong;Karl Henrik Johansson	2014	Proceeding of the 11th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation		control engineering;synchronization;synchronization networks;network switch;computer science;multi-agent system;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing;network topology;computer network;symmetric matrix	Metrics	64.54167651327961	5.903902162963472	78303

Different from the single-target tracking problem, the two-target tracking one has to consider the interaction between followers in different groups. Based on a new flocking control algorithm and distributed filter, all mobile sensors can split into two groups to track their own target and form a cohesive flock with their neighbors. Stability analysis is conducted based on cascading Lyapunov method and matrix theory. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for the convergence is given in the form of the boundary conditions of feedback gains. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed theoretical results.		Housheng Su;Zhenghao Li;Michael Z. Q. Chen	2017	J.

Often this assumption produces undesirable end effects which are particularly severe when the signals are short in duration. This paper presents an approach to discrete convolution which obviates the zero assumption. The method is structurally similar to the Burg method [l], which estimates the autocorrelation coefficients of a series in a manner which does not require a predefinition of the behavior of the signal outside of the known interval. The basic principle of the present approach is that each term of the convolution is recursively determined from previous terms in a manner consistent with the optimal modeling of one signal into the other. The recursion uses forward and backward modeling together with the Morf et al. [2] algorithm for computation of the prediction error filter. The method is illustrated by application to the computation of the analytic signal and the derivative.	algorithm;analytic signal;autocorrelation;coefficient;computation;convolution;fast fourier transform;recursion	Milton José Porsani;Tadeusz J.

The formulae presented here are more accurate than the ones found in the literature for the PU-NLMS algorithm. Thereafter, the ideas of the partial-update NLMS-type algorithms found in the literature are incorporated in the framework of set-membership filtering, from which data-selective NLMS-type algorithms with partial-update are derived. The new algorithms, referred to herein as the set-membership partial-update normalized least-mean square (SM-PU-NLMS) algorithms, combine the data-selective updating from set-membership filtering with the reduced computational complexity from partial updating. A thorough discussion of the SM-PU-NLMS algorithms follows, whereby we propose different update strategies and provide stability analysis and closed-form formulae for excess mean-squared error (MSE). Simulation results verify the analysis for the PU-NLMS algorithm and the good performance of the SM-PU-NLMS algorithms in terms of convergence speed, final misadjustment, and computational complexity.	algorithm;least mean squares filter	Stefan Werner;Marcello Luiz Rodrigues de Campos;Paulo S.

Such negative edges may prevent a network from performing cooperative tasks such as achieving consensus, creating a need for new control-theoretic techniques that guarantee performance in the presence of negative edges. This paper considers the problem of selecting leader nodes to maintain a fixed state in order to steer the remaining nodes to a desired state value in networks with negative edges. We present two sufficient conditions that are equivalent to submodular constraints on the set of leader nodes. The first constraint is based on the graph spectrum, while the second is formulated in terms of the determinant of the Laplacian matrix. We prove that both conditions can be formulated as submodular constraints on the set of leader nodes, leading to polynomial-time algorithms with provable approximation guarantees for selecting a minimum-size set of leader nodes to satisfy these conditions. Furthermore, we introduce necessary conditions for consensus and prove that a set of leader nodes satisfying these conditions can be selected in polynomial time. We characterize the requirements for leader selection in order to ensure consensus in line networks. The results are illustrated through numerical study.	algorithm;approximation;consensus (computer science);graph (discrete mathematics);interaction;laplacian matrix;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;polynomial;provable prime;requirement;spectral graph theory;submodular set function;time complexity	Andrew Clark;Qiqiang Hou;Linda Bushnell;Radha Poovendran	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963139	discrete mathematics;submodular set function;time complexity;approximation algorithm;laplacian matrix;mathematical optimization;symmetric matrix;mathematics;graph;convergence (routing)	Robotics	64.04007525964688	7.142432717344602	80450

An input signal may be decomposed into a number of subsignals, and their spectrum may be exchanged and modified on a specified time-frequency plane in real time processing. The multirate filters are constructed based on wellknown QMF bank structures. In our structure, once QMF banks are designed, adaptive processing may be realized with a simpler procedure. In a design, by intre ducing bifrequency maps, we formulate the multirate filters design completely. Design examples and experimental simulations are shown. One example includes an adaptive spectrum scrambling filter which can be applied in vehicle telephones for more secure communication.	quadrature mirror filter;real-time computing;secure communication;simulation	Shigeo Wada	1996		10.1109/ICASSP.1996.544099	adaptive filter;time–frequency analysis;telecommunications;computer science	Robotics	58.24978541587202	17.293277639682636	80502

The input is an autoregressive process and the coeecients of the generating lter are allowed to change with time, leading to a time varying autocorrelation function at the input. For such an input the optimal Wiener-Hopf coeecients of a lattice l-ter are found. These are then compared with the expected PARCOR coeecients of the recursive least squares lattice l-ter which are a function of the weighting parameter. It is shown that the PARCOR coeecients of the RLS lattice lter have two terms and tend to the Wiener-Hopf optimal weights asymptotically.	algorithm;autocorrelation;autoregressive model;coefficient;population parameter;recursion;recursive least squares filter;restless legs syndrome;weight	Tarun Soniy;James R.

The effect of the correlation structure of the signals on the Cramer-Rao bounds is studied for both the single and multiple experiment cases. The best and worst conditions are found using various criteria. The results are applied to the example of parameter estimation of superimposed sinusoids, or plane-wave direction finding in white Gaussian noise, and best and worst conditions on the correlation structure and relative phase of the sinusoids are found. This provides useful information on the limits of the resolvability of sinusoid signals in time series analysis or of plane waves in array processing. The conditions are also useful for designing worst-case simulation studies of estimation algorithms, and for the design of minimax signal acquisition and estimation procedures, as demonstrated by an example. >		Sze Fong Yau;Yoram Bresler	1992	IEEE Trans.

The optimization consists of transforming the approximate joint diagonalization in SOBI into a properly weighted Least-Squares problem, with the asymptotically optimal weights specified in terms of the estimated correlations. However, only correlations up to the lag of the maximal MA order were used. Somewhat counter-intuitively, it turns out that estimated correlation matrices beyond this lag are also useful, although the respective true correlations are known to be zero and have no direct dependence on the mixing matrix. Nevertheless, when properly incorporated into the weighted least-squares problem, these estimated matrices can significantly improve performance, since they bear information on the estimation errors of the shorter-lags matrices. In this paper we show how to modify the WASOBI algorithm accordingly, and demonstrate the improvement via analysis and simulation results.	approximation algorithm;asymptotically optimal algorithm;blind signal separation;least squares;mathematical optimization;maximal set;mixture model;simulation;trix (operating system)	Arie Yeredor;Eran Doron	2002	2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference		econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	ML	58.4413344054696	11.478191293144342	80661

The proposed approach is adaptive update of a Gaussian kernel width considering the geometric property of positivity of the width. Least-square type rules that update the width on the set of positive real numbers with appropriate transformation are proposed. These update rules are incorporated with the l1-regularized least squares for updating the filter coefficients of kernel adaptive filtering. This double adaptation strategy for both the filter coefficients and the kernel width can greatly increase the generalization ability with a small number of kernel functions.	adaptive filter;coefficient;kernel (operating system);least squares;type rule	Tomoya Wada;Toshihisa Tanaka	2017	2017 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC)	10.1109/APSIPA.2017.8282173	gaussian function;filter (signal processing);kernel (statistics);mathematical optimization;kernel (linear algebra);nonlinear system;mathematics;filter design;small number;adaptive filter	AI	61.36467386331359	13.435422700350582	81390

However, recent low rate sampling schemes have shown that these sparse signals can be sampled with perfect reconstruction at their rate of innovation. To reach this goal in the presence of noise, an estimation procedure is needed to estimate the time-delay and the amplitudes of each pulse. To assess the quality of any unbiased estimator, it is standard to use the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) which provides a lower bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of any unbiased estimator. In this work, analytic expressions of the Cramér-Rao Bound are proposed for an arbitrary number of filtered pulses. Using orthogonality properties on the filtering kernels, an approximate compact expression of the CRB is provided. The choice of the kernel is discussed from the point of view of the estimation accuracy.	approximation algorithm;bandlimiting;image noise;kernel (operating system);mean squared error;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);shannon (unit);sparse matrix	Stephanie Bernhardt;Rémy Boyer;Sylvie Marcos;Yonina C.

To improve convergence rate and steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) of the APA, the step size variation concept based on theoretical MSD has been researched. However, structurally, the APA based on theoretical MSD cannot track the system change without the reset algorithm. The problem is, the reset algorithm would not operate when the system change occurs at early iteration. To overcome this drawback, we propose the variable step size APA attaching the noise-error relation. We apply it to a recent variable step-size APA, which is the optimal step-size APA (OS-APA), then the simulation results show that the proposed APA tracks the system change well without the reset algorithm, and has similar performance compared to the OS-APA for all iterations.	algorithm;iteration;mean squared error;operating system;rate of convergence;simulation;stationary process;steady state	Seung Hun Kim;Jae Jin Jeong;Gyogwon Koo;Sang Woo Kim	2014	2014 19th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing	10.1109/ICDSP.2014.6900824	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;affine shape adaptation;affine combination;statistics	EDA	59.789757097284436	12.603543271422058	81780

The reformulation builds upon a compact parameterization, which models the row-norms of the sparse signal representation as parameters of interest, resulting in a significant reduction of the MMV problem size. Given the sparse vector of row-norms, the joint sparse signal can be computed from the MMVs in closed form. For the special case of uniform linear sampling, we present an extension of the compact formulation for gridless parameter estimation by means of semidefinite programming. Furthermore, we derive in this case from our compact problem formulation the exact equivalence between the ℓ2,1 mixed-norm minimization and the atomic-norm minimization.	analysis of algorithms;compressed sensing;computational complexity theory;estimation theory;loss function;maxima and minima;multiuse model view;nim;numerical analysis;optimization problem;spice;sampling (signal processing);semidefinite programming;signal reconstruction;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;turing completeness	Christian Steffens;Marius Pesavento;Marc E.

This sliding-window spectrum is a function of two variables: a discrete time index, which represents the position of the window, and a continuous frequency variable. It is shown that the signal can be reconstructed from the sampled sliding-window spectrum, i.e., from the values at the points of a certain time-frequency lattice. This sampling lattice is rectangular, and the rectangular cells occupy an area of 27r in the time-frequency domain. It is shown that an elegant way to represent the signal directly in terms of the sample values of the sliding-window spectrum, is in the form of Gabor’s signal representation. Therefore, a reciprocal window is introduced, and it is shown how the window and the reciprocal window are related. Gabor’s signal representation then expands the signal in terms of properly shifted and modulated versions of the reciprocal window, and the expansion coefficients are just the values of the sampled sliding-window spectrum. S INTRODUCTION HORT-TIME Fourier analysis [ l ] of discrete-time signals is of considerable interest in a number of signalprocessing applications. In order to study spectral properties of speech signals, for instance, the concept of a short-time Fourier transform of the signal is very convenient [ 11, [2]. Such a short-time Fourier transform is usually constructed by first multiplying the signal by a window function that is “slided” to a certain position, and then Fourier transforming the “windowed” signal. Therefore, we like to consider’the short-time Fourier transform as a sliding-window representation of the signal. There are other interpretations, of the short-time Fourier transform, including a well-knowPfilter bank interpretation [ 11. However, for the purpose of this paper, we find the slidingwindow interpretation to be the most appropriate, and, to emphasize this, we shall call the short-time Fourier transform the sliding-window spectrum of the signal. The sliding-window representation of a signal, which is a signal description in time and frequency simultaneously, is complete in the sense that the signal can be reconstructed from its sliding-window spectrum [ 11. However, to reconstruct the signal, we need not know the entire slidingwindow spectrum. In this paper we show that it suffices to know the values of the sliding-window spectrum only at the points of a certain rectangdar lattice in the time-frequency domain, and we describe how the signal Manuscript received January 17, 1984; revised January 2, 1985. The author i s with the Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven, Afdeling der Elektrotechniek, Postbus 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands. BASTIAANS can be expressed directly in terms of the values of this sampled sliding-window spectrum. This will lead us in a natural way to Gabor’s representation [3] of a signal as a superposition of properly shifted and modulated versions of a function that is related to the window. We show a way to determine this function from the knowledge of the window, and we elucidate this with some simple examples of window functions. SLIDING-WINDOW REPRESENTATION F DISCRETE-TIME SIGNALS Let x(n) (n = + . , 1, 0, 1, * a ) denote a one-dimensional discrete-time signal and let w(n) represent a window sequence; the signal and the window may take complex values and they need not have a finite extent. We multiply the signal by a shifted and complex conjugated version of the window and take the Fourier transform of the product, thus constructing the function [cf. [l], (6.1)] f ( ~ ! , n) = C i (m> w*(m n) exp [ j ~ ! m ] . (1) Unlike (6.1) in [ l ] , (1) uses a complex conjugated version of the window; moreover, the window has not been timereversed. The only reason for doing this is to get more elegant formulas in the remainder of the paper. We shall callf(Q, n) the sliding-window spectrum [cf. [4], Section 4.11 of the discrete-time signal; it is clearly a function of two variables: the time index n , which is discrete and represents the position of the window, and the frequency variable L!, which is continuous. Of course, as in the case of normal Fourier transforms of discrete-time signals, the sliding-window spectrum f(Q, n) is periodic in L! with period 2n. Two choices of window sequences are of special interest. If w(n) vanishes for n # 0, then f ( 0 , n) is proportional to the signal x ( n ) ; the sliding-window spectrum thus reduces to a pure time representation of the signal. If, on the other hand, w(n) does not depend on n, thenf(Q, 0) is proportional to the Fourier transform of x ( n ) ; the sliding-window spectrum then reduces to a pure frequency representation of the signal. In general, however, the sliding-window spectrum is an intermediate signal description between the pure time and the pure frequency representation. We can reconstruct the signal x(n) from its sliding-window spectrum f(Q, n ) in the usual way [cf. [ l ] , (6.6)] by inverse Fourier transforming and taking m = n, which 03		Martin J.

This class of methods corresponds to a particular regularized least-squares methodology that may achieve a favorable bias/variance trade-off compared with classical Prediction Error Minimization (PEM) methods. However, to fully exploit this property, the kernel function itself needs to be appropriately designed for the identification problem at hand to be able to successfully capture all relevant aspects of the datagenerating system. Hence, there is a need for a methodology that can accomplish this design step without affecting the simplicity of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a systematic kernel construction mechanism to capture dynamic system behavior via the use of orthonormal basis functions (OBFs). Two special cases are investigated as an illustration of the construction mechanism, namely Laguerre and Kautz based kernel structures. Monte-Carlo simulations show that OBFsbased kernels with Laguerre basis perform well compared with stable spline/TC kernels, especially for slow systems with dominant poles close to the unit circle. Moreover, the capability of Kautz basis to model resonant systems is also shown.	basis function;dynamical system;kernel (operating system);least squares;linear time-invariant theory;monte carlo method;norm (social);simulation;spline (mathematics);system identification;time complexity;time-invariant system;vii	Mohamed M.

We build our framework in the Euclidean space using Fourier tools and on the sphere using spherical harmonics. We further provide a theoretical background that explains how our spherical framework can be extended to the hemispherical domain. We use our framework to estimate the variance convergence rate of different state-of-the-art sampling patterns in both the Euclidean and spherical domains, as the number of samples increases. Furthermore, we formulate design principles for constructing sampling methods that can be tailored according to available resources. We validate our theoretical framework by performing numerical integration over several integrands sampled using different sampling patterns.	monte carlo integration;monte carlo method;numerical analysis;numerical integration;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);spectral density estimation	Adrien Pilleboue;Gurprit Singh;David Coeurjolly;Michael M.

In particular, we consider the following two design problems: (i) the  nodal-frequency design problem , in which we tune the natural frequencies of the oscillators given the topology of the network, and (ii) the (robust) edge-weight design problem, in which we design the edge weights assuming that the natural frequencies are given (or belong to a given convex uncertainty set). For both problems, we optimize an objective function of the design variables while considering a desired level of phase cohesiveness as our design constraint. This constraint defines a convex set in the nodal-frequency design problem. In contrast, in the edge-weight design problem, the phase cohesiveness constraint yields a non-convex set, unless the underlying network is either a tree or an arbitrary graph with identical edge weights. We then propose a convex semidefinite relaxation to approximately solve the (non-convex) edge-weight design problem for general (possibly cyclic) networks with nonidentical edge weights. We illustrate the applicability of our results by analyzing several network design problems of practical interest, such as power redispatch in power grids, sparse network design, (robust) network design for distributed wireless analog clocks, and the detection of edges leading to the Braess’ paradox in power grids.	network planning and design	Mahyar Fazlyab;Florian Dörfler;Victor M.

This paper derives a new and more accurate analytical result for the expected misadjustment in the LMS weight vector due to FP effects. Whereas previous results have been applicable only during steady state, the results of this present paper are applicable to both the transient adaptation period and steady state. Experimental data are then presented which show the new analytical results to be valid for approximating the weight misadjustment during the transient adaptation period over a wide range of filter and data values.

An adaptation step-size parameter for the algorithm is worked out from the output signal and the gradient signal. The adaptive algorithm is used for detection of a sinusoid with additive white Gaussian noise, impulse noise and cancellation of 50-Hz interference in the recording of electrocardiogram signals. The performance of this algorithm is proved here to give high convergence speed, high impulse noise robustness and good efficiency of 50-Hz interference cancellation. Finally, the results of computer simulation are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm for the adaptive IIR notch filter.	algorithm;gradient;infinite impulse response	C.

16e642ba7812d0f369fdf93212197750cd7ace80	a new robust adaptive algorithm for underwater acoustic channel equalization		We introduce a novel family of adaptive robust equalizers for highly challenging underwater acoustic (UWA) channel equalization. Since the underwater environment is highly non-stationary and subjected to impulsive noise, we use adaptive filtering techniques based on a relative logarithmic cost function inspired by the “competitive methods” from the online learning literature. To improve the convergence performance of the conventional linear equalization methods, while mitigating the stability issues, we intrinsically combine different norms of the error in the cost function, using logarithmic functions. Hence, we achieve a comparable convergence performance to least mean fourth (LMF) equalizer, while significantly enhancing the stability performance in such an adverse communication medium. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms through highly realistic experiments performed on accurately simulated underwater acoustic channels.	academy;acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive algorithm;adaptive filter;bit error rate;computational complexity theory;decibel;design by contract;eb-eye;equalization (communications);experiment;least mean squares filter;lexical markup framework;loss function;signal-to-noise ratio;stationary process	Dariush Kari;Muhammed O.

These tasks are achieved by recent coverage algorithms, based upon the classic methods by Lloyd. These algorithms however rely upon critical requirements on the communication network: information is exchanged synchronously among all agents and long-range communication is sometimes required. This work proposes novel coverage algorithms that require only gossip communication, i.e., asynchronous, pairwise, and possibly unreliable communication. Which robot pair communicates at any given time may be selected deterministically or randomly. A key innovative idea is describing coverage algorithms for robot deployment and environment partitioning as dynamical systems on a space of partitions. In other words, we study the evolution of the regions assigned to each agent rather than the evolution of the agents’ positions. The proposed gossip algorithms are shown to converge to centroidal Voronoi partitions under mild technical conditions. Our treatment features a broad variety of results in topology, analysis and geometry. First, we establish the compactness of a suitable space of partitions with respect to the symmetric difference metric. Second, with respect to this metric, we establish the continuity of various geometric maps, including the Voronoi diagram as a function of its generators, the location of a centroid as a function of a set, and the widely-known multicenter function studied in facility location problems. Third, we prove two convergence theorems for dynamical systems on metric spaces described by deterministic and stochastic switches.	algorithm;autonomous robot;converge;dynamical system;map;mobile agent;network switch;randomness;requirement;scott continuity;software deployment;telecommunications network;voronoi diagram	Francesco Bullo;Ruggero Carli;Paolo Frasca	2012	SIAM J.

Complex signals are treated as pairs of real signals, and operations are re-organized on a real arithmetic basis. A new set of signals and filtering parameters is introduced, which are expressed either as the sum, or as the difference between the real and the imaginary part of the original variables. The algorithmic strength reduction technique is subsequently applied, resulting in significant computational savings. In this way, an efficient, FRLS algorithm is derived, where only two real valued filters are propagated, based on novel three-terms recursions for the time updating of the pertinent parameters. The proposed algorithm is implemented using real valued arithmetic only, whilst reducing the number of the required real valued multiplication operations by 23.5%, at the expense of a marginal 2.9% increase in the number of the real valued additions. The performance of the proposed FRLS algorithm is investigated by computer simulations, in the context of adaptive system identification and adaptive channel equalization.	recursion;recursive least squares filter	George-Othon Glentis	2005	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2005.03.013	computer simulation;adaptive filter;computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;adaptive system;signal processing;mathematics;algorithm	Vision	58.96005293712807	14.04670463507548	84487

The inner filters are supplemented by lateral narrow-band low- and high-pass FIR filters. The concept of such isoextremal polynomials of this kind enables flexibility in the resulting frequency response of the filter bank. The filter banks presented here are made under the constraint of the resulting frequency response with a constant value for all frequencies.	erdős–rényi model;filter bank;finite impulse response;frequency response;kalman filter;lateral thinking;linear phase;polynomial;the filter	Pavel Zahradnik;Miroslav Vlcek	2012	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2012.2218453	adaptive filter;network synthesis filters;frequency response;electronic engineering;low-pass filter;telecommunications;computer science;chebyshev filter;finite impulse response;root-raised-cosine filter;linear filter;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;band-pass filter;constant k filter;electronic filter topology;filter design;prototype filter;high-pass filter;infinite impulse response;composite image filter;half-band filter;polynomial;m-derived filter	Visualization	59.76590942705946	18.08831402569749	84545

The method can be used to interpolate N-dimensional discrete signals such as audio, images, and 3D medical imaging. As opposed to conventional interpolation methods, where uniform zero-insertion (expansion) is performed prior to low-pass filtering, the proposed method inserts zeros in a blue-noise pattern, which has been shown most appropriate for this application. This interpolation method attenuates undesired replicas solely by the act of noisy zero-insertion, resulting in relaxed requirements on the order of the interpolation filter, thereby reducing the required computations. This work shows that an N/sup th/ order blue noise pattern reduces the filter order by N.	colors of noise;computation;interpolation;low-pass filter;medical imaging;order by;requirement	Zeljko Ignjatovic;Mark F.

Previous research on this problem establishes group stabilization by assuming that the dynamic topology is connected all the time, which however cannot be guaranteed by most proposed distributed control laws. In this paper, a distributed algorithm to distill a necessary subgraph of the initial communication topology is presented. This subgraph covers all the vertices of the communication topology and is proved to be connected as long as the initial communication topology is connected. A distributed control law is then designed to pursue the flocking motion while preserving all the edges in this subgraph. In this way, connectivity can be preserved all the time, and flocking problem is thus solved only provided the initial communication topology of multi-agent system is connected.	dynamical system	Xiaoli Li;Yugeng Xi	2008	J.

The nonlinear filter possesses a recursive structure and provides an estimate of the original sample and the impulse height. The impulse detector is realized as a radial basis function network and yields a fuzzy decision about the impulsivity of a sample. Due to the special combination of both systems, we need only a small number of parameters which can be computed recursively using a procedure derived from a joint optimality criterion. Thereby, we achieve a dramatic gain in performance over other existing methods for both weakly and highly corrupted signals. Further, the algorithm preserves signal details and edges and is applicable to arbitrary impulse distributions.	algorithm;finite impulse response;impulse noise (audio);infinite impulse response;nonlinear system;optimality criterion;radial basis function network;recursion;zero suppression	Ralph Sucher	1995		10.1109/ICIP.1995.529576	nonlinear filter;computer vision;impulse invariance;digital filter;performance;impulse response;impulse noise;computer science;noise;machine learning;finite impulse response;signal processing;linear filter;control theory;mathematics;infinite impulse response;radial basis function network;parameter;statistics;detection theory;recursive filter	ML	58.71601030544133	15.529317892819025	86140

First, we show that, under certain conditions, estimation error of the CKF remains bounded. Further, we show that the careful selection of noise covariance matrices can enhance the filter stability against large estimation error. A modified-CKF is then proposed to improve the stability while reducing the steady state error. The proposed modified-CKF uses adaptive process and measurement noise covariances to cope with large estimation errors, and an ellipsoidal measurement validation gate to reject measurement outliers. Theoretical findings are verified by a series of numerical simulations. The simulation results signify that when the estimation error is large, traditional-CKF may lead instability while the modified-CKF rapidly converges to the true states. Further, the results show that the use of measurement validation gate can improve the robustness of the modified-CKF against measurement outliers.	algorithm;computer simulation;extended validation certificate;instability;kalman filter;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical integration;rate of convergence;steady state	Thumeera R.

The most basic method to preserve connectivity is to have each agent preserve its set of neighbors for all time. More advanced methods preserve a (minimum) spanning tree in the network. Other methods are based on increasing the algebraic graph connectivity, which is given by the second smallest eigenvalue λ2(L) of the graph Laplacian λ2(L) that represents the network. These methods typically result in a monotonic increase in connectivity until the network is completely connected. In previous work by the authors, a continuous feedback control method had been proposed which allows the connectivity to decrease, that is, edges in the network may be broken. This method requires agents to have knowledge of the entire network. In this paper, we modify the controller to use only local information. The connectivity controller is based on maximization of λ2(L) and artificial potential functions and can be used in conjunction with artificial potential-based formation controllers. The controllers are extended for implementation on nonholonomic-wheeled mobile robots, and the performance is demonstrated in an experiment on a team of wheeled mobile robots.	connectivity (graph theory);consensus dynamics;expectation–maximization algorithm;feedback;laplacian matrix;linear algebra;minimum spanning tree;mobile robot	Hasan Poonawala;Aykut C.

By regarding these elements nonlinearly parameterized by SP in DTM as a group of new multiplicative parameters (MP) linearly coupled with system state, the original SP identification problem is equivalently transferred into that of MP. By doing this, MP exhibits linearity characteristic so that we propose a new EM algorithm to analytically identify MP with both accuracy and efficiency, instead of SP. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated in an example of estimating the turn rate in maneuvering target tracking.	approximation;directx plugin;expectation–maximization algorithm;linear system;nonlinear system;simulation;smoothing;stochastic matrix;whole earth 'lectronic link	Bao Song;Xiaoxu Wang;Yan Liang;Quan Pan	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525185	kalman filter;control engineering;atmospheric model;mathematical optimization;estimation;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;linear system;approximation algorithm;statistics	ML	57.648641116327184	5.891246144912474	86859

The Randon Finite Set (RFS) or Finite Set Statistics (FISST) approach is a rigorous and systematic framework for estimation in multi-object systems. The centrepiece of this framework is the so called Bayes multi-object filter, a theoretically sound yet computationally challenging recursion, which propagates the multi-object posterior density. Well known and tractable yet efficient recursive solutions for multi-object estimation, based on approximations of the Bayes multi-object filter, currently exist via moments and parameterizations. This paper summarizes new results which present a conjugate or exact closed form solution to the Bayes multi-object filter.	approximation;bayesian network;cobham's thesis;conjugate variables;recursion;remote file sharing	Ba-Tuong Vo	2012	2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2012.6310801	mathematical optimization;recursive bayesian estimation;bayesian programming;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics;set theory;approximation theory	ML	53.81314164999388	5.537811291923775	86948

This information is used in order to reduce the effect of the disturbance itself. Deconvolution being an ill posed problem, a regularization parameter is to be introduced. The choice of the value of the parameter is a delicate issue. We show that, when studying ANC, the discrepancy principle (applied recursively) is a feasible method for the choice of the parameter.	algorithm;deconvolution;discrepancy function;linear system;matrix regularization;recursion;well-posed problem	Luciano Pandolfi	2007	Int.

Specifically, we present asymmetrically and symmetrically quantised consensus protocols for multiagent dynamical systems. The proposed consensus protocols involve the exchange of quantised information between agents. Due to quantisation, the requirement for consensus is weakened to quantised near-consensus. Under certain assumptions on the network topology, the proposed protocols guarantee that the closed-loop dynamical network is Lyapunov stable and convergent to an appropriately defined set in finite time. We present a complete stability and convergence analysis, using dynamical systems theory and Lyapunov-based approaches. The quasi-robustness of the symmetrically quantised consensus protocols to slowly-varying communication errors is analysed.

We consider general networks with fixed topology and with switching (dynamically changing) topology, propose consensus protocols that take into account both the noisy measurements and the communication time-delays, and studymean square average-consensus for multi-agent systems networked in an uncertain environment and with uniform communication timevarying delays. Using tools from differential equations and stochastic calculus, together with results from matrix theory and algebraic graph theory, we establish sufficient conditions under which the proposed consensus protocols lead to mean square average-consensus.

In some applications, the optimum parameter vectors may not be the same for all agents. Moreover, agents usually exchange information through noisy communication links. In this work, we analyze the theoretical performance of the single-task diffusion LMS when it is run, intentionally or unintentionally, in a multitask environment in the presence of noisy links. To reduce the impact of these nuisance factors, we introduce an improved strategy that allows the agents to promote or reduce exchanges of information with their neighbors.	computer multitasking;mathematical optimization;nuisance variable	Roula Nassif;Cédric Richard;Jie Chen;André Ferrari;Ali H.

A tradeoff between the performance and the convergence rate is a well-known problem due to the choice of the step size. Although the variable-step-size FxLMS algorithms have been proposed for fast convergence, a long tap-length filter is frequently required in order to deal with different environments such that the convergence rate is still subject to a small step size for the long tap length. In this paper, we study a new ANC system with a variable tap-length and step-size FxLMS algorithm. Based on the assumption of an unsymmetric and two-sided exponential decay response model for the ANC control filter, the new FxLMS algorithm has the minimum mean-square deviation for the optimal filter coefficients. In the online secondary path modeling ANC system, simulation results show that the new algorithm with different kind of variable step sizes can provide significant improvements of convergence rate and noise reduction ratio, compared to the fixed-tap-length FxLMS algorithms.	algorithm;coefficient;feed forward (control);least mean squares filter;noise reduction;rate of convergence;simulation;time complexity	Dah-Chung Chang;Fei-Tao Chu	2014	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASLP.2013.2297016	mathematical optimization;acoustics;active noise control;control theory;mathematics	ML	59.80873993472226	12.383835611018757	87572

In this context, the distance of the estimated system from the true one is measured in terms of a particular end-performance metric. This treatment leads to superior unknown system estimates to classical experiment designs based on usual pointwise functional distances of the estimated system from the true one. The separation of the system estimator from the experiment design is done within this new framework by choosing and fixing the estimation method to either a maximum likelihood (ML) approach or a Bayesian estimator such as the minimum mean square error (MMSE). Since the MMSE estimator delivers a system estimate with lower mean square error (MSE) than the ML estimator for finite-length experiments, it is usually considered the best choice in practice in signal processing and control applications. Within the application-oriented framework a related meaningful question is: Are there endperformance metrics for which the ML estimator outperforms the MMSE when the experiment is finite-length? In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question based on a simple linear Gaussian regression example.	design of experiments;experiment;mean squared error;optimal design;signal processing	Dimitrios Katselis;Cristian R.

Further, a variable-forgetting-factor algorithm referred to as the parallel adaptation algorithm that approximately achieves the theoretical minimum mean-squared-error performance in a random walk scenario is developed. Extensive simulation results are presented to support the present findings and demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed algorithm in a number of different applications.	algorithm;recursion;recursive least squares filter	S.

In these circumstances, the amplitudes of the elements of both sequences are converted to a unit magnitude before the coherence estimate is evaluated. In this section, a condition is given for the distribution of the coherence estimate to be independent of second-channel statistics in this situation. Interestingly, the independence does not rely on the notion of spherical symmetry. Assume that the sampies in sequence a are statistically independent. Also, suppose a and b have the property that each sample has unit magnitude, Ifeach sample e'@'' of a i s uniformly distributed on the unit circle , then so is each term exp [ i(8,-+,)I in this expansion of y 2 (a , 6)-regardless of the distribution of the samples of b. This is easily proven by convolution of an arbitrary probability density function p (&) with a uniform density function, modulo 27r. Furthermore , the terms exp [ i (8,*-&) ] will be statistically independent of one another. Thus, in this case, the distribution of the MSC estimate is 1 / N 2 times the distribution of the length squared of a vector formed by adding N unit vectors in a plane which have uniformly distributed direction. This problem has a long history as the problem of a random walk in the plane. The problem of determining this distribution was posed by Pearson in 1905 (see [7]) and its history is detailed in [8]. Note that if the elements of the a sequence are allowed to have nonconstant amplitudes (i.e., A , = 1 x, + iy, 1) that are independently distributed, then invariance with respect to second-channel statistics is still maintained. The distribution of the coherence estimate is, in this case, related to a random walk with a random step size. It is also important to observe that although each term of the a sequence A,eiB """" is spherically symmetric, the a sequence itself is not spherically symmetric. VII. CONCLUSIONS We feel the important aspect of this correspondence is the demonstration of the utility of a geometric approach to this probability problem, not just for the results obtained but also for the insight into why these results come about. Although we have focused on the problem of coherence estimation with no signal present, we anticipate that the geometric approach will prove useful in the case when signal is present. REFERENCES J.

Previously, it has been shown that the prewindowed growing memory RLS algorithm diverges under xed-point implementation 1, 2]. The random walk phenomenon due to roundoo errors in the weight update causes the divergence of the algorithm. To overcome this eeect, these roundoo errors are modeled such that their eeect is incorporated into the algorithm. The steady-state behavior of this new algorithm is analyzed, and it is shown that the divergence phenomenon is actually eliminated, and the new algorithm converges.	algorithm;recursive least squares filter;steady state	Tülay Adali;Sasan H.

The system model is composed of a memoryless non linearity g(.) followed by a linear filter H. The inverse system is a nonlinear Wiener system consisting of an adaptive filter Q followed by a memoryless perceptron. The adaptive filter Q aims at inverting the linear part of the system (adaptive deconvolution). The perceptron aims at inverting the memoryless function (adaptive function inversion). The adaptive system is trained using the backpropagation algorithm (BP). The paper proposes recursions for the mean weight behavior during the learning process. The expression of the mean squared error (MSE) is given as function of the Hammerstein system parameters, the adaptive filter coefficients and the NN weights. The paper is supported with illustrations and computer simulations which show good agreement with theoretical analysis.	adaptive filter;adaptive system;algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;coefficient;computer simulation;deconvolution;electronic filter;mean squared error;nonlinear system;perceptron;recursion	Mohamed Ibnkahla	2002	2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference		adaptive filter;speech recognition;kernel adaptive filter;computer science;machine learning;control theory	ML	59.95515890406645	9.142665576440567	88613

The EB and an estimator for the EB, called the evolutionary biperiodogram (EBP) were first proposed in Ref. [1]. Later, the definitions of both the EB and the EBP were presented with some other results in Ref. [2]. However, in Ref. [3] they were presented without proper reference to the above mentioned reports.	bispectrum;evolutionary algorithm;minimum phase;signal processing;system identification;x86	A. S.

The common control gain of agents determines the consensus performance, which is measured by the ultimate mean square deviation of the states of agents. The consensus performance optimization with respect to the control gain takes a nonlinear matrix inequality form and is difficult to solve. To handle this nonlinearity issue, this brief proposes an iterative method. At each iteration, a descent direction of the control gain is computed by solving two linear matrix inequality optimizations based on a given feasible control gain. Then, a line search algorithm is implemented to move the control gain along the obtained descent direction to improve the consensus performance. That updated control gain will work as the starting feasible control gain of the next iteration. This method can well handle the nonlinearity of the original consensus performance optimization and efficiently improve the consensus performance, which is confirmed by simulations.	agent-based model;consensus (computer science);descent direction;graph (discrete mathematics);iterative method;line search;linear matrix inequality;linear system;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;search algorithm;simulation;social inequality	Qiang Ling;Wei Zheng;Hai Lin	2017	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2016.2630506	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.54298737013335	4.324586716774376	89034

The most commonly used least-mean-square-error (LMSE) solution is optimal when the noise is Gaussian. However, in many practical applications, the noise can be modeled more accurately using a non-Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we consider the linear filtering problem where the noise comes from a generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) and solve the problem using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. To estimate the likelihood, we consider two approaches. One uses explicitly the GGD form that leads to an adaptive filtering algorithm same as the least mean p-norm (LMP) algorithm [1]. Second approach uses a semi-parametric model where the entropy of the noise is estimated using entropy bound minimization (EBM), a flexible approach to density estimation. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound for the ML-LMP estimators by using a second-order Taylor series expansion of the likelihood function. Simulation results show that when the noise comes from a GGD, ML-LMP achieves the best performance, while EBM provides very competitive performance and offers the advantage that it does not assume a certain parametric model for the noise.	adaptive filter;algorithm;gaussian blur;mean squared error;parametric model;rényi entropy;semiconductor industry;semiparametric model;series expansion;simulation	Hualiang Li;Tülay Adali	2011	2011 45th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2011.5766110	gradient noise;gaussian noise;additive white gaussian noise;econometrics;mathematical optimization;value noise;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	ML	56.283895830242955	9.693306189028652	89049

We first consider the case of a fixed communication topology. We show that a simple adaptation of a consensus algorithm leads to an averaging algorithm. We prove lower bounds on the worst-case convergence time for various classes of linear, time-invariant, distributed consensus methods, and provide an algorithm that essentially matches those lower bounds. We then consider the case of a time-varying topology, and provide a polynomial-time averaging algorithm.	best, worst and average case;chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;consensus (computer science);iterative method;time complexity;time-invariant system	Alexander Olshevsky;John N.

Classical ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation assumes: (i) that only the dependent (i.e., output) signals are noisy, and that (ii) the independent (i.e., input) variables are known. In contrast, TLS estimation assumes both the input and output signals to be noisy. Solving TLS problems can be computationally expensive, particularly for nonlinear problems. This challenge arises because the input trajectory must be estimated in a TLS problem, rather than treated as given. This paper addresses this challenge for differentially flat systems by utilizing a pseudospectral expansion to express the input, state, and output trajectories in terms of a flat output trajectory. This transforms the TLS problem into an unconstrained nonlinear programming (NLP) problem with a small number of optimization variables. We demonstrate this framework for an example involving estimating the states and parameters of a second-order nonlinear flat system. Our approach reduces the number of optimization variables from 1503 to 33, while achieving state and parameter estimation errors below 5% and 7%, respectively.	algorithmic efficiency;amped;analysis of algorithms;cobham's thesis;estimation theory;input/output;mathematical optimization;natural language processing;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;ordinary least squares;spectral method;total least squares;transport layer security	Ji Liu;Sergio Mendoza;Guang Li;Hosam K.

These are based on general expressions recently published by Stoica and Nehorai. Also explored, along the same lines, is the case of a single snapshot com- prising either one real sinusoid in real noise or two cisoids in complex noise. These formulas, though simple, are accurate to within a few percent where the number of data points per snapshot is greater than about 6. It is felt that they add insight into the behavior of the CRLB, and cover many of the situations commonly cited in the literature.	approximation;spectral density estimation	David N.

We allow multiple disturbances to act upon different load-side nodes. We formulate the computation of the robustness metric in terms of various equivalent optimization problems with affine inequality constraints. To obtain these results, our analysis identifies a polyhedral cone determined by the topology of the power network whose extreme rays determine the affine inequality constraints. We employ the Double Description method to calculate these extreme rays and discuss how to properly initialize it. Simulations on an IEEE 9-bus power network illustrate our results.	computation;computer simulation;convex cone;convex optimization;fast fourier transform;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;polyhedron;robustness of complex networks;social inequality;transmission line	Yifu Zhang;Jorge Cortés	2016	2016 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2016.7810597	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	EDA	66.37399472759473	8.606281851762022	89305

Introducing a gain for a backward-pass information filter and the notion of an input to the smoother and decomposing the system noises into each element, it is shown that three famous  U - D  algorithms can be naturally applied to construct such a smoother. The new result does not necessitate two burdensome matrix inversions, or any algebraic computations equivalent to them, for the transition matrix and the predicted error covariance, which are at present necessary for the Bierman's  U - D  smoother. Consequently, compared with the result of Bierman, the present algorithm can deal with a broader system, which may cover a time-delay system, and provide an improvement in computation speed and computer storage.

A multivariate random process is said to be asymptotically WSS if it has constant mean and the sequence of its autocorrelation matrices is asymptotically equivalent (a.e.) to the sequence of autocorrelation matrices of some multivariate WSS process. It is shown that this class of processes contains meaningful processes other than multivariate WSS processes. In particular, we give sufficient conditions for multivariate moving average (MA) processes, multivariate autoregressive (AR) processes and multivariate autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes to be asymptotically WSS. Furthermore, in order to solve multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) problems in communications and signal processing involving this kind of processes, we extend the Gray definition of a.e. sequences of matrices and his main results on these sequences to non-square matrices. As an example, the derived results on a.e. sequences of non-square matrices are applied to compute the differential entropy rate and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) for a linear predictor of a multivariate asymptotically WSS process.	asymptote;autocorrelation;autoregressive model;differential entropy;entropy rate;kerrison predictor;mimo;mean squared error;signal processing;stationary process;stochastic process	Jesús Gutiérrez-Gutiérrez;Pedro M.

7a1413369bebbf22b59e70aa26a9eea3ef3f9a98	robust multi-agent optimization: coping with packet-dropping link failures		We study the problem of multi-agent optimization in the presence of communication failures, where agents are connected by a strongly connected communication network. Specifically, we are interested in optimizing h(x) = 1 n ∑n i=1 hi(x), where V = {1, . . . , n} is the set of agents, and hi(·) is agent i’s local cost function. We consider the scenario where the communication links may suffer packet-dropping failures (i.e., the sent messages are not guaranteed to be delivered in the same iteration), but each link is reliable at least once in every B consecutive message transmissions. This bounded time reliability assumption is reasonable since it has been shown that with unbounded message delays, convergence is not guaranteed for reaching consensus [2] – a special case of the optimization problem of interest. We propose a robust distributed optimization algorithm wherein each agent updates its local estimate using slightly different routines in odd and even iterations. We show that these local estimates converge to a common optimum of h(·) sub-linearly at convergence rate O( 1 √ t ), where t is the number of iteration. Our proposed algorithm combines the Push-Sum Distributed Dual Averaging method [24] with a robust average consensus algorithm [26]. The main analysis challenges come from the fact that the effective communication network is time varying, and that each agent does not know the actual number of reliable outgoing links at each iteration.	chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;converge;iteration;loss function;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;network packet;optimization problem;program optimization;rate of convergence;strongly connected component;telecommunications network	Lili Su;Nitin H.

Different from the combination algorithms whose components are updated independently, the variable step-sizes components are adapted using the same input and error signals, and their step-sizes are derived via the mean-square deviation (MSD) of the overall filter. Therefore, the components reflect the working state of the combination filter more accurately than their fixed step-sizes versions. The mixing parameter is obtained by minimizing the MSD and gradually decreases from 1 to 0. Therefore the proposed algorithm has a performance similar to I-VSSAP and I-VSSNLMS in the initial stage and steady-state respectively. Simulations confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms its components and its fixed step-sizes version. The mixing parameter is artificially set to 0 when the difference between the MSDs of two adjacent iterations is below a user-defined threshold, then the proposed algorithm degrades to I-VSSNLMS and exhibits a less computational complexity than AP algorithm.	algorithm;least mean squares filter	Chunhui Ren;Zuozhen Wang;Zhiqin Zhao	2016	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2016.07.022	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;root-mean-square deviation;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	NLP	59.748704662500295	12.156896291107289	90061

The focus is on the asymptotic behavior of the generalized symmetric variant of the algorithm. The latter has already been shown to possess the potential to achieve the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) by allowing the usage of different nonlinearity functions in its implementation. Although the FastICA algorithm along with its variants are among the most extensively studied methods in the domain of ICA, a rigorous study of the asymptotic distribution of the generalized symmetric FastICA algorithm is still missing. In fact, all the existing results exhibit certain limitations. Some ignores the impact of data standardization on the asymptotic statistics; others are only based on heuristic arguments. In this work, we aim at deriving general and rigorous results on the limiting distribution and the asymptotic statistics of the FastICA algorithm. We begin by showing that the generalized symmetric FastICA optimizes a function that is a sum of the contrast functions of traditional one-unit FastICA with a correction of the sign. Based on this characterization, we established the asymptotic normality and derived a closed-form analytic expression of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the generalized symmetric FastICA estimator using the method of estimating equation and M-estimator. Computer simulations are also provided, which support the theoretical results.	algorithm;fastica;heuristic;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;nonlinear system;simulation	Tianwen Wei	2014	2014 IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing (SSP)	10.1109/SSP.2014.6884675	econometrics;mathematical optimization;fastica;mathematics;statistics	ML	54.39452043986421	10.570286331615282	90381

Firstly, a consensus based formation control law is proposed to realize and maintain the desired time-varying formation in presence of time-varying delays and jointly connected topologies. Then, a sufficient condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) is derived for formation control and the stability of the close-loop system is analyzed by employing Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Finally, two task-oriented formation transformation cases are simulated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control law, where the first is to shape varying regular hexagon, and the second is to avoid multiple obstacles.

By the weighted least square (WLS) method, a measurement fusion system is obtained. Using the Kalman filtering method, based on the Riccati equation, a self-tuning weighted measurement fusion white noise deconvolution estimator is presented. It is proved that the self-tuning fusion white noise deconvolution estimator converges to the optimal fusion steady-state white noise deconvolution estimator in a realization by the dynamic error system analysis (DESA) method, so that it has the asymptotic global optimality. A simulation example for a 3-sensor system with Bernoulli-Gaussian input white noise shows its effectiveness.	bernoulli polynomials;deconvolution;fuser (unix);kalman filter;least squares;noise (electronics);online and offline;self-tuning;simulation;steady state;stochastic process;system analysis;time-invariant system;white noise	Xiaojun Sun;Zi-Li Deng	2010	IEEE ICCA 2010	10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524113	kalman filter;gaussian noise;mathematical optimization;minimum-variance unbiased estimator;computer science;control theory;mathematics;statistics;global optimization	Robotics	57.17700795408273	7.005876618573048	90764

Compared to the typical information-theoretical approaches, this new one has at least two merits: (1) the unknown unmixing matrix directly works out from the GE equation without timeconsuming iterative learning; (2) The correctness of the solution is guaranteed. We give out a general learning procedure under this framework. The computer simulation shows validity of our method.	algorithm;blind signal separation;computer simulation;correctness (computer science);iterative method;source separation	Hailin Liu;Yiu-ming Cheung	2005		10.1007/11427445_77	computer simulation;mathematical optimization;systems modeling;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;blind signal separation;iterative method;mixing	AI	55.237270975431905	9.847598175002517	90784

Conventional CS, although effective for dealing with one signal, only leverages the intrasignal correlation for reconstruction. This paper develops a decentralized Bayesian reconstruction algorithm for networked sensing systems to jointly reconstruct multiple signals based on the distributed compressive sensing (DCS) model that exploits both intra- and intersignal correlations. The proposed approach is able to address-networked sensing system applications with privacy concerns and/or for a fusion-center-free scenario, where centralized approaches fail. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decentralized approaches have good recovery performance and converge reasonably quickly.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;bayesian network;calculus of variations;centralized computing;compressed sensing;concave function;converge;distributed control system;expanded memory;hp 48 series;linear algebra;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;nyquist rate;optimization problem;programming paradigm;real time kinematic;rewriting;sampling (signal processing);signal reconstruction;simulation;sparse matrix;stellar classification;theory	Wei Chen;Ian J.

A novel design method is developed for constructing high quality filters with reference to the min–max error criterion. This method is highly efficient in terms of computational time. Simulation studies show a large improvement over existing methods such as quantization [6]. In some cases, the peak ripple magnitude over the stop and pass bands is reduced up to 13 dB over the quantization method. These results are achieved even for cases involving small number of delays.	coefficient;computation;digital filter;display resolution;finite impulse response;linear phase;maxima and minima;quantization (signal processing);recursion;ripple effect;routing;simulation;time complexity	Hai Huyen Dam;Sven Nordebo;Kok Lay Teo;Antonio Cantoni	1998		10.1109/ICASSP.1998.681676	computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;finite impulse response;signal processing;control theory;mathematics	DB	60.878950661000324	17.285631924557162	90985

The simplest version of the algorithm consists of two agents, each one computing the solution of the whole system, using an iterative method. Infrequent unidirectional communication occurs from one agent to the other, either periodically, or probabilistically, thus characterizing the computation as parallel and asynchronous. Every time one agent communicates its current approximation of the solution to the other, the receiving agent carries out a least squares computation to replace its current value by an affine combination of the current approximations, and the algorithm continues until a stopping criterion is met. Deterministic and probabilistic variants of this algorithm are introduced and shown to be efficient, specifically in relation to the popular Barzilai-Borwein algorithm, particularly for ill-conditioned matrices.	approximation;asynchronous i/o;borwein's algorithm;central processing unit;coefficient;computation;condition number;conjugate gradient method;information exchange;iterative method;least squares;linear equation;linear system;mathematical optimization;parallel algorithm;parallel computing;programming paradigm;simulation;sparse matrix;statistical model;system of linear equations	Amit Bhaya;Pierre-Alexandre Bliman;Fernando Agustin Pazos	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5717471	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;multi-agent system;control theory;mathematics;iterative method;linear system;least squares;approximation algorithm	Robotics	63.587191739180184	8.890121824353354	91351

These nonconforming robots correspond to faults in the multirobot system, and our control policy is thus a fault-tolerant policy. Each robot has a limited sensing range and is able to directly estimate the state of only those robots within that sensing range, which induces a network topology for the multirobot system. We assume that it is not possible for the fault-free robots to identify the faulty robots, and thus our approach is robust even to undetected faults in the system. The main contribution of this paper is a fault-tolerant distributed control algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to consensus under certain reasonable connectivity conditions. We first present a general algorithm that exploits the notion of a Tverberg partition of a point set in $\mathbb {R}^d$, and give a proof of convergence. We then provide three instantiations of this algorithm, based on three different sensing models. For each case, we analyze performance via extensive simulations. The effectiveness and performance of our algorithms on real platforms are demonstrated through experiments on a multirobot testbed.	algorithm;converge;distributed control system;experiment;fault tolerance;network topology;robot;simulation;testbed	Hyongju Park;Seth Hutchinson	2017	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	10.1109/TRO.2017.2658604	control engineering;computer science;control theory;distributed computing	Robotics	62.90895531909915	6.080854007468753	91457

A new method is proposed that is suitable for systems operating in low signal-to-noise ratio and high clutter. Such conditions cause unpredictable variations of stochastic characteristics of noise and signals (especially for wideband frequency ones) and create ambiguity in the output of direction-finding algorithms. In this paper, we use the predictive description length (PDL) technique, which is an information theoretic approach, and by suitable modeling, we minimize the predictive codelength for statistical data description of position measurements. The PDL-dynamic programming (DP) method is also presented, which employs the DP algorithm to reduce the computational load of the PDL technique.

Additionally, the required stopband attenuation can be specified. Solving the dual of a semi-infinite linear program is currently the most efficient way to design such filters, but numerical problems prevent the design of high-order FIR filters. Modifications are proposed to overcome this limitation. Furthermore, an efficient method is presented for generating starting values that are close to the optimal solution such that the number of iterations is considerably reduced.

Through presenting Gaussian approximation about the one-step posterior predictive probability density functions (PDFs) of the state and delayed measurement, a novel Gaussian approximation (GA) filter is derived, which recursively operates by analytical computation and Gaussian weighted integrals. The proposed GA filter gives a general and common framework since: (1) it is applicable for both linear and nonlinear systems, (2) by setting the delay probability as zero, it automatically reduces to the standard Gaussian filter without the randomly delayed measurements, and (3) many variations of the proposed GA filter can be developed through utilizing different numerical technologies for computing such Gaussian weighted integrals, including the previously existing EKF and UKF methods, as well as the improved cubature Kalman filter (CKF) in our paper using the spherical-radial cubature rule. The performance of the new method is demonstrated with a simulation example of the high-dimensional GPS/INS integrated navigation.	gaussian blur;nonlinear system;randomness	Xiaoxu Wang;Yan Liang;Quan Pan;Chunhui Zhao	2013	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2013.01.012	gaussian random field;mathematical optimization;ensemble kalman filter;filter;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;gaussian filter;statistics	Robotics	56.57210962788342	5.208000496175032	92146

An accurate statistical model of the NSAF algorithm is obtained. In the derivation, we focus on Gaussian correlated input signals. By assuming that the analysis filter bank is paraunitary and taking into account the full band adaptation mechanism of the NSAF, expressions for the first and the second moments of the adaptive filter weights are derived without invoking the slow adaptation assumption. In the derivations, several hyperelliptic integrals appear. To tackle those integrals induced by Gaussian correlated inputs, we first give a solution by resorting to the adaptive Lobatto quadrature. By invoking the averaging principle, two other approximation methods, the chi-square method and the partial fraction expansion method, are presented to approximate the statistical model as well. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation results corroborate our predictions. The Lobatto quadrature method achieves a good agreement with the MC simulation results, even for a relatively large step size. Compared with the chi-square method and the partial fraction expansion method, the Lobatto quadrature method gives better performance in terms of predicting the mean square error when the length of the adaptive filters is small to medium. The chi-square approximation method and the partial fraction expansion method give a satisfactory performance with a relatively low computational complexity when the filter length is large.	adaptive filter;approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;filter bank;gaussian quadrature;mean squared error;monte carlo method;peterson's algorithm;simulation;statistical model	Wutao Yin;Aryan Saadat Mehr	2011	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2010.2092130	adaptive filter;stochastic process;econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	ML	54.947352257001626	11.24150782710921	92172

Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose the use of a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, herein called LEMACAF, as an alternative to an Alternating Least Squares algorithm known as ALESCAF, which has been used recently in the case of real mixtures of real sources. Second, we extend the CAF approach to the case of complex sources for which the previous algorithms are not suitable. We show that the complex case involves an appropriate tensor stowage, which is linked to a particular tensor decomposition. An extension of the LEMACAF algorithm, called then proposed to blindly estimate the mixing matrix by exploiting this tensor decomposition. In our simulation results, we first provide performance comparisons between third- and fourth-order versions of ALESCAF and LEMACAF in various situations involving BPSK sources. Then, a performance study of is carried out considering 4-QAM sources. These results show that the proposed algorithm provides satisfying estimations especially in the case of a large underdeterminacy level.	least squares;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;sap composite application framework;simulation	Xavier Luciani;André Lima Férrer de Almeida;Pierre Comon	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2089625	mathematical optimization;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;phase-shift keying;signal processing;mathematics;algorithm;statistics	Vision	55.17463110894627	9.737134501108605	92252

A multi-agent system is composed of many agents interconnected by a communication network. This paper aims to further investigate the flocking and preserving connectedness in multi-agent nonholonomic systems with proximity graphs, in which the positions and the relative distances are not available to the distributed controllers. Several sufficient conditions are derived to resolve the above problem based on the kinematic model and the dynamic model, respectively. These sufficient conditions indicate that, for any given distinct initial positions and connected initial graph, there always exist gains of the linear protocols to preserve the connectedness of the graph and realize flocking. Moreover, under an additional condition on initial heading angles, the similar result is obtained for a nonlinear protocol with the form of Kuramoto model. Finally, numerical simulations are given to validate the above theoretical results.	computer simulation;course (navigation);flocking (behavior);kuramoto model;mathematical model;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;telecommunications network	Jiandong Zhu;Jinhu Lu;Xinghuo Yu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215715	communications protocol;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;graph theory;flocking;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing;complex network	ML	64.04322277583636	5.460486976228764	92618

The erratic one depends on the value the input autocorrelation accidentally takes at an iteration, and, essentially, it affects only the results obtained at this particular recursion. On the contrary, the systematic numerical error increases with the information the system carries and propagates essentially throughout the algorithm. It is shown that, for both types of error, as well as the overall one, there are specific intermediate quantities, calculated in the evolution of the algorithm, which may serve as precise indicators of the exact number of erroneous digits with which the various quantities are computed including the PARCOR coefficients and the filter coefficients. Therefore, the generated numerical error can be accurately traced. >	algorithm;levinson recursion;propagation of uncertainty;software propagation	Constantin Papaodysseus;Elias Koukoutsis;C.

Two new protocols are proposed based on multi-hop relaying process for cases with and without delay, respectively. For the case without delay, the consensus protocol only requires the network connectivity condition, yet the final consensus value is not constant. For the case with delay, a necessary and sufficient condition to reach consensus for the delay and connectivity is derived.

For this problem, we propose a new class of subband ADFs which has two kinds of analysis filter banks. We first claim that subband ADFs with the optimum analysis filter bank, which can minimize the least squares error at each bin, can be designed in accordance with the statistics of the signals. We also propose a practical type of subband ADF which requires no a priori knowledge of the the signals statistics. Several computer simulations are also given in order to show the efficiency of the proposed subband adaptive digital filters.	adaptive filter;computer simulation;digital filter;elegant degradation;filter bank;least squares;sub-band coding	Yoshito Higa;Hiroshi Ochi;Shigenori Kinjo	1995	Conference Record of The Twenty-Ninth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	10.1109/ICASSP.1996.544141	computer simulation;adaptive filter;computer vision;kernel adaptive filter;computer science;signal processing;root-raised-cosine filter;filter bank;control theory;statistics	DB	57.93666224187136	14.08447666518456	93052
0f2c41733da27dd11b7dbaa0211c4354df26aa81	robust diffusion recursive least squares estimation with side information for networked agents		This work develops a robust diffusion recursive least squares algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation often experienced in networks of agents in the presence of impulsive noise. This algorithm minimizes an exponentially weighted least-squares cost function subject to a time-dependent constraint on the squared norm of the intermediate estimate update at each node. With the help of side information, the constraint is recursively updated in a diffusion strategy. Moreover, a control strategy for resetting the constraint is also proposed to retain good tracking capability when the estimated parameters suddenly change. Simulations show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over previously reported techniques in various impulsive noise scenarios.	algorithm;computer simulation;control theory;elegant degradation;loss function;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter	Yi Yu;Haiquan Zhao;Rodrigo C. de Lamare;Yuriy V.

The Bayesian recursions appropriate to related filtering problems are exploited, together with “known-form” likelihood ratios, to obtain the desired results. In the derivation of a discrete-time Gauss-Markov likelihood ratio, a “pure” causal estimator-correlator structure is sought and a “locally stable” state estimator is encountered that is of some interest in its own right. The likelihood ratio is “pure” in the sense that the locally stable estimator is used in precisely the same manner as the stored replica is used in known-form signal detection problems to form the likelihood ratio. Consequently, the likelihood ratio is devoid of the extra data-dependent term that arises whenever one uses least squares state estimators to form the likelihood ratio statistic. The locally stable estimator equalizes, within a constant related to the a priori and a posteriori filtering error covariances, the a priori and a posteriori filtering densities. Heuristically, the estimator is a compromise between the one-step predictor and the filtered estimator of a discrete-time Kalman filter. When the observation noise covariance is unknown, a generalization of the so-called unknown level problem, then a Wishart prior is assigned to the innovations covariance and an integral representation is obtained for the desired likelihood ratio. The representation suggests a parallel structure for approximating the likelihood ratio when the observation noise covariance is unknown. Finally, the likelihood ratio for detecting finite-state Markov sequences is derived to illustrate that in general no “pure” estimator-correlator structure can exist when the state-space is finite.	causal filter;data dependency;detection theory;heuristic;hidden markov model;kalman filter;kerrison predictor;least squares;markov chain;recursion;sensor;state space;utility functions on indivisible goods	Louis L.

e70e15c7d11c2a6ae29513a19fdf3cecbb2120aa	distributed big-data optimization via block-wise gradient tracking		We study distributed big-data nonconvex optimization in multi-agent networks. We consider the (constrained) minimization of the sum of a smooth (possibly) nonconvex function, i.e., the agents’ sumutility, plus a convex (possibly) nonsmooth regularizer. Our interest is on big-data problems in which there is a large number of variables to optimize. If treated by means of standard distributed optimization algorithms, these large-scale problems may be intractable due to the prohibitive local computation and communication burden at each node. We propose a novel distributed solution method where, at each iteration, agents update in an uncoordinated fashion only one block of the entire decision vector. To deal with the nonconvexity of the cost function, the novel scheme hinges on Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) techniques combined with a novel block-wise perturbed push-sum consensus protocol, which is instrumental to perform local block-averaging operations and tracking of gradient averages. Asymptotic convergence to stationary solutions of the nonconvex problem is established. Finally, numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and highlight how the block dimension impacts on the communication overhead and practical convergence speed. ∗These authors equally contributed and are in alphabetic order.

bbe127ac373ceb8b36f2d3692f1b29df86bfef3a	analysis of distributed admm algorithm for consensus optimisation over lossy networks		Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a popular convex optimisation algorithm, which is implemented in a distributed manner. Applying this algorithm to consensus optimisation problem, where a number of agents cooperatively try to solve an optimisation problem using locally available data, leads to a fully distributed algorithm which relies on local computations and communication between neighbours. In this study, the authors analyse the convergence of the distributed ADMM algorithm for solving a consensus optimisation problem over a lossy network, whose links are subject to failure. They present and analyse two different distributed ADMM-based algorithms. The algorithms are different in their network connectivity, storage and computational resource requirements. The first one converges over a sequence of networks which are not the same but remains connected over all iterations. The second algorithm is convergent over a sequence of different networks whose union is connected. The former algorithm, compared to the latter, has lower computational complexity and storage requirements. Numerical experiments confirm the proposed theoretical analysis.	algorithm;lossy compression;mathematical optimization	Layla Majzoobi;Vahid Shah-Mansouri;Farshad Lahouti	2018	IET Signal Processing	10.1049/iet-spr.2018.0033	lossy compression;distributed algorithm;mathematical optimization;mathematics;computational resource;computational complexity theory;regular polygon;computation;algorithm;convergence (routing)	ML	63.83446928858675	8.669758674762456	93473

One example is the spectrally-sparse signal, which is composed of a small number of spectral atoms with arbitrary frequencies on the unit interval. In this paper we study the problem of line spectrum denoising and estimation with an ensemble of spectrally-sparse signals composed of the same set of continuous-valued frequencies from their partial and noisy observations. Two approaches are developed based on atomic norm minimization and structured covariance estimation, both of which can be solved efficiently via semidefinite programming. The first approach aims to estimate and denoise the set of signals from their partial and noisy observations via atomic norm minimization, and recover the frequencies via examining the dual polynomial of the convex program. We characterize the optimality condition of the proposed algorithm and derive the expected error rate for denoising, demonstrating the benefit of including multiple measurement vectors. The second approach aims to recover the population covariance matrix from the partially observed sample covariance matrix by motivating its low-rank Toeplitz structure without recovering the signal ensemble. Performance guarantee is derived with a finite number of measurement vectors. The frequencies can be recovered via conventional spectrum estimation methods such as MUSIC from the estimated covariance matrix. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the favorable performance of the proposed algorithms, with comparisons against several existing approaches.	compressed sensing;convex optimization;dictionary;noise reduction;numerical analysis;polynomial;semidefinite programming;sparse matrix;spectral density estimation;toeplitz hash algorithm	Yuanxin Li;Yuejie Chi	2016	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2015.2496294	estimation of covariance matrices;computer vision;covariance intersection;mathematical optimization;estimation;computer science;pattern recognition;noise reduction;mathematics;rational quadratic covariance function;statistics;covariance function	ML	53.971209552485554	8.100561823850061	93737

These adaptive algorithms combine a £i-norm penalty with the the original cost function of the LMS to create a zero attractor (ZA) and hence utilize the sparsity in the filter taps during the adaptation process. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive algorithm to achieve faster convergence rate and lower mean-square deviation under sparsity assumption of impulse response. The proposed modifications employ the recursive inverse adaptive filtering (RI) scheme and the zero attractor to generate the ZA-RI algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed modifications result in significant performance gain in comparison to the conventional LMS-based methods.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive filter;compressed sensing;loss function;rs-232;rate of convergence;recursion (computer science);simulation;sparse matrix;system identification;zonealarm	Mohammad Naser Sabet Jahromi;Aykut Hocanin;Ösman Kükrer;Mohammad Shukri Salman	2014	2014 22nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2014.6830557	adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;convergence;kernel adaptive filter;space-time adaptive processing;computer science;machine learning;signal processing;control theory;recursive least squares filter	HPC	60.84815518300047	12.56102548837797	94333

Finally, we present examples which demonstrate that the new spectral definition is more suitable than current a p proaches for many signals. We show that the value of the method depends on the signal under consideration. We also illustrate that if the signal content is not known, then combining estimates of the evolutionary spectrum and its dual yields good results.	internationalization and localization;stationary process;stellar classification	C.

Correntropy has been recently proposed as a robust similarity measure between two random variables or signals, when the pdfs involved are heavy tailed and non-Gaussian. Maximizing the cross-correntropy between the output of an adaptive filter and the desired response leads to the Maximum Correntropy Criterion for adaptive systems training. We show that a closed form, recursive solution of the filter weights using this criterion yields a simple weighted least squares like formulation. Our simulations show that training the filter weights using this recursive solution is much faster than gradient based training, and more accurate than the RLS algorithm in cases where the error pdf is non-Gaussian and heavy tailed.	adaptive filter;adaptive system;algorithm;gradient;portable document format;recursion;recursive least squares filter;similarity measure;simulation	Abhishek Singh;José Carlos Príncipe	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495055	adaptive filter;computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;adaptive system;pattern recognition;mathematics;statistics;recursive least squares filter	Vision	59.3021256795377	11.23855707567813	94375

The first and second conditional moments of the quantizer output are used to derive difference equations that approximate the dynamical behavior of the first and second weight moments. These difference equations are solved numerically and compare favorably to simulation results. A model of the quantizer as an additive noise source is of no analytical value since the quantizatian noise has negligible effect on the mean square error when the model is valid. Finally, a design approach is proposed for selecting the number of bits in the weight accumulator. The moment equations are also used to determine the algorithm mean square error for different quantizer step sizes and the optimum algorithm step size μ when a fixed amount of input data is available for adaptation.	adaptive algorithm;quantization (image processing)	Douglas T.

With an FIR filter of 16 taps, two types of post-filters, namely a Butterworth and a Bessel each of order 5, are used. During the time interval of interest, , the input signal is sampled at four times the baud rate i.e. every time units. To obtain the approximate solution, we have constrained the output at ,. For the Butterworth post-filter the optimal (or rather suboptimal) noise gain is 0.0146 and for the Bessel post-filter the sub-optimal noise gain is 0.0182. Figures 3 and 4 show the input and output of these filters, the time axis are marked in units of the baud interval. Proposed in this note is a continuous-time filter which consists of an A/D converter, an FIR filter, a D/A converter and an analog post-filter to solve the envelope constrained filtering problem. The problem has been formulated as a quadratic programming problem with functional inequality constraints. As an approximation we have solved the problem where the output is constrained at a finite number of points rather than an entire continuum. Numerical results have shown that useful solutions can be obtained. References [1] R. A. Nobakht and M. R.

It is observed that the ANN's predictive ability is improved after preprocessing EEG signals using a particular nonlinear modeling technique, viz. a bilinear model, compared with those obtained by using a particular classical linear analysis method, viz. an autoregressive (AR) model. Until recently, linear time-invariant Gaussian modeling has dominated the development of time series modeling and feature extraction. The advantage of such classical models lies in the fact that a complete signal processing theory is available. In the case of EEG signals, where the underlying theory regarding the dynamical law governing the generation of these signals (e,g., the underlying physiological factors) is not completely understood, a case can be made for using improved signal processing models that are not subject to linear constraints. Such models should recognize important features of the observed data that may not be well modeled by a linear time-invariant model. It is known that EEG signals are nonstationary, and it is possible that they may be nonlinear as well. Thus, one way of gaining further insights on the structure of EEG signals is to introduce nonlinear models and higher order spectra. This paper compares the results of classification using a linear AR model with those obtained from a bilinear model. It is shown that in certain cases, the nonlinearity of the EEG signals is an important factor that ought to be taken into consideration during preprocessing of the signals prior to the classification task.	electroencephalography	Neep Hazarika;Ah Chung Tsoi;Alex A.

0f818b35f97e84a657de6d6780761b4db2345837	three-stage unscented kalman filter for state and fault estimation of nonlinear system with unknown input		Abstract As the fault and unknown inputs may cause great estimate errors and even divergence for conventional filters when dealing with nonlinear discrete-time systems, this paper proposed a three-stage unscented Kalman filter (ThSUKF) and robust three-stage unscented Kalman filter (RThSUKF) to improve the performance by estimating the state and fault simultaneously. The detail derivation of the filters is illustrated in the paper. The proposed filters are available when the statistic models of the fault and unknown inputs are perfectly known. But if there is no prior knowledge about the fault and unknown input, RThSUKF can also have a great performance. Their performance and effectiveness are demonstrated by the numerical simulation of two-dimensional target tracking. And the results show that ThSUKF and RThSUKF can achieve superior performances with low estimation errors if the nonlinear systems are in presence of fault and unknown inputs.	kalman filter;nonlinear system	Mengli Xiao;Yongbo Zhang;Huimin Fu	2017	J.

These algorithms use small block lengths, thus allowing easy implementation and small input-output delay. It is shown that these algorithms require a smaller number of arithmetic operations than the classical LMS algorithm, while converging much faster. A precise evaluation of the arithmetic complexity is provided, and the adaptive behavior of the algorithm is analyzed. A simulation shows that the tracking characteristics of the new algorithm compared with the NLMS algorithm are also improved. Another simulation shows that, even in the case where noise is added to the reference signal, the proposed algorithm allows a faster convergence and a lower residual error than the NLMS algorithm. >		Mohsen Montazeri;Pierre Duhamel	1993		10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319522	adaptive filter;input/output;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;least mean squares filter;convergence;computer science;theoretical computer science;adaptive behavior;active noise control;noise;residual;mathematics;tracking;computational complexity theory;least squares;recursive least squares filter	Theory	59.909991164413775	13.28051396112493	95067

The new approach addresses the measurement uncertainty-of-origin issue by capturing all measurement input data information in the Bayesian conditional probability density function (PDF), used in the recursive propagation of the posterior target detection and tracking information PDF over time via Bayesian and Markov PDF updates. The application of Bayes’ formula over time resolves measurement association ambiguities. Under linear, Gaussian assumptions, the posterior PDF is a repeating Gaussian mixture. This leads to computational simplifications and efficiencies in implementation. Simulation results demonstrate operation and performance. & 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To achive a better performance, we develop a look ahead strategy that adaptively chooses the best number of coefficients.

Compared with the previous work, the agent's dynamics includes the uncertainties and external disturbances, which is more practical in real-world applications. Due to the approximation capability of neural networks, the uncertain dynamics is compensated by the adaptive neural network scheme. The effects of the approximation error and external disturbances are counteracted by employing the robustness signal. The proposed algorithm is decentralized because the controller for each agent only utilizes the information of its neighbor agents. By the theoretical analysis, it is proved that the consensus error can be reduced as small as desired. The proposed method is then extended to two cases: agents form a prescribed formation, and agents have the higher order dynamics. Finally, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed method.	agent-based model;algorithm;approximation error;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;consensus (computer science);controllers;multi-agent system;neural network simulation;neural network software	Zeng-Guang Hou;Long Cheng;Min Tan	2009	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)	10.1109/TSMCB.2008.2007810	consensus;computer science;machine learning;control theory;distributed computing;artificial neural network;statistics	Robotics	63.78711919121001	4.3950011543627	95556

In such systems, it is important that the individual channel signals be decimated in such a way that the number of samples coded and transmitted does not exceed the number of samples in the original speech signal. Under this constraint, the systems presented in the past have sought to remove the aliasing distortion while minimizing the overall analysis/reconstruction distortion. In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to design tree-structured analysis/reconstruction systems which meet the sampling rate condition and which also result in exact reconstruction of the input signal. This paper develops the conditions for exact reconstruction and presents a general method for designing the corresponding high quality analysis and reconstruction filters.	filter bank;reconstruction filter	Mark J.

Instead, this paper fully exploits the degrees of freedom in weighting functions to design broadband beamformers by using the variably-weighted least squares method. By doing so, we demonstrate that efficient and flexible broadband beamforming can be achieved with passband shaping characteristics while keeping a minimal stopband level.

This problem is revisited through a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based approach, where the unknown parameters are estimated from one-bit quantized noisy measurements with time varying thresholds. The proposed method is computationally efficient and easy to implement, since each ADMM update has simple closed-form formula. Moreover, it provides accurate estimates by exploiting group sparsity hidden in the signal model.

The new version contains corrections and improvements that were communicated to the author. The most serious flaws relate to underflow or near-underflow conditions. As a result, the underflow test in subroutine CUNI2 (ZUN12 in double precision) was reprogrammed. Scaled multiplication was correspondingly introduced into appropriate high-level routines to minimize the effects of near-underflow arithmetic. Additional programming to detect an overflow condition in subroutines CUNIK(ZUNIK) and CUNHJ(ZUNHJ) was also introduced along with variable dimensioning to accommodate FORTRAN77 compilers. This latter change eliminates the need for intervention to convert from 1966 standards. In making some of these changes, it proved to be more convenient (and faster) to use the right sides of the relations EXP(-ELIM) in place of an exponential function evaluation for the underflow test.	algorithm;arithmetic underflow;compiler;double-precision floating-point format;fortran;high- and low-level;subroutine;time complexity;traffic shaping	Donald E.

It is shown that there exists no linear approximation method which is also causal and stable. Only if either the causality or the stability constrain is left out, a linear approximation method may exist.	approximation algorithm;causality;filter bank;filter design;linear approximation;sampling (signal processing)	Holger Boche;Volker Pohl	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - ICASSP '07	10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366792	causal system;computer vision;mathematical optimization;causal filter;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;statistics	Robotics	59.49952140560116	9.85752889113961	95762

In contrast to the widely studied synchronization processes, in which the states of all the coupled agents converge to the same value asymptotically, in the cluster synchronization problem studied in this paper, we require all the interconnected agents to evolve into several clusters and each agent only to synchronize within its cluster. The first mechanism is that agents have different self-dynamics, and those agents having the same self-dynamics may evolve into the same cluster. When the agents’ self-dynamics are identical, we present two other mechanisms under which cluster synchronization might be achieved. One is the presence of delays and the other is the existence of both positive and negative couplings between the agents. Some sufficient and/or necessary conditions are constructed to guarantee n-cluster synchronization. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

42c2492adba6a3d8538e91b7bc7c119eafe6e40c	edge agreement of second-order multi-agent system with dynamic quantization via directed edge laplacian		This work explores the edge agreement problem of second-order multi-agent system with dynamic quantization under directed communication. To begin with, by virtue of the directed edge laplacian, we derive a model reduction representation of the closed-loop multi-agent system depended on the spanning tree subgraph. Considering the limitations of the finite bandwidth channels, the quantization effects of second-order multi-agent system under directed graph are considered. Motivated by the observation that the static quantizer always lead to the practical stability rather than the asymptotic stability, the dynamic quantized communication strategy referring to the rooming in-rooming out scheme is employed. Based on the reduced model associated with the essential edge Laplacian, the asymptotic stability of second-order multi-agent system under dynamic quantized effects with only finite quantization level can be guaranteed. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.	agent-based model;consensus dynamics;directed graph;file spanning;multi-agent system;quantization (signal processing);simulation;spanning tree	Zhiwen Zeng;Xiangke Wang;Zhiqiang Zheng;Lina Zhao	2016	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	AI	64.68959605702631	6.2788016532450595	96213

The resulting sequential Monte Carlo Kalman filter (SMC-KF) consists of a bank of conventional Kalman filters individually tuned to sampled trajectories of the nonlinear state variables. Sampling is according to a Gaussian distribution, with mean and covariance determined by extended Kalman filter-type equations. The SMC-KF is then applied to joint delay and multipath channel estimation in direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA). A combined analytical/simulation technique is employed to compare performance of the SMC-KF and a previously derived extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based DS-CDMA channel estimator.	monte carlo method;nonlinear system;particle filter	Ronald A.

In some cases, this filter is expected to have different filter order for each dimension. However, the conventional methods can realize such filters only if difference between each order is 2, 4 and 6. In this paper, we proposed a closed-form transfer function of 2-D low-pass maximally flat diamond-shaped half-band FIR digital filters with arbitrary filter orders. The constraints to treat arbitrary filter orders are firstly proposed. Then, a closed-form transfer function is achieved by using Bernstein polynomial.	bernstein polynomial;butterworth filter;digital filter;filter bank;finite impulse response;kalman filter;linear phase;low-pass filter;sampling (signal processing);transfer function	Taiki Shinohara;Takashi Yoshida;Naoyuki Aikawa	2017	2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081343	root-raised-cosine filter;2d filters;m-derived filter;prototype filter;half-band filter;network synthesis filters;filter design;adaptive filter;control theory;mathematics	Vision	59.82485695795059	17.492393762291933	96460

Recently, Mahler et al. have introduced a PHD smoother to gain more accurate estimates for both target states and number. However, as highlighted by Psiaki in the context of a backward-smoothing extended Kalman filter, with a nonlinear state evolution model the approximation error in the backward filtering requires careful consideration. Psiaki suggests that to minimize the aggregated least-squares error over a batch of data. We instead use the term retrodiction PHD filter to describe the backward filtering algorithm in recognition of the approximation error proposed in the original PHD smoother, and we propose an adaptive recursion step to improve the approximation accuracy. This step combines forward and backward processing through the measurement set and thereby mitigates the problems with the original PHD smoother when the target number changes significantly and the targets appear and disappear randomly. Simulation results show the improved performance of the proposed algorithm and its capability in handling a variable number of targets.	algorithm;approximation error;extended kalman filter;interaction;least squares;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;randomness;recursion (computer science);simulation;smoothing	Pengming Feng;Wenwu Wang;Syed Mohsen Naqvi;Jonathon A.

The probability hypothesis density (PHD) Filter is an approximation of the multi-object Bayesian filter, which results from the RFS formulation of the problem and has been used in many applications. In the RFS framework, it is assumed that each target and associated observation follow a hidden Markov chain (HMC) model. HMCs conveniently describe some physical properties of practical interest for practitioners, but they also implicitly imply restrictive independence properties which, in practice, may not be satisfied by data. In this paper, we show that these structural limitations of HMC models can somehow be relaxed by embedding them into the more general class of pairwise Markov chain (PMC) models. We thus focus on the computation of the PHD filter in a PMC framework, and we propose a practical implementation of the PHD filter for a particular class of PMC models.	approximation;computable function;computation;gaussian (software);hidden markov model;hybrid memory cube;key server (cryptographic);markov chain;mathematical induction;portable document format;remote file sharing;simulation;stochastic process	Yohan Petetin;François Desbouvries	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2013.2271751	markov chain;markov kernel;recursive bayesian estimation;variable-order bayesian network;bayesian programming;markov property;examples of markov chains;machine learning;causal markov condition;hidden semi-markov model;markov blanket;pattern recognition;mathematics;markov renewal process;additive markov chain;markov process;markov chain mixing time;markov model;hidden markov model;statistics;variable-order markov model	ML	54.1472654630826	5.848527871093059	96700

At each iteration, a noise reduction is performed by means of anExternal Denoising System (EDS), which exploits the estimation results obtained at the previous step; the enhanced data are then input to the master Estimation Algorithm(EA) for next iteration. Recently, a basic TEA scheme has been proposed in the context of modal analysis, which makes use of the Tufts and Kumaresan (TK) algorithm as the master EA, and of a multiband IIR filter as the EDS. In this paper, two improvements of this basic scheme are proposed; the former implies a different design of the EDS, able to achieve better estimation accuracy while reducing the outlier probability; the latter permits the autodetermination of the number of modes making up the signal.

661f2a2a6d00af7f45b7b86ca37c5dbaad0c30eb	adaptive diffusion schemes for heterogeneous networks		In this paper, we deal with distributed estimation problems in diffusion networks with heterogeneous nodes, i.e., nodes that either implement different adaptive rules or differ in some other aspect such as the filter structure or length, or step size. Although such heterogeneous networks have been considered from the first works on diffusion networks, obtaining practical and robust schemes to adaptively adjust the combiners in different scenarios is still an open problem. In this paper, we study a diffusion strategy specially designed and suited to heterogeneous networks. Our approach is based on two key ingredients: 1) the adaptation and combination phases are completely decoupled, so that network nodes keep purely local estimations at all times and 2) combiners are adapted to minimize estimates of the network mean-square-error. Our scheme is compared with the standard adapt-then-combine scheme and theoretically analyzed using energy conservation arguments. Several experiments involving networks with heterogeneous nodes show that the proposed decoupled adapt-then-combine approach with adaptive combiners outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques, becoming a competitive approach in these scenarios.	advanced tactical center;advanced transportation controller;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;approximation;autocorrelation matrix;computation;cross-correlation;experiment;least squares;linear algebra;loss function;mean squared error;newton;newton's method;point of view (computer hardware company);rewrite (programming)	Jesus Fernandez-Bes;Jerónimo Arenas-García;Magno T.

2b519db3d3265f1bde7e2dcd838fb221f5218792	on asymptotic synchronization of interconnected hybrid systems with applications		In this paper, we consider the synchronization of the states of a multiagent network system, where each agent exhibits hybrid behavior. Specifically, the state of each agent may evolve continuously according to a differential inclusion, and, at times, jump discretely according to a difference inclusion. We develop a notion of asymptotic synchronization for part of the state of the system. Our definition of asymptotic synchronization imposes both Lyapunov stability and attractivity on the difference between the agents' states. We recast synchronization as a set stabilization problem, for which tools for the study of asymptotic stability of sets for hybrid systems are suitable. As applications, we introduce two synchronization problems for hybrid systems: the interconnection of continuous-time systems connected over an intermittent communication network and the synchronization of interconnected impulse-coupled oscillators.	agent-based model;asymptote;differential inclusion;hybrid system;interconnection;lyapunov fractal;synchronization (computer science);telecommunications network	Sean Phillips;Ricardo G.

In the recent years, combination schemes have focused on two different approaches: Convex and affine combinations, developing principally practical implementations with just two component filters. However, combinations of a higher number of adaptive filters can offer additional advantages, mainly in tracking environments. In this paper, we introduce a practical adaptation scheme for the affine combination of an arbitrary number of filters, including a steady-state analysis where the proposed rule is compared with the optimal combination. Several experiments both in tracking and stationary scenarios serve to demonstrate the appropriate performance of this approach.	adaptive filter;experiment;least squares;stationary process;steady state	Luis Antonio Azpicueta-Ruiz;Marcus Zeller;Aníbal R.

This paper presents a coefficient-sensitivity analysis for a wide class of 3-D digital filters with separable denominators in local state space that leads to an analytic formulation for sensitivity minimization, and to present two solution techniques for the sensitivity minimization problem at hand. To this end, a vector-matrix-vector decomposition of a given 3-D transfer function that separates the three variables and leads to a state-space realization in a form convenient for subsequent analysis. An l2-sensitivity analysis is then performed. The result is a computationally tractable formula of the overall l2-sensitivity for 3-D digital filters. The l2-sensitivity is minimized subject to l2-scaling constraints by using one of the two solution methods proposed-one relaxes the constraints into a single trace constraint and solves the relaxed problem with an effective matrix iteration scheme; while the other converts the contained optimization problem at hand into an unconstrained problem and solves it using a quasi-Newton algorithm. A case study is presented to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.	algorithm;cobham's thesis;coefficient;digital filter;iteration;iterative method;local variable;mathematical optimization;newton;optimization problem;quasi-newton method;signal processing;state space;transfer function	Takao Hinamoto;Akimitsu Doi;Wu-Sheng Lu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2012.2215027	minimisation;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;digital filter;calculus;mathematics;iterative method;newton's method;matrix decomposition;sensitivity analysis;statistics	Vision	64.80309542072435	17.18153266485584	97548

We use an approach which is based on randomization of control and allows to make minimal assumptions about the noise: randomized test perturbations in control and the external noise must be stochastically independent. In particular, any unknown but bounded deterministic real sequence is an example of such a noise. In the case of a finite set of observations, we propose two procedures for computing data-based confidence regions for unknown parameters of the plant. They could be used in adaptive control schemes. The first procedure is of the stochastic approximation type, while the second one is developed in the general framework of “counting of leave-out sign-dominant correlation regions” (LSCR), which returns confidence regions that are guaranteed to contain the true parameters with a prescribed probability. If the number of observations increases infinitely, we propose the combined procedure for computing confidence regions which shrink to the true parameters asymptotically. The theoretical results are illustrated via a simulation example with a nonminimum-phase second-order plant.	autoregressive model;image noise;minimum phase;moving-average model;randomized algorithm;simulation;soft-in soft-out decoder;stochastic approximation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Konstantin Amelin;Oleg N.

The heart of the RSTSCF is a stochastic Student’s t-spherical radial cubature rule (SSTSRCR), which is derived based on the third-degree unbiased spherical rule and the proposed third-degree unbiased radial rule. The existing stochastic integration rule is a special case of the proposed SSTSRCR when the degrees of freedom parameter tends to infinity. The proposed filter is applied to a maneuvering bearings-only tracking example, in which an agile target is tracked and the bearing is observed in clutter. Simulation results show that the proposed RSTSCF can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing Gaussian approximate filter, Gaussian sum filter, Huber-based nonlinear Kalman filter, maximum correntropy criterion-based Kalman filter, and robust Student’s t-based nonlinear filters, and is computationally much more efficient than the existing particle filter.	agile software development;approximation algorithm;clutter;kalman filter;nonlinear system;numerical integration;particle filter;radial (radio);simulation	Yulong Huang;Yonggang Zhang	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2700428	adaptive filter;kalman filter;nonlinear filter;estimation;invariant extended kalman filter;ensemble kalman filter;kernel adaptive filter;computer science;noise measurement;filtering problem;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;filter design;statistics;alpha beta filter;robustness;time	Robotics	56.3684079364438	5.068310999144794	97655

In some applications, e.g., spectrum estimation, only the second-order statistics are required. In this case, we may use a reduced data sampling rate by exploiting a low-dimensional representation of the original high-dimensional signals. In particular, the covariance matrix can be reconstructed from compressed data by utilizing its specific structure, e.g., the Toeplitz property. In this paper, we propose a general coprime sampling concept that implements effective compression of Toeplitz covariance matrices. Given a fixed number of data samples, we examine different schemes on covariance matrix acquisition, based on segmented data sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified using simulation results.	data compression;frequency band;sampling (signal processing);simulation;spectral density estimation;toeplitz hash algorithm	Si Qin;Yimin Zhang;Moeness G.

These algorithms present several advantages for real time systems such as moderate computational cost, good stability, and adjustable convergence speed. However the basic version of the AP algorithm needs to be optimized to be used on digital signal processors working on real time. Thus several variants of AP and its fast version (FAP) have been developed. Regarding its computational cost and real time implementation, an N /spl times/ N inverse matrix have to be calculated in each algorithm iteration, being N the affine projection order. This paper presents a comparison between several versions of the AP algorithm for real time multichannel audio and proposes a series of recommendations, such as the initialization parameters, to use the variants of the AP algorithm in multichannel sound.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;central processing unit;computation;digital signal processor;face animation parameter;iteration;recursion	Alberto González;Miguel Ferrer;Maria de Diego;Laura Fuster	2004	IEEE 6th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing, 2004.	10.1109/MMSP.2004.1436531	adaptive filter;initialization;mathematical optimization;digital signal processor;real-time operating system;audio signal processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;iterative method;computational complexity theory;algorithm	Visualization	60.92750280446067	13.842404666838796	97873

Two approaches to the implementation of complex wavelet transforms have been proposed earlier. Both approaches require discrete-time allpass systems having approximately linear-phase and (fractional) delay. This paper compares the results when di8erent allpass systems are used. In the earlier work, maximally 9at delay allpass systems were used. In this paper, it is shown that an allpass system designed according to the minimax criterion yields improvements for the complex DWT. ? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using stochastic calculus, one is able to develop a stochastic differential equation that relates the observations to instantaneous frequency. Pseudo-maximum likelihood estimates are obtained through Girsanov theory and the Radon-Nikodym derivative. Bootstrapping is used to find the bias and the confidence interval of the estimates of the instantaneous frequency. An approximate expression for the Cramér-Rao lower bound is derived.

It is widely accepted for such a case that the system state needs not to be augmented with noise vectors and the resultant nonaugmented UKF yields similar, if not the same, results to the augmented UKF. In this letter, we find that under the condition of n+/spl kappa/=const, the basic difference between them is that the augmented UKF draws a sigma set only once within a filtering recursion, while the nonaugmented UKF has to redraw a new set of sigma points to incorporate the effect of additive process noise. This difference generally favors the augmented UKF in that the odd-order moment information is partly captured by the nonlinearly transformed sigma points and propagated throughout the recursion. The simulation results agree well with the analyses.	additive white gaussian noise;dynamical system;kalman filter;nonlinear system;recursion;resultant;simulation;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yuanxin Wu;Dewen Hu;Meiping Wu;Xiaoping Hu	2005	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2005.845592	kalman filter;computer science;noise measurement;unscented transform;dynamical system;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter	Robotics	57.937346383496745	11.525906469983783	98414

In order to reduce the filter complexity even further, this paper considers the optimization a class of FIR filters based on the use of the generalized frequency-response masking approach originally introduced by Lim and Lian (see IEEE Trans. Circuits Syst. II, vol. 41, p. 518-525, Aug. 1994). For this class of filters, the two masking filters are constructed by using a common filter part. Again, the simultaneous optimization of all the subfilters is used, resulting in a considerable reduction in the overall filter complexity. An example taken from the literature illustrates the benefits of the proposed approach.	finite impulse response;frequency response	Tapio Saramäki;Juha Yli-Kaakinen	2002		10.1109/ISCAS.2002.1010201	adaptive filter;control engineering;network synthesis filters;computer vision;electronic engineering;computer science;finite impulse response;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;m-derived filter	Robotics	60.99962809719559	17.03256650118876	98495

2d3cd59328d5ee34117edd1ea2a783470ed7d069	regularized least square support vector machines for order and structure selection of lpv-arx models		Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) is a computationally efficient kernel-based regression approach which has been recently applied to nonparametric identification of Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems. In contrast to parametric LPV identification approaches, LS-SVM based methods obviate the need to parameterize the scheduling dependence of the LPV model coefficients in terms of a-priori specified basis functions. However, an accurate selection of the underlying model order (in terms of number of input lags, output lags and input delay) is still a critical issue in the identification of LPV systems in the LS-SVM setting. In this paper, we address this issue by extending the LS-SVM method to sparse LPV model identification, which, besides non-parametric estimation of the model coefficients, achieves datadriven model order selection via convex optimization. The main idea of the proposed method is to first estimate the coefficients of an over-parameterized LPV model through LS-SVM. The estimated coefficients are then scaled by polynomial weights, which are shrunk towards zero to enforce sparsity in the final LPV model estimate. The properties of the proposed approach are illustrated via simulation examples.	algorithmic efficiency;arx;basis function;coefficient;convex optimization;image scaling;input lag;lasso;least squares support vector machine;mathematical optimization;polynomial;scheduling (computing);simulation;sparse matrix;system identification	Manas Mejari;Dario Piga;Alberto Bemporad	2016	2016 European Control Conference (ECC)	10.1109/ECC.2016.7810527	econometrics;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	AI	57.72010949133174	8.560974951044232	98821

The continuous state estimation error is bounded by a monotonically nonincreasing function of the discrete state estimation error, with both the estimation errors converging to zero. This work shows that the lattice approach to estimation is general as the proposed estimator can be constructed for any observable and discrete state observable system. The main advantage of using the lattice approach for estimation becomes clear when the system has monotone properties that can be exploited in the estimator design. In such a case, the computational complexity of the estimator can be drastically reduced and tractability can be achieved. Some examples are proposed to illustrate these ideas.	computational complexity theory;estimation theory;hybrid system;observable;scalability;simulation;monotone	Domitilla Del Vecchio;Richard M.

Even for relatively low-order systems with only a few inputs and outputs, the amount of memory required to store these data matrices exceeds the limits of what is currently available on the average desktop computer. This severely limits the applicability of the methods. In this paper, we present kernel methods for subspace identification performing computations with kernel matrices that have much smaller dimensions than the data matrices used in the original LPV and bilinear subspace identification methods. We also describe the integration of regularization in these kernel methods and show the relation with least-squares support vector machines. Regularization is an important tool to balance the bias and variance errors. We compare different regularization strategies in a simulation study. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This filter requires the received signal to be shifted by the frequencies of cyclostationarity of the signal and with a frequency domain implementation it will often be best to effect the frequency shifts directly in the frequency domain. This paper introduces techniques for exactly achieving these shifts as well as providing more computationally efficient approximate solutions.	cyclostationary process	Gareth J.

5c3fb62eb4df65ac48b7cd94c78e3457dda3945b	system identification and state estimation under lebesgue sampling: use of inter-sample information		In conventional system identification and state estimation problems, it is commonly assumed that the output signal of a dynamical system is sampled at every regular time interval. This paper addresses the identification and estimation problems under the Lebesgue sampling, which is a type of event-triggered sampling such that the output signal is sampled only when it crosses a specific threshold. In this paper, it is assumed that the output signal is sampled under the Lebesgue sampling rule. Then, the time interval between two samples possesses information such that the signal crosses none of the thresholds during the interval. The inter-sample information plays a key role to improve the accuracy of modeling and estimation. The problems utilizing the information are formulated. We propose likelihood-based methods of both system identification and state estimation to solve the problems. The effectiveness of the methods are illustrated in numerical examples.	addresses (publication format);assumed;computer simulation;dynamical system;hl7 2.5 event type;numerical analysis;numerical method;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;system identification	Takahiro Kawaguchi;Masaki Inoue;Ichiro Maruta;Shuichi Adachi	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	10.1109/CCTA.2017.8062656	lebesgue integration;dynamical system;noise measurement;sampling (statistics);kalman filter;statistics;mathematical optimization;system identification;mathematics	EDA	58.71660050646207	5.220066331316077	99942

Nonlinearities of phase characteristics of the analysis filters are compensated in the synthesis filter bank by reversing ofdata (W case) or an impulse response (FIR case). The considerations are restricted to separable multi-level systems, i.e., one-dimensional two-band filter banks are the basic building blocks and therefore carefully considered in the paper. Described is a technique to design nonlinear-phase FIR filter banks based on optimization. Moreover the problem of design of bireciprocal recursive filters is considered by emphasizing the trade-off between the stopband attenuation and the impulse response length. Both nonideal separation of subbands and long impulse responses increase the amount of information to be encoded thus aggravating the overall coding efficiency defined by the relation between the compression ratio and the quality of reconstructed images. Considered is the choice of elliptic filters as well as some design techniques improving coding efficiency.	algorithmic efficiency;filter bank;finite impulse response;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;recursion (computer science);reversing: secrets of reverse engineering;sub-band coding	Marek Domanski;Roger Swierczynski	1994		10.1109/ICIP.1994.413484	iterative reconstruction;adaptive filter;network synthesis filters;low-pass filter;chebyshev filter;2d filters;finite impulse response;root-raised-cosine filter;linear filter;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;constant k filter;electronic filter topology;filter design;prototype filter;infinite impulse response;composite image filter;m-derived filter	EDA	59.4478924032527	18.21243484434179	100248

While in the past the problem was overridden using gain switching techniques, recently many authors have shown that the best solution for the echo compensation problem is represented by an adaptive filter which iteratively tries to identify the unknown impulse response of the system loudspeaker-room-microphone. Unfortunately the VLSI technology was not suitable to meet the requirements of this solution in a single chip acoustic echo canceller. The present paper, starting from a CMOS 1.2μm technology, will show some figures in terms of speed and silicon area taken for some basic blocks (such as adders, multipliers, memories) required by a canonical solution based on an adaptive FIR filter of 1000 taps with coefficients updated by the NLMS algorithm. Moreover, it will be shown a more efficient solution for the acoustic echo compensation based on a sub-bands approach. Simulated experiments with this architecture will be presented, compared with the ones of the canonical solution for what concerns size, number of operations required and performances.	acoustic cryptanalysis;control system;very-large-scale integration	C.

The paper presents a lower and an upper bound on the boundedness behavior which will show that the boundedness constant of the spectral factorization mapping gets worse as the degree N of the spectra increases.

To address this problem, a novel combination of two NLMP (CNLMP) algorithms is proposed which adaptively combines two independent NLMP filters with large and small step sizes to obtain fast convergence rate and low misadjustment in the presence of α-stable noise. Additionally, to achieve fast convergence at the transition stage, a tracking weight transfer scheme is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the NLMP, LMP and NLMAD algorithms for nonlinear system identification problem in terms of convergence rate and steady-state kernel error.	algorithm;nonlinear system identification;rate of convergence;simulation;steady state	Lu Lu;Haiquan Zhao	2015	2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)	10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230557	control engineering;mathematical optimization;kernel adaptive filter;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	59.97995075691106	12.384023967866876	100763

In this paper, these effects are investigated. The relationship between the fractionally spaced output samples of a noise-limiting prefilter and the symbol spaced output samples of a matched filter is studied for both the time-invariant and the timevarying channels. It is shown that the prefilter and the sampling rate can have significant effects on blind equalization algorithms. Thus, this paper provides a common framework for comparing different blind algorithms that are studied in the literature with different sampling rates. A case study of the well-known subspace method for blind channel identification is presented. The effects of the noise color due to the prefilter on equalizers is investigated, and the sensitivity of the truncation of the overall channel impulse response in terms of the mean squared error (MSE) performance criterion is investigated through numerical examples.	algorithm;blind equalization;discretization;equalization (communications);matched filter;mean squared error;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);time-invariant system;truncation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Deva K.

We provide a constructive method for designing sequences that are maximally compact in time for a given frequency spread. By formulating the problem as a semidefinite program, we show that maximally compact sequences do not achieve the classic Heisenberg bound.

SGD typically has low complexity at the expense of slower convergence. On the other hand, packet-based data transmission in many practical digital communication systems makes it attractive to develop steepest descent (SD) implementation in order to speed-up convergence. This work aims at developing SD implementation of several well-known blind signal recovery algorithms for multi-channel equalisation and source separation. The authors SD formulation is more amenable to additional parametric and signal subspace constraint for faster convergence and superior performance.	algorithm;detection theory;gradient descent	Huy-Dung Han;Zhi Jun Ding	2012	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2011.0764	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning	Mobile	61.71871738123018	11.884758169612475	101065

Most of these algorithms assume the agents to be mutually cooperative and “trustful” and correspondingly attractive couplings between the agents bring the values of the agents' states closer. Opinion dynamics of real social groups, however, require beyond conventional models of multi-agent consensus due to ubiquitous competition and distrust between some pairs of agents, which are usually characterized by the repulsive cou-pling. Antagonistic interactions prevent the averaging tendency of the opinions, which cooperative consensus protocols promote, and may lead to their polarization and clustering. A simple yet insightful model of opinion dynamics with both attractive and repulsive couplings was proposed recently by C. Altafini, who examined first-order consensus algorithms over static signed interaction graphs, where arcs of positive weights connect cooperating agents, and of negative weights correspond to antagonistic pairs. This protocol establishes modulus consensus, where the opinions become the same in modulus but may differ in sign. In the present paper, we extend the modulus consensus model to the case where the network topology is arbitrary time-varying, directed, signed graph. We show that under mild condition of uniform strong connectivity of the network, the protocol establishes agreement of opinions in moduli, whose signs may be opposite, so that the agents' opinions either reach consensus or polarize. This result is further extended to nonlinear consensus protocols. We show also that, unlike cooperative consensus algorithms, uniform strong connectivity cannot be relaxed to uniform quasi-strong connectivity (UQSC).	algorithm;cluster analysis;consensus (computer science);directed graph;distributed control system;distrust;first-order predicate;interaction;modulus robot;multi-agent system;network topology;nonlinear system;polarization (waves);signed graph;social network;strongly connected component	Anton V.

Considering that communication is a major bottleneck in decentralized optimization, our main goal in this paper is to develop algorithmic frameworks which can significantly reduce the number of inter-node communications. We first propose a decentralized primal-dual method which can find an solution both in terms of functional optimality gap and feasibility residual in O(1/ ) inter-node communication rounds when the objective functions are convex and the local primal subproblems are solved exactly. Our major contribution is to present a new class of decentralized primal-dual type algorithms, namely the decentralized communication sliding (DCS) methods, which can skip the inter-node communications while agents solve the primal subproblems iteratively through linearizations of their local objective functions. By employing DCS, agents can still find an -solution in O(1/ ) (resp., O(1/ √ )) communication rounds for general convex functions (resp., strongly convex functions), while maintaining the O(1/ ) (resp., O(1/ )) bound on the total number of intra-node subgradient evaluations. We also present a stochastic counterpart for these algorithms, denoted by SDCS, for solving stochastic optimization problems whose objective function cannot be evaluated exactly. In comparison with existing results for decentralized nonsmooth and stochastic optimization, we can reduce the total number of inter-node communication rounds by orders of magnitude while still maintaining the optimal complexity bounds on intra-node stochastic subgradient evaluations. The bounds on the (stochastic) subgradient evaluations are actually comparable to those required for centralized nonsmooth and stochastic optimization under certain conditions on the target accuracy.	agent-based model;algorithm;centralized computing;convex function;first-order reduction;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;program optimization;stochastic optimization;subderivative;subgradient method	Guanghui Lan;Soomin Lee;Yi Zhou	2017	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;mathematics	ML	63.97397257860383	8.919084501249076	101321

In simulation and test, the output response of Kalman filter can separate noise from reference signal and the outcome is closely matched with reference signal. The response of low-pass IIR filter is smooth and can also separate noise but some time delay is presented. The mean squared error (MSE) of low-pass IIR filter is 0.6354 while the MSE of Kalman filter reduces to 0.1467, a significant improvement by 4 times. Also, the computational efficiency of Kalman filter is better than that of low-pass IIR filter in this application. Both filtering algorithms are implemented and programmed into a heat deformation tester (HDT).

Based on the stability theory of fractional differential equations, some sufficient criteria for local and global cluster synchronization of fractional-order CDNs are derived. In this paper, the coupling configuration matrix can be asymmetric as well as reducible and the inner coupling matrix can also be asymmetric. Moreover, the number of pinning nodes in each cluster can be evaluated. Especially, when the coupling strength is large enough and the coupling configuration matrix is symmetric, cluster synchronization can be achieved via pinning a single node in each cluster. Finally, some typical examples are given to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of our results, a surprising finding is that the synchronization performance will become better as the fractional order decreases in this simulation.	correctness (computer science);coupling constant;http public key pinning;linear algebra;numerical analysis;simulation;social inequality	Guan-Sheng Wang;Jiangwen Xiao;Yan-Wu Wang;Jing-Wen Yi	2014	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2014.01.023	real-time computing;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing	Theory	66.66712205657848	5.711554541594009	101626

Based on the relative state information, fully distributed adaptive protocols are designed for these agents described by Lipschitz nonlinear dynamics under leaderless and leader-follower communication structures. As the special case, for linear multi-agent systems, fault-tolerant consensus problems are also solved with the proposed protocols. First, for the leaderless multi-agent systems, all agents reach an agreement on a common value with undirected connected communication graphs. Second, for the leader-follower multi-agent systems, in which the state of the leader is only available to a subset of the followers, the state of each follower converges to the state of the leader, asymptotically. A distinctive feature of this paper is that the adaptive protocols here are independent of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix associated with the whole communication graph, which means the protocols can be implemented by each agent in a fully distributed fashion. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.	consensus (computer science);fault tolerance;graph (discrete mathematics);laplacian matrix;many-worlds interpretation;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;simulation	Qi Wang;Jinzhi Wang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2821918	fault tolerance;common value auction;laplacian matrix;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;lipschitz continuity;distributed computing;special case;nonlinear system;multi-agent system;computer science	ML	64.37990219126331	5.807191452637515	101718

Measurement errors from different measurement channels, which are considered equal in many previous estimation methods, are usually negatively correlated with time-delays. Measurements with higher time-delays usually have less errors than the ones with lower delays. Our approach improves the estimation accuracy by decreasing the usage rate of measurements with larger errors. To prove the optimality of the approach in the minimum mean square error sense, a derivation procedure is presented. A numerical example and comparison are also given to demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed approach.	estimation theory;mean squared error;numerical analysis	Yao Sun;Fengshui Jing;Zi-ze Liang;Min Tan	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2581479	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;statistics;measurement uncertainty	Visualization	57.4866026556921	4.5846798350354945	101792

Wirtinger calculus is shown to provide an attractive framework for the derivation and analysis of complex-valued algorithms using nonlinear functions, and hence of ICA algorithms as well. Local stability analysis of complex ICA based on ML presents a unique challenge, since in addition to the need for computation of derivatives, the Hessian of a matrix quantity needs to be evaluated, and for the complex case, it assumes a significantly more complicated form than the real-valued case. In this paper, we demonstrate how Wirtinger calculus allows the use of an elegant approach proposed by Amari et al. (1997) in the analysis, thus enabling the derivation of the conditions for local stability of complex ML ICA.

Though each of these representations provides equivalent information about the LPC spectral envelope, their interpolation performance is found to be different.

In this paper, the so called local mean is computed in such a way that it allows the use of differential calculus on envelopes. This new formulation makes us prove that iterations of the sifting process are well approximated by the resolution of partial differential equations (PDE).

The signal is modeled as a stationary random process and sampled on a lattice. Exact expressions for the mean-square error of the best linear interpolator are given in the frequency domain. Moreover, asymptotic expansions are derived for the average mean-square error when the sampling rate tends to zero and infinity, respectively. This makes it possible to determine the optimal lattices for sampling. In the low-rate sampling case, or equivalently for rough processes, the optimal lattice is the one which solves the packing problem, whereas in the high-rate sampling case, or equivalently for smooth processes, the optimal lattice is the one which solves the dual packing problem. In addition, the best linear interpolation is compared with ideal low-pass filtering (cardinal interpolation).	internet access;linear interpolation;low-pass filter;mean squared error;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);set packing;stationary process;stochastic process	Hans R.

To reduce the area complexity and power consumption of the filters, researchers have proposed algorithms to optimize the expression of coefficients with the reduced number of non-zero digits or power-of-two terms. This paper presents a new optimization algorithm based on elegant dynamic programming approach to minimize the number of non-zero digits in coefficient set, which yields to low logic operator cost in the filter circuit implementation. The proposed algorithm utilized the knapsack method from dynamic programming to effectively remove the redundant nonzero digits in the coefficients. Experiment results on benchmark filters show that the proposed algorithm can synthesize FIR filter coefficient with the reduced area complexity. Compared with two competing methods, the proposed algorithm can design FIR filters with an average of 14.49% to 47.73% reduced full adder cost over the competing methods.	adder (electronics);algorithm;benchmark (computing);coefficient;digital filter;digital signal processing;dynamic programming;filter design;finite impulse response;gabor filter;linear phase;mathematical optimization;power of two	Juan Zhao;Yujia Wang;Jiajia Chen;Feng Feng	2016	2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760569	adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;digital filter;computer science;parks–mcclellan filter design algorithm;theoretical computer science;root-raised-cosine filter;linear filter;filter design	EDA	61.58238516632248	18.10992596094101	103617

Examples of signals with a finite rate of innovation include streams of Diracs (e.g., the Poisson process), nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials. Even though these signals are not bandlimited, we show that they can be sampled uniformly at (or above) the rate of innovation using an appropriate kernel and then be perfectly reconstructed. Thus, we prove sampling theorems for classes of signals and kernels that generalize the classic “bandlimited and sinc kernel” case. In particular, we show how to sample and reconstruct periodic and finite-length streams of Diracs, nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials using sinc and Gaussian kernels. For infinite-length signals with finite local rate of innovation, we show local sampling and reconstruction based on spline kernels. The key in all constructions is to identify the innovative part of a signal (e.g., time instants and weights of Diracs) using an annihilating or locator filter: a device well known in spectral analysis and error-correction coding. This leads to standard computational procedures for solving the sampling problem, which we show through experimental results. Applications of these new sampling results can be found in signal processing, communications systems, and biological systems.	bandlimiting;biological system;error detection and correction;forward error correction;kernel (operating system);online locator service;polynomial;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;sinc function;spectral density estimation;spline (mathematics)	Martin Vetterli;Pina Marziliano;Thierry Blu	2002	IEEE Trans.

It is shown that the standard calculation of sine-wave parameters may result in unexpectedly large errors, even with floating-point number representation. The three- and four-parameter least squares, the maximum likelihood, and the quantile-based estimator (QBE) methods are investigated. It is pointed out that imprecise phase storage and summation affect almost every sine-wave fitting algorithm. Furthermore, the necessary solution for sometimes ill-conditioned systems and the imprecisely evaluated distribution of the observation noise, as additional error sources, are also shown to influence a part of the fitting methods. Besides error descriptions, compensation techniques are also suggested in order to mitigate the effect of error sources. The enhancement of precision and robustness due to these suggestions is demonstrated, while keeping the given limited precision number representation platform. The QBE is shown to overcome roundoff error problems when its applicability conditions are fulfilled. In addition, its performance in comparison with that of the least squares estimator is highlighted. Finally, it is pointed out that the investigated methods show similar sensitivity to the inaccurate knowledge of the frequency of the sine wave.	algorithm;branching factor;condition number;curve fitting;distortion;image scaling;instability;least squares;matlab;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;numerical analysis;numerical stability;pairwise summation;query by example;round-off error;sampling (signal processing);vergence	Balazs Renczes;István Kollár;Antonio Moschitta;Paolo Carbone	2016	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2016.2562218	econometrics;mathematical optimization;sensitivity;mathematics;maximum likelihood;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;estimation theory;statistics	Vision	55.88475604054694	11.616409015178922	103902

This paper studies resilient coordination of networked multiagent systems in the presence of misbehaving agents, i.e., agents that are subject to such adverse events. In particular, we consider a class of adverse conditions consisting of exogenous disturbances and interagent uncertainties, and present a distributed adaptive control architecture to retrieve the nominal networked multiagent system behavior. Departing from the existing relevant literature that make specific assumptions on the graph topology and/or the fraction of misbehaving agents, we show that the considered class of adverse conditions can be mitigated through a new adaptive control methodology that utilizes a local state emulator - even if all agents are misbehaving. A illustrative numerical example is provided to demonstrate the theoretical findings.	agent-based model;algorithm;centralized computing;emulator;instability;local variable;multi-agent system;numerical analysis;telecommunications network;topological graph theory	Gerardo De La Torre;Tansel Yucelen;John Daniel Peterson	2014	53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2014.7040228	control engineering;networked control system;engineering;control theory;distributed computing	ML	64.52690437829774	4.795356670541053	103966

In some practical situations, there may also be a disturbance uncorrelated with the primary disturbance at the error microphone, for which a correlated reference signal is not available. This disturbance, being uncorrelated with the primary noise, cannot be controlled by the standard FxLMS algorithm, and increases the residual noise. In this paper we propose an improved hybrid ANC system that can simultaneously control both the correlated and uncorrelated noise signals. The proposed method comprises three adaptive filters: 1) the FxLMS-based ANC filter to cancel the primary noise; 2) a separate FxLMS-based ANC filter to cancel the uncorrelated disturbance; and 3) an LMS-based supporting adaptive filter to generate appropriate signals for the two ANC filters. Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the correlated and uncorrelated primary disturbances. This improved performance is achieved at only a small increase in computational complexity.	adaptive filter;algorithm;computational complexity theory;feedforward neural network;least mean squares filter;microphone;simulation;white noise	Muhammad Tahir Akhtar;Wataru Mitsuhashi	2011	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2011.2112349	computer simulation;adaptive filter;computer vision;feedforward neural network;speech recognition;computer science;machine learning;control theory	Robotics	61.262793623821764	13.613239964397245	104109

Each agent is modeled by a strict-feedback nonlinear system with unknown nonlinear dynamics and unknown external disturbances. The time-varying leader node only gives commands to a small portion of the followers. By using backstepping technique and neural networks method, adaptive distributed controllers for each follower node are constructed, which only require relative state information between themselves and their neighbors. The proposed controllers and adaptive laws guarantee that the tracking errors between all followers and the leader convergence to a small neighborhood of the origin. Moreover, by employing the maximum norm of the unknown neural network weight vectors as the estimated parameter, the algorithm proposed in this paper contains only  N ( N  represents the number of the followers) adaptive parameters that need to be updated online. The number of online learning parameters is independent of the number of the neural networks׳ nodes, which reduces the computation burden significantly. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	multi-agent system;nonlinear system	Fang Wang;Zhi Liu;Yun Zhang;Bing Chen	2016	J.

The problem of the MIMO DFE design is formulated as a set of linear equations with multiple right-hand sides (RHS) evolving in time. By applying an adaptive modified conjugate gradient algorithm, originally proposed for a single linear system, to the problem at hand, we arrive at an equalizer of performance identical to RLS, numerically robust, but of higher computational cost. To reduce its complexity, two updating strategies of the equalizer filters are derived based on Galerkin projection in time and space respectively. The two alternative schemes exhibit a complexity lower than RLS while offering slightly inferior convergence properties.	adaptive equalizer;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;complexity;computation;conjugate gradient method;convex conjugate;equalization (communications);galerkin method;linear equation;linear system;mimo;numerical analysis;recursive least squares filter	Vassilis Kekatos;Aris S.

0fb395a8a049aa38b4ccef2598d7dfd483f3e6db	robust dynamic average consensus algorithm for signals with bounded derivatives		Development and analysis of a robust dynamic average consensus algorithm for arbitrary reference signals with known bounded derivatives is presented. The proposed approach does not rely on full knowledge of the dynamics generating the reference signals nor assume access to its time derivatives. Compared to existing approaches, the proposed algorithm does not require any initialization criteria and therefore it is robust to changes in network topology. Robustness of the proposed approach is attributed to the two consecutive Laplacian matrices that appear in the algorithm and thus two rounds of communication are needed between each update of the agents' estimates. Therefore we introduce a singularly perturbed system that would effectively place an integral between the consecutive Laplacian matrices and allow the nodes to replace the two rounds of communication involving a single variable with a single round of communication involving two variables.

However, existing methodologies do not enable the designer to deliberately shape the probability density function of the random cost according to a pre-specified target density characterized by a finite number of cost statistics. Since the mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis of a variate are strongly associated with the appearance of its density function, a cumulant-based control paradigm that can steer four or more cost cumulants towards nominal target values would be ideal for cost density-shaping objectives. Bearing this idea in mind, we propose a novel weighted least-squares optimization problem of minimizing a weighted sum of squared differences between initial cost cumulants and target initial cost cumulants, for arbitrarily-many terms. The problem is solved using dynamic programming techniques adapted for the cost cumulant-generating equations of the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) framework. The Minimum Weighted Least-Squares, Cost Density-Shaping (MWLS-CDS) optimal controller results and is applied in a building protection problem. It is shown that MWLS-CDS controls can achieve target cost cumulants resultant from a family of 3CC controls to within a 0.5% margin of normalized error.	additive white gaussian noise;cds isis;computation;control system;dynamic programming;least squares;mathematical optimization;noise shaping;optimal control;optimization problem;programming paradigm;resultant;semantics (computer science);simulation;stochastic control;utility functions on indivisible goods;weight function	Matthew Zyskowski;Michael K.

bae45300940d6ecada250525e1ff44b6e570eff2	an approximate projected consensus algorithm for computing intersection of convex sets		In this paper, we propose an approximate projected consensus algorithm for a network to cooperatively compute the intersection of convex sets. Instead of assuming the exact convex projection proposed in the literature, we allow each node to compute an approximate projection and communicate it to its neighbors. The communication graph is directed and time-varying. Nodes update their states by weighted averaging. Projection accuracy conditions are presented for the considered algorithm. They indicate how much projection accuracy is required to ensure global consensus to a point in the intersection set when the communication graph is uniformly jointly strongly connected. We show that π/4 is a critical angle error of the projection approximation to ensure a bounded state. A numerical example indicates that this approximate projected consensus algorithm may achieve better performance than the exact projected consensus algorithm in some cases.	3d projection;approximation algorithm;chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;convex cone;convex set;directed graph;iterative method;numerical analysis;strongly connected component	Youcheng Lou;Guodong Shi;Karl Henrik Johansson;Yiguang Hong	2012	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;dykstra's projection algorithm;mathematics	ML	64.14024092171363	7.158378862582704	104792

The corresponding filter can be implemented using the classical transversal structure but with the- shift operator z-1 replaced by an alternative operator ρ-1. Several design examples are presented.

The proposed algorithm uses an input signal where the input signal matrix Xk becomes an orthogonal matrix. For this input signal, matrix (XkTXk) becomes a diagonal matrix whose inverse can be easily computed. Thus, the proposed algorithm saves a significant amount of computations. Due to this feature the proposed PRAP algorithm is shown to offer a faster convergence speed and a smaller computational burden per iteration than the NLMS algorithm does.	adaptive filter;algorithm;channel (communications);computation;converge;iteration;least mean squares filter	M.

14a6e0bb5c206747bac295a5801ae6b66ac1cc18	the funnel experiment: the markov-based spc approach	process monitoring;stochastic processes;change point	The classical funnel experiment was used by Deming to promote the idea of Statistical Process Control (SPC). The popular example illustrates that the implementation of simple feedback rules to stationary processes violates the independence assumption and prevents the implementation of conventional SPC. However, Deming did not indicate how to implement SPC in the presence of such feedback rules. This pedagogical gap is addressed here by introducing a simple feedback rule to the funnel example that results in a nonlinear process to which the traditional SPC methods cannot be applied. The proposed method of Markov-based SPC (MSPC), which is a simplified version of the CSPC method, is shown to well monitor the modified process.	markov chain;nonlinear system;stationary process	Gonen Singer;Irad Ben-Gal	2007	Quality and Reliability Eng.

A sufficient and necessary consensus criterion is proposed through the combination of two methods. Firstly, a communication searching algorithm is utilized to make sure that each agent obtains the local topology information of strongly connected component where it is located. Secondly, a state-linear-transformation decomposes the consensus problem into a group of stability problems based on the strongly connected components. The corresponding consensus criterion reduces the computational complexity. Moreover, according to the consensus criterion, a distributed design procedure of gain matrices is proposed based on the homotopy method.	computational complexity theory;connected component (graph theory);consensus (computer science);eisenstein's criterion;multi-agent system;network topology;search algorithm;strongly connected component	Xiaojun Qu;Yangzhou Chen;A.

A noisy chaotic signal is first extracted and a noise reduction technique is then used to refine the extracted signal.

However, they cannot approximate arbitrarily well every causal, time-invariant, finite-memory, nonlinear system, i.e., they are not universal approximators as the Volterra filters. In this paper, we propose a novel class of FLANN filters, called Complete FLANN filters, which satisfy the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, and thus can arbitrarily well approximate any nonlinear, time-invariant, finite-memory, continuous system. CFLANN filters are members of the class of nonlinear filters characterized by the property that their output depends linearly on the filter coefficients. As a consequence, they can be efficiently implemented in the form of a filter bank and adapted using algorithms simply derived from those applied to linear filters. In the paper, we apply a nonlinearly Filtered-X NLMS algorithm for CFLANN filters and describe some useful applications in the area of nonlinear active noise control.	approximation algorithm;causal filter;coefficient;filter bank;least mean squares filter;lotka–volterra equations;nonlinear system;time-invariant system	Alberto Carini;Giovanni L.

The design problem is formulated to minimize an objective function, which is a linear combination of pass-band error and stop-band residual energy of the low-pass analysis filter of the filter bank, and the square error of the overall transfer function of the QMF bank at the quadrature frequency. A new algorithm has been developed to minimize the objective function by optimizing the filter tap weights by using Marquardt optimization method. Simulation results of the algorithm show that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the already existing methods. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Stochastic models are given for two types of impulse noise found in adaptive filtering systems: one in observation noise and another at filter input. We first review q-norm and normalized least mean modulus (NLMM) algorithm, and then derive the NRLM algorithm. Analysis of the NRLM algorithm is developed to calculate theoretical convergence. Through experiment, we find that the filter convergence behavior does not critically depend on the value of q. This suggests use of infinity-norm which is easiest to compute. It is also demonstrated that the NRLM algorithm is effective in improving the filter convergence speed, while it enhances the robustness of the NLMM algorithm against both types of impulse noise. Validity of the analysis is confirmed by good agreement observed between simulations and theory.	adaptive filter;algorithm;impulse noise (audio);least mean squares filter;modulus of continuity;recurrence relation;recursion;simulation;steady state;stochastic process	Shin'ichi Koike	2013	2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems	10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704562	adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;digital filter;least mean squares filter;multidelay block frequency domain adaptive filter;kernel adaptive filter;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;mathematics;filter design;statistics;recursive filter;recursive least squares filter	Robotics	59.24541937749058	12.345407368138941	107757

Also, an expression for truncation error variance for values under uniform distribution is obtained. An application of the expressions to analysis of processing essentially quantized data by a nonrecursive smoothing filter is shown. Also their applications to quantization error (quantization noise) analysis of general linear processing of quantized signals under uniform and normal distributions and to quantization error analysis of essentially quantized discrete transforms like DFT (discrete Fourier transform), DCT (discrete cosine transform), DWT (discrete Walsh transforms), wavelet transforms, and so on, to image, sound (audio), video and to general signal processing in many cases can be considered as useful. The effect of accuracy of using these expressions is the more, the more used quantization level and the less maximal signal amplitudes. We find the means and variances of the roundoff errors for a centered random variable in a given range.We derive exact expressions for the variance in closed analitical form.We obtain the variance expressions for the cases of uniformly and normally distributed random values.	round-off error	Yuri A.

We also propose an algorithm to compute the estimates, based on a regularized iterative reweighted least squares algorithm. A basic and a fast version of the algorithm are given. Finally, we test the performance of the proposed approach using numerical experiments and compare it with other estimators. Our estimator provides superior robustness, even up to 40% of outliers, while at the same time performing quite close to the optimal maximum likelihood estimator in the outlier-free case.	algorithm;condition number;experiment;iterative method;least squares;numerical analysis	Marta Martinez-Camara;Michael Muma;Abdelhak M.

In this framework, filter coefficients are allowed to be complex as well as real. Optimality is specified by two criteria: variance of additive noise and stopband attenuation. We first clarify that a synthesis FB yielding PR, which has a degree of freedom in design, can be found in closed form with simple matrix operations. Owing to a degree of freedom, we can specify optimal synthesis FBs which meet those criteria. Theoretical results for finding optimal synthesis filters are shown.

Moreover, the system identification procedure used for data extracted from independent experiments is shown to be valid for data extracted from overlapping subrecords.

df5bec646c7501fb4a410f2a93b8036cb16972c2	determination of the minimum sampling frequency in bandpass sampling by geometric approach and geometric programming		This paper presents a simple and fast approach to find a minimum sampling frequency for multi-band signals. Instead of neighbor and boundary conditions, constraints on the sampling frequency were derived by using the geometric approach to the bandpass sampling theorem. Reformulation of the constraints on the minimum sampling frequency enabled to represent the problem as an optimization problem which was structured by the geometric programming and mixed-integer nonlinear programming methods. The convex optimization problem was then solved by the proposed algorithm applying interior point approach in the line search framework. It was demonstrated that this unified structure directly linked the geometric approach of the bandpass sampling theorem to the optimization problem. The proposedmethodwas verified through numerical simulations in terms of the minimum sampling frequency and the computational efficiency.

36fd84cbded40aa86a75e7e20dd73e94ce383512	synchronization of lagrangian networks with a directed graph via aperiodically intermittent pinning control		Abstract Synchronization of Lagrangian networks with a directed graph via aperiodically intermittent pinning control was developed in this paper. By applying linear feedback injections to a fraction of agents at discontinuous time, all the agents described by Lagrangian systems can be regulated to follow a synchronization state. Based on aperiodically intermittent pinning control, some simple yet general synchronization criteria are derived. Compared with some existing works on control problem of Lagrangian networks, the distinctive advantages of the proposed controllers here include: (i) discontinuous-time control input; (ii) only a fraction of agents to be controlled; (iii) independence on the knowledge of system models. As a direct application, the results are illustrated by a Lagrangian network composing of six two-link revolute manipulators. Subsequently, numerical simulations with different kinds of pinning schemes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.	directed graph;http public key pinning	Mihua Ma;Jianping Cai	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2018.06.043	machine learning;synchronization;directed graph;artificial intelligence;mathematics;control theory;revolute joint;lagrangian	Arch	64.79780752752507	4.647241463271658	108677

These processes have autocorrelation function which is the superposition of amplitude- and angle-modulated complex sinewaves, where the modulating functions, referred to as evolutionary cyclic autocorrelation functions, depend on both time and lag parameter. This class of processes includes that of the almost-cyclostationary processes. The problem of statistical function measurements is addressed for the special case of amplitude-modulated time-warped almost-cyclostationary processes. These processes are shown to be a suitable model for the electrocardiogram.	am broadcasting;autocorrelation;cyclostationary process;mahdiyar;modulation	Antonio Napolitano	2017	2017 25th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081490	superposition principle;statistics;autocorrelation;amplitude;signal processing;cyclostationary process;frequency modulation;control theory;special case;lag;mathematics	ML	54.83354877262505	16.00453502904129	108841

An efficient method for the reconstruction of band-limited discrete signals from sampling sets which are unions of shifted lattices is developed. These sets are not necessarily periodic. A signal can be reconstructed from its samples provided the sampling set and the spectrum of the signal satisfy certain compatibility conditions. While explicit reconstruction formulas for unions of sampling lattices are possible, it is more convenient to use a recursive algorithm. A numerical example utilizing nonperiodic sampling sets implemented in MATLAB is given. The theory and the related algorithm has been applied to speech and image processing examples.	algorithm;bandlimiting;categorization;image processing;matlab;mathematical induction;multidimensional sampling;numerical analysis;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;randomness;recursion (computer science);sampling (signal processing);vanish (computer science)	Hamid Behmard	2009	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2009.2016254	sampling;computer vision;image processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;signal processing;speech processing;mathematics;algorithm	Vision	56.23822561987317	16.806158910460688	108842

On the basis of decomposing the total probability at the point of two adjacent Markov jumping parameters at the current and the next epochs, the posterior probability density of the state for smoothing is derived recursively. Then, through transforming the quotient of two Gaussian mixtures into the corresponding multiplication under the possible two adjacent Markov modes, a recursive Gaussian mixture smoother is designed with the conditional posterior probability density under each hypothesis being approximated by the Gaussian mixture. A maneuvering target tracking example with non-Gaussian noises validates the proposed method.	approximation algorithm;epoch (reference date);gaussian process;linear system;markov chain;mixture model;recursion;smoothing	Yanbo Yang;Yuemei Qin;Yanting Yang;Quan Pan;Zhi Li	2018	2018 21st International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)	10.23919/ICIF.2018.8455478	computer science;machine learning;mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;smoothing;gaussian;linear system;law of total probability;posterior probability;markov process;markov chain;quotient	Robotics	56.03136799246455	5.799875763691462	109112

Directivity of sound radiation, or beamforming, was achieved by driving each loudspeaker unit independently, where the design of beamforming weights was typically achieved by numerical optimization with reference to a given desired beam pattern. This is in contrast to the methods already developed for microphone arrays in general and spherical microphone arrays in particular, where beamformer weights are designed to satisfy a wider range of objectives, related to directivity, robustness, and side-lobe level, for example. This paper presents the development of a physical-model-based, optimal beamforming framework for spherical loudspeaker arrays, similar to the framework already developed for spherical microphone arrays, facilitating efficient beamforming in the spherical harmonics domain, with independent steering. In particular, it is shown that from a beamforming perspective, the spherical loudspeaker array is similar to the spherical microphone array with microphones arranged around a rigid sphere. Experimental investigation validates the theoretical framework of beamformer design.	acoustic lobing;beamforming;loudspeaker;mathematical optimization;microphone;numerical analysis;radiation pattern	Boaz Rafaely;Dima Khaykin	2011	IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASL.2011.2116011	speech recognition;acoustics;harmonic analysis;mathematics;spherical harmonics	Robotics	63.00746569393635	17.479641037468657	109361

Here, by flocking, we mean that all the agents move with a common velocity while keeping a certain desired internal group shape. We first show that flocking algorithms that neglect agents' inertial effect can cause unstable group behavior. To incorporate this inertial effect, we use the passive decomposition, which decomposes the closed-loop group dynamics into two decoupled systems: a shape system representing the internal group shape and a locked system describing the motion of the center-of-mass. Then, analyzing the locked and shape systems separately with the help of graph theory, we propose a provably stable flocking control law, which ensures that the internal group shape is exponentially stabilized to a desired one, while all the agents' velocities converge to the centroid velocity that is also shown to be time-invariant. This result still holds for slow-switching balanced information graphs. Simulation is performed to validate the theory.	agent-based model;algorithm;control theory;converge;flocking (behavior);graph theory;linear matrix inequality;optimal control;simulation;system dynamics;time-invariant system;velocity (software development)	Dongjun Lee;Mark W.

The algorithm is simply a nonparametric kernel estimate of the regression function calculated from dependent data. It is shown that the algorithm converges to the characteristic of the subsystem regardless of the probability distribution of the input variable.

Convexity is often ensured by fitting the table data into analytically convex forms such as posynomials. However, fitting the look-up tables into the posynomial forms with minimum error itself may not be a convex optimization problem and hence excessive fitting errors may be introduced. In this paper, we propose to directly adjust the look-up table values into a numerically convex look-up table without explicit analytical form. We show that numerically """"convexifying"""" the table data with minimum perturbation can be formulated as a convex semidefinite optimization problem and hence optimality can be reached in polynomial time. Without an explicit form limitation, we find that the fitting error is significantly reduced while the convexity is still ensured. As a result, convex optimization algorithms can still be applied. Furthermore, we also develop a """"smoothing"""" algorithm to make the table data smooth and convex to facilitate the optimization process.

First, the optimal linearization technique is utilized to find the exact linear models of the chaotic system at operating states of interest. The proposed blind-channel equalization is formulated as a mixed nonlinear parameter and state estimation problem by an autoregressive (AR) model. The channel coefficients of a fading and multipath channel can be represented by an AR process. Then, an extended Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to reduce the effect of channel noise. By using the extended Kalman filter, the channel coefficients and the state of the system, which is the signal before going through the channel, can be estimated. The stability problem of the proposed blind-channel equalization is also addressed. Numerical examples and simulations are given to show the effectiveness and speed of convergence for the proposed methodology. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to using the sign operation, the proposed algorithm has a robust performance against impulsive noise. A variable step size is obtained by minimizing the mean-square deviation to achieve fast convergence rate and small steady-state error.

This approach uses a robust fast recursive least-squares algorithm (FRLS) and the normalized cross-correlation double-talk detector (NCC DTD). The NCC DTD is developed into a fast version, called FNCC, by reusing computational results from the FRLS algorithm. The major advantage of this detector is that it is much less dependent on the actual echo path attenuation than, e.g., the Geigel DTD. This makes it much more suitable for the acoustic application. r 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, time-varying feedback coupling gains are considered, whose derivative is made directly dependent on the local synchronization error at each vertex in the network. It is shown that, under appropriate conditions, the strategy is indeed successful in guaranteeing the achievement of a common synchronous evolution for all oscillators in the network.

In this work, we define a composite model over a stochastically-switching network capturing both collaborative and antagonistic interactions. We consider a general class of agents, so-called conspecifics, defined in terms of a common distribution for their interaction capacity and the weights they ascribe to interactions. We find closed form expressions for necessary and sufficient conditions for consensus, the rate of convergence to consensus, and conditions for stochastic synchronization. This model is further extended to composite topologies capable of capturing any number of independent interaction modes. Results demonstrate the presence of antagonistic interactions may help the system to achieve consensus and synchronization which is not possible in presence of only collaborative interactions and, at times, enables convergence at a faster rate.	algorithm;consensus (computer science);interaction;maxima;rate of convergence;robot;social system;synchronization (computer science)	Subhradeep Roy;Nicole Abaid	2016	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2538999	random variable;communications protocol;synchronization;simulation;convergence;engineering;control theory;distributed computing;network topology;collaboration	Metrics	64.80292687945195	5.996952724591278	110338

b8407836a4aff32946c9f23500a79ef0c3063103	robust derivative unscented kalman filter under non-gaussian noise		A robust derivative unscented Kalman filter is proposed for a nonlinear system with non-Gaussian noise and outliers based on Huber function. In this paper, the time update process can be performed using a Kalman filter (KF), and measurement update process can be carried out utilizing an unscented transform. This novel filtering algorithm differs from the traditional unscented Kalman filter (UKF) which is sensitive to non-Gaussian noise and outliers. Besides, for a nonlinear system with linear state equation, the presented filtering has the merits of both KF and UKF, and it has better performance under non-Gaussian noise and large outliers. Furthermore, the proposed filtering algorithm can not only track the target effectively but also suppress the effects of the non-Gaussian noise and large outliers. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify estimation accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed filtering algorithm.	algorithm;computer simulation;huber loss;kalman filter;nonlinear system;numerical analysis	Lijian Yin;Baoyu Huo;Yuanqing Xia;Cheng Li	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846752	robustness (computer science);unscented transform;filter (signal processing);outlier;gaussian noise;kalman filter;control theory;computer science;distributed computing;nonlinear system	Robotics	56.39013999279377	4.740628642605763	111023

Specifically, near an exponentially stable periodic orbit undergoing isolated transitions in a hybrid dynamical system, nearby executions generically contract super exponentially to a constant-dimensional subsystem. Under a non-degeneracy condition on the rank deficiency of the associated Poincaré map, the contraction occurs in finite time regardless of the stability properties of the orbit. Hybrid transitions may be removed from the resulting subsystem via a topological quotient that admits a smooth structure to yield an equivalent smooth dynamical system. We demonstrate reduction of a high-dimensional underactuated mechanical model for terrestrial locomotion, assess structural stability of deadbeat controllers for rhythmic locomotion and manipulation, and derive a normal form for the stability basin of a hybrid oscillator. These applications illustrate the utility of our theoretical results for synthesis and analysis of feedback control laws for rhythmic hybrid behavior.	a-normal form;angular defect;approximation algorithm;degeneracy (graph theory);difference quotient;dynamical system;feedback;hybrid system;molecular dynamics;terrestrial television	Samuel Burden;Shai Revzen;S.

It is assumed that the linear dynamic system is represented by the discrete transfer function and the inverse characteristic of the nonlinear element is represented by any set of specified basis functions. It is shown that parameters of a modified series-parallel Wiener model estimated using the least squares method are inconsistent. To obtain consistent parameter estimates, the instrumental variables method is employed. The instrumental variables are generated by passing the system input through the linear dynamic model obtained with the least squares method. It is also shown that proposed identification method can be extended to Wiener systems with inverse nonlinear characteristics that does not contain the first order term. A simulation example is also included to show the effectiveness and practical feasibility and illustrate asymptotic convergence properties of the proposed approach.	basis function;dynamical system;function model;linear least squares (mathematics);mathematical model;nonlinear element;nonlinear system;series-parallel graph;simulation;transfer function	Andrzej Janczak	2013	2013 18th International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR)		mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;non-linear least squares;least squares;nonlinear regression;statistics	Robotics	59.23748667444319	6.064189446065635	112027

Next, truncating the length of series expansion, the transfer functions of FIR and IIR fractional order Simpson integrators are obtained. It is shown that the IIR fractional integrator is always stable.

The optimal choice of the window length can resolve the bias-variance tradeoff in the RSPEC based IF estimation. However, it depends on the unknown nonlinearity of the IF.

Many contrast functions based on the nonlinear structure of the signals have been proposed to extract the unknown sources. However, these researches usually focused on the real-valued case, but ignoring the complex problem. This paper proposes a novel algorithm based on Newton iterations to solve the complex-valued case. The method has a potential capability of extracting complex sources with nonlinear autocorrelation. We also analyze the convergence conditions of the algorithm in theory. Numerical simulations for artificial complex signals corroborate the efficiency of the proposed method. Moreover, our algorithm performs more robust with lower computational cost than classical cumulant-based approach using the nonstationarity of variance (CANSV). Finally, experiments for the separation of single sideband signals illustrate that our method might have good prospects in real-world applications.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;autocorrelation;blind signal separation;channel (communications);communications of the acm;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;experiment;hardware mixing;iteration;mimo;mathematical optimization;newton;nonlinear system;numerical method;simulation;single-sideband modulation;source separation;super smash bros.

For achieving output consensus, a virtual reference model is assumed to generate the desired trajectory that the MAS is required to track and synchronize. A distinct feature of our results lies in the local optimality and robustness achieved by our proposed consensus control algorithm. In addition our study is focused on the case when the available output measurements contain only relative information from the neighboring agents. Indeed by exploiting properties of positive real transfer matrices, conditions are derived for the existence of distributed output feedback control protocols, and solutions are proposed to synthesize the stabilizing and consensus control protocol over a given digraph that has a spanning tree. It is shown that design techniques based on the LQG, LQG/LTR, and H∞ loop shaping can all be employed directly to synthesize the consensus output feedback control protocol, thereby ensuring the local optimality and stability robustness. Finally the reference trajectory is required to be transmitted to only one or a few agents and no local reference models are employed in the feedback controllers thereby eliminating synchronization of the local reference models. Our results complement the existing ones, and are illustrated by a numerical example.	agent-based model;algorithm;authorization;block cipher mode of operation;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;control system;directed graph;dual ec drbg;dynamical system;feedback;file spanning;input/output;local optimum;multi-agent system;noise shaping;numerical analysis;numerical aperture;overhead (computing);reference model;requirement;spanning tree;transfer function;ut-vpn	Luis Alvergue;Abhishek Pandey;Guoxiang Gu;Xiang Chen	2016	SIAM J.

However, loudspeakers introduce nonlinear distortions which may strongly degrade the adaptive filter performance, thus nonlinear filters have to be considered. This paper proposes two adaptive algorithms namely the parallel and cascade sliding-window kernel based affine projection algorithm (PSW-KAPA and CSW-KAPA) to solve the problem of nonlinear AEC (NLAEC) while keeping the computational complexity low. They are based on a leaky KAPA which employs the theory and algorithms of kernel methods. The basic concept is to perform adaptive filtering in a linear space that is nonlinearly related to the original input space. A kernel specifically designed for acoustic applications is proposed, which consists in a weighted sum of the linear and the Gaussian kernels. The motivation is basically to separate the problem into linear and nonlinear subproblems. The weights in the kernel also impose different forgetting mechanisms in the sliding window which in turn translates to a more flexible regularization. Simulation results show that PSW-KAPA and CSW-KAPA consistently outperform the linear NLMS, and generalize well both in high and low linear to nonlinear ratio (LNLR).	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;algorithm;baillie–psw primality test;catalog service for the web;computational complexity theory;distortion;echo suppression and cancellation;kernel (operating system);kernel method;least mean squares filter;loudspeaker;microphone;nonlinear system;simulation;weight function	Jose Manuel Gil-Cacho;Toon van Waterschoot;Marc Moonen;Søren Holdt Jensen	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6287810	loudspeaker;computer vision;mathematical optimization;kernel adaptive filter;computer science;control theory;mathematics;variable kernel density estimation	HPC	61.218135231158506	13.61287808221393	113272

In particular, those complex behaviors are modeled in terms of cooperative tracking of periodic setpoint trajectories. The proposed solution considers a heterogeneous group of robots: a few independent robots are used as a control input for the system, with the aim of controlling the position of the remaining robots, namely the dependent ones. The proposed control strategy explicitly considers changes in the communication topology among the robots, that lead to the definition of a switched system. In particular, these changes happen as the system evolves, since robots are equipped with finite range communication devices. A methodology is introduced for defining the system parameters in order to guarantee asymptotic stability of the switched system, thus guaranteeing the desired tracking performance, assuming that independent robots are able to measure or estimate the global state of the multi-robot system.	robot	Lorenzo Sabattini;Cristian Secchi;Cesare Fantuzzi	2017	Eur.

A new frequency-domain technique ehilbert is formulated that solves the defect. Moreover, the new technique is applicable to all discrete-time real signals of even length. It is implemented by the introduction of one additional zero of the continuous spectrum of the analytic signal hilbert at a negative frequency. Both frequency-domain methods generate equal length discrete-time analytic signals. The new analytic signal preserves the original signal (real part) and also the zeros of the discrete spectrum hilbert in the negative frequencies. The greater attenuation at the negative frequencies affects the degree of aliasing of the analytic signal.

The characteristic function (CF) of the unnormalized conditional probability has been shown to be an analytic and recursive sum of terms composed of a coefficient function of the measurements times on exponential, whose argument has directions operating on the spectral vector. We uncover several fundamental properties of the CF, including the direction coalignment, term combination and reconstruction of the coefficient terms. Based on these properties, a pre-computational technique is developed to enhance the computational efficiency. Numerical simulations of a three-state system demonstrates the performance of the Cauchy estimator under both Cauchy noise environment and Gaussian noise environment, compared to the standard Kalman Filter.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation;characteristic function (convex analysis);coefficient;computation;dynamical system;kalman filter;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;recursion;simulation;three-state logic;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yu Bai;Jason L.

Formulas for the quasiNewton algorithm and the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimator are provided. More interesting results have been obtained in the pure deconvolution case. By a clever parameterization of the deconvolution filter, the estimated parameters are asymptotically independent and explicit and simple formula for their variance are obtained. The quasi-Newton algorithm also becomes particularly simple. Simulation results showing the good performance of the methods are provided. r 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We transform the problem of finding the symmetries of a constrained linear system into the problem of finding the symmetries of a vertex colored graph. The symmetries of a vertex colored graph can be found efficiently using graph automorphism software.

b7c4a15100039d2573c5ec6e9cfa65d783605a13	passivity based state synchronization of multi-agent systems via static or adaptive nonlinear dynamic protocols		This paper studies state synchronization of homogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) with partial-state coupling (i.e., agents are coupled through part of states). We identify three classes of agents, for which static linear protocols can be designed. They are agent which are squared-down passive, squared-down passifiable via output feedback, or G-minimum-phase with relative degree 1. We find that, for squared-down passive agents, the static protocol does not need any network information, as long as the network graph contains a directed spanning tree, while for the other two classes of agents, the static protocol needs rough information on the network graph, in particular, a lower bound of the non-zero eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix associated with the network graph. However, when adaptive nonlinear dynamic protocols are utilized, even this rough information about the network is no longer needed for the other two classes of agents.	block cipher mode of operation;file spanning;laplacian matrix;minimum phase;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;spanning tree	Zhenwei Liu;Meirong Zhang;Ali Saberi;Anton A.

In practice it often happens that some variables, important and critical for quality control, cannot be measured online due to such restrictions as cost and reliability. An uncertainty existing in real systems allows to use a probabilistic approach to online state estimation. Such an approach is proposed in this paper. Different types of information appearing in an online diagnostic system are processed via combination of algorithms subject to probability distributions. This combination of algorithms is presented as a decomposed version of Bayesian filtering. In this paper, the proposed solution is specialized for a system with mixed both continuous and discrete-valued measurements and unobserved variables.	algorithm;bayesian network;bottom type;computation;dynamical system;fault detection and isolation;hidden markov model;hybrid system;iterative method;kalman filter;markov chain;monte carlo method;multinomial logistic regression;numerical analysis;online and offline	Evgenia Suzdaleva;Ivan Nagy	2012	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2011.09.004	control engineering;mathematical optimization;simulation;engineering;state-space representation;machine learning;control theory;statistics	AI	58.55117859590144	4.937948607600251	114107

The connections to orthogonal polynomials are well known. However, infinite impulse response (IIR) models often provide much more compact descriptions and in many cases give improved performance. The objective of this paper is to present a simple framework for the derivation and analysis of orthogonal IIR transfer functions, which are directly related to orthogonal rational functions. Orthogonality simplifies approximation analysis and leads to improved numerical properties. The basic idea is to use a fractional transformation to map the problem to a new domain, where an FIR description is most appropriate. This FIR representation is then mapped back to the original domain to give an orthogonal IIR representation. It is then straightforward to extend many results for FIR models to IIR model structures with arbitrary stable poles; i.e., properties of orthogonal polynomials are easily generalized to orthogonal rational functions. Much of the theory to be presented is classical, e.g., Laguerre and Kautz functions, and we will make use of well-known results in orthogonal filter theory. However, our main contribution is to present a uniform and transparent theory which also covers more novel results that have mainly been presented in the signals, systems, and control literature in the last decade.	apache axis;approximation;approximation algorithm;basis function;bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;book;command & conquer:yuri's revenge;control theory;filter design;finite impulse response;infinite impulse response;laguerre polynomials;low-pass filter;mathematical optimization;nl (complexity);nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical aperture;numerical integration;operational amplifier;polynomial;roberts cross;signal processing;state space;transfer function;transformation theory	Bo Wahlberg	2003	SIAM Review	10.1137/S00361445003766	orthogonal matrix;calculus;mathematics;geometry;transfer function;infinite impulse response;algebra	Theory	59.10242743488411	17.316374428103256	114258

Due to the quantization and the nonuniform distribution of the coefficients through their domain, in the case of adaptive filters, classical steepest descent based approaches cannot be successfully applied. Methods for adaptation processes, as in the least mean squares(LMS) error and other related adaptation algorithms, can actually lose their convergence properties. In this brief, we present a customized Tabu Search (TS) adaptive algorithm that works directly on the power-of-two filter coefficients domain, avoiding any rounding process. In particular, we propose TS for a time varying environment, suitable for real time adaptive signal processing. Several experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive filter;coefficient;digital filter;gradient descent;least mean squares filter;power of two;rounding;shift register;signal processing;tabu search;time complexity;very-large-scale integration	Stefano Traferro;Aurelio Uncini	1999		10.1109/ISCAS.1999.778785	adaptive filter;computer vision;electronic engineering;digital filter;kernel adaptive filter;computer science;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;root-raised-cosine filter;control theory;mathematics;filter design;half-band filter;m-derived filter	ML	61.11007892402737	17.185249249306022	114487

As a generalization of the ordinary Fourier transform, FrFT is a powerful analysis tool to describe signals with chirp-type components. We show that in case of linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals fractional Fourier domain adaptive filtering schemes provide less error and faster convergence. The adaptation algorithm is employed in an active noise control system application with various LFM signals and a real multi-component signal. Simulation results present that the adaptation performance in FrFT-domain adaptive filtering is superior compared to time-domain adaptation. & 2009 Elsevier B.V.

ADC errors are in general signal dependent, and in addition, they often exhibit dynamic dependence. A novel dynamic post-correction scheme based on look-up tables is proposed. In order to reduce the table size and, thus, the hardware requirements, bit-masking is introduced. This is to limit the length of the table index by deselecting index bits. At this point, the problem of which bits to use arises. A mathematical analysis tool is derived, enabling the allocation of index bits to be analyzed. This analysis tool is applied in two optimization problems, optimizing the total harmonic distortion and the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio, respectively, of a corrected ADC. The correction scheme and the optimization problems are illustrated and exemplified using experimental ADC data. The results show that the proposed correction scheme improves the performance of the ADC. They also indicate that the allocation of index bits has a significant impact on the ADC performance, motivating the analysis tool. Finally, the optimization results show that performance improvements compared with static look-up table correction can be achieved, even at a comparable table size.	analog-to-digital converter;append;approximation;concatenation;database index;hadamard transform;iteration;lookup table;mask (computing);mathematical optimization;optimization problem;optimizing compiler;recursion;requirement;sinad;signal processing;spurious-free dynamic range;the matrix;total harmonic distortion	Henrik Lundin;Mikael Skoglund;Peter Händel	2005	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2004.840817	computer vision;mathematical optimization;effective number of bits;computer science;theoretical computer science;signal processing;mathematics;total harmonic distortion	DB	62.57297245944361	17.856473473652116	115132

The approach utilizes cross spectral density (CSD) of the channel outputs, and minimizes the distance between two CSDu0027s, one calculated non-parametrically from the observed output data, and the other calculated from the blindly estimated channel parameters. The CSD criterion is numerically tested on randomly generated SIMO-FIR channels, and shown to be very effective compared to existing channel order selection methods especially under low SNR settings. Blind estimates of the channels with the selected channel order also show superiority of the CSD criterion.	spectral method	Koji Harada;Hideaki Sakai	2009	IEICE Transactions		mathematical optimization;finite impulse response;mathematics;spectral density;statistics	Vision	55.18175587844203	12.90840303971138	115370
869e01154ac827097ad34a446f9026044cde4ee7	a delay relaxed rls-dcd algorithm for real-time implementation		The recursive least squares algorithm (RLS) using dichotomous coordinate descent (DCD) iterations, namely, RLS-DCD, is regarded to be well suited for hardware implementation because of its small computational complexity compared to the classical RLS algorithm. While this is true, yet another important aspect that ultimately determines its applicability for real-time applications with high sample rates, is its iteration bound. In this brief, we discuss this issue and propose a modified RLS-DCD algorithm based on delay relaxation whose iteration bound can be reduced arbitrarily. The degradation in convergence speed is shown to be tolerable, which results in still much faster convergence compared to the normalized least mean square algorithm.	algorithm;computational complexity theory;coordinate descent;elegant degradation;iteration;linear programming relaxation;mean squared error;real-time clock;real-time transcription;recursion;recursive least squares filter;vergence;yet another	Geonu Kim;Hyuk Lee;Jinjoo Chung;Jungwoo Lee	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2017.2706367	control theory;coordinate descent;algorithm design;approximation algorithm;normalization (statistics);recursive least squares filter;computational complexity theory;algorithm;mathematics;least mean squares filter;mathematical optimization;convergence (routing)	EDA	60.51172406071026	12.468785339928374	115471

Although very attractive due to their low computational costs, these procedures often suffer from the underlying ill-conditioned fast-Kalman-type algorithm structure which allows roundoff errors to accumulate in the time direction in each stage of the fast estimation algorithms. This effect causes the algorithms to degrade in a n unpleasant way so that they lose their fast start-up and tracking capability and finally perform not better than simple gradient algorithms when operated in finite arithmetic environments. To cope with these problems, the recently developed method of pure order recursive ladder algorithms (PORLA) is extended in this paper so as to facilitate the identification of ARMA models. Since the time recursion in this new method is limited on the calculation of the input data covariance matrix, roundoff errors cannot propagate in time in higher stages of the pure order recursively constructed ladder form. Thus, the superior LS tracking and fast start-up capability of the new algorithms is not corrupted by roundoff error. Furthermore, the new algorithms allow the use of higher order recursive windows on the data (e.g., recursive Hanning) which again significantly improves the tracking as well as the steady-state behavior. The algorithm development presented here is backed up with a computer program, a n instructive example for implementation of the new method on a massively parallel processor (MPP), and finally, we show several experimental results which confirm the superior properties of the new PORLA method over conventional techniques.	algorithm;backup;computation;computer program;condition number;goodyear mpp;gradient;microsoft windows;parallel computing;recursion (computer science);round-off error;steady state;system identification;transfer function	Peter Strobach	1988	IEEE Trans.

Several optimization criteria for adapting the scaling parameter are proposed and discussed and to apply the scaling parameter adaptation within the Gaussian sum framework, three adaptation procedures are proposed. Performance of the proposed estimation methods is analyzed through the root mean square error and non-credibility index in a numerical example.	dynamical system;image scaling;kalman filter;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;nonlinear system;numerical analysis	Ondrej Straka;Jindrich Duník;Miroslav Simandl	2011	14th International Conference on Information Fusion		mathematical optimization;invariant extended kalman filter;unscented transform;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;statistics	Robotics	57.61692424696036	9.388065321838509	116022

We consider a second-order autoregressive linear predictive model for the noiseless complex-valued αβ signal of the system to relate the system frequency to the phase voltages. We use this model and the noisy voltage data to calculate a total least-square (TLS) estimate of the system frequency by employing the inverse power method in a recursive manner. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm, called recursive TLS (RTLS), outperforms the recursive least-squares (RLS) and the bias-compensated RLS (BCRLS) algorithms in estimating the frequency of both balanced and unbalanced three-phase power systems. Unlike BCRLS, RTLS does not require the prior knowledge of the noise variance.	adaptive algorithm;autoregressive model;exponent bias;ibm power systems;image noise;input/output;inverse iteration;power iteration;real-time locating system;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;resultant;simulation;spectral density estimation;unbalanced circuit	Reza Arablouei;Kutluyil Dogançay;Stefan Werner	2014	2014 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		electric power system;real-time locating system;adaptive algorithm;control theory;total least squares;autoregressive model;three-phase;recursion;inverse iteration;mathematics	HPC	60.63280916548809	11.345454134111279	116041
7a763242232936258e651629e9eb1c7133da318d	multistatic passive detection with parametric modeling of the io waveform		Abstract This paper examines the target detection problem for a passive multistatic radar employing illuminators of opportunity (IOs), where the receivers are contaminated by non-negligible noise and direct-path interference (DPI). A parametric approach is proposed by modeling the unknown signal transmitted from the IO as an auto-regressive (AR) process whose temporal correlation is jointly estimated and exploited for passive detection. The proposed solution is developed based on the generalized likelihood ratio test principle, which involves non-linear estimation that is solved by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We also discuss the initialization of the EM algorithm and the joint adaptive model order estimation for the AR process without using any training signal. In addition, we extend several conventional passive detectors, which were introduced by assuming no DPI is present, to provide them with an ability to handle the DPI problem. A clairvoyant matched filtering (MF) detector is derived as well assuming the knowledge of the IO waveform. Extensive simulation results are presented, using simulated waveforms whose temporal correlation can be easily controlled, as well as practical IO waveforms transmitted by frequency modulation (FM) radio. The results show that the proposed EM-based passive detector outperforms conventional passive detectors due to the exploitation of the waveform correlation.	parametric model;waveform	Xin Zhang;Hongbin Li;Braham Himed	2017	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2017.06.003	filter (signal processing);control theory;parametric statistics;passive radar;mathematics;expectation–maximization algorithm;frequency modulation;detector;multistatic radar;waveform;electronic engineering	ML	65.72483779544524	13.096963077269493	116168

In particular, optimization of orthonormal subband coders for a given power spectrum directly leads to optimal energy compaction lters. In this paper, we consider some new design methods and properties of optimal FIR energy compaction lters. In particular, we propose a very e cient method called the window method for the general M -channel case. The method does not involve any sophisticated optimization tools and terminates in a nite number of elementary steps. Compaction gains achieved by the method are very close to the optimal ones. As the lter order increases the lters of the proposed method converge to the optimum ideal compaction lters.	converge;data compaction;data compression;finite impulse response;mathematical optimization;spectral density;window function	Ahmet Kirac;Palghat P.

In this paper, we consider consensus control of discrete-time first-order agents with the communication graph being an expander network. Each agent has a real-valued state but can only exchange symbolic data with its neighbors. A distributed protocol is designed based on dynamic encoding and decoding with finite level uniform quantizers. The choice of the control parameters only depends on the number of agents, the maximum degree and the isoperimetric constant of the network. It is shown that under the protocol designed, average-consensus can be achieved with an exponential convergence rate based on a single-bit information exchange between each pair of adjacent nodes at each time step. A performance index is given to characterize the total communication energy cost to achieve average-consensus and it is shown that the minimization of the communication energy cost leads to a tradeoff between the convergence rate and the number of quantization levels.	energy minimization;first-order predicate;information exchange;isoperimetric inequality;rate of convergence;sparse matrix;telecommunications network;time complexity	Tao Li;Minyue Fu;Lihua Xie;Ji-Feng Zhang	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5400229	communications protocol;discrete time and continuous time;process performance index;real-time computing;information exchange;convergence;quantization;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;first-order logic;mathematics;distributed computing;rate of convergence;nova;energy minimization;encoding;statistics;channel	Robotics	63.82477906249303	7.321417762182982	116290

In this paper, we introduce an analytical approach to selecting leader agents in order to minimize the total mean-square error of the follower agent states from their desired value in steady-state in the presence of noisy communication links. We show that, for a set of link weights based on the second-order noise statistics, the problem of choosing leaders in order to minimize this error can be solved using supermodular optimization techniques, leading to efficient algorithms that are within a provable bound of the optimum. We formulate two leader selection problems within our framework, namely the problem of choosing a fixed number of leaders to minimize the error, as well as the problem of choosing the minimum number of leaders to achieve a tolerated level of error. We study both leader selection criteria for different scenarios, including MAS with static topologies, topologies experiencing random link or node failures, switching topologies, and topologies that vary arbitrarily in time due to node mobility. In addition to providing provable bounds for all of these cases, simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other leader selection methods, such as node degree-based and random selection methods, and provides comparable performance to current state of the art algorithms.	algorithm;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multi-agent system;network topology;provable security;simulation;steady state;supermodular function	Andrew Clark;Linda Bushnell;Radha Poovendran	2014	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2013.2281473	mobile robot;stochastic process;minimisation;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing;linear system;statistics	ML	63.443015608386986	6.994631218039204	116304

First, the exponential convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed under a new condition on network topologies, called cooperatively connected. This condition does not require the topology constantly connected or jointly connected but only requires the integral of the Laplacian matrix of the network topology over a period of time is connected. Hence, it is suitable for more general time-varying topologies. Second, by establishing a key mathematical lemma, we develop a convergence analysis technique which is based on the difference of the Lyapunov function rather than its differentiation. Finally, a simulation example is also provided to verify the results obtained in this paper.	gradient;mathematical optimization	Jiayun Liu;Weisheng V Chen;Hao Dai	2017	Int. J.

In order to properly solve the problem, a relaxed system is introduced and the connection between the olution of this system and the solution of the initial one is established. One of the main difficulties is then related to the fact that the ptimal solution can be singular. We show that, using slack variables, a set of complementarity constraints can be used to take into ccount the singular nature of the solution. The optimal control problem is then reformulated as a constraint optimization problem ver the Hamiltonian systems and solved via a direct method. This formulation does not require a priori knowledge on the structure regular/singular) of the solution. In addition, state path constraints are included. Numerical simulations for boost, buck–boost and ying capacitor converters, both in continuous and discontinuous conduction mode, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed ethodology. 2013 IMACS.

The DFNN possesses characteristics such as dynamic mapping and restraint noise. The blind equalization is the process of dynamic equalization essentially because digital communication channel is time-varying and indeterminate. The algorithm proposed in this paper accords with the dynamic characteristic of channel because it uses current data and history data. Hence, the new algorithm possesses distinct advantages of stability, convergence speed and convergence properties over the traditional neural network (NN) blind equalization algorithm. The improved performance of the proposed models is confirmed through computer simulations.	algorithm;artificial neural network;blind equalization;channel (communications);computer simulation;indeterminacy in concurrent computation;neuro-fuzzy	Yongxing Hou;Qinghua Bu	2008	2008 Fifth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	10.1109/FSKD.2008.297	training set;computer science;machine learning;blind equalization;artificial neural network;wireless	Robotics	61.930530633343224	12.864395073862623	117056

A network of agents aims to collaboratively estimate the value of an unknown vector parameter, while an unknown subset of agents suffer Byzantine faults. Faulty agents malfunction arbitrarily and may send out highly unstructured messages to other agents in the network. As opposed to fault-free networks, reaching agreement in the presence of Byzantine faults is far from trivial. In this paper, we propose a computationally-efficient algorithm that is provably robust to Byzantine faults. At each iteration of the algorithm, a good agent (1) performs a gradient descent update based on noisy local measurements, (2) exchanges its update with other agents in its neighborhood, and (3) robustly aggregates the received messages using coordinate-wise trimmed means. Under mild technical assumptions, we establish that good agents learn the true parameter asymptotically in almost sure sense. We further complement our analysis by proving (high probability) finite-time convergence rate, encapsulating network characteristics.	algorithm;byzantine fault tolerance;gradient descent;iteration;multi-agent system;rate of convergence	Lili Su;Shahin Shahrampour	2018	CoRR		mathematical optimization;rate of convergence;mathematics;gradient descent	ML	62.64864849305153	6.361640591964367	117369

The linear vocal tract model is well justified biomechanically, and linear prediction is a simple and well understood signal processing task. However, it has been established that, in voiced sounds, the vocal folds exhibit a high degree of nonlinearity. Hence there exists the need for an approach to modelling the behaviour of the vocal folds. This paper presents a simple, nonlinear, biophysical vocal fold model. A complementary discrete model is derived that reflects accurately the energy dynamics in the continuous model. This model can be implemented easily on standard digital signal processing hardware, and it is formulated in such a way that a simple form of nonlinear prediction can be carried out on vocal fold signals. This model could be of utility in many speech technological applications where low computational complexity synthesis and analysis of vocal fold dynamics is required.	computational complexity theory;digital signal processing;nonlinear system;speech technology;tract (literature)	Max A.

A practical expression for determining the required number of bits for the coefficient quantization as a function of a predefined maximum deviation in the magnitude response is proposed in combination with an alternative method based on a time domain analysis. The time domain analysis allows, for a specific pole approximation, to investigate the sensitivity of the MFIR structure to coefficient variations. The paper concludes that, statistically, the MFIR pole approximation filter does not require a larger number of quantization bits for its coefficients than the corresponding Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;domain analysis;finite impulse response;frequency response;infinite impulse response;quantization (signal processing)	Jean-Jacques Vandenbussche;Peter Lee;Joan Peuteman	2013	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2012.09.020	mathematical optimization;computer science;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics;field-programmable gate array	Graphics	57.06798280830414	16.818571354801946	117706

Here, the approximate diagonalization is carried out successively by applying degree-1 finite impulse response (FIR) paraunitary (PU) transformations. The system parameters are chosen to make the zeroth order diagonal energy (ZODE) nondecreasing at each stage.

Unlike the existing works, the agreement of position-like states is not required in this paper. Velocity consensus is a prerequisite of the popular Vicsek model and can find its broad applications in congestion control for internet, distributed task management, distributed estimation for sensor networks, etc. We first give an approach to approximating velocities based on delayed position-like information and then provide the design and analysis results for the velocity-consensus control. We show that if the union of the interaction topology across the time interval with some given length always contains a spanning tree, then the proposed asynchronous protocol will solve the velocity-consensus problem asymptotically.	asymptote;consensus (computer science);multi-agent system;network congestion;spanning tree;velocity (software development);vicsek model	Jie Chen;Long Wang;Feng Xiao	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5399923	control engineering;consensus;computer science;multi-agent system;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing	Robotics	64.1386174486682	5.443125019490841	117854

The equalization scenario is considered from the decision point of view, and constitutes a joint identification and estimation situation due to incomplete knowledge of the system model. A new class of multilinearization algorithms for nonlinear systems is derived according to partitioning theory concepts. The procedure targets on adaptively selecting the best reference points for linearization from an ensemble of generated trajectories that span the whole state space of the desired signal. In the various simulations examined, the partitioned-based equalizer is found superior to the classical extended Kalman filter.	nonlinear system	Demetrios G.

The authors review the Fourier series model of an array's response and introduce a suboptimum method of determining the model parameters. The performance of the suboptimal solution is significantly influenced by the scaling of the principal components (M.A. Koerber, 1992). A method of scaling based on a QR decomposition is presented. This method provides for approximately an order of magnitude reduction in error over previously reported scaling methods. This approach has the significant advantage of requiring no a priori knowledge of the array's response. Simulation results compare the use of QR decomposition based scaling with the ML solution. >		Michael A. Koerber;Daniel R.

First, we employ an extreme-value and asymptotic take on the theory of Gershgorin spectrum bounds to perform a detailed statistical analysis of the spectrum of random N × N Gramian matrices which arise from dynamic constructions of MDS kernels where the diagonalizer of a previous kernel is used to construct the next one. The analysis reveals that even if the subspace distance between consecutive kernels is relatively large, the dominant eigenspace of dynamic MDS kernels are, with a high probability quantified analytically, associated with its first rows. This feature is exploited further to design a statistically optimized and truncated variation of the Jacobi algorithm, which converges to the dominant eigenspace of a dynamic MDS kernel as fast as the overall optimal Jacobian, but without the exhaustive search for the elements to be annihilated at each rotation as required in the latter. Under the fact that the Euclidean double-centered kernels of the classic MDS method are asymptotically Gramian, and the knowledge of Nyström-inspired methods to compensate for data erasures, the technique presented yields a very efficient (fast) MDS-based multitarget tracking algorithm which achieves a remarkably low complexity of order O(√(N)), and which is robust to arbitrary statistics of the target's dynamics.	algorithm;brute-force search;gramian matrix;image scaling;jacobi method;jacobian matrix and determinant;kernel (operating system);multidimensional scaling	Davide Macagnano;Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu	2011	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2100388	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;statistics	Vision	55.06114820872992	9.819874507107611	118638

Based on synchronous and asynchronous sampled-data, we construct two respective algorithms. Our main results, sufficient conditions for the convergence to an optimal solution, are obtained under assumption that all design parameters are chosen properly. We also present one example to validate our theoretical results.	mathematical optimization;multi-agent system	Junxiu Yan;Huiye Qiu;Xiaohua Xia	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2018.03.036	machine learning;mathematical optimization;lipschitz continuity;artificial intelligence;asynchronous communication;mathematics;multi-agent system;convex function;strongly connected component;optimization problem;convergence (routing)	AI	64.7168093720063	6.8431622075653555	118658

To solve this problem, we propose ARock, an asynchronous parallel algorithmic framework, in which a set of agents (machines, processors, or cores) update randomly selected coordinates of the unknown variable in an asynchronous parallel fashion. The resulting algorithms are not affected by load imbalance. When the coordinate updates are atomic, the algorithms are free of memory locks. We show that if the nonexpansive operator has a fixed point, then with probability one, the sequence of points generated by ARock converges to a fixed point of the operator. Stronger convergence properties such as linear convergence are obtained under stronger conditions. As special cases of ARock, novel algorithms for linear systems, convex optimization, machine learning, distributed and decentralized optimization are introduced with provable convergence. Very promising numerical performance of ARock has been observed. Considering the paper length, we present the numerical results of solving linear equations and sparse logistic regression problems.	algorithm;central processing unit;coefficient;computational science;convex conjugate;convex optimization;distributed computing;duality (optimization);emoticon;fixed point (mathematics);linear equation;linear system;lock (computer science);logistic regression;machine learning;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;numerical linear algebra;provable security;proximal operator;randomness;rate of convergence;sparse matrix;synthetic intelligence;vanish (computer science)	Zhimin Peng;Yangyang Xu;Ming Yan;Wotao Yin	2016	SIAM J.

One of the key issues in these block-oriented watermarking schemes is to preserve the synchronisation, i.e. to recover the exact position of each block in the mark recovery process. In this paper, a novel time domain synchronisation technique is presented together with a new blind watermarking scheme which works in the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT or FFT) domain. The combined scheme provides excellent imperceptibility results whilst achieving robustness against typical attacks. Furthermore, the execution of the scheme is fast enough to be used in real-time applications. The excellent transparency of the embedding algorithm makes it particularly useful for professional applications, such as the embedding of monitoring information in broadcast signals. The scheme is also compared with some recent results of the literature.

First, a modular cascade structure for implementing 1-D VFD filter is obtained by using the infinite product expansion of exponential function. This structure is only composed of one basic modular cell. Then, the first order digital differentiator which is designed by the least squares method is applied to realize basic cell in the proposed structure. Next, the proposed method is extended to design 2-D VFD filter.

ba52e1ba93b9bbaa0b303f7cd404e8db1c6f7179	fully distributed event-triggered protocols for linear multi-agent networks		This paper considers the distributed event-triggered consensus problem for general linear multi-agent networks. Both the leaderless and leader-follower consensus problems are considered. Based on the local sampled state or local output information, distributed adaptive eventtriggered protocols are designed, which can ensure that consensus of the agents is achieved and the Zeno behavior is excluded by showing that the interval between any two triggering events is lower bounded by a strictly positive value. Compared to the previous related works, our main contribution is that the proposed adaptive event-based protocols are fully distributed and scalable, which do not rely on any global information of the network graph and are independent of the network’s scale. In these event-based protocols, continuous communications are not required for either control laws updating or triggering functions monitoring.	consensus (computer science);directed graph;multi-agent system;scalability	Bin Cheng;Zhongkui Li	2018	CoRR		scalability;mathematical optimization;mathematics;distributed computing;zeno's paradoxes;consensus;graph;multi-agent system	ML	64.02616696694103	5.761651147772788	119250
25bf38804436548501780136fac357284ab6dcae	decentralized control of stochastically switched linear system with unreliable communication		We consider a networked control system (NCS) consisting of two plants, a global plant and a local plant, and two controllers, a global controller and a local controller. The global (resp. local) plant follows discrete-time stochastically switched linear dynamics with a continuous global (resp. local) state and a discrete global (resp. local) mode. We assume that the state and mode of the global plant are observed by both controllers while the state and mode of the local plant are only observed by the local controller. The local controller can inform the global controller of the local plant's state and mode through an unreliable TCP-like communication channel where successful transmissions are acknowledged. The objective of the controllers is to cooperatively minimize a modes-dependent quadratic cost over a finite time horizon. Following the method developed in [1] and [2], we construct a dynamic program based on common information and a decomposition of strategies, and use it to obtain explicit optimal strategies for the controllers. In the optimal strategies, both controllers compute a common estimate of the local plant's state. The global controller's action is linear in the state of the global plant and the common estimated state, and the local controller's action is linear in the actual states of both plants and the common estimated state. Furthermore, the gain matrices for the global controller depend on the global mode and its observation about the local mode, while the gain matrices for the local controller depend on the actual modes of both plants and the global controller's observation about the local mode.	channel (communications);distributed control system;linear system;network computing system	Seyed Mohammad Asghari;Yi Ouyang;Ashutosh Nayyar	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8430927	control theory;control theory;decentralised system;control engineering;time horizon;mathematics;random variable;linear system;matrix (mathematics);networked control system;communication channel	Robotics	64.39135894258386	6.755524541917325	119715

However, the computational burden increases with the snapshot for iterative operation. In this paper, singular value decomposition (SVD) is employed to eliminate the effect of snapshot and a new version of algorithm JDFTD based on SVD (SVD-JDFTD) is proposed. Numerical simulations verify that SVD-JDFTD reduces the computational burden without loss the superior estimation performance of JDFTD.	algorithm;computation;direction of arrival;iterative method;numerical linear algebra;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing);simulation;singular value decomposition;snapshot (computer storage);spectral density estimation	Liang Liu;Jian-Feng Gu;Ping Wei	2017	2017 3rd IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)	10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.08.009	mathematical optimization;snapshot (computer storage);sampling (statistics);nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;singular value decomposition;mathematics	Vision	53.82523361961554	7.528187110312245	119728

In this paper we propose a technique to retain the simplicity of the linear prediction by including a memoryless nonlinear function. The design of this later is approached from a Bayesian perspective: we look for the conditional mean of the predicted value, given the output of the linear predictor. Two techniques are proposed: the first one makes use of a closed form solution where some higher-order statistics are to be estimated. The second one is a direct sample estimate of the conditional mean given a data training set. The techniques are applied to improve the signal to noise ratio in the automatic detection of fire by infrared signal processing.	kerrison predictor;nonlinear system;signal processing;signal-to-noise ratio;test set	Pablo Bernabeu;Ignacio Bosch;Luis Vergara	2002	2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference		econometrics;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	ML	56.214450404534155	13.150116144825708	119907

Firstly, distributed adaptive online updating strategies for some parameters are proposed based on local information of the network structure. Then, under the online updating parameters, a distributed adaptive protocol is developed to compensate the fault effects and the uncertainty effects in the leaderless multi-agent system. Based on the local state information of neighboring agents, a distributed updating protocol gain is developed which leads to a fully distributed continuous adaptive fault-tolerant consensus protocol design for the leaderless multi-agent system. Furthermore, a distributed fault-tolerant leader-follower consensus protocol for multi-agent system is constructed by the proposed adaptive method. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.	communications protocol;fault tolerance;fault-tolerant computer system;local variable;multi-agent system;numerous;online algorithm;simulation	Shun Chen;Daniel W.

In this paper, we propose a DSP approach to design nonlinear optical devices by treating the desired nonlinear response in the weak perturbation limit as a discrete-time filter. Optimized discrete-time filters can be designed and then mapped onto a specific optical architecture to obtain the desired nonlinear response. This approach is systematic and intuitive for the design of nonlinear optical devices. We demonstrate this approach by designing autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) lattice filters to obtain a nonlinear phase shift response.	autoregressive model;digital filter;discrete-time signal;nonlinear system;signal processing	Geeta Pasrija;Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny;Steve Blair	2005	EURASIP J.

An alternative implicit sampling model is to record the timing of pre-determined level crossings. Thus the signal dictates the sampling times but not the sampling levels. Logan's theorem provides sufficient conditions for a signal to be recoverable, within a scaling factor, from only the timing of its zero crossings. Unfortunately, recovery from noisy observations of the timings is not robust and usually fails to reproduce the original signal. To make the reconstruction robust this paper introduces the additional assumption that the signal is sparse in some basis. We reformulate the reconstruction problem as a minimization of a sparsity inducing cost function on the unit sphere and provide an algorithm to compute the solution. While the problem is not convex, simulation studies indicate that the algorithm converges in typical cases and produces the correct solution with very high probability.	algorithm;compressed sensing;image scaling;loss function;reconstruction conjecture;sampling (signal processing);schedule (computer science);signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;sparse matrix	Petros Boufounos;Richard G.

a56f6d9d65c2f8947b0b6784011f53d744067652	identification of cascade dynamic nonlinear systems: a bargaining-game-theory-based approach		Cascade dynamic nonlinear systems can describe a wide class of engineering problems, but little efforts have been devoted to the identification of such systems so far. One of the difficulties comes from its non-convex characteristic. In this paper, the identification of a general cascade dynamic nonlinear system is rearranged and transformed into a convex problem involving a double-input single-output nonlinear system. In order to limit the estimate error at the frequencies of interest and to overcome the singularity problem incurred in the least-square-based methods, the identification problem is, thereafter, decomposed into a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the objective functions are defined in terms of the spectra of the unbiased error function at the frequencies of interest and are expressed as a first-order polynomial of the model parameters to be identified. The coefficients of the first-order polynomial are derived in an explicit expression involving the system input and the measured noised output. To tackle the convergence performance of the multi-objective optimization problem, the bargaining game theory is used to model the interactions and the competitions among multiple objectives defined at the frequencies of interest. Using the game-theory-based approach, both the global information and the local information are taken into account in the optimization, which leads to an obvious improvement of the convergence performance. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed bargaining-game-theory-based algorithm is effective and efficient for the multi-objective optimization problem, and so is the identification of the cascade dynamic nonlinear systems.	algorithm;coefficient;convex optimization;first-order predicate;game theory;interaction;mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;nonlinear system;numerical method;optimization problem;polynomial;technological singularity	Zhenlong Xiao;Shengbo Shan;Li Cheng	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2858212	mathematics;mathematical optimization;control theory;game theory;nonlinear system;frequency domain;convex optimization;singularity;polynomial;optimization problem;parameter identification problem	ML	66.44820864796019	13.40330899126273	120311

The inverse iteration algorithm for spectral analysis is formulated in a distributed manner to allow each agent to estimate a component of global network connectivity, improving on the convergence rate issues of previous approaches. Potential-based controls drive the agents to maximize connectivity under local degree constraints, maintain established links to guarantee connectivity, and avoid collisions. To achieve constraint satisfaction we exploit a switched model of interaction that regulates link addition through symmetric, repulsive potentials between constraint violators, enforcing discernment in communication through spatial organization. Simulations of connectivity estimation as well as agent aggregation and leader-following applications demonstrate the ability of our proposed methods to generate connectivity maximizing, constraint-aware self organization.	algebraic connectivity;computer simulation;constraint satisfaction;correctness (computer science);distributed algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;global network;inverse iteration;iterative method;jacobi eigenvalue algorithm;jacobi method;linear algebra;linear system;mobile agent;mobile robot;rate of convergence;self-organization;spatial organization;spectral density estimation	Ryan K.

This paper investigates the impact of communication on the performance of a fully distributed DC OPF algorithm, which solves the first order optimality conditions through an iterative process. In this distributed algorithm, at each iteration, every bus exchanges information with its physically connected neighboring buses and updates the local variables by evaluating a simple function. This paper suggests that sharing additional information between buses without physical connections across the system can speed up the convergence of the algorithm. A key aspect is the constrained selection of these additional communication links and the effective integration of this information in the update of the local variables which is the focus of this paper. A proof of concept is given using the IEEE-118 bus test system as a test case.	bus (computing);distributed algorithm;iteration;local variable;rate of convergence;test case	Javad Mohammadi;Gabriela Hug;Soummya Kar	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)	10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007620	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	HPC	64.54795246122775	9.436829738709715	120823

An adaptive convex combination of one fast a one slow LMS filters has been previously proposed for plant identification, as a way to break the speed vs precision compromise inherent to LMS filters. In this paper, an improved version of this combination method is presented. Instead of using a global mixing parameter, the new algorithm uses a different combination parameter for each weight of the adaptive filter, what gives some advantage when identifying varying plants where some of the coefficients remain unaltered, or when the input process is colored. Some simulation examples show the validity of this approach when compared with the one-parameter combination scheme and with a different multi-step approach.	adaptive filter;algorithm;coefficient;gene prediction;least mean squares filter;signal processing;simulation	Jerónimo Arenas-García;Vanessa Gómez-Verdejo;Manel Martínez-Ramón;Aníbal R.

a67cbfece68c3be617ed1fa24fbf8b7f2ee456fa	a numerically stable formulation of the square root unscented kalman filter for state estimation		The square root unscented Kalman filter was introduced to provide a more numerically robust formulation of the unscented Kalman filter and to guarantee positive semi-definiteness. The filter maintains the Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix instead of the covariance itself. Efficient linear algebra techniques, including Cholesky update and downdate, are used to predict and update the Cholesky factor over time. However, a downdated Cholesky factor may not exist due to numerical rounding and truncation. This may impose issues especially in highly dimensional state spaces or if quantities of different magnitude are involved. A failed Cholesky downdate could be accounted for by predicting a more conservative covariance matrix or by neglecting the filter step in the prevailing iteration. However, both approaches may decrease filter performance. A more sophisticated strategy would be to prevent these issues from happening in the first place. We propose a mathematically equivalent filter that numerically guarantees positive semi-definiteness for any arithmetic precision at the cost of a negligible runtime increase. It applies the auxiliary formulation of the scaled unscented transform and filters the forecast sigma points separately.	algorithm;cholesky decomposition;computational complexity theory;iteration;kalman filter;linear algebra;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;numerical analysis;numerical stability;robustness (computer science);rounding;semiconductor industry;significant figures;truncation;windows update	Tino Milschewski;Jean-Francois Bariant	2017	2017 20th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)	10.23919/ICIF.2017.8009711	unscented transform;kalman filter;ensemble kalman filter;cholesky decomposition;invariant extended kalman filter;minimum degree algorithm;incomplete cholesky factorization;extended kalman filter;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.41967650053402	13.963889296941325	120995

To increase the performance of maneuvering target tracking, the 2D and 3D target motion models and the observation model based on the geodetic coordinate system are derived. In order to cope with the target tracking and fusion problems which arise from the intense non-linearity and decentralization in a geodetic coordinate system, two decentralized fusion algorithms denoted as SR-UKF (TR) and SR-UKF (CI) which we developed before are used. Considering the limited bandwidth of the communication network in a battle environment, an adaptive selection scheme which captures the competitive and cooperative relations among the neighbor sensor nodes is developed for decentralized information dissemination.

By yielding an asymptotically efficient filter in the presence of an unknown observation noise, our approach may also be viewed as a robust approach to noisy component extraction.

As such they allow a natural bridging of scales (ranges of frequencies) and time, and are more attractive than models defined in the time- or frequency-domain, alone. The term “multiscale model”, as used in this two-part series, is quite different from the notion of a “multiscale model”, as this is used in recent publications, where in essence such model bridges the states of a system at two distinct scales (an atomistic scale of fast elementary phenomena, and a macroscopic scale characterizing slow continuum-based physics), described by two distinctly different physical models. The multiscale dynamic models, introduced in this paper, link state dynamics over a number of distinct time scales, and are in essence “multiresolution” facets of a single model. The outgrowth of a series of developments, which came about with the advent of the wavelet decomposition for the analysis of discrete signals, multiscale models are defined on dyadic trees, which span the time-scale space. The nodes of such trees are used to index the values of states, inputs and outputs, modeling errors, and measurement errors of dynamic systems. These values are localized in both time and scale (range of frequencies), and thus they offer a hybrid domain that is particularly conducive for estimation and control problems. In Part 1 of this series, which focuses on the foundations of a multiscale systems theory, we will describe the generation of multiscale models from their time-domain counterparts, and develop conditions governing their stability, controllability and observability. In addition, we will address the development of algorithms for the solution of basic problems, such as: optimal control, state estimation, and optimal fusion of measurements and control actions at various scales. It will be shown that multiscale models lend themselves nicely to construction of very effective parallelizable algorithms. In Part 2 of this series, we will apply all these developments to the formulation of a Multiscale Model Predictive Control (MS-MPC) approach and we will show that MS-MPC is a more attractive framework for the design and implementation of multivariable control systems.

Firstly, the wavelet denoising process is adopted to reduce the noise effect for the signal. Secondly, polynomials are constructed to fit the denoised signal in a set of overlapped subintervals of a considered interval. Thirdly, the variable-order fractional derivatives of these fitting polynomials are used as the estimations of the unknown ones, where the values obtained near the boundaries of each subinterval are ignored in the overlapped parts.

Based on the generalized equitable partition, we propose a graph-theoretic characterization of an upper bound on the controllable subspace. Then, we provide a necessary condition for the controllability of the system and give an algorithm to compute the partition. Furthermore, we prove that for a structurally balanced network, the controllability is equivalent to that of the corresponding all-positive network, if the leaders are chosen from the same vertex set.

Lower bounds for both the state and the Markovian interruption variables (fault indicators) of the system are derived, using the recently presented sequential version of the Crame/spl acute/r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for general nonlinear systems. Because of the hybrid nature of the systems addressed, the CRLB cannot be directly applied due to violation of its associated regularity conditions. To facilitate the calculation of the lower bound, the hybrid system is first approximated by a system in which the discrete distribution of the fault indicators is replaced by an approximating continuous one. The lower bound is then obtained via a limiting process applied to the approximating system. The results presented herein facilitate a relatively simple calculation of a nontrivial lower bound for the state vector of systems with fault-prone measurements. The CRLB-type lower bound for the interruption process variables turns out to be trivially zero, however, a nontrivial, non-CRLB-type bound for these variables has been recently presented elsewhere by the authors. The utility and applicability of the proposed lower bound are demonstrated via a numerical example involving a simple global positioning system (GPS)-aided navigation system, where the GPS measurements are fault-prone due to their sensitivity to multipath errors.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;gaussian blur;global positioning system;hybrid system;interrupt;mean squared error;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;portable document format;system of measurement	Ilia Rapoport;Yaakov Oshman	2005	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2005.854579	control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory;statistics	EDA	58.694704979804875	4.487515240685503	121930

It is well-known that SWA presents a higher convergence rate than CMA, at the expense of higher computational complexity. If the forgetting factor is not sufficiently close to one, if the initialization is distant from the optimal solution, or if the signal-to-noise ratio is low, SWA can converge to undesirable local minima or even diverge. In this paper, we show that divergence can be caused by an inconsistency in the nonlinear estimate of the transmitted signal, or (when the algorithm is implemented in finite precision) by the loss of positiveness of the estimate of the autocorrelation matrix, or by a combination of both. In order to avoid the first cause of divergence, we propose a dual-mode SWA. In the first mode of operation, the new algorithm works as SWA; in the second mode, it rejects inconsistent estimates of the transmitted signal. Assuming the persistence of excitation condition, we present a deterministic stability analysis of the new algorithm. To avoid the second cause of divergence, we propose a dual-mode lattice SWA, which is stable even in finite-precision arithmetic, and has a computational complexity that increases linearly with the number of adjustable equalizer coefficients. The good performance of the proposed algorithms is confirmed through numerical simulations.	algorithm;autocorrelation matrix;blind equalization;block cipher mode of operation;cma-es;coefficient;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;converge;equalization (communications);maxima and minima;modulus robot;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;persistence (computer science);rate of convergence;soap with attachments;signal-to-noise ratio	Maria D.

In first case, we study both zero-input limit cycles and forced response while the latter deals only with zero input quantization limit cycles. The results show that the filter in both cases is stable when the poles are located within a circle centered at z = 0.39, touching z = 1, provided that magnitude truncation and saturation or triangular overflow characteristics are used.	adder (electronics);all-pass filter;limit cycle;lossless compression;quantization (signal processing);truncation	Johnny Holmberg;Lennart Harnefors;Svante Signell	2000		10.1109/ISCAS.2000.857106	control engineering;computer vision;throughput;electronic engineering;von neumann stability analysis;digital filter;quantization;computer science;control theory;mathematics;band-pass filter;limit cycle;signal-to-noise ratio;second-order logic	HCI	60.10975754513021	17.340417627302873	122422
5674124cd5616b603b3ff91a9ca635fbb1561f9f	a class of event-triggered coordination algorithms for multi-agent systems on weight-balanced digraphs		This paper revisits the multi-agent average consensus problem on weight-balanced directed graphs. In order to reduce communication among the agents, many recent works have considered event-triggered communication and control as a method to reduce communication while still ensuring that the entire network converges to the desired state. One common way to do this is to design events such that a specifically chosen Lyapunov function is monotonically decreasing; however, depending on the chosen Lyapunov function the transient behaviors can be very different. Consequently, we are instead interested in considering a class of Lyapunov functions such that each Lyapunov function produces a different event-triggered coordination algorithm to solve the multi-agent average consensus problem. The proposed class of algorithms all guarantee exponential convergence of the resulting network and exclusion of Zeno behavior. This allows us to easily consider the implementation of different algorithms that all guarantee correctness to be able to meet varying performance needs.

The mechanism exploits the special structure of the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) equalizers and their relation with CMA equalizers. A heuristic rule for blind determination of the best equalization delay is also provided. Using these guidelines, the equalizer is capable of finding the optimal setting in an online and computationally efficient fashion. In particular, estimation and inversion of the channel output autocorrelation matrix is not needed, in contrast with previous approaches.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;autocorrelation matrix;cma-es;equalization (communications);heuristic;mean squared error;modulus of continuity	Roberto López-Valcarce;Fernando Pérez-González	2001	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/4234.974495	minimum mean square error;mathematical optimization;digital filter;index term;telecommunications;adaptive equalizer;computer science;blind equalization;control theory;mathematics;mean squared error;statistics	Vision	60.263663042491316	14.235096649573777	122670

Such properties include conditions on the stepsize in the adaptive algorithm and analytic expressions for the misadjustment and convergence rate. Our results indicate that the limits on the stepsize are stricter than the ones obtained by considering convergence of the mean of the reflection coefficients and, therefore, only a slower convergence of the mean-square error can be obtained. It is shown that faster convergence is achieved for highly uncorrelated sequences (low S/N ratio) than for almost deterministic sequences (high SIN ratio). The misadjustment is shown to be exponentially dependent on the number of stages in the lattice and is higher for uncorrelated sequences than for almost deterministic sequences.

SPS is introduced for linear regression models, including but not limited to FIR systems, and we show that the SPS confidence regions have exact confidence probabilities, i.e., they contain the true parameter with a user-chosen exact probability for any finite data set. Moreover, we also prove that the SPS regions are star convex with the Least-Squares (LS) estimate as a star center. The main assumptions of SPS are that the noise terms are independent and symmetrically distributed about zero, but they can be nonstationary, and their distributions need not be known. The paper also proposes a computationally efficient ellipsoidal outer approximation algorithm for SPS. Finally, SPS is demonstrated through a number of simulation experiments.	a* search algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;asymptote;experiment;finite impulse response;ibm 1401 symbolic programming system;least squares;simulation;system identification	Balázs Csanád Csáji;Marco C.

To improve the robustness of active sound profiling to uncertainties in the plant model, while avoiding increased control effort, a modified phase-scheduled-command filtered-x least-mean-square algorithm is proposed in this paper. The new algorithm provides improved stability, while requiring the minimum control effort. This improvement is achieved by replacing the plant model with an intelligent adaptive-hysteresis switching mechanism to allow the necessary estimation of the disturbance signal phase. The improved performance and robustness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a series of simulations using measured acoustic responses.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;hysteresis;noise shaping;simulation	Vinal Patel;Jordan Cheer;Nithin V.

Even though the flatness constraints are in general non-linear functions of the filter coefficients, we show the remarkable fact that for a subclass of the filters a simple orthogonal projection of least squared error filters onto a special linear subspace determined via Baher filters gives the solution. The paper also introduces the notion of delay filters that are high order approximations to the ideal delay and establishes their equivalence to Baher filters. This connection gives novel elementary derivations of Baher filters and their properties. Matlab programs are provided at the end of the paper for the design of filters described in this paper.	approximation;coefficient;finite impulse response;group delay and phase delay;linear function;low-pass filter;matlab;nonlinear system;r language;spline (mathematics);turing completeness	Ramesh A.

In this problem, a set of input signals is passed through a MIMO channel modeled as a known linear time-invariant system. The inputs are modeled as multiband signals whose spectral supports are sets of finite measure and the channel outputs are sampled on nonuniform sampling sets. The aim is to reconstruct the inputs from the output samples. This sampling scheme is quite general and it encompasses various others including Papoulis' generalized sampling and nonuniform sampling as special cases. We introduce notions of joint upper and lower densities for collections of sampling sets and then derive necessary conditions on these densities for stable sampling and consistent reconstruction of the channel inputs from the sampled outputs. These results generalize classical density results for stable sampling and interpolation due to Landau.	athanasios papoulis;interpolation;linear time-invariant theory;mimo;nonuniform sampling;sampling (signal processing);time complexity;time-invariant system	Raman Venkataramani;Yoram Bresler	2004	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2004.831755	signal reconstruction;coherent sampling;mathematical optimization;nonuniform sampling;interpolation;slice sampling;signal processing;control theory;mathematics;linear system;statistics	Theory	55.53151389812336	16.085194846318174	123443

Such processes arise as the sound perceived by an observer due to moving acoustic sources. The sources are assumed to be a collection of monopoles which are considered to emit random signals which are stationary in the frames of reference of the sources. The random processes involved are assumed to admit a state space shaping filter formulation and the concept of covariance equivalence is used to describe the temporal behaviour of the perceived signals as white noise excited time varying linear filters. This allows the evolutionary (auto and cross) spectral densities to be computed. The stationarisation of this class of non-stationary signals is achieved by using an optimum control based deconvolution procedure.	acoustic cryptanalysis;deconvolution	Joe K. Hammond;R. F.

To assess the feasibility of the optimized digital filter order calculation, a series of experiments on generation and filtration of noisy periodic signals with different signal shapes and various signal-to-noise ratios has been conducted. For all of the noisy signals, optimal (relative to the original noise-free signals) and optimized (relative to approximated signals) LPF orders based on a minimum median absolute error (MAE) have been calculated. After calculation of MAE between filtered and original signals, it was observed that the optimal and optimized filters allow to get comparable noisy signal filtration quality. The article ends with conclusions about the possibility of using the optimized calculation of the digital filter order for close-to-optimal filtration (with the lowest MAE relative to the original noise-free signal) of noisy periodic digital signals.	approximation;digital filter	Alexey Sergeev-Horchynskyi;Valeriy Rogoza	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-08422-0_38	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	57.05477183112384	16.735495935915683	123583

A design method, based on the dispersion function, is introduced, in order to find an optimal set of elementary designs. For the considered class of Wiener systems, it is shown that these elementary designs are couples of successive input values. However, concatenation of these elementary designs is not straight forward. By imposing symmetry conditions on the total design, a solution is obtained that can be realized as a time sequence and that is optimal in the subspace of symmetric designs.	concatenation;cubic function;finite impulse response;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;polynomial;time series	Alexander De Cock;Michel Gevers;Johan Schoukens	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760663	control engineering;electronic engineering;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics	EDA	57.85876185147321	16.39019131321276	123860

Taking advantage of relative information from individual agents and their neighbors, a distributed adaptive fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed recursively by the approximation property of neural networks (NNs), backstepping methods, dynamic surface control (DSC) methodology and algebraic graph theory. The distinct features of this control approach are that it is not of requirement of prior information of individual agents with the help of approximation property, and the online update parameters are the norms of NNs weight vectors instead of weight vectors themselves. Also, it reduces the computational burden considerably by introducing the DSC approach. The stability of the resulting closed-loop system is rigorously investigated and it is proven that the consensus tracking errors of the MASs under directed communication topology converge to a small adjustable neighborhood around the origin in spite of actuator failures. Two simulation examples, both practical and numerical ones, are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	fault tolerance;multi-agent system;nonlinear system	Yang Yang;Dong Yue	2017	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2016.09.061	computer science;machine learning;multi-agent system;control theory;distributed computing;artificial neural network	AI	63.65161779043273	4.1930039679241435	124003

In the second method, not only the phase correction but also an improved system magnitude estimate of better nce and frequency resolution is derived based on modified magnitude group delay. The results indicate a significant vement in performance for both the methods. For the first method in the absence of noise, the percentage alized mean square error is reduced by about 85% over that of the existing non-parametric method.

Normally, the weight would be chosen to incorporate apriori knowledge of the bandwidth and shape of the spectrum of the signal to be estimated. The iterative procedure developed in this paper uses a periodogram spectrum estimate obtained from some samples of the signal estimatelextrapolation found at one iteration to define the weight that is used to estimate at the next iteration. This algorithm usually converges in less than 10 iterations to an extrapolation which is characterized as a nonparametric frequency-stationary extension of the data. The technique presented here is similar but more versatile than the Papoulis-Chamzas adaptive extrapolation procedure since it is not restricted to narrow-band signals. The frequency resolution and extrapolation length are controlled by the length of a time-domain window used to obtain smooth spectral estimates between iterations. Examples are provided to illustrate the use of the algorithm for interpolation/ extrapolation. These examples give comparable results to nonadaptive extrapolation methods without the need for apriori knowledge. For the spectral estimation example of Kay and Marple, it provides comparable resolution to the parametric methods with more accurate values of the relative strengths of the narrow-band components.	apriori algorithm;athanasios papoulis;extrapolation;interpolation;iteration;spectral density estimation;stationary process	Sergio D.

The ideal four-periodic correction filters, which cancel distortions, are computed as a function of the error filters that model the analog transfer function of each channel, including the sampling time. These correction filters are then approximated as a linear combination of base filters and new accurate models with a limited number of free parameters are proposed. Calibration is performed using the recursive least squares algorithm to estimate the coefficients of the linear combination (and the offset term). The resulting algorithms are tested for accuracy, convergence speed, and stability in a fixed-point implementation, and are compared with previously published linear background calibration techniques. The proposed filter bank significantly improves the accuracy/complexity tradeoff with respect to previously published techniques.	adaptive filter;analog-to-digital converter;approximation algorithm;athanasios papoulis;chroma subsampling;coefficient;computation;computational complexity theory;digital filter;distortion;filter bank;finite impulse response;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point arithmetic;linear model;mathematical optimization;recursion;recursive least squares filter;sampling (signal processing);ti-basic;ti-nspire series;transfer function	Pietro Monsurr&#x00F2;;Felice Rosato;Alessandro Trifiletti	2018	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2017.2662084	adaptive filter;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;linear filter;control theory;prototype filter	Vision	60.35763335702952	15.903300596856418	126079
a845a5dfd4a9cb25b706463578038842e0537ce7	a solution to estimation fusion for multirate measurements with delays		This paper presents the distributed estimation fusion algorithms for a class of multirate multisensor systems with measurement delays. Different sensors uniformly sample measurements with different sampling rates and time delays. First, a new state-space model at the measurement sampling points is constructed and the original time delayed system is transformed to a delay-free one with correlated noises in limited time intervals to obtain the real-time estimation. Based on the new state-space model, the optimal local filter at the measurement sampling points is obtained for each single-sensor subsystem, and then the local estimator at the state update points is derived by using the predictor based on the filter at the measurement sampling points. Then, the estimation error cross-covariance matrices between any two local estimators are derived. Finally, the real-time distributed fusion estimator at the state update points is obtained based on the optimal fusion criterion weighed by matrices in the linear unbiased minimum variance sense. Besides, to avoid the correlation between system and measurement noises in the developed state-space model, a simple alternative but nonreal-time estimation fusion algorithm is also presented by employing dummy measurements. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;cross-correlation;cross-covariance;distributed algorithm;dummy variable (statistics);kalman filter;kerrison predictor;numerical analysis;real-time clock;real-time computing;sampling (signal processing);sensor;state space	Honglei Lin;Shuli Sun	2017	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2017.2724398	control theory;mathematics;estimator;fusion;minimum-variance unbiased estimator;sampling (statistics);noise measurement;matrix (mathematics);sensor fusion	Metrics	57.162654576294635	4.264017733326094	126164

b65834ad2608b96a2e403c3961fd24adcee83a91	a new approach to distributed fusion filtering for networked systems with random parameter matrices and correlated noises		Abstract This paper is concerned with the distributed filtering problem for a class of discrete-time stochastic systems over a sensor network with a given topology. The system presents the following main features: (i) random parameter matrices in both the state and observation equations are considered; and (ii) the process and measurement noises are one-step autocorrelated and two-step cross-correlated. The state estimation is performed in two stages. At the first stage, through an innovation approach, intermediate distributed least-squares linear filtering estimators are obtained at each sensor node by processing available output measurements not only from the sensor itself but also from its neighboring sensors according to the network topology. At the second stage, noting that at each sampling time not only the measurement but also an intermediate estimator is available at each sensor, attention is focused on the design of distributed filtering estimators as the least-squares matrix-weighted linear combination of the intermediate estimators within its neighborhood. The accuracy of both intermediate and distributed estimators, which is measured by the error covariance matrices, is examined by a numerical simulation example where a four-sensor network is considered.

Its convergence analysis is not as extensively studied as Normalized LMS (NLMS), and remains an active area of research. For tractability, most works on APA make many assumptions on the statistics of the input, as well as correlation between signals. Here we consider the effect of the correlation between filter coefficients and past measurement noise on MSE error. The effect of this correlation was found to be dependent on step-size mu, increasing or decreasing the predicted MSE depending on whether mu is less than or greater than 1, irrespective of the input statistics. Simulations are used to verify the analysis results presented.	algorithm;coefficient;computer simulation;least mean squares filter	Thomas K.

We first consider the case of ideal communication between agents and present an adaptive distributed control algorithm such that a group of Euler-Lagrange systems asymptotically synchronize their states to those of a dynamic leader with a time-varying trajectory. Then, we propose a modified design that achieves the same control objective under the assumption of intermittent discrete-time communication in the presence of varying communication delays and possible packet dropout. It is shown that leader-follower synchronization is achieved under sufficient conditions that can be realized uniformly of the interconnection topology between agents for a given characteristics of the communication process. Simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.	algorithm;control theory;distributed control system;dropout (neural networks);euler;euler–lagrange equation;interconnection;network packet;simulation	Abdelkader Abdessameud;Abdelhamid Tayebi;Ilia G.

0aaa793e8237f78c6dcb157a0d6d340cae8165a8	distributed kalman–bucy filter with embedded dynamic averaging algorithm		This paper focuses on distributed estimation using networked sensor agents with local measurements and local communication. A distributed Kalman–Bucy filter implementation is proposed and analyzed for the general case of continuous-time linear time-varying systems as compared to linear time-invariant systems. The sensor agents employ a distributed average tracking algorithm and its extension that accounts for bounded noise to estimate the averages of certain time-varying signals by communicating with their local neighbors in the network. Such estimates are then used to recover certain information in the implementation of the distributed Kalman–Bucy filter. It is shown that using the proposed distributed filter, in the absence of measurement noise, the distributed local estimates approach the centralized filter's estimate asymptotically. In the presence of bounded measurement noise, the distributed local estimates asymptotically approach the centralized filter's estimate within some bound. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the distributed filter.	algorithm;centralized computing;linear time-invariant theory;simulation;time complexity;time-invariant system	Wei Ren;Ubaid M.

The BSS of instantaneous linear mixtures, which finds application in numerous fields, can be solved through the statistical tool of independent component analysis (ICA). This paper concentrates on the analytic solutions for the fundamental two-signal ICA scenario. A novel estimation class, so-called general weighted fourth-order estimator (GWFOE), is put forward, which is based on the fourth-order statistics of the whitened sensor output. By means of a weight parameter, the GWFOE is able to unify a variety of apparently disparate estimation expressions previously scattered throughout the literature, including the well-known JADE method in the two-signal case. A theoretical asymptotic performance analysis is carried out, resulting in the GWFOE large-sample mean square error and the source-dependent weight value of the most efficient estimator in the class. To extend the pairwise estimators to the general scenario of more than two sources, an improved Jacobi-like optimization technique is proposed. The approach consists of calculating the necessary sensor-output fourth-order statistics at the initialization stage of the algorithm, which can lead to significant computational savings when large sample blocks are processed. Based on this idea, adaptive algorithms are also devised, showing very satisfactory convergence characteristics. Experiments illustrate the good performance of these optimal pairwise ICA strategies, in both off- and on-line processing modes	adaptive algorithm;blind signal separation;computation;experiment;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;jade;jacobi method;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;online and offline;source separation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Vicente Zarzoso;Juan José Murillo-Fuentes;Rafael Boloix-Tortosa;Asoke K.

For the latter, the high-order ambiguity function (HAF) is adopted. Schemes for estimating the hyperbolic FM parameter are also proposed. The method improves on existing approaches and is shown to provide performance close to the Craḿer–Rao bound.	algorithm;ambiguity function;chirp;estimation theory;fm broadcasting;modulation	Olivier Besson;Georgios B.

The new design technique is very fast since it reduces the design of a large set of filters to the design of a complex or real one-dimensional filter which is then mapped to produce the desired set of filters. It has the additional advantage that the oneand multi-dimensional filters in the set can be designed and realized efficiently without having to explicitly compute the coefficients of the separate filters. Among the types of filters which can be designed with this technique are seismic migration filters and linear-phase filters. 1. MOTIVATION Certain applications require the design and realization of a large set of filters whose frequency response can be formulated in terms of a number of parameters. Such applications include seismic migration, filter banks, and adaptive filtering. One example is the set of seismic migration filters which depend on the wave velocity and frequency parameters. These parameters control both the cutoff frequency and the phase characteristic of the migration filters. In addition, the depth extrapolation process requires the design of a large set of depth extrapolation filters, one filter for each possible frequency-velocity pair [l]. In the previous methods [l], the coefficients of all the needed 1-D migration filters were precomputed and tabulated. Instead of independently designing the needed filters, this paper presents an efficient procedure which designs in parallel a desired set of oneand multi-dimensional filters by parameterizing and representing the desired set as a single multi-dimensional filter. The new design procedure has the additional advantage that both the designed oneand multi-dimensional filters can be realized efficiently and need not have their coefficients precomputed and tabulated. A new two-in-one Chebyshev structure is introduced for the efficient realization of the individual multi-dimensional filters. Another example is the set of linear-phase filters which differ in terms of their cutoff frequency.

Furthermore we test the robustness of our results in the presence of independent time varying perturbations both deterministic and stochastic.	converge;distributed algorithm;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point theorem;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;software propagation	Christoforos Somarakis;John S.

In this paper we propose a new approach in autofocus systems design that uses some linear control theory results that allow to obtain the optimal feedback gain in the sense of quadratic sharpness hypothesis. The method proposed in this work allows to improve the existent autofocus systems that are based on the sharpness autofocus using the optimal feedback gain. It is shown that the method is sufficiently generic and can be integrated into an image signal processing unit of a modern camera.	automatic control;control system;control theory;image processing;signal processing;systems design	M.

A specification test procedure is also provided for NNIR lowpass filters based on these analyses. The results are presented for systems in the discrete-time (D-T) domain, although equivalent results exist for systems in the continuous-time domain.	addendum;chebyshev polynomials;filter design;infinite impulse response;low-pass filter;mathematical induction;polynomial;recurrence relation;rewrite (programming);selectivity (electronic)	Yuzhe Liu;Peter H.

Such a design makes possible very efficient protection against electromagnetic compromising emanation, which in turn substantially enhances the overall security of a protected communication. We propose a new adaptive FIR filter algorithm for local echo cancellation in such applications. The proposed algorithm differs from the conventional one by the construction of input signals in an optimal way using the D-optimal experiment design. In this way, at each step, we generate a new sample of the D-optimal pilot sequence for the filter parameter estimation. Consequently, the adaptation of the local echo canceler is defined as an initialization process in the first phase of each protected telephone call. The advantage in using the proposed adaptive FIR echo canceler is demonstrated through simulation results.	duplex (telecommunications);echo (computing);echo suppression and cancellation	Zoran Dj Banjac;Branko D.

3665d75e7b72fa6c142c2355695b736fcb1474c3	are genetic algorithms useful for the parameter estimation of fm signals?	high order ambiguity function;polynomial phase signals;genetic algorithms;parameter estimation;cubic phase function	The estimation of polynomial-phase signals (PPSs) is a multiparameter problem, and the maximum likelihood (ML) optimization functions have numerous local optima, making the application of gradient techniques impossible. The common solution to this problem is based on the phase differentiation (PD) techniques that reduce the number of dimensions but, at the same time, reduce the accuracy and generate additional difficulties such as spurious components and error propagation. Here we show that genetic algorithms (GAs) can serve as a powerful alternative to the PD techniques. We investigate the limits of accuracy of the ML technique, and of some alternatives such as the high-order cubic phase function (HO-CPF) and high-order Wigner distribution (HO-WD). The ML approach combined with the proposed GA setup is limited up to the fifth-order PPS, which is not sufficient in many applications. However, the HO-CPF and HO-WD techniques coupled with the GA are able to accurately estimate phase parameters up to the tenth-order PPS. They significantly improve the accuracy with respect to the high-order ambiguity function (HAF) and product HAF (PHAF) and, for higher-order PPSs, they are much simpler and more efficient than the integrated generalized ambiguity function (IGAF).	estimation theory;fm broadcasting;genetic algorithm	Igor Djurovic;Marko Simeunovic;Budimir Lutovac	2012	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2012.05.009	econometrics;mathematical optimization;genetic algorithm;computer science;mathematics;estimation theory;statistics	EDA	58.03395208456345	10.44403238618965	129452

Many SPT term allocation schemes have been developed for distributing the number of SPT terms to the coefficients. In this paper, an SPT term allocation scheme is developed for the design of lattice orthogonal filter banks. The SPT terms are allocated to coefficients one at a time to minimize the frequency response errors due to rounding the coefficients to SPT numbers. Examples show that the proposed allocation scheme is eminently suitable for the design of SPT coefficient lattice filter banks. It is superior to those reported in the literature.	algorithm;alphaserver;central processing unit;coefficient;digital filter;filter bank;filter design;fortran;frequency response;hall-effect thruster;jaccard index;lattice phase equaliser;low-pass filter;pentium 4;power of two;rounding;symmetry protected topological order	Ya Jun Yu;Yong Ching Lim	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1464963	minimisation;mathematical optimization;frequency response;electronic engineering;digital filter;lattice;filter bank;control theory;mathematics;rounding;statistics	Embedded	61.192174765396516	18.11963240808008	130031

This new modeling procedure has been found to possess exceptional modeling capabilities which makes possible the generation of lower order, high quality ARMA spectral estimates from short data lengths. This capability is a consequence of the data smoothing achieved upon making a singular value decomposition of an extended autocorrelation matrix estimate.	time series	James A.

Unlike the large body of existing work, here we consider systems which are physically coupled with uncertain norm-bounded coupling between the subsystems. We propose a model based event-triggered tracking control strategy and an event triggering rule with a time-dependent threshold which guarantees that the tracking errors in the systems asymptotically converge to zero. With the proposed event triggering rule, we prove that the systems do not exhibit Zeno behavior. In addition, the proposed event-triggered tracking control strategy is also employed to decoupled multi-agent systems. The efficacy of the proposed method is discussed using a simulation example.	algorithm;control theory;converge;graph (discrete mathematics);multi-agent system;simulation	Yi Cheng;Valery A.

The algorithms are simpler because in the edculations, the state vector is at one point replaced by a quantized version. This technique avoids to some extent numerical difficulties associated with illconditioning in least squ~res schemes and thus obviates the need for square root algorithms and the need for high order precision calculations. In recursive form, the schemes are designed to yield parameter estimates with negligible bias without the additional computational effort or instabihty risks associated with generalized and extended least squares, recursive maximum likelihood schemes, or the method of instrumental variables. Nonrecursive schemes are designed to minimize computational effort in a batch processing situation while at the same time giving some reduction of bias in the state dependent colored noise situation. The novel algorithms h~ve the limitation that they are suboptimal and there is thus a consequent reduction in the speed of convergence for some applications. The merits of the proposed schemes are assessed \ia simulation studies in this paper and an adaptive equalization application in a companion paper.	adaptive equalizer;algorithm;batch processing;colors of noise;computation;estimation theory;least squares;numerical analysis;rate of convergence;recursion;recursive language;simulation	Rajendra Kumar;John B.

Its main advantages are adaptability and relative simplicity. In order to gain theoretical insights into the performance of this algorithm, we examine its mean-square convergence and derive an expression for its steady-state mean-square deviation. Our methodology is inspired by the principle of energy conservation in adaptive filters.

However, the steady-state MSD analysis of the INSAF was not studied. Therefore, this paper proposes a general solution of steady-sate MSD analysis of the INSAF algorithm, which is based on the substitution of the past weight error vector in the weight error vector.

An event-based estimator in the form of the Kalman filter with intermittent observations is first introduced, based on which time-varying upper and lower bounds on the expectation of the communication rate are developed. For stable systems, time-invariant upper and lower bounds are given. For sensors whose measurement values are scalars, the exact expression for the expectation of the communication rate is obtained. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the results. It is shown that the developed results are rich enough to be generalized to recover existing results obtained for event-based minimum mean squared error estimates and estimates under more general event-triggering schemes.	dynamical system;kalman filter;mean squared error;numerical method;sensor;time-invariant system	Dawei Shi;Tongwen Chen;Ling Shi	2014	2014 American Control Conference	10.1109/ACC.2014.6858610	control engineering;invariant extended kalman filter;fast kalman filter;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;statistics;alpha beta filter	Robotics	59.55103467599131	4.5584157427120795	130753

The KF is only optimal for linear modeling with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables and Gaussian noises. In some complicated problems, the system model is not unique and the measurement equation is nonlinear. The particle filter (PF) along with interacting multiple models (IMM) becomes an attractive solution. In this paper, a new particle resampling method is proposed for the PF to alleviate the degeneracy effect of particle propagation. The new IMMPF algorithm is developed for an angle-of-arrival (AOA) tracking problem with bearings-only measurements. Simulation results show that the IMMPF algorithm outperforms the IMM extended KF algorithm and achieves a root mean square tracking performance which is quite close to the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).	algorithm;angle of arrival;degeneracy (graph theory);gaussian process;interaction;kalman filter;mean squared error;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;particle filter;radar tracker;simulation;software propagation	Dah-Chung Chang;Meng-Wei Fan	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7037301	mathematical optimization;auxiliary particle filter;noise;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	54.45957332047974	4.8907884769923635	130870

Formation control is concerned with problems in which autonomous agents are required to stabilize at a given distance of other agents. In this context, a graph associated to a formation encodes both the information flow in the system and the distance constraints, by fixing the lengths of the edges. While globally stabilizing control laws for the case of n = 3 agents in a cyclic formation have been proposed, the case of n = 4 agents has so far resisted attempts to obtain globally stabilizing control laws. We show that a large class of control laws, including all control laws shown to work in the three agents case, cannot satisfactorily stabilize a four agents formation. The proof relies on applying ideas from singularity theory and dynamical systems theory which can be used to address global stabilization of a broad class of decentralized control systems.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;consensus dynamics;control flow;distributed control system;dynamical systems theory;graph (discrete mathematics);optimal control	Mohamed-Ali Belabbas	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6161450	control engineering;computer science;graph theory;control theory;feedback;mathematics;distributed computing	Robotics	63.32141504445569	5.134095149815559	130875

The proposed method assumes that the static nonlinear function of the Wiener system has a single minimum (or maximum), but does not assume any parametrization of the nonlinear function. Based on a modified principal component analysis (PCA), referred to as weighted PCA, the FIR coefficients of the Wiener system are estimated without estimating the nonlinear function of the Wiener system. The numerical computation cost is essentially equivalent to those of two standard PCA. Numerical examples in harsh practical conditions, with data generated by Wiener systems involving a discontinuous nonlinear function or an infinite impulse response, are presented to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.	nonlinear system;principal component analysis;system identification	Qinghua Zhang;Vincent Laurain	2013		10.3182/20130703-3-FR-4038.00061	mathematical optimization;classical wiener space;control theory;mathematics;wiener filter;integral representation theorem for classical wiener space;statistics;wiener deconvolution	Robotics	59.55007308841781	8.548496845636622	130988

In this paper, we introduce a regional multimodulus algorithm for blind equalization of QAM signals that performs similarly to the supervised normalized least-mean-squares (NLMS) algorithm, independently of the QAM order. We find a theoretical relation between the coefficient vector of the proposed algorithm and the Wiener solution and also provide theoretical models for the steady-state excess mean-square error in a nonstationary environment. The proposed algorithm in conjunction with strategies to speed up its convergence and to avoid divergence can bypass the switching mechanism between the blind mode and the decision-directed mode.	am broadcasting;adaptive equalizer;algorithm;apple a5;apple a7;blind equalization;coefficient;equalization (communications);imaginary time;interference (communication);least mean squares filter;mean squared error;modulation;modulus of continuity;nyquist rate;offset binary;revolution in military affairs;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;steady state;supervised learning;system identification	Joao Mendes Filho;Maria D.

Approaches using such a consistent measure of dependence as the Shannon's mutual information are considered. A constructive procedure of deriving a linear input/output model which is statistically equivalent to a multi input / multi output dynamic stochastic system driven by a white-noise Gaussian process is proposed. A key issue of such a procedure is using the condition of component-wise coincidence of the mutual information of the input and output processes of the system and the input and output processes of the model as an identification criterion. The approach enables one to derive explicit relationships determining elements of the weighting matrices of the linearized model. At that, using such an unreal preliminary assumption as a known joint probability distribution of the system and model output processes is eliminated.	gaussian process;information theory;input/output;mimo;mutual information;nonlinear system;shannon (unit);stochastic process;unreal;white noise	Kirill Chernyshov	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5281101	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;statistics	ML	58.090987465310924	7.4748639998553115	131180

We notice that each musical instrument has each autocorrelation function. Polyphony can be separated into each monophony using comb filters ( ). We can obtain the autocorrelation functions for the outputs of comb filters from the autocorrelation functions of the monophony. By the pattern patching between the autocorrelation functions for the output signals of the comb filters and ones calculated from monophony of each instrument, we can estimate the musical instruments for polyphony.

In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive filtering approach to reduce interchannel coherence which is based on a selective-tap updating procedure. This tap-selection technique is then applied to the normalized least-mean-square, affine projection and recursive least squares algorithms for stereophonic acoustic echo cancellation. Simulation results for the proposed algorithms have shown a significant improvement in convergence rate compared with existing techniques.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive algorithm;adaptive filter;autocorrelation matrix;cache coherence;centrality;echo suppression and cancellation;least mean squares filter;mathematical optimization;nl (complexity);nonlinear system;preprocessor;rate of convergence;recursion;recursive least squares filter;reduction (complexity);simulation	Andy W.

It is shown from the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) and the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation principles that with the additive observation phase noise (AOPN), due to the AWGN, being described by its a posteriori distribution conditioned on the received signal magnitude, the received signal phase is a sufficient statistic for estimating the single-sinusoid angle parameters. Using a geometric approach, the exact statistical model for the AOPN is derived, where the a posteriori probability density function (pdf) and the corresponding a priori pdf are given by explicit, closed-form expressions that are valid for arbitrary signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The a posteriori pdf is Tikhonov, and is of particular interest as it establishes the AOPN model for phase-based frequency/phase MAP/ML estimation in the time domain. It is further illustrated that the results derived can yield various AOPN models as special cases, and the underlying physical insights and interconnections that exist among these models are revealed. It is shown that the model derived by Tretter is an ultimate specialization in the high SNR limit of the AOPN models developed here. For high SNR, the a posteriori Tikhonov pdf can be accurately approximated by a Gaussian distribution, which leads to the best linearized AOPN model. The applications of these AOPN models to the design of linear estimators, including the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator, the linear minimum variance estimator, and the LMMSE implementation of the weighted phase averager are presented, and their estimation performances are compared through computer simulations, with the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the Bayesian CRLB as the benchmark. To facilitate estimator design, the a priori statistical models of the frequency and phase are proposed from the information-theoretic perspective, and an improved phase unwrapping algorithm over that given by Fu and Kam is presented. It is shown that by incorporating all the information available in the AOPN, the estimation accuracy can be much improved.	additive model;additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);computer simulation;execution unit;fast fourier transform;information theory;instantaneous phase;mean squared error;partial template specialization;performance;phase noise;portable document format;principle of maximum entropy;rife;signal-to-noise ratio;statistical model;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hua Fu;Pooi Yuen Kam	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2238604	normal distribution;fourier transform;additive white gaussian noise;econometrics;mathematical optimization;time–frequency analysis;mathematics;maximum likelihood;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;estimation theory;phase noise;statistics	Vision	54.476122252753875	10.829547442707147	131693

This problem applies in general to any setup involving vectors of signal and interference samples, including wideband temporal processing, di/use spatial (array) processing, or any combination thereof. The algorithms attempt to solve a generalized eigenvalue (GEV) problem using only snapshots of signal and interference training vectors, and the goal is to do this with a minimum amount of data and computational resources. The algorithms considered fall into two classes: two-step approaches that 5rst estimate the covariance matrices and then solve the GEV problem; and, stochastic gradient type algorithms that recursively update the solution in one step for each new set of data vector snapshots. The algorithms are compared on the basis of convergence rate and computational complexity. ? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This approach not only links closed-loop subspace identification with optimal control; but also directly evaluates parametric uncertainties on the identified Markov parameters. Neither a state-space model nor its stochastic uncertainty has to be realized in this approach. The effects of the parametric uncertainties on the output predictor are analyzed explicitly. Analytic solution to the probabilistic design is derived in a closed form, which avoids computing the empirical mean of a cost function as required by randomized algorithms. The solution hence leads to an easily implementable cautious optimal design, robust to the uncertainties in the identified Markov parameters from a closed-loop plant.	closed-loop transfer function;input/output;kerrison predictor;loss function;markov chain;mathematical model;optimal control;optimal design;randomized algorithm;recursion;simulation;state space	Jianfei Dong;Michel Verhaegen	2008	2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2008.4738690	control engineering;stochastic process;covariance matrix;closed-form expression;mathematical optimization;uncertainty;optimal control;noise measurement;noise;optimal design;state-space representation;control theory;mathematics;probabilistic logic;markov process;markov model;randomized algorithm;computational model;statistics	ML	57.37505692623805	6.4456208794558645	132601

This iterative algorithm is based on a system model where an overall noise term describes both, the measurement noise and the noise resulting from the model uncertainties. This overall noise term is a function of the true parameter vector. The proposed iterative algorithm can be applied on structured as well as unstruc-tured models and it outperforms prior art algorithms for a broad range of applications.	approximation;convolution;estimation theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;iterative method;simulation	Oliver Lang;Michael Lunglmayr;Mario Huemer	2016	CoRR		econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	Vision	56.18693668425093	9.026497804921474	133013

This paper presents a statistical analysis of fixed-point roundoff error that identifies the conditions under which this model is valid, and examines the statistical behavior of roundoff error when these conditions are not satisfied. The results show that if the multiplier coefficient is expressed as a = N/M, where M is a positive integral power of two and N is an odd integer, then the errors generated by roundoff after multiplication can generally be modeled as uniformly distributed, white, and uncorrelated with the signal, if the signal has sufficiently wide bandwidth and has a dynamic range that extends over approximately M quantum steps. For narrow-band low-level signals, the roundoff error statistics can differ significantly from the uniform, white, uncorrelated model. In addition, these results show that statistical behavior of roundoff error can differ significantly from that of the quantization error that is generated when a continuous random variable is quantized.	fixed-point arithmetic;round-off error	Casper W.

The proposed method is based on a lower order complex-time distribution (CTD), derived by using the idea of complex-time differentiation of the instantaneous phase. Unlike other existing TFDs in the same framework, the proposed TFD is an order-free distribution which alleviates the subtractive cancellation error in IF estimation. The approach is applied to highly nonstationary monocomponent signals. Performance of the numerical implementation is compared with three existing IF estimation methods using three simulated signals. Noise analysis is also performed to evaluate the robustness of the method in presenfdece of additive noise at signal to noise ratio (SNR) varying from −10 dB to 20 dB. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the other methods at lower SNR and works reasonably well for the noiseless case. & 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In order to allow the estimation of the model on a single realisation of the random signal, it is assumed that the coefficients are weighted sums of known functions, for instance polynomials, cosines. Two ARMA models will be discussed in this paper. The first one is a white noise driven ARMA model, which is rather usual. The second one has been designed for deterministic or speech-like signals and consists of a linear system driven by intermittent inputs with additive output (white) noise. The time-frequency representation of the signal is then obtained from the state-space realisation of the time-dependent model. After a description of the algorithms involved in both estimators, the paper focuses on a comparison of the two ARMA models on modulated sinusoids corrupted by white noise. This shows that these models behave equally well for high SNR (signal-to-noise ratio), but the deterministic model gives better results when the SNR decreases.	frequency analysis;time–frequency analysis	Yves Grenier	1984		10.1109/ICASSP.1984.1172742	econometrics;speech recognition;mathematics;linear system;statistics	NLP	55.75672012088277	14.716141173113071	133513

While many methods have been proposed to blindly identify convolutive MIMO systems with No ges Ni (overdetermined), very scarce results exist for the case of (underdetermined), all of which refer to systems that either have some special structure or special and values. In this paper, we show that, as long as , independent of whether the system is overdetermined or underdetermined, we can always find the appropriate order of statistics that guarantees identifiability of the system response within trivial ambiguities. We also propose an algorithm to reach the solution, that consists of parallel factorization (PARAFAC) of a -way tensor containing th-order statistics of the system outputs, followed by an iterative scheme. For a certain order of statistics , we provide the description of the class of identifiable MIMO systems. We also show that this class can be expanded by applying PARAFAC decomposition to a pair of tensors instead of one tensor. The proposed approach constitutes a novel scheme for estimation of underdetermined systems, and improves over existing approaches for overdetermined systems.	algorithm;iterative method;mimo	Yuanning Yu;Athina P.

9877e211f60b239f3d4e3e1f02a62cfbf4bdc8db	compensation for nonlinear distortion of the frequency modulation-based parametric array loudspeaker		The parametric array loudspeaker PAL modulates the audio signal on an ultrasonic carrier. When the modulated signal is transmitted in air, an audio beam is created based on the nonlinear acoustic principle. Each modulation method has advantages and disadvantages. The frequency modulation FM is favorable for its low cost and high volume, but the tradeoff is its complicated nonlinear distortion, which is difficult to be reduced. In this paper, the Volterra filter is adopted to model the nonlinearity of the FM-based PAL. A novel complex inverse system is devised to effectively reduce the nonlinear distortion. Three practical aspects are addressed. First, the computational complexity of the Volterra filter is reduced by the parallel cascade structure with almost no compromise to the model accuracy. Second, Volterra filters are identified at discrete input levels to treat the nonlinearity that keeps changing with the time-varying audio input. Third, when the input level is high, a separation approach is proposed to refine the identified Volterra filters, which eventually improves the performance of the proposed inverse system.	acoustic cryptanalysis;computational complexity theory;distortion;fm broadcasting;lotka–volterra equations;loudspeaker;modulation;nonlinear system;pal;parametric array;rate–distortion theory	Yuta Hatano;Chuang Shi;Yoshinobu Kajikawa	2017	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing	10.1109/TASLP.2017.2705280	nonlinear distortion;acoustics	ML	62.247670478697884	14.46248746789755	133811

Firstly, the continuous signal can be represented as a function of the trigonometric functional extension (Fourier series). Fourier series of the signal are parameterized by the fundamental frequency and unknown parameters. Then, the gradient-based iterative identification algorithm is derived, for estimating parameters of the signal model with known and unknown frequencies, separately.

The proposed method exploits a state-space structure describing the system so that a bank of particle filters can be used to efficiently track each of the time series separately. Since each gene interacts with some of the other genes, the individual filters need to exchange information about the states (genes) that they track. The analytical derivation of the posterior distribution of the states given the observed data allows for marginalization of the matrix describing the interactions in the network and for efficient implementation of the method. Computer simulations reveal a promising performance of the proposed approach when compared to the conventional particle filter that attempts to track the time series of all the genes and which, as a result, suffers from the curse-of-dimensionality.	coefficient;computer simulation;curse of dimensionality;interaction;particle filter;state space;the matrix;time series	Mónica F.

13c834263d7b2dd5792b9bdaf9712ca65bba9861	distributed kalman/h∞ filtering for sensor networks with partial unknown system parameters		This paper studies the distributed filtering problem for sensor networks in which each sensor’s measurement matrix is not observable and target’s system matrix is not completely and precisely known. A distributed Kalman/$\mathrm{H}_{\infty}$ filtering algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is composed of two parts. The first part is a consensus Kalman filter to estimate the parameters of the target’s system matrix. It is proved that the mean square estimation errors of the system parameters converge to zero, if and only if for any one system parameter, its accessible node subset where each node knows this parameter with noise is globally reachable. The second part is a consensus Kalman/$\mathrm{H}_{\infty}$ filtering algorithm based on the system parameter estimations to estimate the target’s state. In the state estimation, the consensus weights are fully distributed and adaptively designed based on the estimation errors of the sensors. Under the algorithm, as long as there further exists a globally reachable node which is collaboratively observable using its neighbors’ available measurements, the mean square estimation errors of all sensors must be bounded.	algorithm;consensus (computer science);converge;kalman filter;mean squared error;network topology;observable;sensor;time-invariant system;time-varying network	Ya Zhang;Donghua Chen;Cheng-Lin Liu;Yangyang Chen	2018	2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2018.8444239		Robotics	62.4094481408347	5.886150658527127	135348

If the observations themselves are used, it is possible to identify automatically a good time-series model for stochastic data. The selected model is an adequate representation of the statistically significant spectral details in the observed process. Sometimes, identification has to be based on many less than N characteristics of the data. The reduced statistics information is assumed to consist of a long autoregressive (AR) model. That AR model has to be used for the estimation of moving average (MA) and of combined ARMA models and for the selection of the best model orders. The accuracy of ARMA models is improved by using four different types of initial estimates in a first stage. After a second stage, it is possible to select automatically which initial estimates were most favorable in the present case by using the fit of the estimated ARMA models to the given long AR model. The same principle is used to select the best type of the time-series models and the best model order. No spectral information is lost in using only the long AR representation instead of all data. The quality of the model identified from a long AR model is comparable to that of the best time-series model that can be computed if all observations are available.	algorithm;automatic identification and data capture;autoregressive model;order by;simulation;stationary process;time series	Piet M.

It is shown that the output consensus problem can be solved by the proposed event triggered control algorithms if a necessary and sufficient condition is satisfied. Then a self triggered control scheme is also developed, where continuous monitoring of measurement errors can be avoided. The feasibility of both proposed control schemes is discussed by excluding Zeno behavior. It is also shown that agents are able to achieve output consensus with significant reduction of the number of triggering events, controller updates and communication transmission. As a result, energy can be saved and the lifespan of the agents can be prolonged. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.

This paper handles these issues for the frequency-domain Gaussian maximum-likelihood estimator of rational transfer-function models within an errors-invariables framework.	genetic algorithm;input/output;parametric model;transfer function	Rik Pintelon;Mei Hong	2007	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2007.908606	econometrics;mathematical optimization;information science;mathematics;transfer function;frequency domain;statistics	Visualization	57.552414562228236	7.963463042257053	136293

Our motivation for this result stems from the fact that the reduced-rank estimation by the stochastic MV-PURE estimator, while avoiding the problem of regularization parameter selection appearing in a common regularization technique used in inverse problems and machine learning, presents computational challenge due to nonconvexity induced by the rank constraint. To combat this problem, we propose a recursive scheme for computation of the general form of the stochastic MV-PURE estimator which does not require any matrix inversion and utilize the inherently parallel hybrid steepest descent method. We verify efficiency of the proposed scheme in numerical simulations.	computation;computer simulation;condition number;flops;gradient descent;iteration;machine learning;matrix regularization;numerical analysis;parallel computing;recursion;stationary process;stochastic process	Tomasz Piotrowski;Isao Yamada	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-29350-4_49	minimax estimator;parallel processing;mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;statistics	ML	64.75341294602164	14.219570146472416	136332

The existing design approaches for nearfield wideband beamformers are highly sensitive to errors in microphone array characteristics, i.e., microphone gain, phase, and position errors, as well as sound speed errors. In this paper, a robust design approach for nearfield wideband beamformers for microphone arrays is proposed. The robust nearfield wideband beamformers are designed based on the minimax criterion with the worst case performance optimization. The design problems can be formulated as second-order cone programming and be solved efficiently using the well-established polynomial time interior-point methods. Several interesting properties of the robust nearfield wideband beamformers are derived. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed beamformers in the presence of errors in microphone array characteristics.	beamforming;best, worst and average case;computer;cone (formal languages);conic optimization;input device;interior point method;mathematical optimization;microphone;minimax;optimal design;p (complexity);second-order cone programming;time complexity;ultra-wideband;whole earth 'lectronic link	Huawei Chen;Wee Ser;Zhu Liang Yu	2007	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2007.904667	time complexity;electronic engineering;speech recognition;acoustics;second-order cone programming;computer science;engineering;optimal design;interior point method;mathematics;input device;robustness	EDA	63.77207868626721	15.138356913444191	136369

An extended sampling theorem is given which states that signals can be sampled non-uniformly and then perfectly reconstructed if spectrum obtained by an extended Fourier transform (EFT) is bandlimited. Since, according to the theorem, the sampling instants are determined by the function used in EFT, the aim is to find such function which reflects the time-varying spectral content of the signal. This, in comparison to uniform sampling, allows reducing the number of samples required to represent the signal. The results have been demonstrated by numerical simulations on two signals.	bandlimiting;computer simulation;digital signal processing;electronic funds transfer;numerical analysis;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;sampling (signal processing)	Rolands Shavelis;Modris Greitans	2012	2012 Proceedings of the 20th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)		multidimensional signal processing;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;coherent sampling;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;oversampling;discrete-time signal;analog signal;digital signal processing;mathematics;spectral density estimation;spectral density;frequency domain;bandwidth;statistics	EDA	55.722686498226466	17.45621768266905	136429

Traditional solutions to such problems rely on primal/dual decomposition and gradient methods, whose convergence is sensitive to the choice of the stepsize and may not be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of large-scale real-time applications. We propose a new iterative approach to distributed resource allocation in coupled systems. Without complicating message-passing, the new approach is robust to parameter choices and expedites convergence by exploiting problem structures. We theoretically analyze the asynchronous algorithm convergence conditions, and empirically evaluate its benefits in a case of cloud network resource reservation based on real-world data.	distributed algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;gradient;iteration;lagrangian relaxation;message passing;real-time clock	Di Niu;Baochun Li	2013	2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6566945	distributed algorithm;mathematical optimization;resource allocation;computer science;theoretical computer science;distributed computing	Metrics	63.85522328746467	9.576451449627347	136643

This framework exploits all those relationships that intrinsically characterize a limited set of realizations, obtained by an ensemble of output signals and their parameterized inputs, by means of the separation property of the Karhunen-Loeve transform. The generality and the flexibility of the approximating mappings (ranging from traditional approximation techniques to multiresolution decompositions and neural networks) allow the design of a large number of distinct identifiers each displaying a number of properties such as linearity with respect to the parameters, noise rejection, low computational complexity of the approximation procedure. Exhaustive experimentation on specific case studies reports high identification performance for four distinct identifiers based on polynomials, splines, wavelets and radial basis functions. Several comparisons show how these identifiers almost always have higher performance than that obtained by current best practices, as well as very good accuracy, optimal noise rejection, and fast algorithmic elaboration. As an example of a real application, the identification of a voice communication channel, comprising a digital enhanced cordless telecommunications (DECT) cordless phone for wireless communications and a telephone line, is reported and discussed.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;best practice;channel (communications);computational complexity theory;digital enhanced cordless telecommunications;estimation theory;experiment;hilbert space;identifier;image noise;multiresolution analysis;noise reduction;nonlinear system identification;polynomial;radial (radio);radial basis function;rejection sampling;spline (mathematics);telephone line;wavelet	Claudio Turchetti;Giorgio Biagetti;Francesco Gianfelici;Paolo Crippa	2009	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2008.2008964	speech recognition;telecommunications;nonlinear system;computer science;mathematics;accuracy and precision;statistics;best practice	Visualization	57.366866540335586	15.51786740962033	136751

STRONG (Stochastic Trust Region Response Surface Convergent Method) is a newly developed design-of-experiments based simulation optimization method. It incorporates the idea of trust region method (TRM) for deterministic optimization into the traditional response surface methodology (RSM) to eliminate the human intervention required by RSM and to achieve the desired convergence. In the earlier paper, we proved the convergence of STRONG and demonstrated its computational efficiency. The original STRONG assumes the stochastic response follows a normal distribution. This paper relaxes the normal assumption and develops a framework called STRONG-X which is applicable for generally distributed additive noise with bounded variance. The convergence of STRONG-X can be proved and the generality of STRONG-X makes it an appealing method.	additive white gaussian noise;computation;design of experiments;experiment;federal enterprise architecture;iterative method;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;response surface methodology;simulation;stochastic gradient descent;trust region;utility functions on indivisible goods	Kuo-Hao Chang;Hong Wan	2009	Proceedings of the 2009 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)		stochastic process;econometrics;mathematical optimization;response surface methodology;stochastic optimization;mathematics;trust region;design of experiments;statistics	Robotics	57.34384375500143	9.302448539640737	136897

This social-welfare maximization problem is challenging due to the non-convexity. We first reformulate the problem as a convex task together with an incentive signal design strategy, and then propose a distributed algorithm for solving the reformulated problem. By doing so, we are able to achieve the solution of the original non-convex problem without exposure of any private information between end-customers and network operator.

The basic idea of the reduced order RLS based polynomial predistortion algorithm is to approximate the target function with two simpler functions (with a smaller number of coefficients) instead of a single function. A complex function is decomposed into two simpler functions so that we can compute the RLS algorithm with much less complexity. The proposed reduced order RLS polynomial predistortion show superior performance compared to the conventional RLS polynomial predistortion with the same number of coefficients or with the same computational complexity.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;computational complexity theory;polynomial;recursion;recursive least squares filter	Minglu Jin;Sooyoung Kim Shin;Deock-Gil Oh;Jae Moung Kim	2003		10.1109/ISCAS.2003.1205841	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;function approximation;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;signal processing;mathematics;computational complexity theory;polynomial;recursive least squares filter	Vision	60.50857134235905	13.892729105898582	137316

The use of multiplier-less digital filters results in simplified filtering structures, better throughput rates and higher speed. These characteristics are very desirable in many DSP systems. This thesis concentrates on the design of digital filters with power-of-two coefficients that result in simplified filtering structures. Two distinct classes of ML FIR filter design algorithms are developed and compared with traditional techniques. The first class is based on the sensitivity of filter coefficients to rounding to power-of-two. Novel elements include extending of the algorithm for multiple-bands filters and introducing mean square error as the sensitivity criterion. This improves the performance of the algorithm and reduces the complexity of resulting filtering structures. The second class of filter design algorithms is based on evolutionary techniques, primarily genetic algorithms. Three different algorithms based on genetic algorithm kernel are developed. They include simple genetic algorithm, knowledge-based genetic algorithm and hybrid of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. Inclusion of the additional knowledge has been found very useful when redesigning filters or refining previous designs. Hybrid techniques are useful when exploring large, N-dimensional searching spaces. Here, the genetic algorithm is used to explore searching space rapidly, followed by fine search using simulated annealing. This approach has been found beneficial for design of high-order filters. Finally, a formula for estimation of the filter length from its specification and complementing both classes of design algorithms, has been evolved using techniques of symbolic regression and genetic programming. Although the evolved formula is very complex and not easily understandable, statistical analysis has shown that it produces more accurate results than traditional Kaiser's formula. In summary, several novel algorithms for the design of multiplier-less digital filters have been developed. They outperform traditional techniques that are used for the design of ML FIR filters and hence contributed to the knowledge in the field of ML FIR filter design. 11 To my precious wife Martina and daughter Alexandra.	british undergraduate degree classification;coefficient;digital filter;digital signal processor;filter bank;filter design;finite impulse response;first-class function;genetic algorithm;genetic programming;kaiser window;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;power of two;rounding;simulated annealing;symbolic regression;throughput	Radovan Cemes	1996			electronic engineering;electronics;computer science;electrical engineering;computer engineering	Graphics	61.30254989360246	17.60665819749478	137414

We propose a systematic and explicit procedure to address this problem by pairing GP regression with Kalman Filtering. Under a specific separability assumption of the modeling kernel and periodic sampling on a (possibly non-uniform) space-grid, we show how to build an exact finite dimensional discrete-time state-space representation for the modeled process. The major finding is that the state at instant k of the associated Kalman Filter represents a sufficient statistic to compute the minimum variance prediction of the process at instant k over any arbitrary finite subset of the space.

Firstly, synchronization of a dynamical network with physical links and undirected topology is reinvestigated from a set stability point of view. An explicit Lyapunov function with respect to its synchronization manifold is constructed for such a network by using properties of undirected networks. Based on this Lyapunov function, a distributed event-triggered sampling scheme is designed which decides when a node should send its sampled state to its neighbors across the communication network in order to achieve asymptotic synchronization of a dynamical network with communication links. The proposed triggering rule only depends on the state of the node itself and the sampled ones that are received from its neighbors.	dynamical system;graph (discrete mathematics);linear time-invariant theory;lyapunov fractal;sampling (signal processing);simulation preorder;synchronization (computer science);telecommunications network;time complexity;time-invariant system	Tao Liu;David John Hill;Bing Liu	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426585	control engineering;synchronization;synchronization networks;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing	Embedded	64.47208317241251	5.6291579899683315	137710
400d197f46162e4e57c5993e0bedcd4114c66e72	robust decentralized dynamic optimization at presence of malfunctioning agents		This paper considers the problem of tracking a network-wide solution that dynamically minimizes the summation of time-varying local cost functions of network agents, when some of the agents are malfunctioning. The malfunctioning agents broadcast faulty values to their neighbors, and lead the optimization process to a wrong direction. To mitigate the influence of the malfunctioning agents, we propose a total variation (TV) norm regularized formulation that drives the local variables of the regular agents to be close, while allows them to be different with the faulty values broadcast by the malfunctioning agents. We give a sufficient condition under which consensus of the regular agents is guaranteed, and bound the gap between the consensual solution and the optimal solution we pursue as if the malfunctioning agents do not exist. A fully decentralized subgradient algorithm is proposed to solve the TV norm regularized problem in a dynamic manner. At every time, every regular agent only needs one subgradient evaluation of its current local cost function, in addition to combining messages received from neighboring regular and malfunctioning agents. The tracking error is proved to be bounded, given that variation of the optimal solution is bounded. Numerical experiments demonstrate the robust tracking performance of the proposed algorithm at presence of the malfunctioning agents. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The algorithm is based on an orthogonal decomposition of the triplet (A,E, C) to the observer-Hessenberg-triangular form. It is a natural generalization of the widelyknown observer-Hessenberg algorithm for the Sylvester-observer equation : XA − FX = GC, which arises in state estimation of a standard first-order state-space control system. An application of the proposed algorithm is made to state and velocity estimations of second-order control systems modeling a wide variety of vibrating structures. For dense un-structured data, the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the recently proposed SVD-based algorithm of the authors, it is heavily composed of BLAS-3 (Level 3 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) operations, which make the algorithm an ideal candidate for high-performance computing.	algorithm;blas;computation;control system;control theory;feedback;first-order predicate;karl hessenberg;linear algebra;numerical analysis;optimal control;singular value decomposition;state space;subroutine;supercomputer;systems modeling;the matrix;triangular matrix;triplet state;velocity (software development)	João B.

Some distributed adaptive strategies are designed on all the coupling weights of the network for reaching synchronization, which are then extended to the case where only a small fraction of coupling weights are adjusted. A general criterion is given and it is found that synchronization can be reached if the corresponding edges and nodes of the updated coupling weights form a spanning tree. Finally, simulation examples are given to illustrate the theoretical analysis.	complex network;control theory;http public key pinning;loose coupling;simulation;spanning tree	Wenwu Yu	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21111-9_20	synchronization;adaptive control;spanning tree;computer science;control theory;distributed computing;complex network	ML	64.78582833929133	5.740224443909836	138216

This is, however, not the first time that a function minimization approach has been used to obtain dominance. An optimisation oriented method was first proposed in 1975 (Ahson, 1975). This method is based on a new formulation of diagonal dominance criterion which takes into account model parameter uncertainties.	diagonally dominant matrix;nyquist rate	Syed I.

However, most phase estimation schemes rely on precise knowledge of the underlying parameters of the system under measurement, and performance deteriorates significantly with changes in these parameters; hence it is desired to develop robust estimation techniques immune to such uncertainties. In related works, we have already shown how adaptive homodyne estimation can be made robust to uncertainty in an underlying parameter of the phase varying as a simplistic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic noise process. Here, we demonstrate robust phase estimation for a more complicated resonant noise process using a guaranteed cost robust filter.	adaptive filter;quantum phase estimation algorithm	Shibdas Roy;Ian R.

Due to the absence of phase information, signal recovery requires some form of additional prior information. In this paper, the prior information we assume is sparsity. We develop a convex optimization based framework to retrieve the signal support from the support of the autocorrelation, and propose an iterative algorithm which terminates in a signal with the least sparsity satisfying the autocorrelation constraints. Numerical results suggest that unique recovery up to a global sign change, time shift and/or time reversal is possible with a very high probability for sufficiently sparse signals.	algorithm;autocorrelation;convex optimization;detection theory;iterative method;mathematical optimization;phase retrieval;sparse matrix;time reversal signal processing;timeshift	Kishore Jaganathan;Samet Oymak;Babak Hassibi	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6288658	convex function;fourier transform;mathematical optimization;estimation;combinatorics;convex optimization;decorrelation;pattern recognition;mathematics;autocorrelation technique;iterative method;phase retrieval;correlation	Robotics	57.195147818638034	13.783321947160442	138524

Based on this blend of high-order statistics and temporal structure in a single functional form, we propose a unified criterion for instantaneous blind source separation (BSS). The criterion simultaneously exploits both spatial and spectral characteristics of the sources. Consequently, the new algorithm is able to separate independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) sources, which requires high-order statistics; and it is also able to separate temporally correlated Gaussian sources with distinct spectra, which requires temporal information. Performance of the proposed method is compared with other popular BSS methods that solely depend on either high-order statistics (FastICA, JADE) or second-order statistics at different lags (SOBI). The new algorithm outperforms the conventional methods in the case of mixtures of sub-Gaussian and superGaussian sources. r 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The formation system is composed of three kinds of uncertain Mecanum-wheeled mobile robots (MWMRs) and the communication network is modeled as a directed graph. The dynamic behavior of each kind of uncertain MWMR is modelled by an uncertain second-order dynamic model in a unified framework. By using the Lyapunov stability theory and fuzzy sliding-mode control approach, a fuzzy sliding-mode leader-follower consensus formation control law is presented to carry out formation control in presence of model and parameter uncertainties. Two computer simulations are performed to illustrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed method.	computer simulation;consensus (computer science);consensus dynamics;directed graph;experiment;graph theory;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;mobile robot;obstacle avoidance;optimal control;telecommunications network;unified framework	Micheli Stefanello	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2018.8491531	mecanum wheel;fuzzy logic;lyapunov stability;robot;control theory;sliding mode control;directed graph;vehicle dynamics;mobile robot;computer science	Robotics	64.08977399445358	4.583200001646905	139087

This is an extremely time-consuming process and an optimum solution is not guaranteed. In this work, this problem is studied from the viewpoint of compressive sensing (CS) and a CS-based method is provided. Although there have been CS-based methods proposed for the design of narrowband arrays, its extension to the wideband case is not straightforward, as there are multiple coefficients associated with each sensor/microphone and it is not sufficient to simply minimize the l1 norm of the weight coefficients to obtain a sparse array solution. To achieve this, a modified l1 norm minimization method is derived and its effectiveness is verified by design examples.	beamforming;coefficient;compressed sensing;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;microphone;nonlinear system;simulated annealing;sparse matrix;t-norm;taxicab geometry	Matthew B.

4a7f9656e2657682347b1c86ba14a5c0690e6d2b	fast and accurate algorithms for re-weighted $\ell _{1}$-norm minimization	minimisation;iterative methods;computational complexity;signal reconstruction	To recover a sparse signal from an underdetermined system, we often solve a constrained l1-norm minimization problem. In many cases, the signal sparsity and recovery performance can be further improved by replacing the l1 norm with a “weighted” l1 norm. Without prior information about the signal's nonzero elements, the procedure for selecting weights is iterative in nature. Common approaches update the weights at every iteration using the solution of a weighted l1 problem from the previous iteration. This paper presents two homotopy-based algorithms that efficiently solve reweighted l1 problems. First, we present an algorithm that quickly updates the solution of a weighted l1 problem as the weights change. Since the solution changes only slightly with small changes in weights, we develop a homotopy algorithm that replaces old weights with new ones in a small number of computationally inexpensive steps. Second, we propose an algorithm that solves a weighted l1 problem by adaptively selecting weights while estimating the signal. This algorithm integrates the reweighting into every step along the homotopy path by changing the weights according to changes in the solution and its support, allowing us to achieve a high quality signal reconstruction by solving a single homotopy problem. We compare both algorithms' performance, in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational complexity, against state-of-the-art solvers and show that our methods have smaller computational cost. We also show that the adaptive selection of the weights inside the homotopy often yields reconstructions of higher quality.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;computational complexity theory;display resolution;iteration;signal reconstruction;sparse matrix;taxicab geometry	Muhammad Salman Asif;Justin K.

500056659212960e1dc4390417cc9f8aec52248f	optimal design of digital low pass finite impulse response filter using particle swarm optimization and bat algorithm		In this paper, the traditional metaheuristic Particle Swarm Optmization (PSO) and the Bat Algorithm (BA) are used to optimal design digital low pass (LP) Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. These filters have a wide range of applications because of their characteristics. They are easy to be designed, they have guaranteed bounded input-bounded output (BIBO) stability and can be designed to present linear phase at all frequencies. Traditional optimization methods based on gradient are susceptible to getting trapped on a local optima solution when they are applied to optimize multimodal problems, such as the FIR filter design. Here, to overcome this drawback, the aforementioned metaheuristics are adopted to obtain the coefficients of low pass FIR filters of order 20 and 24. The performance of BA and PSO algorithms are compared with the classical Parks and McClellan (PM) filter design algorithm, which is a deterministic procedure. For this comparison is considered the filters pass band and stop band ripples, transition width and statistical data. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed filter design approach using BA algorithm outperforms PM and PSO.	bibo stability;bat algorithm;business architecture;coefficient;deterministic algorithm;filter bank;filter design;finite impulse response;gradient;linear phase;local optimum;low-pass filter;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;multimodal interaction;optimal design;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;simulation	Alcemy G.

In particular, it is of interest to find a preprocessing operation that enables the adoption of conventional signal processing techniques and algorithms developed for the filtering of proper-complex signals and that leads to computationally efficient near-optimal postprocessing. An invertible linear-conjugate linear (LCL) operator named the DT frequency shift (FRESH) properizer is first proposed. It is shown that the DT FRESH properizer converts a DT improper-complex SOCS random process input to an equivalent DT proper-complex SOCS random process output by utilizing the information only about the cycle period of the input. An invertible LCL block processing operator named the asymptotic FRESH properizer is then proposed that mimics the operation of the DT FRESH properizer but processes a finite number of consecutive samples of a DT improper-complex SOCS random process. It is shown that the output of the asymptotic FRESH properizer is not proper but asymptotically proper and that its frequency-domain covariance matrix converges to a highly structured block matrix with diagonal blocks as the block size tends to infinity. Two representative estimation and detection problems are presented to demonstrate that asymptotically optimal low-complexity postprocessors can be easily designed by exploiting these asymptotic second-order properties of the output of the asymptotic FRESH properizer.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;asymptote;asymptotically optimal algorithm;block size (cryptography);central processing unit;cyclostationary process;elegant degradation;imaginary time;preprocessor;signal processing;stochastic process;system on a chip	Jeong Ho Yeo;Joon Ho Cho	2014	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2014.2320938	system on a chip;mathematical optimization;signal processing;mathematics;correlation;frequency domain;statistics	ML	54.15540680579404	15.476139999253837	139790

In such a problem, communication constraints impose limits on the achievable control performance. We consider as instance of coordination the consensus problem. The aim of the paper is to characterize the relationship between the amount of information exchanged by the agents and the rate of convergence to the consensus. We show that time-invariant communication networks with circulant symmetries yield slow convergence if the amount of information exchanged by the agents does not scale well with their number. On the other hand, we show that randomly time-varying communication networks allow very fast convergence rates. We also show that, by adding logarithmic quantized data links to time-invariant networks with symmetries, control performance significantly improves with little growth of the required communication effort.	autonomous agent;autonomous robot;circulant matrix;consensus (computer science);distributed control system;mobile agent;quantization (signal processing);randomness;rate of convergence;scalability;telecommunications network;time-invariant system	Ruggero Carli;Fabio Fagnani;Alberto Speranzon;Sandro Zampieri	2008	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2007.07.009	simulation;consensus;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;rate of convergence;algorithm	AI	65.92862212631705	6.824082830297642	139801

In this method, a mean-square error based on the difference between the desired and actual frequency responses is formulated in a quadratic form. Quadratic programming is employed wherein the constraint on stability is accomodated to design stable differentiators. Our method is compared with the linear programming approach in terms of the computational complexity and the variation of the magnitude and group-delay errors with frequency. It is shown that the differentiators designed using our method has a much lower computational complexity and smaller variation of the magnitude and group-delay errors with frequency than those designed using the linear programming approach. The method has been extended to the design of frequency-selective differentiators in which the differentiation is performed over any prescribed passband. Finally, the design of maximally-accurate differentiators is presented in which derivative constraints are also accomodated in the error function.	group delay and phase delay;recursion	S.

6ea748f321897466711f0dbbf9313084bc6d98c8	robust synchronization of a class of uncertain complex networks via discontinuous control	dynamical networks;robust control;synchronization	We propose robust controller designs to synchronize networks with uncertainties in their node dynamics and their connections. We consider two situations: in the first, we assume that the effect of uncertainties vanishes as synchronization is achieved. In the second, disturbances are assume nonvanishing but bounded. To achieve robust synchronization on these situations, we design local feedback controllers, which are smooth in the first case, and discontinuous in the latter. These designs allow us to establish synchronization criteria for this class of uncertain dynamical networks. We use numerical experiments to illustrate our results.	complex network	Juan Gonzalo Barajas-Ramírez	2012	Computers & Mathematics with Applications	10.1016/j.camwa.2012.01.082	robust control;synchronization;real-time computing;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Theory	65.18803266738132	4.855423434507823	140230

A recursive maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) algorithm is derived as an alternative to the maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm of Mendel and Kormylo. The MAP approach proposed here yields a suboptimal detector which is substantially different in details from the corresponding approximate ML detector of Mendel and Kormylo. Simulation studies are presented to show that the MAP detector performs as well as the ML detector and can yield comparable results with much less computational effort. A comparative study of both the MAP and ML detectors has been made via simulations which show some interesting differences in structure as well as performance.	coefficient;deconvolution;recursion (computer science)	Arijit K.

According to the block Hermitian matrix property of covariance matrix, a new element-order recursive method is proposed in this paper to calculate the inverse space-time covariance matrix for STAP weight vector. In the proposed method, the inverse space-time covariance matrix of first element-order is initially calculated recursively based on block Hermitian matrix property, and then the inverse space-time covariance matrix of high element-order is correspondingly deduced recursively based on obtained inverse covariance matrix of previous element-order. Finally, STAP weight vector is calculated based on the final inverse covariance matrix. Afterwards, a modified reduced-dimension STAP method is derived by combining the proposed method with the m-Doppler Transformation (mDT-SAP) STAP approach. Based on the simulated and the actual airborne phased array radar data, the proposed method verified that the computational complexity is much smaller than conventional STAP methods. The proposed element-order recursive method for STAP is applicable for practical airborne phased radar system. 由于空时协方差矩阵求逆存在巨大的运算复杂度, 传统空时自适应处理(STAP)技术难以满足目前技术水平下系统实时性的要求。 本文根据空时协方差矩阵为Hermitian矩阵, 能利用阵元分块递推的特性, 提出基于阵元阶数递推计算空时协方差矩阵逆的STAP算法。 本方法首先根据分块Hermitian矩阵性质, 递推得到第1个阵元的协方差逆矩阵, 然后按照阵元阶数逐级递推得到最终的空时协方差逆矩阵, 进而得到STAP自适应权值。 同时, 本方法还可以有效地与m多普勒邻域(mDT-SAP)等降维STAP算法结合使用。 仿真与实测数据处理结果表明, 本方法在极大降低计算复杂度的同时, 能够获得和直接协方差矩阵求逆STAP算法同样的杂波抑制性能。	airborne ranger;computation;computational complexity theory;numerical linear algebra;phased array;radar;recursion;space-time adaptive processing	Xiaopeng Yang;Yuze Sun;Yongxu Liu;Tao Zeng;Teng Long	2014	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-014-5250-1	hermitian matrix;estimation of covariance matrices;covariance matrix;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;cma-es;space-time adaptive processing;computer science;mathematics;state-transition matrix;computational complexity theory;algorithm;covariance function	AI	57.455353099109715	13.197899351484736	140883

Both uniform input delay and nonuniform input delay are considered. We identify one class of agents for which static linear protocol can be designed, which is named squared-down passifiable via input feedforward. A parameterized static protocol is proposed for each agent such that state synchronization is achieved among agents with uniform or nonuniform input delay. Moreover, we derive upper bounds for uniform and nonuniform input delay that can be tolerated.	display lag;input lag;multi-agent system	Zhenwei Liu;Meirong Zhang;Ali Saberi;Anton A.

OMP iteratively decomposes a signal through deterministic atom selections at each iteration step. Recently proposed randomized OMP algorithms employ random atom selections instead and have the potential to further improve denoising. Typically, the best approximation from these algorithms can be obtained only within a narrow range of iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage randomized OMP (MS-ROMP) denoising approach that performs successive ROMP runs, each denoising the obtained estimate from the previous one. We show through simulations that, under certain conditions, this can significantly improve denoising performance by producing a good approximation after any number of iterations beyond the sparsity level.	approximation;atom;dictionary;greedy algorithm;iteration;least squares;matching pursuit;noise reduction;online advertising;openmp;romp;randomized algorithm;simulation;sparse matrix	Stefanos Koskinas;Ioannis N.

The TDE-SI method considers the delay between two transient signals as the difference between the center of mass of these signals. The method has three special cases: In the first, time is the mass coordinate and the signal sit) is the mass distribution (estimate D/spl circ//sub s/); in the second case, the squared signal s/sup 2/(t) is the mass distribution (estimate D/spl circ/(s/sup 2/)); and the last is a variant of the second. The bias and the standard deviation to) of the estimate have been evaluated when the signal is contaminated by Gaussian white noise. D/spl circ//sub s/ is not biased but the /spl sigma/ of the TDE is higher than that obtained when working with D/spl circ/(s/sup 2/). Moreover, the D/spl circ/(s/sup 2/) estimate is biased. The special case of a bias-corrected estimate (D/spl circ/'(s/sup 2/)) is presented; this D/spl circ/'(s/sup 2/) yields a /spl sigma/ of its TDE lower than the estimate D/spl circ//sub s/. Hence, D/spl circ/'(s/sup 2/) is the most suitable of the three TDE-SI options for TDE. Theoretical estimations are validated by simulation results with artificially generated signals and by real so-called QRS complex waves (ventricular activity) from an electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. >	broadcast delay	Pablo Laguna;Raimon Jané;Pere Caminal	1994	IEEE Trans.

Available approaches typically rely on relaxations such as Group Lasso or nuclear norm minimization. Moreover, incorporating stability and model order constraints into the formalism in such methods entails a substantial increase in computational complexity. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper we present algorithms for parsimonious linear time invariant system identification aimed at identifying low-complexity models which i) incorporate a priori knowledge on the system (e.g., stability), ii) allow for data with missing/nonuniform measurements, and iii) are able to use data obtained from several runs of the system with different unknown initial conditions. The randomized algorithms proposed are based on the concept of atomic norm and provide a numerically efficient way to identify sparse models from large amounts of noisy data.	computational complexity theory;initial condition;lasso;linear time-invariant theory;numerical analysis;occam's razor;randomized algorithm;semantics (computer science);signal-to-noise ratio;sparse matrix;system identification;time complexity;time-invariant system	Burak Y&imath;lmaz;Korkut Bekiroglu;Constantino M.

In this paper, we focus on the regularized recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm and present a method to find its regularization parameter, which is related to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Also, using a proper estimation of the SNR, we further propose a variable-regularized RLS (VR-RLS) algorithm. In addition, a low-complexity version of the VR-RLS algorithm is developed, based on the dichotomous coordinate descent (DCD) method. Due to their nature, the proposed algorithms have good robustness features against additive noise, which make them behave well in all noisy conditions.

A new kind of distributed control protocol is designed based on the adaptive intermittent control ideas, some novel criteria are derived in matrix inequalities form by resorting to the generalized Halanay inequality. It is proved that second-order consensus can be reached if communication duration is larger than a threshold value under the strongly connected and balanced topology, and the relationship between the delays and communication duration over each control period is sought out.

1794011519200fd2006ab39901cc85068a66d8f2	the power-oja method for decentralized subspace estimation/tracking		This work proposes a decentralized and adaptive subspace estimation method, called the Power-Oja (P-Oja) method. Existing decentralized subspace tracking algorithms have slow convergence rate or are unable to adapt to time varying statistics. To resolve these issues, the P-Oja method is developed by combining the power method with Oja's learning rule. Our key innovation lies on the design of a modified objective function with enhanced spectral gap property. This allows the P-Oja method to track the principal subspace more quickly with a finite number of samples. Interestingly, the resulting method coincides with the conventional Oja's learning rule in some special cases. To enable decentralized signal processing, we further demonstrate that the proposed method can be implemented by using a gossip algorithm. Our simulation results show that the proposed P-Oja outperforms the conventional Oja's method in terms of estimation accuracy, and the power method in terms of tracking performance. The effect of the communication graph on the tracking performance is also studied.	algorithm;erkki oja;learning rule;loss function;optimization problem;power iteration;rate of convergence;signal processing;simulation	Sissi Xiaoxiao Wu;Hoi-To Wai;Anna Scaglione;Neil A.

Therefore, recently, how to reduce the group delay of FIR filters has been studied intensively. To reduce the ringing in the time domain and to maximize the stopband attenuation, it is useful to design FIR filters with maximally flat characteristics in the passband and transmission zeros in the stopband. We present a mathematically closed form transfer function of low delay bandpass FIR filters with maximally flat amplitude in the passband and the transmission zeros in the stopband. Because of the mathematically closed form transfer function, the designing filters are very simple. Moreover, we propose a design method of low delay bandpass FIR filters with maximally flat amplitude in the passband and equiripple in the stopband by using an iterative method of a closed form transfer function and Remez algorithm.	butterworth filter;finite impulse response;group delay and phase delay;iterative method;remez algorithm;ringing (signal);transfer function	Yukio Mori;Naoyuki Aikawa	2004			computer science;finite impulse response;transition band;prototype filter;elliptic filter;stopband	EDA	60.9190339276314	17.938704758710628	142294

This paper first uses graph theoretic constructions to study modified versions of the Altafini model in which there are communication delays or quantized communication. The condition under which consensus in absolute value or bipartite consensus is achieved proves to be the same as the condition in the delay-free case. The paper also analyzes the performance of the model where the information exchanged between neighboring agents is subject to a certain type of deterministic uniform quantization. We show that in finite time and depending on initial conditions, the model on any static, connected, undirected signed graph will either cause all agents to reach a quantized consensus in absolute value, or will lead all variables to oscillate in a small neighborhood around the absolute value.	directed graph;graph (discrete mathematics);initial condition;interaction;quantization (signal processing);signed graph;theory	Ji Liu;Mahmoud El Chamie;Tamer Basar;Behçet Açikmese	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798806	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;convergence;aerodynamics;computer science;theoretical computer science;control theory;mathematics;limiting;statistics	Theory	64.53210184580693	6.170753151931912	143048

The main novelty of our approach is the transformation of the original problem into the maximum eigenvalue minimization of a parameterized Toeplitz matrix, with only O(N) variables. This is a typical application of semidefinite programming (SDP) and may be solved with reliable interior-point algorithms. Our algorithm is to be compared with the method of Tuqan and Vaidyanathan (1998), which has O(N/sup 2/) variables. The numerical experiments show that the optimum compaction filter is obtained with good numerical accuracy and convenient execution time for filters of order up to 100.	data compaction;sockets direct protocol	Bogdan Dumitrescu;Corneliu Popeea	2000		10.1109/ICASSP.2000.862031	minimisation;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;eigenvalues and eigenvectors;finite impulse response;toeplitz matrix;mathematics;computational complexity theory;statistics	EDA	61.41375843819555	16.557520470092854	143314

Given sample values inside a disk of finite radius, we wish to estimate the field’s power spectral density using linear prediction. Issues arising here include estimation of covariance lags and extendibility of a finite set of lag estimates into a positive semidefinite covariance extension (required for a meaningful spectral density). We give a generalized autocorrelation procedure that guarantees positive semidefinite covariance estimates. It first interpolates the data using Gaussians, computes its Radon transform, and applies familiar 1-D techniques to each slice. Some numerical examples are provided to justify the validity of the proposed procedure. We also propose a correlationmatching covariance extension procedure that uses the Radon transform to extend a given set of covariance lags to the entire plane, when this is possible, and discuss circumstances for which this is impossible.	autocorrelation;interpolation;numerical analysis;raster graphics;spectral density estimation	Wen-Hsien Fang;Andrew E.

In this technique, IIR filters replace the c onventional FIR filters of the PSWT, offering computational and spectral magnitude performance advantages, in addition to significant delay reductions. Previously, the PSWT has only incorporated filter banks with slowly reacting FIR wavelet filters. While these filters possess the desirable properties of linear phase, and design simplicity, a large delay is incurred which increases exponentially with increasing resolution. The progression to IIR filter banks gives rise to a multi-resolution decomposition mechanism, beneficial for real-time applications, such as speech coding, where delay is an important issue.	color gradient;computation;filter bank;finite impulse response;infinite impulse response;interpolation;linear phase;programming paradigm;real-time clock;speech coding;waveform;wavelet transform	Nicola R.

To design these algorithms an innovation approach is used, assuming that the state-space model of the signal is unknown and using only covariance information. To measure the precision of the proposed estimators formulas to calculate the filtering and smoothing error covariance matrices are also derived. The effectiveness of the estimators is illustrated by a numerical simulation example where a signal is estimated using observations from two randomly delayed sensors having different delay properties.	sensor	Raquel Caballero-Águila;Aurora Hermoso-Carazo;José D.

In particular, each device combines noisy measurements of its absolute position with distance measurements to its neighbors. The communication topology is modeled by a graph. Both static and dynamic graph structures are investigated. The self-localization task is addressed using distributed Kalman Filters. First a filter is designed which uses only locally available measurements for state estimation. Secondly, a data fusion step is added to the filter. This allows the usage of more measurement information available in the network to improve the accuracy. When the graph is dynamic, a larger communication radius is necessary to ensure reliable performance.	algorithm;graph (discrete mathematics);kalman filter;mobile device	Anne-Kathrin Hess;Anders Rantzer	2010		10.1145/1755952.1755980	control engineering;invariant extended kalman filter;fast kalman filter;computer science;machine learning;control theory;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation;alpha beta filter	Robotics	61.26667390601889	5.275414100771817	144223

These channels may result from oversampling the single output of a transmission channel or/and by receiving multiple outputs of an antenna array. A number of recent contributions in the field of blind channel identification have shown that polyphase channels can be blindly identified using only second-order statistics (SOS) of the output. In this work, we are mostly interested in the blind linear equalizationof these channels: After some elaboration on the specifics of the equalization problem for polyphase channels, we show how optimal settings of various well-known types of linear equalization structures can be obtained blindly using only the output’s SOS by using multichannel linear prediction or related techniques.	channel (communications);oversampling;polyphase quadrature filter	Constantinos B.

Recently efforts have been made to use generalized sinc functions to perfectly reconstruct various kinds of non-bandlimited signals. As a consequence, perfect reconstruction sampling formulas have been established using such generalized sinc functions. This article studies the error of the reconstructed non-bandlimited signal when an adaptive truncation scheme is employed. Further, when there are noises present in the samples, estimation on the expectation and variance of the error pertinent to the reconstructed signal is also given. Finally discussed are the reproducing properties and the Sobolev smoothness of functions in the space of non-bandlimited signals that admits such a sampling formula.	bandlimiting;modulus of smoothness;relevance;sampling (signal processing);sinc function;truncation	Youfa Li;Qiuhui Chen;Tao Qian;Yi Wang	2012	CoRR		nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;sinc filter;mathematics;sinc function;statistics	ML	54.303932805028744	16.107480925505588	144406

A novel distributed intermediate estimator based fault tolerant tracking protocol is presented. The leader’s input is nonzero and unavailable to the followers. By applying a projection technique, the mismatched disturbances are separated into matched and unmatched components. For each node, a tracking error system is established, for which an intermediate estimator driven by the relative output measurements is constructed to estimate the sensor faults and a combined signal of the leader’s input, process faults, and matched disturbance component. Based on the estimation, a fault tolerant tracking protocol is designed to eliminate the effects of the combined signal. Besides, the effect of unmatched disturbance component can be attenuated by directly adjusting some specified parameters. Finally, a simulation example of aircraft demonstrates the effectiveness of the designed tracking protocol.	agent-based model;anatomic node;block cipher mode of operation;fault tolerance;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;simulation	Jun-Wei Zhu;Guang-Hong yang;Wen-an Zhang;Li Yu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2017.2753383	estimator;robustness (computer science);observer (quantum physics);fault tolerance;tracking error;mathematics;multi-agent system;control theory	Embedded	63.572424287813185	4.286676485747834	144465

Recently in the radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) design and linearization communities, there have been many attempts to utilize the CS technique to enable the development of efficient wireless transmitters. This paper provides a brief review of the use of CS in PA and transmitter linearization. Mainly two approaches are discussed: the use of CS to recover amplitude-distorted signals, and the use of CS to reduce the complexity of the digital predistorters. Experimental results obtained using an envelope tracking (ET) PA prototype show the potential and value of the CS technique in developing efficient predistorters at a low computational cost.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;audio power amplifier;circuit restoration;coefficient;compressed sensing;computation;distortion;experiment;image restoration;nonlinear system;prototype;rf power amplifier;radar;radio frequency;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix;system identification;transmitter	Oualid Hammi;Abubakr Hassan Abdelhafiz;Fadhel M.

131bc5ab9597ddb05971b306ee09dc15155aefcf	distributed parametric consensus optimization with an application to model predictive consensus problem		In this paper, we study a special class of distributed convex optimization problems—distributed parametric consensus optimization problem (DPCOP), for which a two-stage optimization method including primal decomposition and distributed consensus is provided. Different from traditional distributed optimization problems driving all the local states to a common value, DPCOP aims to solve a system-wide problem with partial common parameters shared amongst local agents in a distributed way. To relax the restriction on the topology, a distributed projected subgradient method is applied in distributed consensus stage to achieve the consensus of local estimated parameters, while the subgradients can be obtained by solving a multiparametric problem locally. For a special class of DPCOPs, a discrete-time distributed algorithm with exponential rate of convergence is provided. Furthermore, the proposed two-stage optimization method is applied to a distributed model predictive consensus problem in order to reach an optimal output consensus at equilibrium points for all agents. The stability analysis for the proposed algorithm is further given. Two case studies on a heterogenous multiagent system with high-order integrator dynamics are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed methods.	agent-based model;anatomy, regional;consensus (computer science);convergence (action);convex optimization;distributed algorithm;mathematical optimization;maximal set;multi-agent system;optimization problem;projections and predictions;rate of convergence;subgradient method;exponential	Xinli Shi;Jinde Cao;Wei Huang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2017.2726102	subgradient method;rate of convergence;distributed algorithm;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematical optimization;distributed element model;convex optimization;mathematics;parametric statistics;optimization problem;consensus	ML	64.46659179421711	7.571218708843729	144527

This shows that the adaptation gains of this method should be selected depending on the signs of the differential powers of the sources in order to control its stability. As these signs are unknown in a blind context, we then develop a method for deriving them from the observed mixed signals.	blind signal separation;source separation	Yannick Deville	2002	2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference		econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;blind signal separation;statistics	Vision	54.764329145656504	13.266426744292538	144972

The new formulation includes a term, in the dynamics equation, that depends on the most recent linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimate of the state. This can model the behavior of a feedback control system featuring a state estimator. The measurement equation is allowed to depend on the previous LMMSE estimate of the state, which can represent the fact that measurements are obtained from a validation window centered about the predicted measurement and not from the entire surveillance region. The LMMSE filter is derived for the considered problem. The approach is demonstrated in the context of target tracking in clutter and is shown to be competitive with several popular nonlinear methods.	clutter;control system;dynamical system;feedback;kalman filter;mean squared error;nonlinear system;state-space representation;stochastic process	Daniel Sigalov;Tomer Michaeli;Yaakov Oshman	2014	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2014.2308601	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	56.42913998970558	5.228364188078021	145498

Thus, researchers have invested much effort to find ways to increase the efficiency of the FRM algorithm. In this paper, a novel 2-stage FRM structure was proposed. The three interpolation factors of the subfilters in the second stage can be chosen independently. The band-edge shaping filter synthesized by the second stage has a non-periodical frequency response, which is quite different from conventional FRM structures. Various filters were designed to test the performance of the proposed method. Experiments show that the proposed structure achieves lower complexity, in terms of the number of multipliers, compared to the FRM algorithms such as 1-stage FRM, 2-stage FRM, IFIR-FRM, SFFM-FRM, serial-masking FRM and some current FRM structures.	algorithm;computer simulation;experiment;finite impulse response;frequency response;group delay and phase delay;interpolation;newton's method;noise shaping;texts from last night	Ying Wei;Debao Liu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2013.2259485	frequency response;telecommunications;interpolation;finite impulse response;mathematics	Visualization	61.88046546719095	14.876706810462025	145727

The method will find the minimal length filter required to meet the constraints, or design a filter of any longer length desired. This latter option is helpful when there are constraints on monotonicity in certain bands or when finite word length must be considered. When the frequency response constraints are equal to the deviation of an optimal filter, the optimal filter is designed.

However in many cases (e.g. aerocrafts), the dynamics of agents have the characteristic of switching. Moreover, such switching in agent might be accompanied with the change of the interconnection topology of this MAS. This paper proposes a new model of two level switching structure to describe this type of MAS. The switching in the low level, which represents the variation of the agent dynamics, is deterministic and controllable. The switching in the upper level, which reflects the random change of the topology, fits for a Markov chain. Besides, the transition probability of the Markov chain in the upper level varies accordingly with the low level switching. This paper deals with the almost sure (AS) consensus for the MAS with two level switching. By analyzing the transient features of discrete-time Markov chain and based on the method of dwell time, a sufficient condition of AS consensus is proposed.	fits;high- and low-level;interconnection;markov chain;multi-agent system;time-invariant system	Yang Song;Zhenhong Yang;Taicheng Yang;Weiyan Hou	2016	Inf.

ce6f9d4017f7d38203572d5f2e1c35db2cacd91d	optimal design of pulse-forming networks	pulse forming network;optimal design	Abstract   In communication systems for digital signals, such as data transmission systems, electrical networks (filters) are used to:   1.   1. Concentrate the signal energy in a given frequency band in order to avoid disturbance outside this band.   2.   2. Produce a suitable signal form to allow high transmission rates together with low error rates.    To design such networks, a performance index has been defined and an optimization problem has been formulated. This problem can be classified as the minimization of a nonlinear function subject to nonlinear constraints.  Instead of using penalty function methods to solve this nonlinear programming problem, the set of original variables has been transformed by linear and invertible mapping into a set of auxiliary variables for which a simple constraint space exists. For the minimization with the new set of variables, a gradient technique has been used which takes into account that linearization is only valid for small step changes in the variables.  The last part of the paper describes a typical example of a pulse-forming network with bandpass characteristics.	optimal design	Werner Stehle	1973	Computer-Aided Design	10.1016/0010-4485(73)90147-4	control engineering;mathematical optimization;optimal design;control theory;mathematics;statistics	EDA	63.59030798203021	17.223072423501296	145910

By introducing an equivalent auxiliary system and a new certain indefinite quadratic form performance function, the system uncertainty can be appropriately considered into the new performance function and the fault estimator design is converted to the minimization problem of a quadratic form. Based on the partially equivalence property between the deterministic quadratic form problem and the Krein space estimation theory, the two-dimensional  H ∞  fault estimation problem can be solved via signal deconvolution in Krein space. Through employing projection operation and Riccati-like difference equation in two dimensions, both the recursive form fault estimator and the explicit condition for existence of the estimator are derived. One Darboux equation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault estimator.		Dong Zhao;Steven X.

For this purpose, a minimum norm robust pole assignment problem is formulated and solved as an unconstrained minimization problem for a suitably chosen cost function. By using a generalized Sylvester equation-based parameterization, an explicit expression of the gradient of the cost function is derived to allow the efficient solution of the minimization problem by using powerful gradient search-based minimization techniques. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.	assignment problem;gradient;loss function;numerical analysis	A.

5d1ccd79b3dd35f7333a8d23e9553071b796e53a	a solution to fastest distributed consensus problem for generic star & k-cored star networks		—Distributed average consensus is the main mechanism in algorithms for decentralized computation. In distributed average consensus algorithm each node has an initial state, and the goal is to compute the average of these initial states in every node. To accomplish this task, each node updates its state by a weighted average of its own and neighbors' states, by using local communication between neighboring nodes. In the networks with fixed topology, convergence rate of distributed average consensus algorithm depends on the choice of weights. This paper studies the weight optimization problem in distributed average consensus algorithm. The network topology considered here is a star network where the branches have different lengths. Closed-form formulas of optimal weights and convergence rate of algorithm are determined in terms of the network's topological parameters. Furthermore generic í µí±²-cored star topology has been introduced as an alternative to star topology. The introduced topology benefits from faster convergence rate compared to star topology. By simulation better performance of optimal weights compared to other common weighting methods has been proved.	a* search algorithm;chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;computation;consensus (computer science);fastest;mathematical optimization;network topology;optimization problem;rate of convergence;simulation;star network	Saber Jafarizadeh;Abbas Jamalipour	2012	CoRR		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;lower limit topology;mathematics;distributed computing;extension topology	Metrics	63.744309907225116	7.1394137394175035	146777

In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic decorrelation property of the discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) for two classes of discrete-time long-memory processes containing the ARFIMA and the GARMA processes. Especially, we prove theoretically that the covariance across between-packet DWPT coefficients decays hyperbolically or exponentially fast as the width of the underlying Daubechies scaling and wavelet filters to generate the DWPT gets large. Meanwhile, we show that the covariance between within-packet DWPT coefficients converges hyperbolically fast to its corresponding counterpart when the underlying scaling and wavelet filters to generate the DWPT are the Shannon's ideal low- and high-pass filters.	asymptote;autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average;autoregressive model;coefficient;decorrelation;discrete wavelet transform;image scaling;network packet;shannon (unit);wavelet packet decomposition	Xiaojiang Yu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2013.2255331	econometrics;mathematical optimization;second-generation wavelet transform;low-pass filter;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;high-pass filter;discrete wavelet transform;statistics	ML	54.079411733433496	15.354734701533799	146989

In a LFWSN, the communicating graph is mainly expressed by some complete subgraphs; if we fix subgraphs that are composed of all leaders while all nodes in complete subgraphs of followers run on the sleeping-awaking method, then the fixed leaders and varying followers topology is obtained, and the switching topology is expressed by a Markov chain. It is supposed that the measurements of all sensors are corrupted by additive noises. Accordingly, the limited error tracking protocol is proposed. Based on the theory of asymptotic boundedness in mean square, it is shown that LFWSN keeps the limited error tracking under the designed protocol.	markov chain;mean squared error;sensor;utility functions on indivisible goods	Jinping Mou;Jie Wang	2015	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2015.000107	nickel;communications protocol;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;sensor;control theory;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	62.30144915875712	5.931759756567377	147135

It combines the quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimator with the random sample consensus (RANSAC). This technique can with reasonable calculation complexity work for lower the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than existing parametric estimators of polynomial phase signals (PPS) and nonparametric estimators of FM signals, i.e., it achieves lower SNR threshold than the state-of-the-art techniques in the field. Obtained results are better for about 3dB with respect to the QML in term of the SNR threshold without increasing the mean squared error (MSE) above the threshold. The proposed estimator is tested on the PPS as a parametric estimator and for general FM signal estimation as a nonparametric estimator.

Our simulations verify the optimality of the conditional dPCRLB by comparing it with the centralized conditional PCRLB in bearing-only tracking applications.	algorithm;centralized computing;computation;recursion;simulation	Arash Mohammadi;Amir Asif	2013	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2012.2235430	computer vision;mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;signal processing	Vision	53.78575552101469	4.621902410787698	148334

However, there is a lack of analysis of saturation effects on the performance of ANC systems. This paper proposes an indirect method for analyzing the saturation effects in steady state using Fourier analysis. This indirect method uses clipping to approximate saturation and decomposes the saturated narrowband signal as the summation of a set of rectangular waves and a pulse-amplitude modulated signal. The theoretical analysis shows that the clipping of a sinusoidal signal produces extra odd harmonics, thus affecting the convergence speed and steady-state solution of adaptive filter in ANC systems. This analysis can be extended to narrowband noises that consist of multiple sinusoidal components such as engine noise in many ANC applications. A low-pass filter is effective in reducing saturation effects for harmonic-related noises. Analysis results are verified by computer simulations using recorded engine noise and transfer functions measured from an experimental setup.	adaptive filter;aliasing;approximation algorithm;clipping (computer graphics);computer simulation;control system;dynamic range;fourier analysis;image noise;low-pass filter;modulation;noise (electronics);sensor;steady state;transfer function	Sen M.

Undecimated MEMDFBs show the same results as those of original MEMD for an octave tree structure. Since the exact cut-off frequencies of MEMD are not known (i.e. due to data-driven decomposition), employing just simple downsampling in MEMD might cause aliasing. However, decimated MEMDFBs in this paper achieve perfect reconstruction with aliasing cancelled for any arbitrary tree. Applications of decimated/undecimated MEMDFBs for speech/audio and image signals are also included. Since decimated MEMDFBs can be applied into any arbitrary tree structure, this extends into MEMD packets. Arbitrary tree structures in decimated MEMDFBs also lead to more diverse choices in frequency bands for various multivariate applications requiring decimations.	aliasing;decimation (signal processing);digital filter;filter bank;frequency band;hilbert–huang transform;stationary wavelet transform;tree structure	Min-Sung Koh;Danilo P.

The contribution of the paper to the VSSLMS is threefold; (1) when γ ≪ 1 - α, the VSSLMS has low steady-state misalignment. (2) when α ≪ 1, the VSSLMS achieves different steady-state misalignments for different noise distributions.

When all the states are measured, we show that, in the presence of process and measurement noise, the state and parameter estimation errors are bounded. To this end, we show that this is possible only through the appropriate design of a virtual input which ensures that the system error signals are bounded. As a special case of all the states being measured, we show that in the case of a noise free system, the state estimation errors converge to the origin. For the case when only some states are measured, we show that for a linear system with n states, m inputs and p measurements, we can estimate at most p2 entries of the system matrix and pm entries of the input matrix.	converge;dynamical system;estimation theory;identification scheme;linear system;simulation	Srinath Mallikarjunan;Venkatesh Madyastha	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160902	control engineering;adaptive system;control theory;mathematics;linear system;statistics	Robotics	59.33446925724599	4.338954662409984	149342

Based on these single-parameter equations of the prediction error, individual model parameters error can be estimated for iterative parameter estimation. An added benefit of this parameter estimation method, besides its unique convergence characteristics, is the added capacity for direct noise compensation in the time-scale domain. This paper explores this benefit by introducing a noise compensation method that estimates the distortion by noise of the prediction error in the time-scale domain and incorporates that as a confidence factor to bias the estimation of individual parameters error. This method is shown to improve the precision of the estimated parameters when the confidence factors accurately represent the noise distortion of the prediction error.	estimation theory	James R.

Two cases of dynamic leaders with constant velocity and variable velocity are analyzed based on finite time stability theory. In particular, we propose homogeneous and sequential estimators to guarantee accurate desired position and velocity estimation of followers in finite time. Then the accurate estimations obtained are employed to achieve robust finite time containment control. Distributed control protocols are developed by applying homogeneity theory and sliding mode control so as to make followers converge and remain within the dynamic convex hull spanned by the leaders in finite time and suppress perturbation effectively. Finally, several simulation results are presented as a proof of theoretical analysis.	converge;correctness (computer science);directed graph;distributed computing;distributed control system;dynamic convex hull;nonlinear system;simulation;velocity (software development)	Di Yu;Qinghe Wu;Li Song	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6161039	sequential estimation;control engineering;robust statistics;communications protocol;mathematical optimization;lead;von neumann stability analysis;uncertainty;stability;sliding mode control;convex hull;control theory;mathematics;stability theory;second-order logic;statistics;robustness	Robotics	63.65594250954297	5.201068666599839	149742

The common approach is to neglect the dynamics and see the problem as a sequence of independent problems. This approach has two disadvantages. Firstly, the temporal dependency in the state could be used to improve the accuracy of the state estimates. Secondly, having an estimate for the state and its support could be used to reduce the computational load of the subsequent step. In the linear Gaussian setting, compressive sensing was recently combined with the Kalman filter to mitigate above disadvantages. In the nonlinear dynamical case, compressive sensing can not be used and, if the state dimension is high, the particle filter would perform poorly. In this paper we combine one of the most novel developments in compressive sensing, nonlinear compressive sensing, with the particle filter. We show that the marriage of the two is essential and that neither the particle filter or nonlinear compressive sensing alone gives a satisfying solution.	compressed sensing;computation;kalman filter;nonlinear system;particle filter;sparse matrix	Henrik Ohlsson;Michel Verhaegen;S.

Both the dynamics among the followers and the dynamics between the leader and each follower are heterogeneous. A sampled-data-based consensus protocol is proposed. In addition, the communication delays are considered. Based on Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, sufficient conditions for quasi-consensus in heterogeneous leader-following multiagent systems are established. The results show that all the followers can track the leader within a bounded range even if in the presence of heterogeneity of dynamics and sampled-data information.

The new wavelets are generated and the transform computed in discrete-time by alternating the Laguerre transform with perfect reconstruction filterbanks. This scheme provides the unique implementation of orthogonal or biorthogonal warped wavelets by means of rational transfer functions. We show that the discrete-time warped wavelets lead to well-defined continuous-time wavelet bases, satisfying a warped form of the two-scale equation. The shape of the wavelets is not invariant by translation. Rather, the “wavelet translates” are obtained from one another by allpass filtering. We show that the phase of the delay element is asymptotically a fractal. A feature of the warped wavelet transform is that the cut-off frequencies of the wavelets may be arbitrarily assigned while preserving a dyadic structure. The new transform provides an arbitrary tiling of the time–frequency plane, which can be designed by selecting as little as a single parameter. This feature is particularly desirable in cochlear and perceptual models of speech and music, where accurate bandwidth selection is an issue. As our examples show, by defining pitch-synchronous wavelets based on warped wavelets, the analysis of transients and denoising of inharmonic pseudo-periodic signals is greatly enhanced.	all-pass filter;causal filter;cochlear implant;coefficient;discrete fourier transform;discrete frequency domain;dyadic transformation;electronic band structure;feature detection (web development);filter bank;fractal;laguerre polynomials;low-pass filter;noise reduction;numerical analysis;signal processing;tiling window manager;time–frequency representation;wavelet transform;xfig	Gianpaolo Evangelista;Sergio Cavaliere	1998	IEEE Trans.

Thus, this bound is of special interest in applications involving hybrid systems, i.e., systems with both continuously and discretely distributed parameters, which can represent, in practice, fault-prone systems. However, the requirement to know explicitly the joint distribution of the estimated parameters with all the measurements makes the application of the Weiss-Weinstein lower bound to Markovian dynamic systems cumbersome. A sequential algorithm for the computation of the Crameacuter-Rao lower bound for such systems has been recently reported in the literature. Along with the marginal state distribution, the algorithm makes use of the transitional distribution of the Markovian state process and the distribution of the measurements at each time step conditioned on the appropriate states, both easily obtainable from the system equations. A similar technique is employed herein to develop sequential Weiss-Weinstein lower bounds for a class of Markovian dynamic systems. In particular, it is shown that in systems satisfying the Crameacuter-Rao lower bound regularity conditions, the sequential Weiss-Weinstein lower bound derived herein reduces, for a judicious choice of its parameters, to the sequential Crameacuter-Rao lower bound	computation;dynamical system;hybrid system;marginal model;sequential algorithm;whole earth 'lectronic link	Ilia Rapoport;Yaakov Oshman	2007	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2007.893208	mathematical optimization;chapman–robbins bound;dynamical system;calculus;signal processing;mathematics;statistics	Metrics	56.81493063073992	8.280536755071115	150996

Previous work by the authors proposed so-called logical consensus approach, by which a network of agents, that can exchange binary values representing their local estimates of the events, is able to reach a unique and consistent decision. The approach therein proposed is based on the construction of an iterative map, whose computation is centralized and guaranteed under suitable conditions on the input visibility and graph connectivity. Under the same conditions, we extend the approach in this work by allowing the construction of a logical linear consensus system that is globally stable in a fully distributed way. The effectiveness of the proposed method is showed through the real implementation of a wireless sensor network as a framework for the surveillance of an urban area.	centralized computing;communications protocol;computation;connectivity (graph theory);consensus (computer science);decision problem;iterative method;map;routing	Adriano Fagiolini;Simone Martini;Davide Di Baccio;Antonio Bicchi	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5650096	wireless sensor network;computer science;graph theory;machine learning;distributed computing;routing protocol;computer network	Robotics	62.48116369476057	6.365258227524727	151270

We consider two cases of second-order digital filters: distinct real poles and multiple real poles. In case of second-order digital filters, we can express the L2-sensitivity of second-order digital filters by a simple linear combination of exponential functions and formulate the L2-sensitivity minimization problem by a simple polynomial equation. As a result, the minimum L2-sensitivity realizations can be synthesized by only solving a fourth-degree polynomial equation, which can be analytically solved. key words: state-space digital filters, L2-sensitivity, minimization, closed form solutions	algebraic equation;digital filter;mathematical optimization;quartic function;state space;time complexity	Shunsuke Yamaki;Masahide Abe;Masayuki Kawamata	2010	IEICE Transactions		closed-form expression;mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;digital filter;state space;exponential function;control theory;mathematics;second-order logic	Graphics	62.70367895971856	16.101957014428468	151327

In this paper the sensitivity of this error power to random perturbations about the optimum filter coefficients is investigated. Expressions are derived for the mean and variance of the deviation from the optimum error power. It is shown that for the prewindowed growing memory RLS algorithm (~=1) the mean value of the deviation increases linearly with the number of iterations. The variance of the deviation increases in proportion to the square of the number of iterations. Expressions are also derived for the variance for correlated signals. These expressions show that the variance of the deviation for correlated signals increases compared to uncorrelated white signals by a term related to the sum of the square of the off-diagonal elements of the sample autocorrelation matrix. Expressions are also derived for the mean and variance of the deviation for the exponentially windowed RLS algorithm (A < 1). In this case the deviations are bounded and inversly proportional to 1-~.	algorithm;autocorrelation matrix;coefficient;expression (computer science);iteration;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;window function	Sasan Ardalan	1988	IEEE Trans.

Jointly SC processes have Loève bifrequency cross-spectrum with spectral masses concentrated on a countable set of support curves of the bifrequency plane. Jointly almost-cyclostationary (ACS) processes are obtained as special case when the support curves are lines with unit slope. It is shown that two jointly wide-sense stationary or jointly ACS processes expanded or decimated with different rates give rise to jointly SC processes. In addition, interpolation filtering of jointly SC processes is considered and sufficient conditions for alias-free filtering are provided.	cyclostationary process;decimation (signal processing);filter bank;linear time-invariant theory;prototype filter;stationary process;stochastic process;strongly correlated material;whittaker–shannon interpolation formula	Antonio Napolitano	2010	2010 18th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;combinatorics;mathematics;statistics	HPC	54.562745525624464	16.29805850948358	151561

First, a new weighted measure for pole and zero sensitivity for state-space digital filters is proposed and the problem of minimizing this measure is investigated. To this end, two efficient iterative techniques for minimizing this measure are developed by employing a quasi-Newton algorithm and relying on a recursive matrix equation, respectively. Furthermore, minimization of the proposed sensitivity measure subject to l2-scaling constraints is examined by extending the two aforementioned solution methods-one converts the constrained optimization problem at hand into an unconstrained problem and solves it using a quasi-Newton algorithm, while the other relaxes the constraints into a single constraint on matrix trace and solves the relaxed problem with an effective matrix iteration scheme. In addition, a simple yet novel method for the minimization of a zero sensitivity measure subject to minimal pole sensitivity is explored by pursuing an optimal coordinate transformation matrix. Simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed techniques.	algorithm;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);digital filter;iteration;mathematical optimization;newton;newton's method;optimization problem;quasi-newton method;recursion;simulation;state space;transformation matrix	Takao Hinamoto;Akimitsu Doi;Wu-Sheng Lu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2015.2500418	pole–zero plot;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;sensitivity;calculus;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics	Vision	64.90033941088193	17.23313193223916	151585

We consider antagonistic interactions among subsystems and propose a distributed feedback paradigm to achieve the output regulation goal. The reference and disturbance signals are produced by exosystems, which can be considered as a leader. However, not all subsystems have access to the information of the leader for constructing a feedback law to achieve the output regulation objective. The paper presents a distributed feedback strategy that makes all subsystems track the reference signal in a bipartite manner while rejecting the inflicted disturbance. Finally, the theoretical findings of this paper are validated through a numerical example.	directed graph;feedback;freedom of information laws by country;interaction;multi-agent system;numerical analysis;programming paradigm	Hassan Dehghani Aghbolagh;Mohsen Zamani;Zhiyong Chen	2017	2017 11th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2017.8287187	bipartite graph;control theory;multi-agent system;computer science	AI	64.11240688131633	4.875058696208225	151685

These conditions are applied to cubic-phase coupling detection, stressing the study of nonergodic signals and possible strategies to study them. Numerical examples to illustrate these conditions for cubic phase coupling detection and separation of mixed signals using independent component analysis (ICA) methods are also showed in this paper.	cubic function;ergodicity;independent component analysis;stationary process	David Blanco;Diego P.

In particular, performance restrictions in the frequency domain due to the non-negativity constraint are investigated. It is shown that the gain drop in the frequency response near zero frequency affects the response over the entire frequency spectrum. The passband and stopband gains are shown to be severely limited. It is further shown that stopband and passband locations can be chosen freely with the exception of a mandatory passband around zero.

A constrained approximation technique is proposed for adaptively designing pulses so that they approximate target frequency characteristics. At the cost of using eleven shifted B-splines, an example set of four pulses conforming to the FCC spectral mask is obtained.	analogue electronics;approximation algorithm;b-spline;bandlimiting;basis function;converge;digital filter;first-order predicate;polynomial;spectral mask;spline (mathematics);ultra-wideband	Mitsuhiro Matsuo;Masaru Kamada;Hiromasa Habuchi	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424604	mathematical optimization;digital filter;computer science;control theory;mathematics	EDA	61.231295543974156	16.198471001532575	152055

However, the appropriate optimization (search) algorithms are still being pursuit by researchers since different aspects about the effectiveness of such algorithms have to be addressed on different circumstances. In this paper, we focus on the two popular source localization methods for wideband acoustic signals, namely the alternating projection (AP) algorithm and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We explore the respective limitations of these two methods and design a new hybrid approach thereupon. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the trade-off can be achieved between the computational complexity and the localization accuracy using our newly proposed scheme. Moreover, we present the new robustness analysis for the source localization algorithms. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) involving the source spectral estimation error and thus prove that the new hybrid algorithm is more efficient than the EM algorithm. By employing the Gaussianity test, we also quantify the statistical mismatch between the actual statistics of the sensor signals and the underlying Gaussian model. We show that the Gaussianity measure can be a reliable robustness figure for source localization.	acoustic cryptanalysis;computation;computational complexity theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;global positioning system;hybrid algorithm;internationalization and localization;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;simulation;spectral density estimation	Kun Yan;Hsiao-Chun Wu;S.

In this paper, a formulation and new design algorithm are introduced for two-band low-delay lter banks. The formulation is related to that of two-band lattice lter banks and provides a broad range of design exibility within a compact framework.

We also apply Voelcker's results on demodulation of analytic SSB signals by an AM detector. Exploiting the duality of the Fourier-Stieltjes transform and its inverse, we rederive and extend to continuous one-dimensional signals some results concerning the representation of Fourier-transformed discrete time (finite) sequences by partial information such as one bit or complete Fourier phase, Fourier magnitude or signed-magnitude. The duality and interrelationship of characteristics and constraints attributed to time and frequency signal representation create further possibilities of drawing results and interpretations from one- to its counter-domain. In particular, we indicate possible extensions of certain results to problems of N-dimensional signals and to issues of stochastic signals. We also highlight basic issues concerning the structure of signals and their reconstruction from partial information.	signal reconstruction	Shlomo Shamai;Yehoshua Y. Zeevi	1985	IEEE Trans.

9ec8ec7b7eddb494ca4580fc50a71d0fa40b9ab3	phase retrieval algorithm via nonconvex minimization using a smoothing function		Phase retrieval is an inverse problem which consists in recovering an unknown signal from a set of absolute squared projections. Recently, gradient descent algorithms have been developed to solve this problem. However, their optimization cost functions are non-convex and non-smooth. To address the non-smoothness of the cost function, some of these methods use truncation thresholds to calculate a truncated step gradient direction. But, the truncation requires designing parameters to obtain a desired performance in the phase recovery, which drastically modifies the search direction update, increasing the sampling complexity. Therefore, this paper develops the Phase Retrieval Smoothing Conjugate Gradient method (PR-SCG) which uses a smoothing function to retrieve the signal. PR-SCG is based on the smooth-ing projected gradient method which is useful for non-convex optimization problems. PR-SCG uses a nonlinear conjugate gradient of the smoothing function as the search direction to accelerate the convergence. Furthermore, the incremental Stochastic Smoothing Phase Retrieval algorithm (SSPR) is developed. SSPR involves a single equation per iteration which results in a simple, scalable, and fast approach useful when the size of the signal is large. Also, it is shown that SSPR converges linearly to the true signal, up to a global unimodular constant. Additionally, the proposed methods do not require truncation parameters. Simulation results are provided to validate the efficiency of PR-SCG and SSPR compared to existing phase retrieval algorithms. It is shown that PR-SCG and SSPR are able to reduce the number of measurements and iterations to recover the phase, compared with recently developed algorithms.	algorithm;carrier recovery;convex function;convex optimization;gradient descent;iteration;loss function;mathematical optimization;nonlinear conjugate gradient method;nonlinear system;performance rating;phase retrieval;rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);scalability;simulation;smoothing;truncation;unimodular polynomial matrix	Samuel Pinilla;Jorge Bacca;Henry Arguello	2018	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2018.2855667	mathematical optimization;gradient method;control theory;smoothing;inverse problem;mathematics;gradient descent;algorithm;phase retrieval;conjugate gradient method;nonlinear conjugate gradient method;optimization problem	ML	62.16392446623132	11.18877815425565	152719

The computational expense associated with Monte Carlo methods is, however, a concern especially in scenarios requiring real-time processing. In this work, a theoretical model is derived that provides insight on the relationship between performance and computational expense for a Monte Carlo Bayesian compressive sensing algorithm. The theoretical model is shown to accurately describe the practical performance of the algorithm. Additionally, the theoretical model is able to inexpensively project the algorithm's performance characteristics for various SNRs and computational complexity levels. The model is then useful in assessing the method's performance under different operational requirements.	algorithm;analysis of algorithms;compressed sensing;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;real-time web;requirement	Ioannis Kyriakides;Radmila Pribic	2014	2014 IEEE 8th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM)	10.1109/SAM.2014.6882426	monte carlo method in statistical physics;quasi-monte carlo method;econometrics;dynamic monte carlo method;hybrid monte carlo;particle filter;markov chain monte carlo;machine learning;monte carlo molecular modeling;rejection sampling;monte carlo integration;statistics;monte carlo method	ML	54.18626514538783	10.887668827570739	152869

In this method, the reconstruction error appears when the signal does not satisfy the Nyquist condition. This paper proposes a new reconstruction method by using a linear perceptron and multi layer perceptron as FIR filter. The perceptron which has the weights obtained by learning in adapting the original signal suppresses the difference between the reconstructed signal and the original signal even when the Nyquist condition does not stand. Although the proposed method needs weight data, the total data size is much smaller than the ordinary sampling method, as the most suitable reconstruction filter is exclusively adapted to the given sampling data.	artificial neural network;finite impulse response;nyquist rate;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;perceptron;reconstruction filter;sampling (signal processing);shannon (unit);signal reconstruction	A.

It has been proven by Sinopoli et al. that there is a critical observation arrival probability such that the expectation of the estimation error covariance is always finite and the equilibrium of the Modified Algebraic Riccati Equation (MARE) gives an upper bound on the mean covariance matrix. In this paper, we analyze the necessary condition on the existence of equilibrium of the MARE and provide an analytical lower bound on the critical value, below which there is no positive definite equilibrium. In contrast to the lower bound which only depends on the unstable eigenvalues on the system matrix, our analytical lower bound is tighter and depends on both the unstable eigenvalues of the system matrix and the rank of the observation matrix. Moreover, any sub-system can give an analytical lower bound, which also depends on the rank of the sub-system's observation matrix. The simulation results show that our lower bound is very tight.	algebraic riccati equation;algebraic equation;control theory;kalman filter;randomness;simulation	Xiaotong Shen;Daniela Rus;Marcelo H.

In practice, a sufficiently large filter length is utilized in such contexts to avoid a large excess mean square error at steady state, thereby resulting in slower convergence rate and increased computations. In this work we motivate and propose a new diffusion-based variable tap-length algorithm, which is able to track tap-length changes during the convergence process.

In the perceivable area, each agent select links according to the event-triggered function. It is shown that a bound of event-triggered function of each agent is based on the norm of its state. According to the event-triggered function, an adaptive consensus protocol is provided, and a model of SFMAS is obtained. On the basis of vector partial order, several consensus criteria are derived. It is also shown that the consensus of the probability connected SFMAS is mainly dependent on the event-triggered functions, even though the system is influenced by the bounded disturbances.

To this end, assuming that the signal fundamental frequency is known beforehand (i.e., estimated in an independent stage), a complexity-reduced scheme is proposed here. The reduction in complexity is achieved owing to completely new analytical and summarised expressions that enable quick estimation at a low numerical error. The proposed algorithm for the calculation of the unknown parameters requires O((2M)2) flops, while the straightforward solution of the obtained equations takes O((2M)3) flops, where M is number of harmonic coefficients. It is proved that the estimation performance of the proposed algorithm can attain Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios. It is applied in signal reconstruction, spectral estimation, system identification, as well as in other important signal processing problems. The paper investigates the errors related to the signal parameter estimation, and computer simulation demonstrates the accuracy of these algorithms.		Predrag B.

Based on the relative position and the relative velocity information, a novel finite-time consensus protocol is constructed. By using the Lyapnuov finite-time theory, it is shown that the proposed protocol can coordinate the states of agents to guarantee the finite-time consensus under an undirected connected topology. And then we extend the results onto the strongly connected directed communication topology. Importantly, the finite convergence time of the leaderless systems is explicitly presented.

The focus is aimed at the stochastic integration filter, which is based on a stochastic integration rule. It is shown that the covariance matrix of the integration error calculated as a byproduct of the rule can be used as a measure of nonlinearity. The measure informs the user about validity of the assumptions of Gaussianity, which is adopted by the stochastic integration filter. It is also demonstrated how to use this information for a prediction of the number of remaining iterations of the rule. The paper also focuses on utilization of the integration error covariance matrix for improving estimates of the mean square error of the estimates, which is produced by the filter.	algorithm;dynamical system;institute for operations research and the management sciences;iteration;iterative method;mean squared error;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;software release life cycle;source input format	Jindrich Havlik;Ondrej Straka;Jindrich Duník;Jirí Ajgl	2016		10.5220/0005983903530361	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory	ML	57.78674569222034	5.377564096979068	153549

Diffusion adaptation strategies that are based on the least-mean-squares algorithm can be nonrobust against impulsive noise corrupting the measurements. Impulsive noise can degrade stability and steady-state performance, leading to unreliable estimates. In previous work [“Robust adaptation in impulsive noise,” IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 64, no. 11, pp. 2851–2865, Jun. 2016], a robust adaptive algorithm for stand-alone agents was developed, one that semi-parametrically estimates the optimal error nonlinearity jointly with the parameter of interest. Prior knowledge of the impulsive noise distribution was not assumed. In this paper, we extend the framework to solve the problem of robust distributed estimation by a network of agents. Challenges arise due to the coupling among the agents and the distributed nature of the problem. The resulting diffusion strategy is analyzed and its performance illustrated by numerical simulations.	adaptive algorithm;computer simulation;least mean squares filter;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;scalability;semiconductor industry;steady state	Sara Al-Sayed;Abdelhak M.

From the generalization of the  S -method distribution by rotating it in the time–frequency plane, a similar generalization of the  T -class distribution follows readily. The generalized  T -class distribution is then applicable to signals that behave chirp like, with their instantaneous frequency slowly varying around the slope of the chirp; this slope needs no longer be zero, as is the case for the original  T -class distribution, but may take an arbitrary value.

However, there is no explicit solution to a linearization system based on the U2VF. Therefore, this paper proposes a synthesis method to extract A2VFs from the U2VF based on the parallel cascade structure. The mature technique of building a linearization system based on the A2VF can hence be adapted to consort with the U2VF.	loudspeaker;modulation;nonlinear system;pal;parametric array	Chuang Shi;Yoshinobu Kajikawa	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472474	control theory;mathematics	Robotics	61.97220059490519	14.502415026245357	154142

By examining the properties and connections of the so-called multichannel filtering and data selection transforms, we establish a relationship between the identification equations used in the two approaches. Next, it is shown that the least-squares and subspace estimators are identical for the case when there are two subchannels. In general, the two algorithms are different in their utilization of the noise subspace. I. INTRODUCT~ON The so-called blind channel identification, i.e., identifying a channel using only the channel output, has attracted increasing research attention in recent years. Since the publication of [7], several interesting eigenstructure-based approaches [Z], [4] , [5] have been proposed. In some simulations, there is a significant performance improvement over the algorithm proposed in 171 and [SI. Much of the performance gain can be credited to the exploitation of the special structure of the so-called filtering transform. Under the identifiability condition [6]-[SI, the first two such algorithms are the subspace approach (SS) proposed by Moulines et al. [3], [5] and the least-squares approach (LS) proposed in [2]. Slock also derived similar results using linear prediction techniques [SI. The SS method is based on the following two key results: i) The signal subspace uniquely determines the channel impulse response, and ii) the channel vector is orthogonal to the filtering transform of the noise subspace. The LS approach, on the other hand, is derived by the exploiting the single-input multiple-output nature of the identification procedure. In this correspondence, we investigate connections between the SS and LS approaches. Assuming that the same data window is used, the LS and SS approaches can be derived from the same covariance matrix of the channel outputs. The identification equations and the uniqueness of their solutions are shown in the same framework. The approach presented here offers a unified view of the two methods. The second result of this paper is to show that the two estimators are in fact identical for the special case involving two subchannels. This case is of particular importance since it corresponds to the T/Z-fractionally sampled channel that is popular in communication applications. Differences betweeii the two approaches are also revealed in our new derivation.	algorithm;channel state information;least squares;signal subspace;simulation	Hanks H. Zeng;Lang Tong	1996	IEEE Trans.

A characteristics of kernel-based techniques is that they deal with kernel expansions whose number of terms is equal to the number of input data, making them unsuitable for online applications. Kernel-based adaptive filtering algorithms generally rely on a two-stage process at each iteration: a model order control stage that limits the increase in the number of terms by including only valuable kernels into the so-called dictionary, and a filter parameter update stage. It is surprising to note that most existing strategies for dictionary update can only incorporate new elements into the dictionary. This unfortunately means that they cannot discard obsolete kernel functions, within the context of a time-varying environment in particular. Recently, to remedy this drawback, it has been proposed to associate an ℓ1-norm regularization criterion with the mean-square error criterion. The aim of this paper is to provide theoretical results on the convergence of this approach.	adaptive filter;algorithm;dictionary;iteration;kernel (operating system);machine learning;manifold regularization;mean squared error;taxicab geometry	Wei Gao;Jie Chen;Cédric Richard;Jianguo Huang;Rémi Flamary	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638763	kernel;adaptive filter;computer vision;kernel method;mathematical optimization;kernel embedding of distributions;radial basis function kernel;kernel adaptive filter;kernel principal component analysis;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;iterative method;variable kernel density estimation;polynomial kernel;statistics;kernel smoother	Vision	60.95873440963535	12.151142069276311	154478

Since FxLMS algorithm appears to be the best choice as a controller filter, researchers tend to improve performance of ANC systems by enhancing and modifying this algorithm. In this paper, modification is done in the existing FxLMS algorithm that provides a new structure for improving the tracking performance and convergence rate. The secondary signal y(n) is dynamic thresholded by Wavelet transform to improve tracking. The convergence rate is improved by dynamically varying the step size of the error signal.	algorithm;control system;international standard serial number;rate of convergence;stationary wavelet transform	Pallavi Babu;A.

To deal with the optimization problem with projection uncertainties, we propose a distributed continuous-time dynamical protocol based on a new concept of approximate projection. Here each agent can only obtain an approximate projection point on the boundary of its convex set, and communicate with its neighbors over a time-varying communication graph. First, we show that no matter how large the approximate angle is, the system states are always bounded for any initial condition, and uniformly bounded with respect to all initial conditions if the inferior limit of the stepsize is greater than zero. Then, in the two cases, nonempty intersection and empty intersection of convex sets, we provide stepsize and approximate angle conditions to ensure the optimal convergence, respectively. Moreover, we give some characterizations about the optimal solutions for the empty intersection case and also present the convergence error between agents’ estimates and the optimal point in the case of constant stepsizes and approximate angles.	approximation algorithm;combinatorial optimization;convex analysis;convex set;graph theory;initial condition;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;optimization problem	Youcheng Lou;Yiguang Hong;Shouyang Wang	2016	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2016.02.019	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;dykstra's projection algorithm;mathematics	Theory	64.37543067103076	6.979380605726755	154808

The resulting filtering system is polynomial in state and linear in observations. The obtained optimal filter for the extended state vector also serves as the optimal identifier for the unknown parameters. Performance of the designed optimal state filter and parameter identifier is verified for both, positive and negative, parameter values.	identifier;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;polynomial;quantum state;simulation;stochastic process;system of polynomial equations;wiener filter	Michael V.

Assuming a time-invariant undirected network topology for the sensors, we present a suboptimal solution that guarantees minimum overall energy cost of mobility and communication for the sensors to achieve consensus. The design procedure of the distributed control protocol is composed of two steps. The first step yields the local feedback gain via solving a linear quadratic regulating (LQR) problem, while the second step produces the network feedback gain based on convex optimization technique. The results are extended to formation control problems with and without communication delays. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated by numerical examples.	sensor	Ge Guo;Yuan Zhao;Guoqing Yang	2014	Inf.

The partial model occurs frequently in situations in which the ideal synthesis model has been truncated by a time-varying mask in order to exclude unwanted signal components or when knowledge of the true time or frequency support of the ideal model is unknown. A cross-Wigner-distribution (CWD) synthesis algorithm is developed from the weighted-least-square error criterion and compared with existing Wigner distribution (WD) synthesis algorithms. The algorithm is also shown to be useful when interference or cross terms hinder the use of the quadratic auto-Wigner-distribution (AWD) for signal synthesis. >	algorithm;modified wigner distribution function	T.

The greater design freedom available makes possible the construction of wavelets with a high degree of smoothness, in comparison with orthonormal wavelet bases. Grobner bases are used to obtain the solutions to the nonlinear design equations. Following the dual-tree DWT of Kingsbury, one goal is to keep the redundancy-factor bounded by 2, instead of allowing it to grow as it does for the undecimated DWT (which is exactly shift-invariant). For the tight frame presented here, optimal-tree based denoising algorithms can be directly applied.	algorithm;discrete wavelet transform;filter bank;frame (linear algebra);gröbner basis;iteration;noise reduction;nonlinear system	Ivan W.

The authors apply an inverse problem formulation, presenting an integrated design to quadratic (l/sub 2/) and least absolute value (l/sub 1/) beamformers. The general solution of the l/sub 2/ beamformers is parameterized by a regularizing parameter that weights the confidence placed by the designer on prior knowledge versus the quality of the measurements. This regularizing parameter is used to establish an equivalence between alternative l/sub 2/ beamformers. The authors then develop time-recursive implementations of the l/sub 2/ and l/sub 1/ beamformers. The performance of these beamformers is studied next. The authors show that 1) in the presence of correlated arrivals, the MMSE beamformer uses constructively the correlation between incoming signals in reconstructing the estimated field, while rejecting the uncorrelated returns, and 2) the l/sub 1/ beamformer has the ability to adjust itself to unexpected noise conditions because it is considerably more robust than the l/sub 2/ beamformers to unmodeled impulsive noise or to the occurrence of malfunctioning sensors.

These processes exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics and coupling between the dimensions, which make their component-wise processing by multiple univariate LMS, bivariate complex LMS (CLMS), or multichannel LMS (MLMS) algorithms inadequate. The QLMS accounts for these problems naturally, as it is derived directly in the quaternion domain. The analysis shows that QLMS operates inherently based on the so called ldquoaugmentedrdquo statistics, that is, both the covariance E{ xx H} and pseudocovariance E{ xx T} of the tap input vector x are taken into account. In addition, the operation in the quaternion domain facilitates fusion of heterogeneous data sources, for instance, the three vector dimensions of the wind field and air temperature.

We first address the problem of expressing the covariance matrix of nonsymmetrical half-plane, noncausal, and quarter-plane MA random fields in terms of the model parameters. Assuming the random field is Gaussian, we derive a closed-form expression for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the error variance in jointly estimating the model parameters. A computationally efficient algorithm for estimating the parameters of the MA model is developed. The algorithm initially fits a 2-D autoregressive model to the observed field and then uses the estimated parameters to compute the MA model. A maximum-likelihood algorithm for estimating the MA model parameters is also presented. The performance of the proposed algorithms is illustrated by Monte-Carlo simulations and is compared with the Cramer-Rao bound.	estimation theory	Joseph M.

For a discrete linear repetitive process (LRP) assumed to be stable along the pass, our attention is focused on the design of a reduced-order filter, which guarantees the filtering error process to be stable along the pass, and minimizes an upper bound for the H2 norm of its transfer function. Two different approaches are proposed to solve the reduced-order H2 filtering problem: one is the convex linearization approach and the other is the projection approach.

Linearization of loudspeaker system is generally realized by a Volterra filter. However, Volterra filter has a problem of requiring a huge computational complexity. The Simplified Volterra Filter (SVF), which removes the lines along the main diagonal of the 2ndorder Volterra kernel, has been previously proposed as a way to reduce the computational complexity while maintaining the compensation performance for the nonlinear distortion. However, this method cannot greatly reduce the computational complexity. Hence, we propose a subband linearization system which consists of a subband parallel cascade realization method for the 2nd-order Volterra kernel and subband linear inverse filter. Experimental results show that this proposed linearization system can produce the same compensation ability as the conventional method while reducing the computational complexity.	computational complexity theory;distortion;inverse filter;loudspeaker;nonlinear system;serial vector format	Yoshinobu Kajikawa	2008	2008 16th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	61.245048597565585	14.265063672828589	156021

The agents aim to collectively track the minimum of the sum of locally known time-varying convex functions by exchanging information between the neighbors. We focus on scenarios when the communication among the agents is described by a directed network. We devise an algorithm with a discrete time-sampling scheme such that the distance between any agent estimate and time-varying optimal solutions converges to a steady state error bound whose size is related to the constant step-size and the sampling interval. The convergence rate is shown to be linear given that the objective function is strongly-convex.

This nonlinear filter is obtained by choosing at each moment, on the basis of the observations, one of a finite number of Kalman-type filters driven by a suitable nonlinear transformation of the “innovations.” As a byproduct we obtain also the asymptotic identification of the a priori unknown observation noise disturbance. By yielding an asymptotically efficient filter in face of an unknown observation noise, our approach may also be viewed as a robust approach to filtering for linear models.	approximation;linear model;nonlinear system	Robert Sh.

For any nontrivial channel the approximations for some delay values are poor. If a Bussgang algorithm is initialized with these weights it misconverges. A Monte-Carlo simulation created misconvergence as predicted. We propose the variance constraint (VC) algorithms that have more robust convergence properties than the Bussgang algorithms. The VC cost functions are similar to the well-known Godard cost functions. They incorporate estimates of the channel-equalizer overall gain and use a linear constraint on the weights. These two modifications push the bad stable points farther away in weight space from the stable points with good performance (i.e., low intersymbol interference). A Monte-Carlo simulation of nearly 2000 channels shows no misconvergence.		Michael J.

3e624214d2695262952ba90ccdb109c86e9de108	a robust step-size control algorithm for frequency domain acoustic echo cancellation		The presence of near-end interferences and echo path changes make it essential for an adaptive filter to vary its learning rate according to corresponding conditions. In this paper, a robust step-size control algorithm which is based on the optimization of the square of the bin-wise a posteriori error is proposed. To prevent the adaptive filter from diverging in the presence of interferences, constraints on the filter update are applied. The learning rate expression is derived and then we extend the method to multidelay block frequency domain adaptive filter (MDF) so as to meet the demand of low delay in practical application. An updating strategy for the constraints is proposed as well. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, especially in double-talk and echo path change situations.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;echo suppression and cancellation;mathematical optimization;multidelay block frequency domain adaptive filter	Chao Wu;Kaiyu Jiang;Yanmeng Guo;Qiang Fu;Yonghong Yan	2014			adaptive filter;multidelay block frequency domain adaptive filter;kernel adaptive filter;computer science	Vision	60.889499088112565	12.237930980494854	156797

Unlike other approaches which make use of a lattice structure or a cascade algorithm, we show that our technique provides a direct explicit expression of all FIR orthogonal filters, with no need of iteration procedures. Thus, in order to design a L-tap 2-channel paraunitary filterbank, it suffices to choose L/2 independent parameters, and introduce them in a simple expression which provides the filter coefficients directly. Some examples illustrate how this new approach can be used for designing filters with certain desired properties.	cascade algorithm;coefficient;computational complexity theory;crystal structure;filter bank;finite impulse response;iteration;monomial	María Elena Domínguez Jiménez	2005			filter bank;electronic engineering;mathematics;communication channel	Graphics	59.537902411989606	17.594006755313057	157557

To handle the noise it is of great advantage to know the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially in situations with changing noise conditions. In this paper we present a new approach for estimating the SNR during an impulse response measurement by means of the so-called sliding window correlation (SWiC) as introduced in this paper.

In this paper, we propose a subspace-based adaptive MCEQ algorithm with the aim of addressing the problem of high computational complexity involved in the multiple input/output inverse theorem based non-adaptive MCEQ algorithms. In the proposed algorithm, equalization is achieved using multiple sets of inverse filters such that each set of filters corresponds to each subspace and these filters are adaptively estimated using the least-mean-square type algorithm. In order to improve the convergence performance, the sparseness of the estimated Kronecker delta function is used as a constraint to the adaptive algorithm. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed adaptive algorithms yield better equalization with improved convergence performance.	adaptive algorithm;computational complexity theory;dirac delta function;input/output;mpeg multichannel;neural coding;simulation	Rajan S.

A framework for analyzing such systems was proposed in [1] and called Kalman filtering with intermittent observations. The performance of such a system, i.e., the error covariance matrix, is governed by the solution of a matrix-valued random Riccati recursion. Unfortunately, to date, the tools for analyzing such recursions are woefully lacking, ostensibly because the recursions are both nonlinear and random, and hence intractable if one wants to analyze them exactly. In this paper, we extend some of the large random matrix techniques first introduced in [2], [3] to Kalman filtering with intermittent observations. For systems with a stable system matrix and i.i.d. time-varying measurement matrices, we obtain explicit equations that allow one to compute the asymptotic eigendistribution of the error covariance matrix. Simulations show excellent agreement between the theoretical and empirical results for systems with as low as n = 10, 20 states. Extending the results to unstable system matrices and time-invariant measurement matrices is currently under investigation.	computer simulation;control theory;distribution (mathematics);dynamical system;kalman filter;lossy compression;nonlinear system;recursion;steady state;time-invariant system	Ali Vakili;Babak Hassibi	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5400386	kalman filter;stochastic process;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	59.488279969968104	4.6700783226480524	158772

The computational complexity of adaptation algorithms such as the NLMS algorithm is proportional to the filter length, which means that for long filters the adaptation task can become prohibitively expensive. The purpose of partial coefficient update is to reduce the computational complexity by adapting a subset of the filter coefficients at every iteration. In this paper we develop selective-partial-update NLMS and AP algorithms based on the principle of minimum disturbance. The algorithms are based on sound theoretical justification and appear to have good convergence performance as attested to by computer simulations with real speech signals.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;echo suppression and cancellation;least mean squares filter	Kutluyil Dogançay;Oguz Tanrikulu	2000		10.1109/ICASSP.2000.862007	computer simulation;adaptive filter;computer vision;mathematical optimization;speech recognition;computer science;speech processing;mathematics	Vision	60.525353670740046	13.352726308042307	159633

A distributed control law with time-varying gains is proposed to make the position states of both first-order and second-order agents mean-square converge to a common point and the velocities of second-order agents mean-square converge to zero, while their velocities remain in the corresponding nonconvex constraint sets.

We study in parallel the dynamic convergence behavior of three blind equalization algorithms: the multimodulus algorithm (MMA), the constant modulus algorithm (CMA), and the reduced constellation algorithm (RCA). Using a conditional Gaussian approximation, we first derive the theoretical mean-squared-error (MSE) trajectory for MMA. This analysis leads to accurate but somewhat cumbersome expressions. Alternatively, we apply a Taylor series approximation to derive MSE trajectories for MMA, CMA, and RCA. This approach yields simpler but somewhat less accurate expressions. For the steady-state operation, however, we derive even simpler formulas that accurately predict the asymptotic MSE values. We finally study the convergence rates of the three blind algorithms using their theoretical MSE trajectories, computer simulations, and a laboratory experiment.	algorithm;approximation;blind equalization;cma-es;computer simulation;mean squared error;modulus of continuity;multipoint ground;point-to-multipoint communication;steady state	Lee M.

The convergence properties are analyzed and we derive the exact convergence rate and an upper bound for a simple single-input single-output system with filter length . Finally, this upper bound is used to derive an approximation of the convergence rate for systems of arbitrary length. Implementation-wise, the method has the advantage of being numerically stable and straight forward to extend to the multiple-input multiple-output case. Furthermore, due to the existence of fast QL-factorization methods, it is possible to compute the filters efficiently.	all-pass filter;approximation;mimo;minimum phase;numerical stability;rate of convergence;time-invariant system	Morten Hansen;Lars P.

0b007f5e9ad1c8cadd2f02983c8f6775af99adc1	za-apa with zero attractor controller selection criterion for sparse system identification		The zero attraction affine projection algorithm (ZA-APA) is one of the sparse APAs that are based on (l_{1})-norm penalty function. It provides faster convergence and lower steady-state error than the conventional APA when the system is sparse. Most of the analysis for attraction-type APA is normally based on white Gaussian assumption for the input. In this paper, a detailed performance analysis of the ZA-APA is performed using individual weight error variance (IWV) method. Using the IWV method, the condition for the convergence in mean and mean square error sense and the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) error based on non-Gaussian input assumption is derived. Theoretical derivation reveals that the value of zero attractor controller plays a key role in the final steady-state error. Hence, a selection criterion for zero attractor controller based on the steady-state MSD error is proposed. Finally, simulations are performed to validate the analysis made in the context of unknown system identification.	sparse matrix;system identification;zonealarm	S.

These algorithms are: the Adaptive Line Enhancer (ALE), the Gradient Adaptive Lattice Structure, and the Adaptive Least—Squares Predictor. Least squares algorithms have been developed by Morf et al[la]. More recently, Satorius incorporated the lattice form of the algorithm in a decision directed equalizer. This investigation is concerned with an analysis of the performance of the above adaptive algorithms when the random process being observed is composed of sinusoids in additive noise. In particular, the problem of estimating and resolving the sinusoidal frequencies is considered. In addition, such performance properties as, signal—to—noise ratio (SNR) and convergence constants are also discussed. This comparison is done through a computer simulation and results indicate the relative advantage of adaptive least—squares algorithm.	additive white gaussian noise;algorithm;autoregressive model;computer simulation;equalization (communications);gradient;kerrison predictor;least squares;signal-to-noise ratio;stochastic process;utility functions on indivisible goods	Kevin Buckley;S.

The traditional analysis techniques which are used to model this estimator obscure this, restricting the estimator to the finite set of data sufficient to span the length of its filter. The finite Wiener filter is thus often considered a bound on the performance of the LMS estimator. Several papers have reported the performance of the LMS filter exceeding that of the finite Wiener filter. In this paper, we will demonstrate a bound on the LMS estimator, which does not exclude the contributions from data outside its filter length, and which demonstrates the ability of the LMS estimator to outperform the finite Wiener filter in certain cases.	file spanning;least mean squares filter;nonlinear system;wiener filter	Kevin J.

062f52fd4decb5a14382d8dca7839e1ebc8e7e4b	structural target controllability of undirected networks		In this paper, we study the target controllability problem of networked dynamical systems, in which we are tasked to steer a subset of network states towards a desired objective. More specifically, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the structural target controllability problem of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with symmetric state matrices, such as undirected dynamical networks with unknown link weights. To achieve our goal, we first characterize the generic rank of symmetrically structured matrices, as well as the modes of any numerical realization. Subsequently, we provide a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition for the structural controllability of undirected networks with multiple control nodes. Finally, we derive a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition for structural target controllability of undirected networks. Remarkably, apart from the standard reachability condition, only local topological information is needed for the verification of structural target controllability.

This paper describes an approach to robust measurement of time intervals in the presence of interference. This approach is based on modeling the distribution of the measurement results as a Gaussian-uniform mixture. A batch maximum-likelihood and a recursive particle filtering estimator are implemented, which incorporate the above model. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are evaluated by numerical simulations and by comparison with the Cramér-Rao lower bound. Finally, as a case study, the approach is applied to the experimental data obtained from an in-house developed ultrawideband time-interval measurement system.	computer simulation;elegant degradation;instrumentation (computer programming);interference (communication);interval arithmetic;level of measurement;mixture model;numerical analysis;particle filter;radar;recursion;sensor;simulation;system of measurement;ultra-wideband	Alessio De Angelis;Guido De Angelis;Paolo Carbone	2015	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2015.2469434	econometrics;mathematical optimization;particle filter;computer science;mixture model;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics;robustness;monte carlo method	Metrics	54.28027584723198	5.18287715361261	161421

This algorithm is based on an extension of the consensus algorithm able to synchronize a family of double integrators. Since the various clocks may have different drifts, the algorithm needs to be designed so that it can work also in case of heterogeneous double integrators. Through a robust control analysis it is possible to determine the maximum admissible level of heterogeneity yielding synchronization. The first part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of an unrealistic synchronous implementation of the algorithm. However, in the last part of the paper we propose a realistic pseudo-synchronous implementation which is proved to be a perturbation of the synchronous one. From arguments related the center manifold theorem, the stability of the pseudo-synchronous is finally proved.	chandra–toueg consensus algorithm;clock synchronization;distributed algorithm;linear system;numerical analysis;perturbation theory;robust control	Ruggero Carli;Sandro Zampieri	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5717128	control engineering;clock synchronization;synchronization;distributed algorithm;computer science;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing	Embedded	65.8364547984682	5.368800006743669	161859

An exact expression is derived for the characteristic function of the weight vector at time n+1, conditioned on the weight vector at time n. The conditional characteristic function is expanded in a Taylor series and averaged over the unknown weight density to yield a first-order partial differential-difference equation in the unconditioned characteristic function of the weight vector. The equation is approximately solved for small values of the adaption parameter and the weights are shown to be jointly Gaussian with time-varying mean vector and covariance matrix given as the solution to well-known difference equations for the weight vector mean and covariance matrix. The theoretical results are applied to analyzing the use of the weights in detection and time delay estimation.

Using local subspaces reduces the dimensionality of each subspace and enables larger speedups. Transitions between local subspaces require special care and updating the reduced bases associated with each subspace increases the accuracy of the reduced-order model. In the present work, local reduced basis updates are considered in the case of hyper-reduction, for which only the components of state vectors and reduced bases defined at specific grid points are available. To enable local reduced basis updates, two comprehensive approaches are proposed. The first one is based on an offline/online decomposition. The second approach relies on an approximated metric acting only on those components where the state vector is defined. This metric is computed offline and used online to update the local bases. An analysis of the error associated with this approximated metric is then conducted and it is shown that the metric has a kernel interpretation. Finally, the application of the proposed approaches to the model reduction of two nonlinear physical systems illustrates their potential for achieving large speedups and good accuracy.	approximation algorithm;dimensionality reduction;nonlinear system;online and offline;quantum state	David Amsallem;Matthew J.

690a19b87991d1c5d8d5dc0ebd9dbe967aea86b1	distributed edge-variant graph filters		The main challenges distributed graph filters face in practice are the communication overhead and computational complexity. In this work, we extend the state-of-the-art distributed finite impulse response (FIR) graph filters to an edge-variant (EV) version, i.e., a filter where every node weights the signals from its neighbors with different values. Besides having the potential to reduce the filter order leading to amenable communication and complexity savings, the EV graph filter generalizes the class of classical and node-variant FIR graph filters. Numerical tests validate our findings and illustrate the potential of the EV graph filters to (i) approximate a user-provided frequency response; and (ii) implement distributed consensus with much lower orders than its direct contenders.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;consensus (computer science);extended validation certificate;finite impulse response;frequency response;overhead (computing)	Mario Coutino;Elvin Isufi;Geert Leus	2017	2017 IEEE 7th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2017.8313105	mathematical optimization;computational complexity theory;finite impulse response;matrix decomposition;frequency response;symmetric matrix;filter design;graph;consensus;mathematics	Visualization	63.20307607718758	10.157113434986073	162620

The nonstationary signals are modeled as rational processes with timevarying parameters. The spectral matching approach, which was introduced by Friedlander and Porat, is generalized to the nonstationary case and two new estimators, namely, the time-varying spectral matching estimator (TVSME) and the time–frequency spectral matching estimator (TFSME) are proposed. The proposed methods estimate the parameters of the time-varying rational model by fitting the parametric spectrum expression to an estimated time–frequency distribution of the signal. An approximate statistical analysis is given for both methods along with computer simulation results, illustrating the performance of the proposed estimators.	approximation algorithm;computer simulation;spectral density estimation;spectral method;time–frequency representation	Ali Kaderli;A.

It is known that for ARMAX and ARARX models, providing a large enough Signal-to-Noise-Ratio(SNR) will avoid the potential local convergence. We show the same condition can be extended to ARARMAX models in this paper. To ease the application of this condition, the exact value of such SNR needs to be quantified.

This device incorporates accurate time measurement with pulse counting. It is shown that the accuracy of velocity measurement in real implementations is significantly poorer than indicated previously. Encoder nonidealities are found to introduce a bias in the measured velocity output. A significant rms output error can also result. The insensitivity of the error to the form of the encoder noise model is demonstrated, and two analyses of differing complexity are presented. These permit calculation of the tachometer error measures, based on a knowledge of the magnitude of the error characteristics of the encoder. This facilitates the implementation of a compensation function that will reduce the influence of the bias. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the existence of the bias, verify the validity of the derived formulae, and show the benefit to be gained by compensation.		Richard C.

Our formalism applies to an extended class of convolution-based signal approximation techniques, which includes interpolation, generalized sampling with prefiltering, and the projectors encountered in wavelet theory. We claim that we can predict theL-approximation error by integrating the spectrum of the function to approximate—not necessarily bandlimited—against a frequency kernelE(!) that characterizes the approximation operator. This prediction is easier yet more precise than was previously available. Our approach has the remarkable property of providing a global error estimate that is the average of the true approximation error over all possible shifts of the input function. Our error prediction is exact for stationary processes, as well as for bandlimited signals. We apply this method to the comparison of standard interpolation and approximation techniques. Our method has interesting implications for approximation theory. In particular, we use our results to obtain some new asymptotic expansions of the error asT ! 0, as well as to derive improved upper bounds of the kind found in the Strang–Fix theory. We finally show how we can design quasi-interpolators that are near optimal in the least-squares sense.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;approximation theory;bandlimiting;convolution;fourier analysis;interpolation;least squares;movie projector;sampling (signal processing);semantics (computer science);stationary process;wavelet	Thierry Blu;Michael Unser	1999	IEEE Trans.

First, using perturbed Liapunov function methods, mean-square error estimates are obtained for the tracking error. Then using recent results on two-time-scale Markov chains, mean ordinary differential equation and diffusion approximation results are obtained. It is shown that a sequence of the centered tracking errors converges to an ordinary differential equation. Moreover, a suitably scaled sequence of the tracking errors converges weakly to a diffusion process. It is also shown that iterate averaging of the tracking algorithm results in optimal asymptotic convergence rate in an appropriate sense. Two application examples, analysis of the performance of an adaptive multiuser detection algorithm in a direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) system, and tracking analysis of the state of a hidden Markov model (HMM) with infrequent jumps, are presented.	algorithm;approximation;hidden markov model;iteration;least mean squares filter;markov chain;mean squared error;multi-user;rate of convergence	Gang George Yin;Vikram Krishnamurthy	2005	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2005.850075	adaptive filter;markov chain;mathematical optimization;least mean squares filter;computer science;hidden semi-markov model;control theory;mathematics;markov model;hidden markov model;statistics	Vision	59.77188965129025	5.28582515911229	163117

Here, following [29], cluster consensus is defined in two aspects: intra-cluster synchronization, which means that the state differences among agents in the same cluster asymptotically converge to zero, and inter-cluster separation, which means the states of the agents in different clusters are separated. Under the inter-cluster common influence condition and with adapted inter-cluster identical inputs, the stability of cluster consensus is proved by extending the existing concepts and approaches in the matrix and graph theories to the cluster cases. The adapted inputs are also required to separate different clusters (or called inter-cluster separation). For the graph of the network, both static and switching topologies are considered. Numerical simulation to verify the theoretical results is given, too.	algebraic graph theory;consensus (computer science);converge;numerical analysis;numerical method;simulation;the matrix	Yujuan Han;Wenlian Lu;Tianping Chen	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426981	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;stability;numerical analysis;graph theory;mathematics;distributed computing;statistics	DB	64.78824277107208	5.925297927479127	163654

We use an algebraic approach which allows us to define the existence conditions of a left inverse, for a nonlinear system and therefore the equalization conditions. These existence conditions need the computation of the rank of some jacobian matrices. This approach is applied to a Volterra filter, which represents a nonlinear system. We will show also that these equalizability conditions depend to the coefficients of the nonlinear system and input values therefore we can verify for any channel with assumed known coefficients if this system is ideally equalizable or not. The appropriate algorithm that we have used to test the performance of the equalization is the APA (Affine Projection Algorithm). The choice of APA is justified by the use of a colored excitation signal as an input signal due to the nonlinear channel characteristics.	adaptive algorithm;adaptive equalizer;algorithm;channel (communications);coefficient;computation;equalization (communications);jacobian matrix and determinant;linear algebra;nonlinear system;simulation	Hichem Arfa;Sadok El Asmi;Safya Belghith	2006	2006 14th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics	ML	63.484948187593176	13.708027390762425	163717

In both mathematical analysis and numerical simulation, we prove that the algorithm guarantees an uncrowded flocking behavior with asymptotical velocity synchronization when sufficiently intensive communication exists within the agents. Moreover, we provide the conditions for collision avoidance along the whole transient procedure. The proposed flocking model has its references in natural collective behaviors like escaping panic and traffic jam motions.	algorithm;asymptote;british informatics olympiad;collision detection;computer simulation;flock;flocking (behavior);jam;multi-agent system;velocity (software development)	Zhiyong Chen;Hai-Tao Zhang;Chao Zhai	2010	2010 11th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision	10.1109/ICARCV.2010.5707221	control engineering;synchronization;simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;control theory	Robotics	65.40047451033199	7.14383551188539	164424

In this paper, we propose an effective alternative that distributes a pre-defined addition budget to the multiplier-less FIR filters, which takes into account the common sub-expression sharing inside the computations. We successfully integrate a heuristic common sub-expression elimination (CSE) algorithm and the coefficient quantization by successive approximation proposed by Li et al. Besides, we also propose an improved search algorithm for an optimal scale factor to settle the coefficients collectively into the quantization space. Simulation results show that CSE effectively reduces 29.1%~31.5% budgets for comparable filter responses. Besides, the improved scale factor exploration helps to find an identical or a better (never worse) quantization result with only 32.67%~44.53% run time, whether or not CSE is applied.	approximation;coefficient;computation;digital filter;filter design;finite impulse response;heuristic;quantization (signal processing);rounding;run time (program lifecycle phase);search algorithm;simulation	Tay-Jyi Lin;Tsung-Hsun Yang;Chein-Wei Jen	2003		10.1109/ISCAS.2003.1206222	adaptive filter;network synthesis filters;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;digital filter;quantization;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;finite impulse response;root-raised-cosine filter;linear filter;mathematics;filter design;prototype filter;half-band filter	AI	61.398576644694124	18.13665187075958	164627

This algorithm includes a two-stage adaptive orthogonalization which greatly reduces nonuniform convergence effects. Significantly improved convergence characteristics compared with direct-form implementations are achieved. Furthermore, the system has a fairly simple structure and a relatively low computational burden. The proposed implementation is especially attractive in those applications in which the error signal needs to be minimized, such as echo canceling. In system identification problems, however, some additional offline processing needs to be performed to transform the lattice reflection coefficients into direct-form filter coefficients. >		Peter M.

Instead of using a gradient decent procedure-with its inherent problem of becoming trapped in local minima of a nonquadratic cost function-two eigenstructure algorithms are proposed. Both algorithms feature a priori bounds on the output variance at any convergent point, which, based on simulations, lead to solutions that lie acceptably close to a global minimum point of an output variance objective function. Moreover, a sufficient condition for such stationary points based on fixed-point theory is shown. It is shown that the convergence rate of both algorithms increases as the separation of eigenvalues of the input covariance matrix increases.

Given a fixed observation point, it is desired to find sufficient graphical conditions under which the failure of a set of edges in the network information flow digraph is distinguishable from another set. When the latter is empty, this corresponds to the detectability of the former link set given the response of the observing agent. In developing the results, a powerful extension of the all-minors matrix tree theorem in algebraic graph theory is proved which relates the minors of the transformed Laplacian of a directed graph to the number and length of the shortest paths between its vertices. The results reveal an intricate relationship between the ability to distinguish the responses of a healthy and a faulty multi-agent network and the inter-nodal paths in their information flow digraphs. The results have direct implications for the operation and design of multi-agent systems subject to multiple link losses. Simulations and examples are presented to illustrate the analytic findings.	algebraic graph theory;coefficient;computer simulation;degree of a polynomial;directed graph;graphical user interface;kirchhoff's theorem;linear algebra;multi-agent system;shortest path problem;vertex (geometry)	Mohammad Amin Rahimian;Amir Ajorlou;Amir G.

But this approach is not suitable in certain applications. In this paper, it is conjectured that if some messages are confined to a ball around their initialized values, then initialization can be avoided. Towards this goal, for networks specified with a bipartite graph, a variant of the sum-product algorithm is derived by adding an inequality constraint on the variable free energy in the underlying Bethe optimization problem. In the binary case, this leads to an upper bound that restricts the ℓ1 norm of the extrinsic message (vector) to a ball around its (otherwise) initial value. Results are reported for binary LDPC decoders through simulations which confirm that initialization between decoding attempts can be eliminated and show that the algorithm tends to outperform the standard sum-product. A few more observations and comments on this approach, relation with other variational methods, and applications to analog processing and inference over distributed networks are outlined in the end.	algorithm;analog-to-digital converter;belief propagation;calculus of variations;graphical model;iterative method;low-density parity-check code;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;simulation;social inequality;taxicab geometry;variational inequality;variational message passing	Murthy V.

8d982328efbcac0071e373fdd00dc2c631136dc3	nonuniform sampling theorems for bandlimited signals in the offset linear canonical transform		Nonuniform sampling is an important kind of sampling, which arises in various real applications due to imperfect timebase or random events. As the offset linear canonical transform (OLCT) has shown to be a powerful tool for optics and signal processing, it is therefore worthwhile and interesting to explore the nonuniform sampling theorems for deterministic signals and random signals in the OLCT domain. In this paper, we address the problem of the nonuniform sampling of deterministic signals and random signals associated with the OLCT. First, some special nonuniform sampling models are briefly introduced. Then, the reconstruction theorems for deterministic signals from these nonuniform samples in the OLCT domain have been obtained. In addition, by applying the results, the nonuniform sampling theorems for random signals in the OLCT domain also have been derived. Finally, the simulation results are presented to show the advantages and effectiveness of the methods.	bandlimiting;linear canonical transformation;nonuniform sampling	Shuiqing Xu;Lei Huang;Yi Chai;Yigang He	2018	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-018-0803-y	bandlimiting;mathematical optimization;mathematics;signal processing;sampling (statistics);nonuniform sampling;offset (computer science)	Crypto	54.80036264386887	16.6524962533045	164736

By defining a common synchronisation manifold for each possible switching topology, exponential synchronisation of a nonlinear networked system can be assessed by the exponential stability of a reduced nonlinear system corresponding to the concerned system, wherein the communication graph can be directed and weighted and the inner-linking matrix might be singular. In particular, a synchronisation criterion consisting of the self-dynamics of isolated nodes and the consensus dynamics of a linear switched system is given. Two numerical simulations of synchronisation are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the analytical results for the periodic and random switching cases.	nonlinear system	Lei Wang;Qing-Guo Wang	2013	Int.

Several examples are presented, confirming the validity of the proposed strategy and indicating that the best solution in terms of the total order of the system should be obtained from the study of each particular case.

The simplicity and the proved convergence of the algorithm make it attractive for this application. The advantages in using the adaptive IIR echo canceller are discussed as well as some remaining problems. Extensive computer simulations show that the IIR canceller performs better than the FIR (finite impulse response) canceller after convergence, although in general the IIR canceller converges more slowly. It is also observed that the order selection of the IIR canceller is crucial in achieving superior performance over FIR cancellers. >	echo suppression and cancellation;infinite impulse response	Hong Fan;W.

Therefore, this paper investigates the positive properties of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). This transform is nearly shift invariant at moderate additional computational cost. However, the straightforward approach of extending the DTCWT to wavelet packets by decomposing the high pass coefficients as well led to non-analytic basis functions. Because analytic basis functions were required for the desired properties, a filter swapping scheme was developed to preserve analyticity. This analytic complex wavelet packet transform showed improved denoising performance for the application of speech enhancement and promises improvements for other applications like general filtering and signal analysis.	algorithmic efficiency;basis function;coefficient;complex wavelet transform;computation;network packet;noise reduction;paging;signal processing;speech enhancement;wavelet packet decomposition	Thomas Weickert;Claus Benjaminsen;Uwe Kiencke	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518348	wavelet;speech recognition;harmonic wavelet transform;second-generation wavelet transform;continuous wavelet transform;signal processing;pattern recognition;cascade algorithm;mathematics;wavelet packet decomposition;stationary wavelet transform;discrete wavelet transform;lifting scheme;wavelet transform	Visualization	57.22083616751844	18.209841054217105	166364

They consist of a linear combination between a morphological/rank filter and a linear filter. A gradient steepest descent method is proposed to optimally design these filters, using the averaged least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. The filter design is viewed as a learning process, and convergence issues are theoretically and experimentally investigated. A systematic approach is proposed to overcome the problem of nondifferentiability of the nonlinear filter component and to improve the numerical robustness of the training algorithm, which results in simple training equations. Image processing applications in system identification and image restoration are also presented, illustrating the simplicity of training MRL-filters and their effectiveness for image/signal processing.	algorithm;circuit restoration;experiment;filter design;gradient descent;image processing;image restoration;kalman filter;least mean squares filter;least-squares analysis;linear iga bullous dermatosis;media resource locator;median filter;nonlinear system;optimal design;robustness (computer science);signal processing;system identification;vergence	Lúcio F.

In contrast to the average value, the median value is a statistical measure inherently robust to the presence of outliers, which is a significant robustness issue in large-scale sensor and multi-agent networks. The proposed protocol requires only binary information regarding the relative state differences among the neighboring agents and achieves consensus on the median value in finite time by exploiting a suitable ad-hoc discontinuous local interaction rule. In addition, we characterize certain resiliency properties of the proposed protocol against the presence of uncooperative agents which do not implement the underlying local interaction rule whereas they interact with their neighbors thus influencing the network. In particular, we prove that despite the persistent influence of (at most) a certain number of uncooperative agents, the cooperative agents achieve finite time consensus on a value lying inside the convex hull of the cooperative agents' initial conditions, provided that the special class of so-called “$k$-safe” network topology is considered. Capabilities of the proposed consensus protocol and its effectiveness are supported by numerical studies.	consensus (computer science);convex hull;hoc (programming language);initial condition;many-worlds interpretation;multi-agent system;network topology;numerical analysis;value (computer science)	Mauro Franceschelli;Alessandro Giua;Alessandro Pisano	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2590602	wireless ad hoc network;communications protocol;simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;distributed computing;robot kinematics;robustness	AI	63.18609981742873	5.960526604745532	166629

The shaped noise transfer function (NTF) is assumed to have infinite impulse response, and the optimization objective is minimizing the maximum magnitude of the NTF over the signal frequency band. By virtue of the GKYP lemma, the optimization of an NTF is converted into a minimization problem subject to quadratic matrix inequalities, and then an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve this alternative minimization problem. Each iteration of the algorithm contains linear matrix inequality constraints only and can be effectively solved by the existing numerical software packages. Moreover, specifications on the NTF zeros are also integrated in the design method. A design example demonstrates that the proposed design method has an advantage over the benchmark one in improving the signal-to-noise ratio. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The linear prediction model may be applied wherever frame-based prediction is used. A stable synthesis procedure is derived by casting the prediction equation as a cyclic convolution in the time domain. When the filter order is the maximum possible, the synthesis filter is shown to have a frequency response proportional to the squared magnitude of the DFT of the frame. A symmetric two-sided predictor which has only half the number of coefficients to be coded as compared to a one-sided predictor of the same order is described.

(Trans. IEICE, vol. J72-A, no. 5, pp.786-794, 1989) using a IIR band pass filter with a variable center frequency and parallel block structure for fast processing. In 1996 an adaptive algorithm was investigated which solved the problem whereby the presence of several input frequencies led to the situation of it being impossible to achieve convergence using the new algorithm proposed by Takahashi et al. (Proc. IEEE APCCAS'94, pp. 376-381, 1994). However, the control signal generated by the new algorithm, used for adjusting the center frequency of the band pass filter, still jitters in spite of its convergence. In this paper, in addition to using the output in an adaptive algorithm as proposed, the input signal is used as an auxiliary or reference signal. In this way the jitter on the control signal can be reduced significantly, with the same convergence rate, with little added computational complexity.	algorithm	P. Kidakorn;W.

An arc describing the interaction strength between two agents is said to be persistent if its weight function has an infinite l1 norm. We discuss two balance conditions on the interactions between agents which generalize the arc-balance and cut-balance conditions in the literature respectively. The proposed conditions require that such a balance should be satisfied over each time window of a fixed length instead of at each time instant. We prove that in both cases global consensus is reached if and only if the persistent graph, which consists of all the persistent arcs, contains a directed spanning tree. The convergence rates of the system to consensus are also provided in terms of the interactions between agents having taken place. The results are obtained under a weak condition without assuming the existence of a positive lower bound of all the nonzero weights of arcs and are compared with the existing results. Illustrative examples are provided to show the critical importance of the nontrivial lower boundedness of the self-confidence of the agents.	complete (complexity);consensus (computer science);discrete-time signal;file spanning;interaction;mathematical induction;multi-agent system;persistent data structure;rate of convergence;spanning tree;stochastic matrix;taxicab geometry;the matrix;weight function	Weiguo Xia;Guodong Shi;Ziyang Meng;Ming Cao;Karl Henrik Johansson	2017	CoRR		discrete time and continuous time;control theory;mathematics;reciprocal	AI	64.76244822733575	6.703057140899921	167087

The multi-channel algorithms to be presented possess stage by stage decoupling and do not involve an arbitrary size of the step length, unlike conventional tapped delay line algorithms. General implementation of constraints are discussed in terms of multi channel adaptive lattice algorithms. Different structures are proposed for the constraint algorithms based, on a direct form and a normalised form, which may be applied to broad-band sensor data. Single channel multi-sensor adaptive lattices are considered for narrow-band array data processing and their performance compared with eigenfilter (Pisarenko) type processors.	algorithm;array processing	Tariq S.

Blind deconvolution is a problem that has been investigated in detail over the last two decades. Many approaches adopting various optimization criteria have been proposed to determine the inverse of the unknown channel filter. Minimum entropy deconvolution, as summarized by Donoho, provides an effective tool for determining the deconvolving filter using only the observed data. Recently, we have proposed an estimator for Renyi's entropy based on Parzen windowing, and demonstrated its superior performance over other entropy estimators in blind source separation and other problems. In this paper, we present a blind deconvolution algorithm based on the minimization of this entropy estimator and investigate its performance through Monte Carlo simulations.	algorithm;blind deconvolution;blind signal separation;control system;kernel density estimation;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;rényi entropy;signal processing;simulation;source separation	Deniz Erdogmus;José Carlos Príncipe;Luis Vielva	2002	2002 11th European Signal Processing Conference		econometrics;mathematical optimization;deconvolution;blind equalization;mathematics;blind deconvolution;statistics;wiener deconvolution	Robotics	56.355601365167395	10.212376850378488	167772
c3d1d11649f9ebfcacf37c8617bd068175e39fde	spatially distributed sampling and reconstruction		A spatially distributed system contains a large amount of agents with limited sensing, data processing, and communication capabilities. Recent technological advances have opened up possibilities to deploy spatially distributed systems for signal sampling and reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce a graph structure for a distributed sampling and reconstruction system by coupling agents in a spatially distributed system with innovative positions of signals. A fundamental problem in sampling theory is the robustness of signal reconstruction in the presence of sampling noises. For a distributed sampling and reconstruction system, the robustness could be reduced to the stability of its sensing matrix. In a traditional centralized sampling and reconstruction system, the stability of the sensing matrix could be verified by its central processor, but the above procedure is infeasible in a distributed sampling and reconstruction system as it is decentralized. In this paper, we split a distributed sampling and reconstruction system into a family of overlapping smaller subsystems, and we show that the stability of the sensing matrix holds if and only if its quasi-restrictions to those subsystems have uniform stability. This new stability criterion could be pivotal for the design of a robust distributed sampling and reconstruction system against supplement, replacement and impairment of agents, as we only need to check the uniform stability of affected subsystems. In this paper, we also propose an exponentially convergent distributed algorithm for signal reconstruction, that provides a suboptimal approximation to the original signal in the presence of bounded sampling noises.	approximation;central processing unit;centralized computing;digital signal processing;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;gibbs sampling;sampling (signal processing);signal reconstruction	Cheng Cheng;Yingchun Jiang;Qiyu Sun	2015	CoRR		mathematical optimization;control theory	Robotics	62.75412932400758	9.624167291023936	167817

In such a context, the error between the measured data and the output model is supposed to be unknown but bounded with a priori known bounds. The bounded error is specified over measurement noise, rather than over an equation error, which is mainly motivated by experimental considerations. The proposed approach is based on the optimal bounding ellipsoid algorithm for linear output-error fractional models.

We propose a new approach, based on the optimization of the log-likelihood criterion. The parameters of the log-likelihood to be estimated are the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. They are actualized by means of a stochastic algorithm that requires little computational cost. Furthermore, the particular structure of the algorithm, that we named MALASE, ensures the orthonormality of the estimated basis of eigenvectors at each step of the algorithm. MALASE algorithm shows strong links with many Givens rotation based update algorithms that we discuss.

For extracting the desired signal, one of the most important factors of the comb filter is the notch gain which controls an elimination quantity of the observed signal at noise frequencies. Conventional comb filters employ a predesigned notch gain under the assumption that the appropriate notch gain is known. Unfortunately, in many practical situations, the appropriate notch gain is unknown and often changes. In this paper, we propose a new comb filter with the adaptive notch gain to automatically achieve the appropriate notch gain. In the proposed method, we utilize an adaptive line enhancer (ALE) instead of the conventional notch gain multiplier. When the ALE completely estimates the periodic noise signal, the ALE's frequency response directly gives the appropriate notch gain. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive comb filter.	adaptive filter;coefficient;comb filter;finite impulse response;frequency response;noise reduction;simulation	Yosuke Sugiura;Arata Kawamura;Youji Iiguni	2012	Proceedings of The 2012 Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference		adaptive filter;control engineering;median filter;electronic engineering;kernel adaptive filter;signal transfer function;noise temperature;noise;multiplicative noise;control theory;noise figure;matched filter;signal-to-noise ratio;comb filter;stochastic resonance	Robotics	58.74877466989486	15.700594007685769	169604

The goal is to achieve consistent estimation results for very long range radar tracking, whereas this correlation term becomes non-negligible. Remarkably, the range element of the correlation term is so significant that it is several times larger than the range variance of the second-order term (SOT) and four orders of magnitude larger than the variance of the range measurement. In the absence of a closed form expression, the correlation of interest is approximated by scaling the variance of SOT using a design parameter. Improved performance of the new method is shown in simulated tests when the parameter is tuned up using the off-line Monte-Carlo averaging. The proposed SOF can process measurements in either the range–direction–sine (r–u–v) coordinates or the spherical (r–a–e) coordinates. & 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, their impact on the supporting cyber structure and their scalability to ensure real-time performance need further study. In this paper, a proximal Jacobian distributed optimal power flow model for the dispatch of converter-based power distribution systems is proposed, which features a favorable convergence behavior.

Input vectors are sent into the matrix to produce upon multiplication output vectors from which the frequency information in the matrix is deduced. The scheme resembles the familar closed-loop frequency response estimation procedures in classical control theories. The estimated frequency then tunes an adaptive notch filter for interference suppression. The method provides more accurate IF estimates than given by the Wigner-Ville distribution and a performance close to notch filtering at exact IF at a significantly lower computational requirement.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;enter the matrix;fm broadcasting;frequency response;interference (communication);recursion;theory;wigner quasiprobability distribution;zero suppression	H.

Here, asynchrony means that each agent updates the state information by its own clock that is independent of the other agents’ update times, and the update intervals of each agent are not necessarily equispaced. It is assumed that the leaders are stationary, and the followers can be classified into two generic categories: the followers with the first-order dynamics and the followers with second-order dynamics. For different kinds of followers, two distributed containment control protocols are presented to guarantee that all the followers can asymptotically converge into the convex hull formed by the leaders. The properties of the product of infinite nonnegative matrices are explored to arrive at that the asynchronous containment control can be achieved under the proposed protocols if and only if the communication topology among the agents contains a directed spanning forest rooted at the leaders. At last, simulation results are given to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical findings.	multi-agent system	Jin-Liang Shao;Lei Shi;Wei Xing Zheng;Ting-Zhu Huang	2018	Inf.

0ffc009225c59e39bb228597cda2653a5aecac73	iterative-promoting variable step-size least mean square algorithm for adaptive sparse channel estimation		Least mean square (LMS) type adaptive algorithms have attracted much attention due to their low computational complexity. In the scenarios of sparse channel estimation, zero-attracting LMS (ZA-LMS), reweighted ZA-LMS (RZA-LMS) and reweighted -norm LMS (RL1-LMS) have been proposed to exploit channel sparsity. However, these proposed algorithms may hard to make tradeoff between convergence speed and estimation performance with only one step-size. To solve this problem, we propose three sparse iterative-promoting variable step-size LMS (IP-VSS-LMS) algorithms with sparse constraints, i.e. ZA, RZA and RL1. These proposed algorithms are termed as ZA-IPVSS-LMS, RZA-IPVSS-LMS and RL1-IPVSS-LMS respectively. Simulation results are provided to confirm effectiveness of the proposed sparse channel estimation algorithms.

Valid agents have constant reference inputs, while additional interconnecting agents do not have reference inputs. Average-consensus tracking algorithms are proposed for the agents converging to the average value of constant reference inputs of valid agents. Under symmetric and connected topology, consensus conditions are obtained for the agents without and with communication delay, respectively, by using generalized Nyquist criterion.

Secure and fault-tolerant consensus algorithms typically assume knowledge of nonlocal information; however, this assumption is not suitable for large-scale dynamic networks. To remedy this, we focus on local strategies that provide resilience to faults and compromised nodes. We design a consensus protocol based on local information that is resilient to worst-case security breaches, assuming the compromised nodes have full knowledge of the network and the intentions of the other nodes. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the normal nodes to reach asymptotic consensus despite the influence of the misbehaving nodes under different threat assumptions. We show that traditional metrics such as connectivity are not adequate to characterize the behavior of such algorithms, and develop a novel graph-theoretic property referred to as network robustness. Network robustness formalizes the notion of redundancy of direct information exchange between subsets of nodes in the network, and is a fundamental property for analyzing the behavior of certain distributed algorithms that use only local information.	best, worst and average case;complex network;connectivity (graph theory);consensus (computer science);distributed algorithm;fault tolerance;global network;graph (discrete mathematics);graph theory;information exchange;internet backbone;like button;network topology;nikon cx format;quantum nonlocality;recursion;redundancy (engineering);robustness of complex networks;the times;vertex separator	Heath J.

Such filter-banks are beneficial, e.g., for speech and audio subband processing, but their synthesis filter-bank design is more complex as for uniform filter-banks. This problem is tackled by a new least-squares error (LS) synthesis filter-bank design. Magnitude and phase distortions are minimized with the constraints for complete aliasing cancellation and a restricted signal delay. The coefficients of the synthesis filters are determined by a linear set of equations with linear constraints which can be easily solved. The obtained FIR synthesis subband filters exhibit a frequency selectivity similar to that of the IIR analysis filters. The new concept is very general and can be applied in case of an allpass transformation of first or higher order as well as for polyphase network (PPN) filter-banks where the prototype filter length exceeds the number of channels. These properties make the proposed design of interest for various subband processing systems requiring non-uniform frequency bands.	aliasing;all-pass filter;coefficient;discrete cosine transform;distortion;filter bank;finite impulse response;frequency band;infinite impulse response;least squares;mathematical optimization;polyphase quadrature filter;prototype filter;selectivity (electronic)	Heinrich W.

e6d80cd8c00304fe68ae873ccf8a088279074a28	using invariance to extract signal from noise		It is shown how differential invariance can be used to extract an underlying signal from its noisy measurement towards constructing a non-asymptotic state estimator for linear systems. While the model of the system is assumed known, the noise can have arbitrary characteristics. The differential invariance is rendered by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and the system is represented in terms of a output reproducing functional on a Hilbert subspace. High accuracy, full state estimation of the system is achieved over arbitrary time intervals by way of orthogonal projection onto the subspace that represents the system invariance. Although the results are presented here primarily with reference to SISO LTI systems they readily extend to LTV systems with multiple outputs.	hilbert space;image noise;initial condition;kernel (operating system);linear system;linear time-invariant theory;magma;nonlinear system;recursion;smoothing;soft-in soft-out decoder;yet another	Debarshi Patanjali Ghoshal;Kumar Gopalakrishnan;Hannah Michalska	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963342	invariant (physics);estimator;kernel (linear algebra);control theory;noise measurement;mathematical optimization;subspace topology;linear system;mathematics;orthographic projection	Robotics	60.57523617727492	7.569678008369611	170941

It is known that this method can be more numerically efficient than the classical system identification method. However, no results are available to quantify its advantages. This paper offers a rigorous study of the performance of the subband method. More precisely, we aim to compare the performance of the subband identification method with the classical (fullband) identification method. The comparison is done in terms of the asymptotic residual error, asymptotic convergence rate, and computational cost when the identification is carried out using the prediction error method, and the optimization is done using the least-squares method. It is shown that by properly choosing the filterbanks, the number of parameters in each subband, the number of subbands, and the downsampling factor, the two identification methods can have compatible asymptotic residual errors and convergence rate. However, for applications where a high order model is required, the subband method is more numerically efficient. We study two types of subband identification schemes: one using critical sampling and another one using oversampling. The former is simpler to use and easier to understand, whereas the latter involves more design problems but offers further computational savings.	computation;computational complexity theory;decimation (signal processing);finite impulse response;least squares;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;oversampling;profiling (computer programming);rate of convergence;sampling (signal processing);sub-band coding;system identification	Damián Marelli;Minyue Fu	2004	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2003.820083	mathematical optimization;computer science;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics	Comp.	58.91290905545802	13.704527692404218	171022
4f9a42c3505f6fde93f52940ba83ec4613b859d9	fractional spectral analysis of randomly sampled signals and applications		Nonuniform sampling can be utilized to achieve certain desirable results. Periodic nonuniform sampling can decrease the required sampling rate for signals. Random sampling can be used as a digital alias-free signal processing method in analog-to-digital conversion. In this paper, we first present the fractional spectrum estimation of signals that are bandlimited in the fractional Fourier domain based on the general periodic random sampling approach. To show the estimation effect, the unbiasedness, the variance, and the optimal estimation condition are analyzed. The reconstruction of the fractional spectrum from the periodic random samples is also proposed. Second, the effects of sampling jitters and observation errors on the performance of the fractional spectrum estimation are analyzed, where the new defined fractional characteristic function is used to compensate the estimation bias from sampling jitters. Furthermore, we investigate the fractional spectral analysis from two widely used random sampling schemes, i.e., simple random sampling and stratified random sampling. Finally, all of the analysis results are applied and verified using a radar signal processing system.	analog-to-digital converter;bandlimiting;characteristic function (convex analysis);nonuniform sampling;nyquist–shannon sampling theorem;randomness;sampling (signal processing);signal processing;spectral density estimation;stratified sampling;the matrix;toeplitz hash algorithm	Liyun Xu;Feng Zhang;Ran Tao	2017	IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement	10.1109/TIM.2017.2728438	electronic engineering;importance sampling;statistics;simple random sample;stratified sampling;sampling (statistics);slice sampling;mathematics;sampling (signal processing);nonuniform sampling;signal reconstruction	Metrics	54.97494228403301	16.492855317503615	171038

It involves approximation of an equiripple FIR by rounding operation and application of the sharpening technique. In that way the overall filter is based on combining one simple filter with integer coefficients. The parameters of the design are the rounding constant and the parameters of the sharpening polynomials such as the order of tangencies m and l. Our analysis indicates that utilizing this approach the required number of total nonzero bits becomes quite low and less than in the minimum number of signed powers-of-two (MNSPT) design. The cost is the increase of the total numbers of sums and the delays.	approximation;coefficient;filter design;finite impulse response;low-pass filter;polynomial;rounding	Gordana Jovanovic-Dolecek;Sanjit K.

The objective of this paper is to have a sub-Nyquist sampling scheme for continuous-time wavelet-sparse signals within the general framework of FRI theory. Though the signal has a parametric representation in the wavelet basis, it is not possible to recover the signal merely from its low-pass samples, which makes the problem different from the conventional FRI settings. The need for the Fourier coefficients at frequencies widely spread over the spectrum puts challenges on the design of the sampling kernel.

The multikernel adaptive filter is an extension of the kernel adaptive filter using multiple kernels. Hence, it has offers higher performance than the kernel adaptive filter. In this paper, we focus on the fact that the multikernel adaptive filter determines a subspace in the sum of multiple reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) associated with different kernels. Based on this, we propose a novel method to individually select appropriate input signals in order to construct dictionary which determines the subspace. Furthermore, based on the fact that any unknown filter is an element in RKHS, we propose L2 regularization in order to avoid overadaptation. Also, we derive an algorithm that fixes the dictionary size in order to construct an efficient adaptive algorithm. Numerical examples show the efficiency of the proposed method.	adaptive algorithm;dictionary;hilbert space;kernel adaptive filter;matrix regularization;multikernel;numerical method	Taichi Ishida;Toshihisa Tanaka	2013	2013 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference	10.1109/APSIPA.2013.6694279	adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;kernel adaptive filter;machine learning;mathematics	Vision	61.68272857097591	13.189121663227303	171584

For this class of systems a balanced truncation algorithm is developed. The reduced order model is suboptimal, however the approximation error, which is captured by means of the stochastic gain, is bounded from above by twice the sum of singular numbers associated to the truncated states of each mode. Such a result allows rigorous simplification of the dynamics of each mode in an independent manner with respect to a metric which is relevant from a robust control point of view.	algorithm;approximation error;control point (mathematics);level of detail;linear system;markov chain;mean squared error;robust control;truncation	Georgios Kotsalis;Anders Rantzer	2010	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2010.2060241	control engineering;mathematical optimization;lti system theory;control theory;mathematics;markov process	Visualization	57.45317603197144	8.163604575967085	171957

So, recently, how to reduce the group delay of FIR filters has been studied intensively. To reduce the ringing in the time domain and to maximize the stopband attenuation, it is useful to design FIR filters with maximally flat characteristics in the passband and transmission zeros in the stop band. We present a mathematically closed form transfer function of low delay lowpass FIR filters with maximally flat amplitude in the passband and the transmission zeros in the stopband. Therefore, the designing filters are very simple. Moreover, of low delay lowpass FIR filters with maximally flat amplitude in the passband and equiripple in the stopband by using an iterative method of a closed form transfer function and Remez algorithm.	butterworth filter;finite impulse response;group delay and phase delay;iterative method;low-pass filter;remez algorithm;ringing (signal);transfer function	Naoyui Alkawa;Masamitsu Sato	2002	2002 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2002.5744906	computer science;chebyshev filter;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics;transition band;prototype filter;elliptic filter;stopband	Robotics	60.978931467049506	17.907501761383617	172237

Typical solutions like EKF/UKF could fail while Monte Carlo methods, even though more accurate, are computationally expensive. Recently proposed log homotopy based particle flow filter, also known as Daum-Huang filter (DHF) provides an alternative way of non-linear state estimation. There have been a number of DHFs derived, based on solutions of the homotopy flow equation. The performance of these new filters depends a lot on the implementation methodology. In this paper, we highlight the key factors affecting the DHF performance and investigate them individually. We then make recommendations based on our results. It is shown that a properly designed DHF can outperform a basic particle filter, with less execution time.	analysis of algorithms;autodesk 3ds max;discretization;euler;extended kalman filter;linear system;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;particle filter;run time (program lifecycle phase);smoothed-particle hydrodynamics	Muhammad Altamash Ahmed Khan;Martin Ulmke	2015	2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)		econometrics;mathematical optimization;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	56.06879313671281	4.729946267812046	172403

In this paper, we develop a new class of Volterra models, called baseband Volterra-Parafac models, with a reduced parametric complexity, by using a doubly symmetric Parafac decomposition of high order Volterra kernels viewed as tensors. Three adaptive algorithms are then proposed for estimating the parameters of these models.

The contraction theory provides a simple method to determine convergence of trajectories of the systems in the network instead of the Master Stability Function and the calculation of Lyapunov exponents. The objective is to determine the contraction region where once the trajectories reach such region they will converge each other and remain in such a contraction region. Such a condition lies mainly on the system parameters, network topology and coupling strength.	algorithm;converge;coupling constant;lyapunov fractal;network topology;neuron	Guillermo Solis-Perales;Guillermo Obregon-Pulido	2011	IX Latin American Robotics Symposium and IEEE Colombian Conference on Automatic Control, 2011 IEEE	10.1109/LARC.2011.6086840	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	66.59806851407279	5.861973570864691	172852

Such signals can be modelled by a weighted sum of sinusoidal components whose frequencies are integer multiples of a fundamental frequency. Given a data set, the fundamental frequency can be estimated in many ways including a maximum likelihood (ML) approach. Unfortunately, the ML estimator has a very high computational complexity, and the more inaccurate, but faster correlation-based estimators are therefore often used instead. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for the evaluation of the ML cost function for complex-valued data over all frequencies on a Fourier grid and up to a maximum model order. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the computational complexity to a level not far from the complexity of the popular harmonic summation method which is an approximate ML estimator.	approximation algorithm;computational complexity theory;loss function;spectral density estimation;weight function	Jesper Kjær Nielsen;Tobias Lindstrøm Jensen;Jesper Rindom Jensen;Mads Græsbøll Christensen;Søren Holdt Jensen	2015	2015 23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362451	econometrics;mathematical optimization;probabilistic analysis of algorithms;average-case complexity;mathematics;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;estimation theory;asymptotic computational complexity;statistics	ML	55.748289181592796	12.37993556308841	172993

However, identification of parametric linear models has received very little attention. In this paper, some methods are proposed for identification of moving average (MA) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) linear models with fractionally spaced data input using only the output sequence. It is shown that q-length MA and MA part of ARMA can be identified using only q points of the cyclic autocorrelation provided it is nonzero at two or more incommensurate cycle frequencies. This can be ensured by using the sum of cycle frequency separated signals or by using signals with a low frequency pilot.

It presents an alternative to large-sample analysis of the methods, recently provided by Stoica, Soderstrom, and Tichavskf. The two most important variants of these methods are considered in connection with the choice of the sample covariance matrix: the simpler technique follows the principle of a simple linear prediction (LP), and the more complex one is based on the idea of a forward-backward prediction (FB). Explicit expressions for the high-SNR covariance elements of the estimation errors associated with all the methods are derived first. These expressions of covariances are used 1) to analyze and compare the statistical performances of MUSIC, MN, and SUR estimation methods in both of the variants; 2) to discuss the problem of the optimal dimension of the data covariance matrix; and 3) to study the limit statistical efficiency of the methods. Finally, performances of the large-sample and highSNR asymptotics are documented by aid of Monte Carlo simulations.	music (algorithm);monte carlo method;performance;peter stoica;signal subspace;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;spectral density estimation	Petr Tichavský	1993	IEEE Trans.

First, the authors analyze individual local perception model and dynamics model, set the intersection of all the local perceptions as the region of interest (ROI). The MSN consists of sensors with first-order dynamics and second-order dynamics. Then, the authors design a control strategy to ensure that individuals aggregate at a point in the ROI relying on their local perceptions and the locations of neighbors within their communication scope. The authors describe this situation of aggregation as rendezvous. In addition, the authors introduce artificial potential field to make sensors deploy dispersedly in a bounded range near the ROI, which the authors call dispersed deployment. Finally, the authors prove the stability of the proposed strategies and validate the theoretical results by simulations. This research is applied for the cooperative deployment and data collection of mobile platforms with different dynamics under the condition of inaccurate perception.	aggregate data;control theory;first-order predicate;mobile device;region of interest;sensor;simulation;software deployment	Zhi Zheng;Zhihong Peng;Jie Chen	2017	J.

All the methods dedicated to the solution of this problem rely on the minimization of a squared-error criterion. In the identification literature, an instrumental variable based optimization criterion was introduced in order to cope with estimation bias in case of a noise modeling error. This principle has never been used in the LS-SVM context so far. Consequently, an instrumental variable scheme is introduced into the LS-SVM regression structure, which not only preserves the computationally attractive feature of the original approach, but also provides unbiased estimates under general noise model structures. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by a representative example.	algorithm;arx;computation;least squares;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;refinement (computing);simulation;support vector machine	Vincent Laurain;Wei Xing Zheng;Roland Tóth	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160354	identification;support vector machine;least squares support vector machine;minimisation;econometrics;estimation;kernel;instrumental variable;nonlinear system;noise;machine learning;errors-in-variables models;mathematical model;mathematics;bias of an estimator;computational model;regression analysis;statistics	Vision	57.56685620646196	8.87707022744746	173970

Simple delay-independent, delay-dependent and discretized complete LKF-based performance criteria are presented and demonstrated on a platoon with predecessor and leader following control architecture.	algorithmic efficiency;computation;discretization;domain analysis;lyapunov fractal;platoon (automobile)	Gabriella Varga;Gábor Rödönyi;Péter Gáspár;Jozsef Bokor	2014	2014 International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)	10.1109/ICCVE.2014.7297616	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.74529389623783	4.5662252282734865	174068

The merit factor is a well-known measure related to the autocorrelation sidelobe energy of a sequence. In this paper an equation is derived that allows the change in the merit factor of a binary sequence to be computed for all single-element changes with O(NlogN) operations, where N is the sequence length. The approach is then extended to multiple-element changes, allowing the merit factor change to be calculated with an additional O(Ns3) operations, where Nsis the number of changed elements, irrespective of sequence length. The multiple-element calculations can be used to update the single-element calculations so that in iterative use only O(N) operations are required per element change to keep the single-element calculations current. A steep descent algorithm (a variation on the steepest descent method) employing these two techniques was developed and applied to quarter-rotated, periodically extended Legendre sequences, producing optimized sequences with an apparent asymptotic merit factor of approximately 6.3758, modestly higher than the best known prior result of approximately 6.3421. Modified Jacobi sequences improve after steep descent to an approximate asymptotic merit factor of 6.4382. Three-prime and four-prime Jacobi sequences converge very slowly making a determination difficult but appear to have a higher post-steep-descent asymptotic merit factor than Legendre or modified Jacobi sequences.	approximation algorithm;asymptote;autocorrelation;bitstream;computation;converge;gradient descent;iteration;iterative method;jacobi method;quadratic residue;radar	John Michael Baden	2011	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2011.2164778	algorithm design;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;calculus;mathematics	Comp.	57.933325175724626	13.19838812165215	174323

His method utilizes a unit-norm constrained adaptive filter to find and track a single vector that lies in the noise subspace. By tracking this vector without explicit formulation of the sample covariance matrix R or its eigendecomposition, the algorithm maintains a low computational cost. In this paper, Thompson's method is extended using a penalty method. The new algorithm seeks an orthonormal basis that spans the noise subspace. The computational complexity of the algorithm is then reduced to a more desirable level through the use of a relaxation technique. Once the noise subspace is constructed, one can compute the MUSIC power spectrum for an improved spectral estimate.		C. D. Schmitz;W.

Agents are connected via diffusive full-state coupling, i.e. agents are coupled through states. A necessary and sufficient condition is developed for the solvability of the H∞ and H2 almost state synchronization problem. Moreover, a family of static protocols are developed such that the impact of disturbances on the network disagreement dynamics, expressed in terms of the H∞ and H2 norm of the corresponding closed-loop transfer function, is reduced to any arbitrarily small value. The protocol design is based on two methods: algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) or asymptotic time-scale eigenstructure assignment (ATEA).	algebraic riccati equation;algebraic equation;closed-loop transfer function;communications protocol;multi-agent system	Anton A.

The identification is done using a recently published subspace identification (SID) algorithm [1] for LPV systems. The objective is to demonstrate the ability of this method to not only identify a highly accurate model in state space form, but to also determine the state order of the system. As the identification data are gained from simulation, a comparison is given between the noiseless and the noisy case, and the effects of noise especially on the model order estimation are discussed.	algorithm;simulation;state space;system identification;wow and flutter measurement	Michael Buchholz;Wallace E.

These proposals are, mainly, based on the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm. In this paper we propose two algorithms that exploit the sparsity of the system and based on the mixed norm LMS (MN-LMS) algorithm. The first algorithm is proposed by adding l1-norm penalty to the cost function of the MN-LMS algorithms. This term enables us to attract the near-to-zero filter coefficients into zero very fast. However, when the system is highly non sparse, the algorithm almost fails. Because of that, we propose another algorithm that uses an approximation of thel0-norm penalty term in the cost function of the MN-LMS algorithm. This provides high performance even if the system is highly non sparse system. The performances of the proposed algorithms are compared to those of the LMS and MN-LMS algorithms in an acoustic sparse system identification setting. The proposed algorithms provide significant performances compared to the others.	acoustic cryptanalysis;adaptive filter;algorithm;approximation;coefficient;least mean squares filter;loss function;performance;sparse matrix;system identification;taxicab geometry	Gulden Eleyan;Mohammad Shukri Salman	2014	2014 22nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2014.6830477	mathematical optimization;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;signal processing;sparse approximation	ML	61.79666291802808	12.74252315485145	174832
f1046a5ace7ad112bf0d7ee42b9bced9a62141b8	a robust generalized-maximum likelihood unscented kalman filter for power system dynamic state estimation		This paper develops a new robust generalized maximum-likelihood-type unscented Kalman filter (GM-UKF) that is able to suppress observation and innovation outliers while filtering out non-Gaussian process and measurement noise. Because the errors of the real and reactive power measurements calculated using phasor measurement units (PMUs) follow long-tailed probability distributions, the conventional UKF provides strongly biased state estimates since it relies on the weighted least squares estimator. By contrast, the state estimates and residuals of our GM-UKF are proved to be roughly Gaussian, allowing the sigma points to reliably approximate the mean and the covariance matrices of the predicted and corrected state vectors. To develop our GM-UKF, we first derive a batch-mode regression form by processing the predictions and observations simultaneously, where the statistical linearization approach is used. We show that the set of equations so derived are equivalent to those of the unscented transformation. Then, a robust GM-estimator that minimizes a convex Huber cost function while using weights calculated via projection statistics (PSs) is proposed. The PSs are applied to a two-dimensional matrix that consists of a serially correlated predicted state and innovation vectors to detect observation and innovation outliers. These outliers are suppressed by the GM-estimator using the iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. Finally, the asymptotic error covariance matrix of the GM-UKF state estimates is derived from the total influence function. Extensive simulation results carried out on IEEE New England 39-bus 10-machine test system verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.	approximation algorithm;autocorrelation;automated theorem proving;batch processing;emoticon;gaussian process;hp 48 series;higher-order function;iteratively reweighted least squares;kalman filter;maxima and minima;nonlinear system;optimization problem;outer product;phasor;power management unit;simulation;statistically close;strongly correlated material	Junbo Zhao;Lamine Mili	2018	IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing	10.1109/JSTSP.2018.2827261	estimator;kalman filter;iteratively reweighted least squares;mathematical optimization;outlier;computer science;covariance matrix;least squares;huber loss;covariance	Robotics	56.372062144485234	6.254050327661802	174894

We focus especially on developing a relationship between the Cramer-Rao bound on pole estimates for the multi-observation case, and those when each single observation is used separately for estimation.	dynamical system;estimation theory;fisher information;linear algebra;randomness;transfer function	Jackeline Abad Torres;Sandip Roy	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426627	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;spectrum of a matrix;control theory;mathematics;linear system;estimation theory;matrix differential equation;statistics	Vision	56.78356294170845	7.996774901346974	174922

Since each agent can only obtain relative local information intermittently, the proposed consensus algorithm is based on a discontinuous local interaction rule. The interaction among agents happens at a disjoint set of continuous-time intervals. The closed-loop multi-agent system can be represented using mixed linear continuous-time and linear discrete-time models due to intermittent information transmissions. The time-scale theory provides a powerful tool to combine continuous-time and discrete-time cases and study the consensus protocol under a unified framework. Using this theory, some conditions are derived to achieve exponential consensus under intermittent information transmissions. Simulations are performed to validate the theoretical results.	multi-agent system	Fatima Zohra Taousser;Michael Defoort;Mohamed Djemai	2016	Int. J.

Each filtering operation can be implemented by convolution with a low-order 2-D finite-extent impulse response. This sequence of filtering operations can be viewed as an iteration where a new estimate of the output signal is formed from the previous estimate. If a convergence constraint is satisfied, the sequence of estimates will approach the desired output signal. In practice, the number of iterations is finite. Consequently, the frequence response that is actually realized by the iterative implementation is an approximation to the desired rational frequency response.	digital filter;iterative method	Dan E.

The necessary conditions are derived and incorporated into a multi-step optimization framework to ensure the stability of the resulting IIR filter. It is shown that IIR filter achieves similar or slightly better performance compared to its finite impulse response (FIR) counterpart. Moreover, IIR filtering requires significantly less number of taps to compensate the same CD channel compared to FIR filtering.	all-pass filter;finite impulse response;group delay and phase delay;infinite impulse response;mathematical optimization;mean squared error	Jawad Munir;Amine Mezghani;Israa Slim;Josef A.

The technique can be used for the design of general low-pass, high-pass and bandpass filters. Although the number of multiplications of the IFIR filter is dependent on the bandwidth and the center frequency of the desired filter, this approach nearly always provides a substantial reduction in complexity when compared to other FIR and IFIR design procedures. >	b-spline;filter design	D.

Both the leaderless consensus problem and the coordinated tracking problem with a dynamic leader are considered. By introducing a distributed filter for each agent or follower, the proposed control algorithms use only relative position measurements in the absence of communication. In the special case without the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, i.e., for multi-agent systems with double-integrator dynamics, we further derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the leaderless consensus problem under a general directed graph. Finally, simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The approach is grounded in a second-order Taylor-series expansion of the system's state variables along the solution trajectories as a function of the uncertain elements. Subsequently, over the time horizon of interest, Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs (QCQPs) are formulated to estimate maximum and minimum bounds on the state variables to recover the reach set. To contend with the nonconvexity of the QCQPs, Lagrangian relaxations are leveraged to formulate Semidefinite Programs (SDPs) that provide guaranteed bounds to the solutions of the QCQPs. Applications of the method to quantify the impact of uncertain power injections in power-system dynamic models are demonstrated with numerical examples.	mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;numerical analysis;numerical method;propagation of uncertainty;semidefinite programming;series expansion;software propagation;system dynamics	Hyungjin Choi;Peter J.

b974fa462fa00fb5fadcbf859bab11d3b6a44cc9	a double-layered framework for distributed coordination in solving linear equations		This paper proposes a double-layered framework (or form of network) to integrate two mechanisms, termed consensus and conservation, achieving distributed solution of a linear equation. The multi-agent framework considered in the paper is composed of clusters (which serve as a form of aggregating agent) and each cluster consists of a sub-network of agents. By achieving consensus and conservation through agent-agent communications in the same cluster and clustercluster communications, distributed algorithms are devised for agents to cooperatively achieve a solution to the overall linear equation. These algorithms outperform existing consensus-based algorithms, including but not limited to the following aspects: first, each agent does not have to know as much as a complete row or column of the overall equation; second, each agent only needs to control as few as two scalar states when the number of clusters and the number of agents are sufficiently large; third, the dimensions of agents’ states in the proposed algorithms do not have to be the same (while in contrast, algorithms based on the idea of standard consensus inherently require all agents’ states to be of the same dimension). Both analytical proof and simulation results are provided to validate exponential convergence of the proposed distributed algorithms in solving linear equations.	distributed algorithm;imaginary time;linear equation;multi-agent system;negative base;semiconductor industry;simulation;subnetwork;system of linear equations;time complexity	Xuan Wang;Shaoshuai Mou;Brian D.

However, as they use a linear FIR filter with a convex decision region, their residual estimation error is high. In this paper, four nonlinear blind equalization schemes that employ a complex-valued multilayer perceptron instead of the linear filter are proposed and their learning algorithms are derived. After the important properties that a suitable complex-valued activation function must possess are discussed, a new complex-valued activation function is developed for the proposed schemes to deal with QAM signals of any constellation sizes. It has been further proven that by the nonlinear transformation of the proposed function, the correlation coefficient between the real and imaginary parts of input data decreases when they are jointly Gaussian random variables. Last, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes is verified in terms of initial convergence speed and MSE in the steady state. In particular, even without carrier phase tracking procedure, the proposed schemes correct an arbitrary phase rotation caused by channel distortion.

We assume a widely-linear predictive model for the αβ complex signal of the system that is given by Clarke's transform. The system frequency is estimated using the parameters of this model. In order to estimate the model parameters while compensating for noise in both input and output of the model, we utilize the notions of total least-squares fitting and gradient-descent optimization. The outcome is an augmented gradient-descent total least-squares (AGDTLS) algorithm that has a computational complexity comparable to that of the complex least mean square (CLMS) and the augmented CLMS (ACLMS) algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides significantly improved frequency estimation performance compared with CLMS and ACLMS when the measured voltages are noisy and especially in unbalanced systems.	algorithm;autoregressive model;computational complexity theory;dirac delta function;distortion;edmund m. clarke;emoticon;gradient descent;ibm power systems;input/output;inverse iteration;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;power iteration;real-time locating system;recursion;recursive least squares filter;s transform;simulation;small-bias sample space;spectral density estimation;total least squares;unbalanced circuit	Reza Arablouei;Stefan Werner;Kutluyil Dogançay	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638177	econometrics;mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;stochastic gradient descent;non-linear least squares;electric power system;computational complexity theory;statistics;recursive least squares filter	Robotics	61.086059885912	11.207886967527498	178008

More precisely, we focus on the associated convex relaxation where the ℓ1-norm of the vector of variables is minimized and propose a new iteratively reweighted scheme in order to improve the conditions under which this relaxation provides the sparsest solution. We prove the convergence of the new scheme and derive sufficient conditions for the convergence towards the sparsest solution. Experiments show that the new scheme significantly improves upon the previous approaches for compressive sensing. Then, these results are applied to switched system identification.	compressed sensing;linear equation;linear programming relaxation;linear system;mathematical optimization;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;system identification;system of linear equations;taxicab geometry	Van Luong Le;Fabien Lauer;Gérard Bloch	2014	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2014.2351694	database index;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;convergence;sparse matrix;network switch;machine learning;sparse approximation;mathematics	Vision	65.99480100537681	15.918573038397135	178776

The adaptive scheme consists of a parallel combination of a linear component, represented by crossband filters between subbands, and a quadratic component, which is modeled by multiplicative cross-terms. We adaptively update the model parameters using the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm, and derive explicit expressions for the transient and steady-state mean-square error (MSE) in frequency bins for white Gaussian inputs. We show that estimation of the nonlinear component improves the MSE performance only when the power ratio of nonlinear to linear components is relatively high. Furthermore, as the number of crossband filters increases, a lower steady-state MSE may be obtained at the expense of slower convergence. Experimental results support the theoretical derivations.	adaptive algorithm;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;nonlinear system identification;short-time fourier transform;steady state	Yekutiel Avargel;Israel Cohen	2009	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2009.2021713	adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;split-step method;nonlinear system;computer science;adaptive system;calculus;control theory;mathematics	Vision	58.74416739439976	13.93656841017486	179112
d38d4ca9e985f62f4fed49eea2f2c702012cefd4	uncertainty inequalities for the linear canonical hilbert transform		The Heisenberg uncertainty principle plays an important role in signal processing, applied mathematical and physics community. The extensions of the traditional uncertainty principle to the novel transforms have received considerable attention recently. In this paper, the uncertainty inequalities under the linear canonical Hilbert transform (LCHT) are considered. First, the uncertainty principle for the complex signals associated with the one-dimensional LCHT is investigated. Subsequently, the uncertainty inequality for the complex signals derived by the two-dimensional LCHT is proposed. It is shown that the uncertainty bounds for the complex signals derived by LCHT are different from the general complex signals in the LCT domain. In addition, the example and potential applications are also presented to show the correctness and useful of the derived results. Therefore, the uncertainty principles presented here not only can enrich the ensemble of the classical uncertainty principle, but can have many real applications too.	hilbert transform	Shuiqing Xu;Yi Chai;Youqiang Hu;Li Feng;Lei Huang	2018	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-018-0780-1	inequality;mathematical optimization;mathematics;uncertainty principle;signal processing;correctness;hilbert transform	Vision	54.02662934327912	17.512218051762524	179313

How a 2-D filter can be designed to retain a desired coefficient sparsity for efficient implementation while achieving best possible performance subject to that sparsity constraint? These are the focus of this paper in which we present a two-phase design method for 2-D FIR digital filters in two most common design settings, namely, the least squares and minimax designs. Simulation studies are presented to illustrate each phase of the proposed design method and to evaluate the performance of the filters designed.	coefficient;digital filter;filter design;finite impulse response;least squares;minimax;simulation;sparse matrix;two-phase locking	Wu-Sheng Lu;Takao Hinamoto	2011	Multidim.

Correct transformation from a continuous 2-D domain into the z domains without residuum and without errors is described. The proposed solution with high selectivity is a filter function in the z1 domain and the Hilbert transformer in the z2 domain. A corresponding example of the new class of linear-phase highly selective 2-D FIR digital filters of low complexity, which is obtained by the proposed approximation technique, is shown in this brief.	approximation;chebyshev polynomials;digital filter;finite impulse response;hilbert transform;linear phase;polynomial;selectivity (electronic);t-norm;transformer	J.

Given a realization of the observation process, the aim is to estimate the state of the Markov chain assuming known model parameters. Computing conditional mean estimates is infeasible as it involves a cost that grows exponentially with the number of observations. We present three expectation maximization (EM) algorithms for state estimation to compute maximum a posteriori (MAP) state sequence estimates [which are also known as Bayesian maximum likelihood state sequence estimates (MLSEs)]. The first EM algorithm yields the MAP estimate for the entire sequence of the finite state Markov chain. The second EM algorithm yields the MAP estimate of the (continuous) state of the jump linear system. The third EM algorithm computes the joint MAP estimate of the finite and continuous states. The three EM algorithms optimally combine a hidden Markov model (HMM) estimator and a Kalman smoother (KS) in three different ways to compute the desired MAP state sequence estimates. Unlike the conditional mean state estimates, which require computational cost exponential in the data length, the proposed iterative schemes are linear in the data length.	expectation–maximization algorithm;linear system;markov chain	Andrew Logothetis;Vikram Krishnamurthy	1999	IEEE Trans.

Its realization was based on an iterative procedure, while its performance had been assessed through the simulations only. In this paper, we derive asymptotic performance of the XWD-based IF estimator. The obtained results are used to develop an algorithm for the selection of an adaptive window width in the XWD estimator, producing a trade-off between the bias and variance.

The basic assumption is that the speech driving process consists of an approximately Gaussian part (unvoiced) and a jump part (voiced). The pitch pulse positions located by processing the innovations alone are known not to be very accurate due to phase-distortions, effects of zeros and inaccurate model parameter estimates. In our ladder form linear prediction recursions, a log-likelihood function is recursively computed (on-line) for each speech sample. The derivative of this log-likelihood function becomes a sensitive measure of extreme outliers of the speech waveforms, i.e., samples that very likely do not fit the Gaussian statistics. When combined with the innovations of our ladder algorithms a good statistic is obtained for locating the pitch pulses by thresholding. This pitch detection scheme has the advantage that all the necessary variables are already computed in the modeling ladder recursions and therefore is suited for fast on-line or even hardware (e.g., VLSI) implementations.	pitch detection algorithm	Daniel T.

The methods estimate the DOA using only linear transformations of the data. This is of special interest for cases when the number of sensors is large and the computational advantages of these methods are significant. These methods use a less restrictive noise model and, e.g., can accommodate cases where the noise variance is different for different sensors. Large sample variance expressions for the estimates of the DOAs are derived, and the statistical properties of the proposed method are compared against the properties of multiple signal classification (MUSIC). >		Petre Stoica;Anders Eriksson;Torsten Söderström	1993		10.1109/ICASSP.1993.319587	speech recognition;control system;mathematics;linear map;statistics	EDA	54.15940692971177	10.243258324681923	181151

This leads to a very high computational effort and cannot be realized on most low-cost DSPs. One common proposition to decrease the computational load is to update only a portion of the coefficients at a time. This decreases not only the computational load but also the convergence speed. To reduce this drawback, it has been suggested that only the most significant coefficients be updated. This improves the convergence speed considerably. Unfortunately, it requires additional memory of twice the filter length. In our proposal, we present a modified version of the mentioned algorithm which has almost the same adaptation speed but consumes significantly less memory.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;coefficient;computation;digital signal processor;least mean squares filter	Thomas Schertler	1998		10.1109/ICASSP.1998.681789	adaptive filter;computer vision;speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science	AI	60.89930799401535	13.41622298200473	181185

In this paper, the framework for a Gaussian sum filter is developed emphasizing how the uncertainty can be propagated accurately over extended time periods in the absence of measurement updates. To achieve this objective, a series of metrics constructed from tensors of higher-order cumulants are proposed which assess the consistency of the uncertainty and provide a tool for implementing an adaptive Gaussian sum filter. Emphasis is also placed on the algorithm's potential for parallelization which is complemented by the use of higher-order unscented filters based on efficient multidimensional Gauss-Hermite quadrature schemes. The effectiveness of the proposed Gaussian sum filter is illustrated in a case study in space surveillance involving the tracking of an object in a six-dimensional state space.	adaptive filter;algorithm;cartesian closed category;coefficient;economic complexity index;gaussian blur;gaussian elimination;gaussian quadrature;gauss–hermite quadrature;geographic coordinate system;geosynchronous orbit;molecular orbital;nonlinear system;numerical partial differential equations;parallel computing;polynomial;portable document format;refinement (computing);state space;subdivision surface;vii	Joshua T.

A new non-stochastic but not necessarily deterministic (possibly nonlinear) alternative approach to signal filtering based mainly on concepts of signal power, signal energy, and an equivalence relation plays a dominant role in the presentation. Causality, error invariance, and especially error convergence properties are the most important and fundamental features of resulting filters. Therefore, it is natural to call them asymptotic filters. Although error convergence aspects are emphasized in the approach, it is shown that introducing the signal power as the quantitative measure of signal energy dissipation makes it possible to achieve reasonable results from the optimality point of view as well. The authors show that the notion of the asymptotic filter can be used as a proper tool for unifying stochastic and non-stochastic, linear and nonlinear approaches to signal filtering.

For such a problem, we propose two decentralized variants (ODA-C and ODA-PS) of Nesterov's primal-dual algorithm with dual averaging. In ODA-C, to mitigate the disagreements on the primal-vector updates, the agents implement a generalization of the local information-exchange dynamics recently proposed by Li and Marden [1] over a static undirected graph. In ODA-PS, the agents implement the broadcast-based push-sum dynamics [2] over a time-varying sequence of uniformly connected digraphs.

58bfa5080778bddaaf265981ddb9aa436d865f3b	cooperative stabilization of a class of lti plants with distributed observers		Over the last decades, the cooperative design of complex networked systems has received an increasing attention in real-world engineering practices. Traditionally, each node in the network is assumed to obtain the same signal. However, each agent often possesses different measurement due to the observability or configuration of the systems. To solve the stabilization problem in this case, we aim to establish a unified framework for the cooperative control of complex network with distributed observers. In detail, different from the traditional centralized design, this paper initiates a cooperative approach by only using the local information of the networked systems. In allusion to the three kinds of representative networks, this paper establishes some sufficient or necessary conditions for the existence of network parameters that guarantee the stabilization of the LTI plants. Moreover, some corresponding algorithms are developed to find the suitable parameters of networked observers. Last but not least, numerical simulations are also provided to verify the above theoretical results.	algorithm;centralized computing;complex network;computer simulation;consensus dynamics;language technologies institute;numerical analysis;unified framework	Kexin Liu;Henghui Zhu;Jinhu L&#x00FC;	2017	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2017.2675922	control engineering;control theory	Robotics	64.52531998383192	4.729631903868672	182920

e0a8fca75f411301dfb88cfb1cdb53a2191a540d	rigid formation control with nonlinear passive actuation		This paper presents a distributed control law that locally forces a group of agents to self-organize into a rigid formation specified by a subset of interagent distances. The control law presented here is distributed as its execution requires each agent to only sense its relative positions with its neighbors, i.e. agents with whom they share a specified desired distance, and its own velocity. The paper extends [13], [17], and [18]. In [13] each agent is modeled as a single integrator. On the other hand, [17] assumes double integrator dynamics but requires that agents can also sense the velocities of their neighbors, doubling the communication/sensing overhead. In [18] the agent velocities are generated by the actuation signals through a Linear Time Invariant Positive Real dynamics. Double integrator dynamics are a special case of this. Unlike [17] no agent needs its neighbor's velocities. This paper on its parts relaxes the assumption of linear time invariance and instead assumes that the actuation to velocity dynamics of each agent is nonlinear but passive. We prove that the control law of [18] still guarantees local stability despite the presence of nonlinear actuation dynamics. We argue that, like [13], [17] and [18], no law for this problem can be globally stable.	algorithm;consensus dynamics;control theory;critical point (network science);distributed control system;linear time-invariant theory;local convergence;loss function;minimum bounding rectangle;nonlinear system;optimal control;overhead (computing);period-doubling bifurcation;self-organization;simulation;state space;stationary process;time complexity;time-invariant system;velocity (software development)	Bradley W.

Using LMS-type adaptation, the estimator is computationally efficient and it provides direct measurements of multipath gain and delay on a sample-by-sample basis. The convergence dynamics and variances of system parameters are derived. It is shown that the optimal performance of the estimator approaches the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

The challenge is how the original signal could be recovered from a few linear observations. Recently, many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed which mostly rely on computationally costly batch-based estimation which lacks the ability of estimating changes in the signal to be reconstructed. In this paper, a recursive reconstruction algorithm is proposed which has the ability of sequentially utilizing the received observations and so capable of tracking the time varying underlying sparse or compressible signals, while, Due to the adaptive structure, the computational cost is spread out in time iterations. Simulation tests compare the performance of the proposed and state of the art algorithms.	adaptive coordinate descent;algorithmic efficiency;compressed sensing;computation;computational complexity theory;genetic algorithm;iteration;loss function;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;nyquist rate;optimization problem;rate of convergence;recursion;sampling (signal processing);simulation;sparse matrix	Mohammad Ali Tinati;Tohid Yousefi Rezaii	2011	2011 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation	10.1109/HPCSim.2011.5999845	signal reconstruction;mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;compressed sensing;approximation algorithm;statistics	Robotics	62.048465043609966	11.180727466852035	183370

Savitzky and Golay proved in their hallmark paper that local LS fitting of polynomials and their evaluation at the mid-point of the approximation interval is equivalent to filtering with a fixed impulse response. The problem that we address here is, “how to choose a pointwise minimum mean squared error (MMSE) S-G filter length or order for smoothing, while preserving the temporal structure of a time-varying signal.” We solve the bias-variance tradeoff involved in the MMSE optimization using Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE). We observe that the 3-dB cutoff frequency of the SURE-optimal S-G filter is higher where the signal varies fast locally, and vice versa, essentially enabling us to suitably trade off the bias and variance, thereby resulting in near-MMSE performance. At low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), it is seen that the adaptive filter length algorithm performance improves by incorporating a regularization term in the SURE objective function. We consider the algorithm performance on real-world electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The results exhibit considerable SNR improvement. Noise performance analysis shows that the proposed algorithms are comparable, and in some cases, better than some standard denoising techniques available in the literature.	adaptive filter;akaike information criterion;algorithm;approximation;bias–variance tradeoff;computation;finite impulse response;least squares;loss function;low-pass filter;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;mean squared error;mike lesser;noise (electronics);noise reduction;optimization problem;polynomial;selection algorithm;semantics (computer science);signal-to-noise ratio;smoothing;synthetic intelligence;time complexity	Sunder Ram Krishnan;Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2012.2225055	econometrics;mathematical optimization;electrical engineering;finite impulse response;bias;mathematics;variance;statistics	Vision	55.633486843463814	12.028534114547405	183669

This paper presents a new algorithm called the CRCE (combined regressor and combined error) algorithm that can overcome the problems of the conventional algorithms by using the combined form of the regression vector and the estimation error. By controlling the composition of the combined regressor and the combined error, the CRCE algorithm continuously adjusts the coefficient update equation to achieve convergence stability and estimation accuracy. The computer simulation results also demonstrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than those of the conventional algorithms.	infinite impulse response	Min-Soo Park;Woo-Jin Song	1997	Signal Processing	10.1016/S0165-1684(96)00148-X	computer simulation;control engineering;mathematical optimization;system identification;computer science;finite impulse response;control theory;mathematics;infinite impulse response	ML	59.95268345583225	11.980221667511081	184011

As recently shown, this problem is generically NP hard both in the number of data points and the number of inputs to the non-linearity.

We develop distributed consensus protocol to solve regulation synchronization problem for leaderless MAVs with directed interaction topology. Adaptive control algorithms are used locally for each vehicle to deal with nonlinear dynamics and uncertainty associated with flying environment, such as, wind gust, payload mass, aerodynamic friction and other external disturbances. The resulting protocol for synchronization problem combines simple decentralized proportional-plus-derivative like term and robust adaptive control term with position signal based consensus protocol. Lyapunov method uses to show the asymptotic convergence of the consensus errors of the closed loop systems formulated by multiple MAVs. It is shown in our analysis that all MAVs reach an agreement and synchronize to a common value which is not a priori defined. The convergence of the asymptotic consensus error is shown by using Lyapunov method and sliding mode control theory. The proposed design is simple as it does not require exact knowledge of the dynamical model and uncertainty.	aerial photography;algorithm;closed-loop transfer function;consensus (computer science);consensus dynamics;control theory;dynamical system;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system	Shafiqul Islam;Peter Xiaoping Liu;Abdulmotaleb El-Saddik	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2017.8122995	control theory;vehicle dynamics;sliding mode control;nonlinear system;lyapunov function;adaptive control;synchronization;computer science;convergence (routing);consensus	Robotics	63.76038344141941	4.779092979189008	185050

The idea is to use “the useful input parametrization” for OE models proposed by Stoica and Söderstrom (1982). The advantage of this parametrization is that the Toeplitz covariance matrix structure instrumental in the FIR analysis also holds for this OE model input representation after a transformation. However, an issue is that the corresponding minimum variance cost function for the OE case will be more complicated than for FIR models, and that the dimension of the optimization problem will be of one degree higher than for the corresponding FIR case. The proposed OE framework is applied to minimum variance input signal design in system identification frequency response estimation and model predictive control. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.	control theory;finite impulse response;frequency response;like button;loss function;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;peter stoica;social inequality;system identification;toeplitz hash algorithm	Bo Wahlberg;Mariette Annergren;Cristian R.

Based on a distributed state observer, a novel event-triggered mechanism is firstly introduced to design the output feedback synchronization controller, and by applying a useful graph theoretical result, the asymptotic convergence of the synchronization errors is then guaranteed. Moreover, it is proved that the designed event-triggered synchronization method is also valid for the CDNs with time-varying coupling weights. In particular, the proposed method is an extension of the existing state feedback event-triggered synchronization results. Finally, the circuit realizations for the new event-triggered mechanism and control approach are given, and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated through the simulation results.	block cipher mode of operation	Chong-Xiao Shi;Guang-Hong yang;Xiao-Jian Li	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2017.05.014	coupling;control theory;synchronization;state observer;convergence (routing);computer science;graph;control theory	Robotics	64.93253139283681	4.6945570977085245	185492

Then the Gaussian Inverse Wishart-Probability Hypothesis Density (GIW-PHD) filter in the random matrix framework is utilized to track multiple extended objects in the presence of clutter measurements and missed detections. In view of the invariant extension evolution model and neglected actual measurement noise for the original GIW-PHD filter, this paper adopts a dynamic evolution model and a reasonable measurement noise model. A suitable likelihood function is derived and the new recursive expressions are presented along with the necessary assumptions and approximations. Furthermore, a parameter adaptive improved algorithm based on the GIW-PHD filter is presented, that estimates model parameters adaptively.

The desired properties of a filter bank (such as zero aliasing, perfect reconstruction) are formulated as an objective function of the filter coefficients. The design procedures minimize the objective function by iterative quadratic programming with linear constraints. Our design examples show that the method is flexible towards frequency support configurations, smoothness constraints, and can be used to design multidimensional perfect reconstruction filter banks having up to eight channels.	aliasing;coefficient;filter bank;iterative method;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;quadratic programming;reconstruction filter	Truong T.

Current methods to eliminate this distortion, by switching to a fixed parallel structure or by cascading an equalizer, require a stability test which costs O ( N z ) multiplications per sampling period, This paper proposes a new configuration for an IIR adaptive echo and litrwling canceler, which consists of a 2-channel maximum entropy lattice filter and its inverse filter. The echo is canceled by the adaptive lattice filter, while the signal distortion is eliminated by the inverse lattice. With stability guaranteed without the necessity of testing, the new structure costs 0 ( N ) multiplications per sampling period. The new algorithm can also be greatly simplified for white input cases.	algorithm;distortion;echo (command);echo suppression and cancellation;equalization (communications);infinite impulse response;inverse filter;lattice phase equaliser;porpentine (game designer);sampling (signal processing);series-parallel graph	Jinhui Chao;Shigeo Tsujii	1991	IEEE Trans.

To solve the described problem, existing literature proposes distributed gradient-like algorithms that are attractive due to computationally simple iterations k, but have a drawback of slow convergence (in k) to a solution. We propose a distributed gradient-like algorithm, that we build from the (centralized) Nesterov gradient method. For the convex fi's with Lipschitz continuous and bounded gradients, we show that our method converges at rate O(log k/k). The achieved rate significantly improves over the convergence rate of existing distributed gradient-like methods, while the proposed algorithm maintains the same communication cost per k and a very similar computational cost per k. We further show that the rate O(log k/k) still holds if the bounded gradients assumption is replaced by a certain linear growth assumption. We illustrate the gains obtained by our method on two simulation examples: acoustic source localization and learning a linear classifier based on l2-regularized logistic loss.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;centralized computing;computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;gradient descent;gradient method;iteration;linear classifier;linear function;loss functions for classification;mathematical optimization;rate of convergence;simulation	Dusan Jakovetic;José M.

By stable, we refer to the classical stability condition for the AR model. By consistent, we refer to the classical consistency constraints of Adams-Bashforth methods of order-two. One attractive feature of this algebraic method is that the model parameters can be obtained without directly knowing any training data set as opposed to many standard, regression-based parameterization methods. It takes only long-time average statistics as inputs. The proposed method provides a discretization time step interval which guarantees the existence of stable and consistent AR model and simultaneously produces the parameters for the AR models. In our numerical examples with two chaotic time series with different characteristics of decaying time scales, we find that the proposed AR models produce significantly more accurate short-term predictive skill and comparable filtering skill relative to the linear regression-based AR models. These encouraging results are robust across wide ranges of discretization times, observation times, and observation noise variances. Finally, we also find that the proposed model produces an improved short-time prediction relative to the linear regression-based AR-models in forecasting a data set that characterizes the variability of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, a dominant tropical atmospheric wave pattern.	autoregressive model;linear algebra	John Harlim;Hoon Hong;Jacob L.

Firstly, we formulate a mathematical description of the data transmission delay and a measurement model. Secondly, the state model and the measurement model are adapted into new forms by expanding their dimensions. In this way, non-white noise can be converted to white noise, which can be dealt with using standard Kalman filtering. Thirdly, a dimensionality reduction method is proposed to overcome the complexity generated by expanding dimensions, and then a synthesis filter is designed with dimensions equal to those of the original system. Finally, a simulation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed method.	filter bank	Lan Wu;Chenglin Wen	2017	Annales des Télécommunications	10.1007/s12243-017-0573-8	electronic engineering;simulation;telecommunications;engineering;root-raised-cosine filter;filter bank;filter design;m-derived filter	EDA	57.90085632578162	17.060924297198934	187274

In our designed framework, the time-varying network topology is constant in each time interval and then randomly jumps to another topology when certain occasional events occur at some random moments. In addition, we further assume that the dwell time of each topology is unknown in advance and the corresponding adjacency weighted matrix is not necessarily nonnegative due to the probable existence of deteriorated communication channels in the underlying interaction network. By the orthogonal decomposition method, the state vector of the resultant error dynamical system can be further decomposed as two transversal components, one of which evolves along the consensus manifold and the other evolves transversally with the consensus manifold. Then, by introducing the generalized matrix measure and by applying the tools of contraction and circle analysis, the second-order locally dynamical consensus of multiagent systems with arbitrarily fast switching directed topologies is theoretically investigated in detail, and some easily verified sufficient conditions are also presented. It is shown that, under sufficiently large coupling strengths, the random switchings can be effectively tolerated and the consensus can be achieved for all agents in the network. Finally, numerical simulation examples are also provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.	agent-based model;computer simulation;consensus (computer science);directed graph;dynamical system;interaction network;multi-agent system;network topology;nonlinear system;randomness;resultant;thyristor;time-varying network	Huaqing Li;Xiaofeng Liao;Tingwen Huang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2013.2242466	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;vector space;computer science;artificial intelligence;graph theory;machine learning;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.10807871284266	5.907364144642591	187275

The proposed method approximates the noise-free coefficient functions by a local linear expansion on the observed scheduling variables. Therefore, additive noise on the scheduling variables is reconstructed as a corrective term added to the output noise that is proportional to the squared gradient obtained from the posterior of the Gaussian Process. An iterative procedure is given so that the obtained solution converges to the best estimation of the coefficient functions according to the given measure of fitness. Moreover, the expectation and covariance functions estimated by GP are modified for the noisy scheduling variable case to include the noise contribution on the estimated expectation and covariance functions. The model training procedure identifies noise level in the measurements including outputs and scheduling variables by estimating the noise variances, as well as other defined hyperparameters. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is compared to the standard GP approach through a numerical example.	additive white gaussian noise;coefficient;gaussian process;gradient;iterative method;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;schedule;scheduling (computing);system identification;utility functions on indivisible goods	Farshid Abbasi;Javad Mohammadpour;Roland Tóth;Nader Meskin	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7402326	job shop scheduling;econometrics;mathematical optimization;noise measurement;control theory;gaussian process;mathematics;statistics	AI	57.17015546774659	8.590483613346597	187332

We focus on the design of linear filters, such that for all admissible parameter uncertainties, the error state of the bilinear stochastic system is mean square bounded, and the steadystate variance of the estimation error of each state is not more than the individual prespecified value. It is shown that the design of the robust filters can be carried out by solving some algebraic quadratic matrix inequalities. In particular, we establish both the existence conditions and the explicit expression of desired robust filters.

2c0cad73ea61d6484e94da9974f93649f3fa0a86	a connectivity preserving framework for distributed motion coordination in proximity networks		A necessary condition for global performance guarantees in most of the motion coordination algorithms is connectivity of the underlying network topology. In proximity networks, connectivity maintenance becomes critical because the neighborhood set of each agent is dynamic and depends on the locations of all the other agents in the network. We present an efficient framework for distributed motion coordination in proximity networks. The proposed framework relies on identifying agents in a so called weakly connected dominating (WCD) set of the underlying network graph. Maintaining only the edges incident to the agents in WCD, which we call as critical edges, preserves the connectivity of the overall network. The proposed framework is presented in the context of rendezvous problem, which is selected because of its canonical importance in distributed systems with mobile agents. We propose a controller that drives all the agents to a common point by preserving the critical edges only. The proposed scheme is robust to failure of edges that are not critical and nodes that do not belong to WCD. Moreover, it performs well in terms of energy consumption and computational complexity.	agent-based model;algorithm;computational complexity theory;connected dominating set;connectivity (graph theory);distributed computing;mobile agent;multi-agent system;network topology;simulation	Hassan Jaleel;Waseem Abbas	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431056	rendezvous problem;computer science;control theory;control engineering;computational complexity theory;approximation algorithm;network topology;multi-agent system;distributed computing;graph	AI	63.695413371555176	6.009815642418396	187488

A follower-based observer based on relative outputs of neighboring agents is developed to estimate the relative states of neighbors which avoid designing the observer for the leaders in the existing literature. A matrix transformation is introduced to eliminate the coupling terms resulting from the simultaneous design of observers and controllers. A feasible condition on devising observers and controllers is obtained. Furthermore, the result is extended to deal with the case with transmission time delay.

The broadband beamformer coefficients are expressed as the sum of power-of-two terms with a restriction on the total number of power-of-two terms for the beamformer coefficients. An iterative algorithm is employed to reduce the number of nonzero coefficients and, thereby, multipliers in both the robust and nonrobust beamformers. A quantization scheme in combination with a random search is then applied to efficiently distribute the power-of-two terms for the beamformer coefficients. Design examples show that the number of nonzero coefficients for the beamformers can be significantly reduced without a significant degradation in the integral squared error. In addition, robust beamformers are shown to be less sensitive to nonzero coefficient reduction and quantization than nonrobust beamformers.	algorithm;beamforming;coefficient;computational complexity theory;elegant degradation;iterative method;least squares;power of two;quantization (signal processing);random search	Hai Huyen Dam;Sven Nordholm	2013	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2013.2285971	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics;iterative method	EDA	61.2329012453525	16.2701977213656	188058

This emanates from uniform-grid sampling but where some of the samples are missing. One application is found in time-interleaved analog-to-digital converters with missing samples due to calibration at certain time instances. The square of the L2-norms correspond to scaling of the round-off noise that in practice is always present at the input of the resampling filter. As will be shown through the derived bounds, the L2-norm of the corresponding filter that recovers the missing samples is generally much larger than unity. Consequently, the noise variance is generally much larger for the recovered samples than for the other samples obtained in the sampling process. Based on this observation, the paper also proposes an alternative resampling scheme for which the maximum of all L2-norms in the resampling is reduced.	analog-to-digital converter;image scaling;round-off error;sampling (signal processing)	Håkan Johansson;Anu Kalidas Muralidharan Pillai	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472535	econometrics;nonuniform sampling;resampling;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	55.615314846811	14.190522878821346	188388

To overcome these challenges, the present paper introduces a grid-based model in which the state captures target signal strengths on a known spatial grid (TSSG). This model leads to linear state and measurement equations, which bypass data association and can afford state estimation via sparsity-aware Kalman filtering (KF). Leveraging the grid-induced sparsity of the novel model, two types of sparsity-cognizant TSSG-KF trackers are developed: one effects sparsity through 1-norm regularization, and the other invokes sparsity as an extra measurement. Iterative extended KF and Gauss-Newton algorithms are developed for reduced-complexity tracking, along with accurate error covariance updates for assessing performance of the resultant sparsity-aware state estimators. Based on TSSG state estimates, more informative target position and track estimates can be obtained in a follow-up step, ensuring that track association and position estimation errors do not propagate back into TSSG state estimates. The novel TSSG trackers do not require knowing the number of targets or their signal strengths and exhibit considerably lower complexity than the benchmark hidden Markov model filter, especially for a large number of targets. Numerical simulations demonstrate that sparsity-cognizant trackers enjoy improved root-mean-square error performance at reduced complexity when compared to their sparsity-agnostic counterparts. Comparison with the recently developed additive likelihood moment filter reveals the better performance of the proposed TSSG tracker.	activity tracker;benchmark (computing);correspondence problem;gauss–newton algorithm;grid (spatial index);hidden markov model;information;kalman filter;markov chain;newton;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;resultant;simulation;sparse matrix;utility functions on indivisible goods	Shahrokh Farahmand;Georgios B.

Since the proposed exact ML estimator is computationally intensive, an approximate solution is proposed, originating from the analysis of the log-likelihood (LL) function in the single chirp signal case.

In this problem a convex cost functional of the control signals of the agents shall be minimized, while the outputs of the agents shall coincide at some given finite time. This is an instance of the rendezvous or finite time consensus problem. We solve this problem without any constraints on the communication topology and provide a solution as an explicit feedback control law for the case when the dynamics of the agents is output controllable. It turns out that the communication graph topology induced by the solution is complete. Based on this solution for the finite time consensus problem, we provide a solution to the case of infinite time horizon. Furthermore, we investigate under what circumstances it is possible to express the controller as a feedback control law of the output instead of the states.

The estimator incorporates an auxiliary model, which prevents the propagation of outliers. Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator for ARMA models that are driven by independently and identically distributed (iid) innovations with symmetric distributions are established. To analyze the infinitesimal effect of outliers on the estimator, the influence function is derived and computed explicitly for an AR(1) model with additive outliers. To obtain estimates for the AR(<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$p$</tex-math></inline-formula>) model, a robust Durbin–Levinson type and a forward–backward algorithm are proposed. An iterative algorithm to robustly obtain ARMA(<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$p,q$</tex-math></inline-formula>) parameter estimates is also presented. The problem of finding a robust initialization is addressed, which for orders <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$p+q > 2$</tex-math></inline-formula> is a nontrivial matter. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator to existing robust methodologies for different types of outliers both in terms of average and of worst case performance, as measured by the maximum bias curve. To illustrate the practical applicability of the proposed estimator, a real-data example of outlier cleaning for R–R interval plots derived from electrocardiographic data is considered. The proposed estimator is not limited to biomedical applications, but is also useful in any real-world problem whose observations can be modeled as an ARMA process disturbed by outliers or impulsive noise."""	autoregressive model;best, worst and average case;experiment;forward–backward algorithm;iterative method;levinson recursion;plasma cleaning;software propagation;strong consistency;utility functions on indivisible goods	Michael Muma;Abdelhak M.

Presented criterion function can show not only outside system output error but also inside parameters error in order to explain more difference between actual and estimative system. Identification algorithm may consist of many different PSO algorithms that are named the combinatorial PSO. The estimating and tracking of parameters make use of characteristics of different PSO algorithms. The simulation and result show that the identification algorithm for time-varying systems with noise was indeed more efficient and robust in combinatorial PSO comparing with the original particle swarm optimization.	algorithm;colors of noise;estimation theory;loss function;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;simulation	Weixing Lin;Peter Xiaoping Liu	2006		10.1007/978-0-387-36594-7_38	mathematical optimization;estimation theory;colors of noise;particle swarm optimization;mathematics	ML	57.50439427595061	9.311444922502785	189048

Analysis and synthesis are performed by two identical DFT polyphase filter banks providing a high computational efficiency. It is shown that cross-talk in a DFT polyphase transmultiplexer filter bank can be described by half-band bandpass filters and that cross-talk can be avoided independent of the filter characteristic if an appropriate subset of input signals are real and the remaining are imaginary. The channel transfer functions can be realized as pure delays by choosing the frequency response of the baseband prototype filter as a square root Nyquist system. Due to a remaining cross-talk between non-adjacent channels, which can be kept arbitrarily small, and due to deviations from the ideal Nyquist characteristic in case of linear phase analysis and synthesis filter banks, which can also be kept arbitrarily small, the resulting transmultiplexer filter bank performs not a perfect but an almost perfect reconstruction.

We first formulate the AOA localization problem within the framework of formation graph theory, which is an extension of the classical graph theory by incorporating the positional information of the vertices. Solving the AOA localization problem is equivalent to finding the solution to a system of linear equations. To avoid matrix inversion, we propose a continuous-time dynamics whose global asymptotic equilibrium is the desired localization. This dynamics turns out to have a very similar expression to that of the continuous-time consensus dynamics. The convergence and delay performance of the protocol is also studied. We finally argue that through optimizing the condition number of the stiffness matrix, the convergence and delay performance of the protocol can be simultaneously improved.	angle of arrival;condition number;consensus dynamics;graph theory;internationalization and localization;least-angle regression;linear equation;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;stiffness matrix;system of linear equations	Guangwei Zhu;Jianghai Hu	2013	2013 American Control Conference		communications protocol;mathematical optimization;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;mobile computing	Robotics	62.506903472160865	6.636974480221939	190835

The task of this filter is to provide relative position information over a relatively long period of time (tens of minutes). The filter consists of several partial state observers that, one after another, reconstruct key information for the whole state estimation. The observer relies on a sufficient condition to guarantee uniform complete observability of a general bounded linear time-varying system using (point-wise) differential rank conditions. From this condition, we construct a collection of filters well-suited for each possible trajectory of the vehicle. This results in temporally interconnected observers which are of the Kalman filter type. It is proven that each of them asymptotically converges to zero. We illustrate this design with trajectory estimation obtained on simulation data. Finally, experimental results using low-cost sensors show the potential and the relevance of the approach.	global positioning system;inertial navigation system;kalman filter;relevance;sensor;simulation;the filter;time complexity	Pierre-Jean Bristeau;Nicolas Petit;Laurent Praly	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5717848	kalman filter;control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory;extended kalman filter;filter design;alpha beta filter	Robotics	61.67136591999479	4.8856644636261395	191030

Here, we show that the mean-square error in the adaptive phase estimate may be further reduced for the stochastic noise process considered by using an optimal Kalman filter in the feedback loop. Further, the estimation process can be made robust to fluctuations in the underlying parameters of the noise process modulating the system phase to be estimated. This has been done using a guaranteed cost robust filter.	experiment;feedback;kalman filter;mean squared error;noise power;quantum system;smoothing	Shibdas Roy;Ian R.

However, the problem remains challenging for higher-order systems due to the complexity of consensus analysis and data rate minimization. In this paper, the leaderless and leader-following quantized consensus for a special kind of high-order systems are considered. Each agent is assumed to be controllable and observable with single input and single output, and its system matrix admits n identical eigenvalues of 1. The special case of n-th order integrator multi-agent system with only the first state variable being measurable is first investigated, and it is shown that for a fixed undirected connected network, n bits of information exchange between agents suffice to guarantee the leaderless and leader-following quantized consensus respectively with an exponential convergence rate by employing a suitable encoding-decoding scheme and perturbation analysis of matrices. The obtained results are then extended to the general case of multi-agent dynamics with n identical eigenvalues of 1 by applying the same encoding-decoding scheme and control protocol to an observer system for each agent. The final consensus value and the application to formation control are also discussed.	consensus (computer science);consensus dynamics;cultural consensus theory;data rate units;graph (discrete mathematics);information exchange;multi-agent system;observable;perturbation theory;rate of convergence;time complexity;uncompressed video	Zhirong Qiu;Yiguang Hong;Lihua Xie	2013	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760960	control engineering;information exchange;computer science;multi-agent system;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing;statistics	ML	65.241307595807	6.325482474590256	191579

The original problem is reduced to the filtering problem for an extended state vector that incorporates parameters as additional states. Since the noise intensities cannot be observable in the original linear system, the new quadratic vector variable formed by the diagonal of the matrix square of the system state is introduced. The obtained mean-square filter for the extended state vector also serves as the optimal identifier for the unknown parameters. Performance of the designed mean-square state filter and parameter identifier is verified in an illustrative example.	coefficient;identifier;linear system;mean squared error;numerical analysis;observable;quantum state;simulation;stochastic process;system of polynomial equations;the matrix;wiener filter	Michael V.

We show that both amplitude and fundamental frequency time variations can be compactly captured in a single time polynomial which modulates the fundamental harmonic component. A correct estimation of the fundamental frequency is assured through the fully automated spectral analysis method (ASA).The best-fit is easily obtained by linear least-squares, given the fact that the set of equations is linear-in-parameters. In contrast to the existing methods, the proposed approach is designed to properly describe harmonic structures in audio signals under conditions of both AM and FM modulations and low signal-to noise ratios.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;approximation;curve fitting;fm broadcasting;linear least squares (mathematics);polynomial;spectral density estimation;stationary process	Miroslav Zivanovic;Johan Schoukens	2009	2009 17th European Signal Processing Conference		mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;mathematics;fundamental frequency;statistics	Vision	56.20768637289865	15.520963241362828	191835

In pattern classification and signal registration applications, it is shown that for a particular class of signals, the binary filters yield the same asymptotic performance as the matched filter. It is hence adduced that a dynamic range of a single bit in the filter suffices for classification purposes. The effects of statistical sidelobe fluctuations and a finite system space-bandwidth product are included in the analysis. It is demonstrated that performance improves in a natural fashion with increase in the space-bandwidth product for both the binary filter and the matched filter. >		Santosh S.

The control law is based on some analytic potential functions, ensuring the boundedness of the control signal. It is assumed that the information flow graph is an undirected static tree. A detailed convergence analysis for the designed controllers is subsequently presented. The growth of the radius of the smallest circle centered at a fix point which contains all agents is shown to be bounded by a decaying exponential function. This result is used to show the boundedness of the trajectories of the agents. Some important properties of positive limit sets of nonlinear systems are then used to prove the convergence of the agents to consensus, under the proposed controllers.

The approach evaluates the Gaussian sum approximation of the a priori probability density function (pdf) by solving the Fokker-Planck equation numerically. Approximate evaluation of the a posteriori pdf is achieved by using Gaussian sums, a priori pdf and measurements in Bayes rule. Mean and covariance values of Gaussians are chosen by the help of an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), with respect to a region where a priori and a posteriori pdfs are approximated. Weights of the Gaussians are updated using the deterministically chosen grid points in the specified domains. UKF here acts as a one step look ahead mechanism to determine the high probability regions where a priori and a posteriori pdfs can reside. The a priori and a posteriori pdfs are approximated around these high probability regions. The developed approach is compared with UKF and Particle Filter in a one dimensional nonlinear system.	approximation algorithm;deterministic algorithm;kalman filter;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;particle filter;portable document format	Murat Gokce;Mustafa Kuzuoglu	2013	Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Information Fusion		econometrics;mathematical optimization;ensemble kalman filter;mathematics;extended kalman filter;statistics	Robotics	56.18328017899042	5.627981407166159	192120

Such mixture distributions are common for radio propagation in mixed line- and non-line-of-sight environments. The newly derived BCRB is tighter than earlier more general bounds proposed in literature, and thus gives a more realistic bound on actual estimation performance. The resulting BCRB can be used to compute a lower bound on root mean square error of position estimates in a large class of radio localization applications. We illustrate this on an archetypical tracking application using a nearly constant velocity model and time of arrival observations.	approximation algorithm;bim;line-of-sight (missile);markov chain;mean squared error;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;process modeling;simulation;software propagation;time of arrival;velocity (software development)	Carsten Fritsche;Anja Klein;Fredrik Gustafsson	2013	IEEE Wireless Communications Letters	10.1109/WCL.2013.032013.130073	speech recognition;machine learning;mathematics;tracking;markov process;statistics	Metrics	54.433375185549785	5.047403801026615	192307

Unfortunately, noise statistics are usually unknown and have to be determined from output measurements. Current expectation maximization (EM) based algorithms for estimating noise covariances for nonlinear systems assume the number of additive process and output noise signals are the same as the number of states and outputs, respectively. However, in some applications, the number of additive process noises could be less than the number of states. In this paper, a more general nonlinear system is considered by allowing the number of process and output noises to be smaller or equal to the number of states and outputs, respectively. In order to estimate noise covariances, a semi-definite programming solver is applied, since an analytical solution is no longer easy to obtain. The expectation step in current EM algorithms rely on state estimates from the extended Kalman filter (EKF) or smoother. However, the instability and divergence problems of the EKF could cause the EM algorithm to converge to a local optimum that is far away from true values. We use moving horizon estimation instead of the EKF/smoother so that the accuracy of the covariance estimation in nonlinear systems can be significantly improved.	expectation–maximization algorithm;nonlinear system	Ming Ge;Eric C.

Two assumptions are made on the statistics of the input signal. 1) The input sequence is a wide-sense stationary vector process of dimension k. 2) The input vectors are statistically independent. With these assumptions and from the characterizing matrices of the Mealy machine, the method developed by Cariolaro and Tronca can be readily used. The continuous and discrete components of the spectrum of the coded signal are expressed in matrix form, which is particularly appropriate for computer programming.	computer programming;convolutional code;electronic component;encoder;generator matrix;independent set (graph theory);mealy machine;noise reduction;stationary process;wiener filter	Pierre Comon;Jean-Louis Lacoume	1986	IEEE Trans.

The optimal coefficients are selected by assuming that the excitation signal has a t-distribution t(/spl alpha/) with /spl alpha/ degrees of freedom. With /spl alpha/=/spl infin/, we get the RLS method. Simulation results show that the obtained estimates using the proposed method with small /spl alpha/ are more efficient, and the standard deviation (SD) of the estimation results is smaller and more accurate than that with large /spl alpha/. The proposed estimator with small /spl alpha/ is also more efficient and more accurate than the recursive method based on Huber's M estimate. Two approaches are used, i.e., the infinite memory and the exponentially weighted approaches.	autoregressive model;recursion;time series	Junibakti Sanubari;Keiichi Tokuda;Mahoki Onoda	1998	IEEE Trans.

Each agent is described by a discrete-time single integrator and endowed with a quadratic objective function which is private to itself. For each agent, we develop two bounded distributed protocols: bounded proportional–integral (PI) protocol and bounded integral (I) protocol, based on the information received from its neighboring agents through the communication network and the gradient of its own objective function. We show that the proposed bounded distributed protocols with properly chosen parameters solve the global optimal consensus problem, i.e., the multi-agent system achieves consensus at a state that minimizes the sum of the objective functions, if the directed communication network is strongly connected and detailed balanced.	multi-agent system	Tao Yang;Yan Wan;Hong Wang;Zongli Lin	2018	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2018.08.017	discrete time and continuous time;telecommunications network;mathematical optimization;integrator;control theory;pi;multi-agent system;mathematics;bounded function;consensus;strongly connected component	AI	64.36337397505004	6.63898626581365	193066

We will show that it has been derived under an erroneous assumption, and we also give a counterexample to show that it does not yield a consistent order estimate in general. Two linear approaches for parameter estimation have also been presented in the paper.’ We point out that an existing counterexample to an earlier version of one of the algorithms also applies to both the approaches of the above paper. H ( z ) is the transfer function of the underlying noncausal ARMA model (see ( IC) and ( Id) in the paper), and the symbol * denotes convolution. This claim is false. The correct maximum orderp, is given by The p + causal poles of H(z) yield the p’(p’ + 1 ) / 2 causal poles of H2(z , n), and similarly for the anticausal poles. The “interaction” between the causal and the anticausal poles of H(z) does not contribute any poles to H2(z, n). We refer the reader to [ l ] for details. Here we will illustrate this with a simple example of a noncausal AR(2) model that has one causal pole and one anticausal pole, i .e. , p + = 1, p= 1, a n d p = 2. (Note that since this is an AR model, we have B(z) = 1 so that there is no cancellation between B(z) and A2(z-’, n) for any n.) We consider an AR(2) model with the transfer function It has a causal pole at 0.5 and an anticausal pole at 2.5.

The problem is motivated by the practical need to parsimoniously characterise time-varying nonlinear systems. A significant advantage of the approach is that only a single input-output record is required to obtain least-squares estimates of the model parameters. The judicious selection of basis sequence is also discussed. The method represents a simple and practical time-varying nonlinear system identification procedure. Examples are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the technique.	approximation;nonlinear system	Jonathon C. Ralston;Boualem Boashash;Abdelhak M.

The first online estimator is based on the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) technique and uses a set of sufficient statistics to carry the information about the transition matrix. A deterministic variant of the SMC estimator is then developed, which is simpler to implement and offers superior performance. Finally, a novel approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm is proposed. These algorithms offer a solution to the problem of estimating the number of competing terminals in an IEEE 802.11 network where better performance can be expected if the backoff parameters are adapted to the number of active users. Realistic simulations using the ns-2 network simulator are provided to demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed estimators.	approximation algorithm;backoff;hidden markov model;markov chain;monte carlo method;signal processing;simulation;stochastic matrix	Tom Vercauteren;Alberto López Toledo;Xiaodong Wang	2005	Proceedings.

A zero-phase 1D filter is derived, whose frequency response is real and approximates to a certain accuracy the magnitude of the initial 1D prototype, using a convenient change of variable and a Chebyshev-Pade rational approximation. As prototype filters, we use elliptic and inverse Chebyshev filters, which are very efficient.

We propose distributed algorithms that operate over static topologies, for solving the weight-balancing problem when the weights are either non-negative real numbers or when they are restricted to be non-negative integers. For the case of real weights, the proposed algorithm is shown to admit a geometric convergence rate. For the case of integer weights, the proposed algorithm is shown to converge after a finite number of iterations that we explicitly bound. We also provide examples to illustrate the operation, performance, and potential advantages of the proposed algorithms.	computer performance;consensus dynamics;converge;directed graph;distributed algorithm;distributed computing;internet;iteration;mathematical optimization;rate of convergence;transmitter;weight-balanced tree	Apostolos I.

The proposed idea is to replace each unit delay operator in a fixed-coefficient FIR filter with the 2nd order FIR fractional delay (FD) structure and the cutoff frequency, ƒc of the filter is changed by changing the FD value. The change in FD results in change in amplitude and length of an impulse response. This in turn changes ƒc and transition bandwidth (TBW) of an FIR filter. The mathematical relation between cut-off frequency, TBW and FD value D is derived. The design example shows that the proposed method provides very fine control over ƒc.	bandwidth (signal processing);coefficient;digital filter;filter design;finite impulse response;frequency response	Sumit Jagdish Darak;A.

This strengthens earlier results which only considered an infinite number of samples. The proof is based on the linearization technique of the analytical constant modulus algorithm (ACMA), together with a simple inductive argument. We then study the finite-alphabet case. In this case, we provide a subexponentially decaying upper bound on the probability of nonidentifiability for a finite number of samples. We show that under practical assumptions, this upper bound is tighter than the currently known bound. We then provide an improved exponentialy decaying upper bound for the case of -PSK signals ( is even).	algorithm;inductive reasoning;modulus of continuity	Amir Leshem;Nicolas Petrochilos;Alle-Jan van der Veen	2003	IEEE Trans.

We employ a parameterization, particularly suitable for system identification, which has the following properties: observability, match-point controllability, and matchability. Using it, the number of model parameters is kept to a minimum, no undesired pole-zero cancellations can appear, and the use of nonlinear estimation is not necessary. We relate this parameterization to classical autoregressive model structures, and propose an algorithm for parameter estimation. By means of Monte Carlo simulations it is found that the algorithm is promising: fewer data points and lower signal-to-noise ratio are required to obtain results that are similar or better than those obtained by traditional methods.	algorithm;autoregressive model;data point;estimation theory;monte carlo method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;observable;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;state space;system identification	Rodrigo Alvite Romano;Felipe Pait	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760083	econometrics;mathematical optimization;observability;controllability;control theory;mathematics;linear system;estimation theory;monte carlo method	Robotics	57.11898346865371	8.893460143781521	196494
cc2125fae706a10ef3ed86ada9fb164af09eb9fa	adaptive sparse system identification in compressed space	sparse system;random filter optimization;compressed sensing;adaptive identification;lti system	In this paper, we propose a method for adaptive identification of sparse systems. The method requires low number of filter weights, significantly less than the number of taps of sparse system. The approach is based on compressed sensing (CS) technique. In fact, we adaptively estimate a compressed version of high dimensional sparse system. The aim is accomplished by using the structure of random filter and an interpolator at the transmission line. They are arranged such that the linear time invariant (LTI) property of the overall system (compressed system) is preserved. The unique features of the identification in the reduced dimensions are investigated. Stability in high convergence rates and robustness against highly correlated input signals are two important advantages of the proposed method. Furthermore, we propose a modified algorithm for optimization of the random filter and illustrate its impact by numerical results. Two appropriate reconstruction algorithms are evaluated for recovery of original sparse system. Simulation results indicate that at low levels of sparsity, the proposed approach outperforms the conventional least mean square (LMS) method and has comparable performance with the regularized LMS algorithms, only by half number of the filter weights.	sparse;system identification	Seyed Hossein Hosseini;Mahrokh G.

Many of the traditional denoising methods use linear methods such as Wiener filtering. Recently, nonlinear methods, especially those based on wavelets, have become increasingly popular, due to a number of advantages over the linear methods. It has been shown that wavelet-thresholding has near-optimal properties in the minimax sense, and guarantees a better rate of convergence, despite its simplicity. Even though much work has been done in the field of wavelet-thresholding, most of it was focused on statistical modeling of the wavelet coefficients and the optimal choice of the thresholds. We propose a custom thresholding function which can improve the denoised results significantly. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the advantage of the new thresholding function.	additive white gaussian noise;coefficient;minimax;noise reduction;nonlinear system;rate of convergence;simulation;statistical model;thresholding (image processing);utility functions on indivisible goods;wavelet;wiener filter	Byung-Jun Yoon;Palghat P.

The algorithm is derived using a least mean p-power error criterion. It reduces to the conventional LMS algorithm when p takes on 2. It is revealed by both analytical results and extensive simulations that the new algorithm for p - 3,4 generates much improved DFC estimates in moderate and high SNR environments compared to the LMS algorithm, while both have similar degrees of complexity. Assuming the Gaussian property of the estimation error, the proposed algorithm including the LMS algorithm is analyzed in detail. Elegant dynamic equations and closed form noise misadjustment expressions are derived and clarified.	adaptive algorithm;additive white gaussian noise;coefficient;discrete fourier transform;fourier analysis;least mean squares filter;mean squared error;quasiperiodicity;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;time-scale calculus;utility functions on indivisible goods	Yegui Xiao;Katsunori Shida	1998	9th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 1998)		mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;mathematics;statistics	EDA	58.4628525198104	13.343734749307544	196844

The autoconvolution with the autocorrelation provides a second-order description that discriminates between deterministic and stochastic signals - even those with identical power spectra. We also introduce the panorama as the Fourier transform of the autoconvolution. The power spectrum and panorama admit a two-dimensional spectral representation that has unique and powerful properties, such as detecting deterministic sinusoidal components in correlated stochastic noise without knowledge of the sinusoidal frequencies or amplitudes.

As a result least-squares criteria are commonly used for estimating the system parameters. In this paper we will describe methods that are based on uniformly distributed system inputs. The estimates of the system parameters will then be found from min/max operations on linear combinations of the output samples. A new method for solving the resulting min/max problems is described and the min/max criterion is used in an application where it performs better than the commonly used least-squares criterion.	estimation theory;maxima and minima	Per Hedelin;Gunnar Hult	1983		10.1109/ICASSP.1983.1172174	econometrics;mathematical optimization;information theory;computer science;mathematics;restricted maximum likelihood;maximum likelihood;likelihood function;quasi-maximum likelihood;maximum likelihood sequence estimation;estimation theory;statistics	Vision	56.287650528896854	8.691861379271188	197677

In this paper the stationary point of a modified adaptive algorithm by splitting the delay in the conventional one is derived by a direct method considering the causality constraint and an explicit expression of the bias is obtained. Also, a stability condition is mentioned. Then, when the input signal to hearing aids is a moving average (MA) process or an autoregressive (AR) process, unbiased algorithms for identification of the feedback path are proposed.

By using insight into the nature of the problem and basic probability, a procedure that greatly reduces the number of filters required by multiple model approaches is obtained. This allows for a much longer detection horizon without increasing the computational requirements and results in improved performance over standard multiple model approaches. The performance of this approach is evaluated for state/parameter estimation of a heptane to toluene aromatization process. The method is also shown to be robust to errors in the assumed noise statistics.	additive white gaussian noise;computation;effective method;estimation theory;extended kalman filter;ibm notes;nonlinear system;optimal control;recursion (computer science);requirement;utility functions on indivisible goods	Douglas G.

By making use of the time-scale separation properties of such networks, we design state-feedback controllers at the cluster level to guarantee stability in the presence of time varying delays in the inter-cluster feedback channels. Applying results from singular perturbation theory, we show that when these individual controllers are implemented on the actual network model, the closed-loop response is close to that obtained from the approximate models, provided that the clustering is strong and the time delay is below the maximum limit. The design procedure is demonstrated by a simulation example.	aggregate function;approximation algorithm;broadcast delay;cluster analysis;cobham's thesis;distributed control system;fitness approximation;interconnection;network model;numerical analysis;perturbation theory;robust control;simulation;sparse matrix	Almuatazbellah M.

Regarding a practice related application of the developed algorithms, it is shown how the convex direct current optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problem can be solved distributedly with event-triggered and local communication in a multi-agent network. Moreover, the combined application with a decomposition technique for linear matrix inequalities is described which enables to distributedly solve a semidefinite dual of the nonconvex alternating current optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem with (close to) local and eventtriggered communication. Numerical results for these applications confirm the good properties of the developed algorithms and show that event-triggered communication yields a considerable reduction of the information exchange in the optimization process.	adaptive stepsize;algorithm;convex optimization;information exchange;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;numerical method;optimization problem	Martin Meinel	2016			electric power system;separable space;convex optimization;mathematical optimization;mathematics	ML	64.69161747636416	9.22288167401934	198311

First, the resampling algorithm is analyzed from a new viewpoint and its defects are demonstrated. Then some exquisite work is introduced in order to overcome these defects such as comparing the weights of particles by stages and constructing the new particles based on quasi-Monte Carlo method, from which an exquisite resampling (ER) algorithm is derived. Compared to the resampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm can maintain the diversity of particles thus avoid the sample impoverishment in particle filters, and can obtain the same estimation accuracy through less number of sample particles. These advantages are finally verified by simulations of non-stationary growth model and a re-entry ballistic object tracking.	algorithm;erdős–rényi model;monte carlo method;particle filter;population dynamics;quasi-monte carlo method;resampling (statistics);simulation;stationary process	Xiaoyan Fu;Yingmin Jia	2010	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2010.2053031	econometrics;mathematical optimization;particle filter;auxiliary particle filter;computer science;signal processing;mathematics;accuracy and precision;statistics;monte carlo method	Visualization	54.95250022951951	4.97512376332417	198864

At each sensor, this uncertainty in the observations is modeled by a sequence of Bernoulli random variables correlated at consecutive sampling times. To estimate the signal, recursive filtering and (fixed-point and fixed-interval) smoothing algorithms are derived without requiring the knowledge of the signal state-space model but only the means and covariance functions of the processes involved in the observation equations, the uncertainty probabilities and the correlation between the variables modeling the uncertainty. To measure the estimation accuracy, recursive expressions for the estimation error covariance matrices are also proposed. The theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical simulation example where a signal is estimated from observations featuring correlated uncertainty and coming from two sensors with different uncertainty characteristics. & 2008 Elsevier B.V.

3fd8d9163ebbd5d49519f063aacca944715e40cc	asymptotic robustness in consensus networks		We consider the problem of asymptotic robustness in large consensus networks that occur in many areas such as distributed optimization. Robustness, in this context, is the scaling of performance measures, e.g.: $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ -norm, as a function of network dimension. We provide a formal framework to quantify the relation between such performance scaling and the convergence speed of the network. Specifically, we provide upper and lower bounds for the convergence speed in terms of robustness and discuss how these bounds scale with the network topology. The main contribution of this work is that we obtain tight bounds, that hold regardless of network topology.

The power complementarity requirement is needed to preserve the whiteness of the channel noise at the beamformer output, which allows the application of optimum trellis-based equalizers to the output signal. The power complementarity property imposes non-negative definite quadratic constraints on the beamforming filters so that the beamformer design is expressed as a constrained quadratic optimization problem. Two approaches are proposed to solve this problem. The first method is a Lagrangian relaxation technique, which exploits the fact that the dual mathematical problem reduces to the unconstrained minimization of a convex function over a convex domain. A second approach employs a cascaded lattice representation of the power complementary filterbank and performs the beamformer design incrementally, one lattice stage at a time.	beamforming;complementarity theory;convex function;convex set;filter bank;finite impulse response;lagrangian relaxation;linear programming relaxation;mathematical optimization;noise (electronics);optimization problem;trellis quantization	Mutlu Koca;Bernard C.

Based on the affine Wigner distributions of J. and P. Bertrand, these new time-scale distributions support efficient online operation at the same computational cost as the continuous wavelet transform. Moreover, they take advantage of the proportional bandwidth smoothing inherent in the sliding structure of their implementation to suppress cumbersome interference components. To formalize their place within the echelon of the affine class of time-scale distributions (TSD’s), we introduce and study an alternative set of generators for this class.	algorithmic efficiency;bertrand (programming language);continuous wavelet;interference (communication);kernel (operating system);row echelon form;smoothing;spectral density estimation;tsd;wavelet transform;wigner distribution function	Paulo Gonçalves;Richard G.

In this paper, we propose a Kalman filter based fast noise suppression algorithm for white and colored disturbance. The algorithm aims to achieve robust noise suppression with reduced computational complexity without sacrificing high quality of speech signal, by modifying the proposed canonical space model. We show the effectiveness of the proposed fast noise suppression algorithm using numerical and subjective evaluation results.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;display resolution;fast fourier transform;filter design;kalman filter;numerical analysis;zero suppression	Nari Tanabe;Toshihiro Furukawa;Shigeo Tsujii	2008	2008 Second International Symposium on Universal Communication	10.1109/ISUC.2008.34	electronic engineering;speech recognition;fast kalman filter;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;moving horizon estimation	EDA	61.461172510272576	14.402466278199482	199869

Recently introduced method referred to as the polynomial beamformer (PB) being the maximum likelihood estimator for these parameters suffers from high computational complexity due to a multidimensional search. Hence, its applicability is limited only to the second-order PPSs while it is unfeasible for higher-order PPSs as it is heavily reliant on the PPS order. A low complexity estimator that utilizes similar strategy as the PB is proposed in this paper. Statistical study shows that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold and mean-squared error (MSE).	analysis of algorithms;beamforming;coefficient;computational complexity theory;direction of arrival;error detection and correction;loss function;mean squared error;optimization problem;polynomial;signal-to-noise ratio	Predrag Rakovic;Marko Simeunovic;Igor Djurovic	2017	Signal Processing	10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.12.015	mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;mathematics;estimation theory;direction of arrival;statistics	AI	54.642468255062596	10.926165346188183	199945

Employing the Lyapunov function approach with some graph theory techniques, we improve the so-called connection graph stability method for the synchronization analysis, that was originally developed by Belykh et al. for symmetrically linear coupled dynamical systems, to fit the asymmetrically nonlinear coupled case. We derive some criteria that ensure the nonlinearly coupled as well as linearly coupled dynamical systems to be globally exponentially synchronized. An illustrative example of a regular network with a modular structure of nonlinearly coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neurons is provided. We further consider a small-world dynamical network of nonlinearly coupled Chua’s circuits and demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that the small-world dynamical network is easier to synchronize than the original regular dynamical network. More interestingly, numerical results of a real-world network of the cat cortex modeled by the asymmetrically linear coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo equations are also presented.	chua's circuit;complex network;coupled cluster;dynamical system;fitzhugh–nagumo model;graph theory;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;synchronization (computer science);time complexity	Chun-Hsien Li;Suh-Yuh Yang	2011	J.
