a674b940c225b06c20031047ac69ac53032b571d	fixed-order controller design for siso systems using monte carlo technique		A novel randomized approach to fixed-order controller design is proposed for discrete-time SISO plants. It is based on the Monte Carlo sampling Schur stable polynomials using so-called Fam–Meditch parametrization and projecting them onto the affine set of closed-loop characteristic polynomials, which is defined by the controller parameters. If the sampling-projecting procedure fails to find a stabilizing controller, certain candidate controllers are then locally optimized by means of an iterative method of nonsmooth optimization.

c977f2fc6bedc51cf5041dde3f213ffb26ed0055	non-periodic transition-tracking switching via learning-based decomposition: high-speed nano-positioning experiment example		In this paper, the tracking problem involving nonperiodic tracking-transition switching is considered from a learning-based decomposition viewpoint. Non-periodic tracking-transition occurs in applications where precision tracking of a given desired trajectory in sections is intermediated to rapid transition of the output with given boundary conditions. The control challenges arise as the tracking and the transition sections are coupled together, post-switching oscillations of the output can be induced due to the mismatch of the boundary states, and the tracking performance can be limited by the nonminimum-phase zeros. Although these challenges have been tackled recently by combining the system-inversion with optimization technique, the solution obtained involves heavy online computation, and can be sensitive to model uncertainties. This work aims to overcome these limitations through a learning-based decomposition approach, where a library of input-output elements is constructed offline via iterative learning a priori, and then used online to both decompose the desired output (in tracking sections), design and optimize the desired transition output (in transition sections), and synthesize the control input based on the superposition principle. The proposed approach is demonstrated through experiment implementation on a piezoelectric actuator.	algorithm;computation;error detection and correction;experiment;gnu nano;iterative method;linear system;mathematical optimization;minimum phase;online and offline;pid;piezoelectricity;rise time;superposition principle	Jiangbo Liu;Qingze Zou	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431505	control theory;iterative learning control;periodic graph (geometry);control engineering;computer science;robustness (computer science);boundary value problem;actuator;oscillation;superposition principle;trajectory	Robotics	68.0870698987469	-6.456023445040932	49891

Different from canonical-form nonlinear systems whose neural network approximation models have explicit relative degrees, non-canonical form nonlinear systems usually do not have such a feature, nor do their approximation models which are also in non-canonical forms. For adaptive control of non-canonical form neural network system models with uncertain parameters, this paper develops a new adaptive feedback linearization based control scheme, by specifying relative degrees and establishing a normal form of such systems, deriving a new system re-parametrization needed for adaptive control design, and constructing a stable controller for which an uncertain control gain matrix is handled using a matrix decomposition technique. System stability and tracking performance is analyzed. A detailed example with simulation results is presented to show the control design procedure and desired system performance.	a-normal form;approximation;artificial neural network;input/output;mimo;nonlinear system;simulation	Yanjun Zhang;Gang Tao;Mou Chen;Zehui Mao	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7525385	control engineering;mathematical optimization;adaptive control;nonlinear system;networked control system;control theory;mathematics;matrix decomposition;statistics;mimo	Robotics	64.7880439874614	-4.7988455901242935	50109

The closed-loop properties amenable to the proposed technique include global and local stability, performance with respect to a given cost function (both in a deterministic and stochastic setting) and the L2 gain. The method applies to a wide range of practical control problems: For instance, a dynamical controller (e.g., a PID) plus input saturation, model predictive control with state estimation, inexact model and soft constraints, or a general optimization-based controller where the underlying problem is solved with a fixed number of iterations of a first-order method are all amenable to the proposed approach. The approach is based on the observation that the control input generated by an optimization-based controller satisfies the associated Karush-KuhnTucker (KKT) conditions which, provided all data is polynomial, are a system of polynomial equalities and inequalities. The closed-loop properties can then be analyzed using sum-of-squares (SOS) programming.	dynamical system;first-order predicate;game controller;interior point method;iteration;karush–kuhn–tucker conditions;loss function;mathematical optimization;mesh analysis;pid;parsing;polynomial;semidefinite programming	Milan Korda;Colin Neil Jones	2017	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2016.12.008	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear control;stochastic control;engineering;stochastic optimization;control theory;mathematics;explained sum of squares;model predictive control	Robotics	63.12145090930379	-0.7324196000829509	50219

Moreover, controller gains are calculated based on a convex optimization method by solving a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI).

For each agent, an FD filter is designed that receives the output measurements from its neighboring agents whenever specific event conditions are satisfied. With our proposed methodology all agents collaborate with one another to detect the occurrence of faults in the team and each agent not only can detect its own fault but also is capable of detecting its neighbor's fault. The filter parameters and the event conditions are designed such that a mixed H∞/H- performance index is guaranteed and it is shown that by using an event-triggered technique, the amount of data that is sent by each agent to its neighboring agents is dramatically decreased. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of the problem are obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) where extended LMI characterizations are used to reduce the conservativeness of the multi-objective H∞/H- problem. Simulation results corresponding to a team of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles demonstrate and illustrate the effectiveness and capabilities of the proposed methodology.	autonomous robot;fault detection and isolation;linear matrix inequality;multi-agent system;sensor;simulation;unmanned aerial vehicle	S.

Firstly, the concepts of singular stochastic finite-time boundedness and singular stochastic finite-time H∞ stabilization via observer-based state feedback are given. Then an observer-based state feedback controller is designed to ensure singular stochastic finite-time H∞ stabilization via observer-based state feedback of the resulting closed-loop error dynamic SMJS. Sufficient criteria are presented for the solvability of the problem, which can be reduced to a feasibility problem involving linear matrix inequalities with a fixed parameter. As an auxiliary result, we also discuss the problem of finite-time stabilization via observer-based state feedback of a class of SMJSs and give sufficient conditions of singular stochastic finite-time stabilization via observer-based state feedback for the class of SMJSs. Finally, illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed techniques.		Yingqi Zhang;Wei Cheng;Xiaowu Mu;Xiulan Guo	2012	J.

Given an extended relative degree condition, it is possible to propose necessary and sufficient (NAS) conditions for robust ILC convergence. The tracking error bound is shown to depend continuously on the bounds of the iteration-dependent uncertainties. When the iteration-dependent uncertainties are bounded, NAS conditions exist to guarantee bounded system trajectories and output tracking error. If the iteration-dependent uncertainties converge, then NAS conditions ensure bounded system trajectories and zero output tracking error. The results are also extended to a class of affine nonlinear systems satisfying a Lipschitz condition. Simulation tests on a representative batch process demonstrate the validity of the obtained robust ILC convergence results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The motivation for studying this control problem is the presence of delayed measurements in feedback control of large-scale chemical processes and the potential use of sensors and actuators in industrial applications to improve closed-loop performance. Under the assumption that there exists an upper bound on the maximum measurement delay, we design an iterative DMPC system for nonlinear systems subject to delayed state feedback. The design takes advantage of bi-directional communication between the distributed controllers used in the iterative DMPC system. Sufficient conditions under which the proposed distributed control design guarantees that the states of the closed-loop system are ultimately bounded in a region that contains the origin are provided. The theoretical results are illustrated through a catalytic alkylation of benzene process.	as-interface;distributed control system;feedback;iteration;iterative method;nonlinear system	Jinfeng Liu;Xianzhong Chen;David Muñoz de la Peña;Panagiotis D.

0f140aaea05c7727478414f4be4a7b38e5dd7f89	fault detection for discrete piecewise linear systems with infinite distributed time-delays		ABSTRACTIn this paper, the fault detection problem is investigated for a class of discrete-time piecewise linear systems with external disturbances and infinite distributed time-delays. As a modelling framework, piecewise linear system often arise when piecewise linear components are encountered, such as dead-zone, saturation, relays and hysteresis. The time-delays are assumed to be infinitely distributed in the discrete-time domain. The aim of this paper is to detect the possible faults and to estimate the system state. For this purpose, firstly, stability analysis is given based on a piecewise smooth Lyapunov function. Afterward, an appropriate approach of fault detection and filter design problem is provided to achieve a satisfactory balance between the disturbances attenuation level γ and the sensitivity to the fault for piecewise linear systems. As a consequence, a sufficient condition is obtained in terms of the linear matrix inequalities such that, for all admissible infinite distributed time-delay...	linear system;piecewise linear continuation	Jiajia Li;Xinli Wang;Fei Han;Guoliang Wei	2017	Int.

We propose to use a modular approach: We first design a robust nonlinear state feedback that renders the closed loop input-to-state stable (ISS). Here, the input is considered to be the estimation error of the uncertain parameters, and the state is considered to be the closed-loop output tracking error. Next, we augment this robust ISS controller with a model-free learning algorithm to estimate the model uncertainties. We implement this method with two different learning approaches. The first one is a model-free multi-parametric extremum seeking (MES) method and the second is a Bayesian optimization-based method called Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GPUCB).

Although the SDRE solution of the non-linear benchmark problem was derived using the tools of optimal control, the SDRE control law is not the solution of any optimal control problem. The new control law is obtained by approximating the existing SDRE control law in the least square sense from the class of control laws that are of the form required for them to be solutions of optimal control problems. Using the sum of squares tools the optimality criterion is calculated. As a byproduct, the stability of the approximating control law is established over a subset of the non-linear benchmark problem's state space.	approximation;approximation algorithm;benchmark (computing);least squares;linear programming relaxation;loss function;nonlinear system;optimal control;optimality criterion;polynomial;simulation;state space	Gyorgy Hexner	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160325	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;least squares;statistics	Robotics	63.30535139081082	-1.2332068026103074	51924

First, fuzzy logic models are used to approximate the output probability density functions (PDFs) of non-Gaussian processes such that the task of PDF shape control can be reduced to a fuzzy weight dynamics modeling and control problem. Next, Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models with multiple disturbances are employed to describe the nonlinear relations between fuzzy weight dynamics and the control input, in which a novel disturbance-observer-based PI-type fuzzy feedback controller is designed to ensure the system stability and convergence of the tracking error to zero. Meanwhile, the disturbance estimation and attenuation performance as well as the state constrained requirement can also be guaranteed. Moreover, the novel composite observer is constructed by augmenting the disturbance estimation into the full-state estimation. The satisfactory tracking performance and full-state observation effect can be achieved by the designed optimization algorithm. Finally, simulations for paper-making process are given to show the efficiency of the proposed approach.	approximation algorithm;control theory;fuzzy logic;gaussian process;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;portable document format;rejection sampling;simulation;stochastic control	Yang Yi;Wei Xing Zheng;Changyin Sun;Lei Guo	2016	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2459755	fuzzy logic;stochastic process;mathematical optimization;probability density function;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;computer science;fuzzy number;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy control system;statistics	Robotics	63.58831220758701	-5.38463260097598	52326

There are  N  potentially possible disturbance inputs of a system on each of which may act a disturbance from a certain class. A disturbance attenuation level is defined for each channel as an induced norm of the operator mapping signals of the corresponding class to the objective output of the system. Necessary conditions of the Pareto optimality are derived. It is established that the optimal solutions with respect to a multi-objective cost parameterized by weights from an  N -dimensional simplex are Pareto suboptimal solutions and their relative losses compared to the Pareto optimal ones do not exceed  1 − N ∕ N . These results are extended to the case when the disturbances acting on different inputs are combined into coalitions. The approach is applied to multiple classes of  L 2 -bounded and impulsive disturbances for which the  H ∞ ∕ γ 0  optimal controllers as the Pareto suboptimal solutions are synthesized in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed.	pareto efficiency	Dmitry V. Balandin;Mark M.

The MPC using this type of cost (informally dubbed ℓasso-MPC) is suitable, for instance, for redundantly-actuated systems. This is because of its ability to select a set of preferred actuators, leaving the other ones at rest for most of the time. The proposed approach aims to recover from state constraint violation and to track a changing set-point. Nominal stability is guaranteed for all feasible references and robustness to additive uncertainties is formally characterised, under certain assumptions. In particular, sufficient conditions are given for the feasible region to be robustly invariant, this region being larger than the MPC for regulation. The closed-loop system is input-to-state stable (ISS), and a local ISS gain is computed. All results apply to stabilisable LTI systems. Results hold as well for the more common quadratic MPC, a special case of the proposed controller.	feasible region;language technologies institute;lasso;linear time-invariant theory;robustness (computer science);utility functions on indivisible goods	Marco Gallieri;Jan M.

A dynamic discrete event-triggered scheme is designed to choose the transmitted data for different Markovian jumping modes. The time-delay modelling method is employed to describe the event-triggered scheme and the network-related behaviour, such as transmission delay, data package dropout and disorder, into a networked Markovian time-delay jump system. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee that the resulting filtering error system is stochastically stable with a prescribed performance index. A co-design method for the H∞ filter and the event-triggered scheme is then proposed. The effectiveness and potential of the theoretic results obtained are illustrated by a simulation example.	algorithm;broadcast delay;dropout (neural networks);network packet;numerical analysis	Huijiao Wang;Peng Shi;Ramesh K.

We begin with training a recurrent neurocontroller for robustness on high-fidelity models of physical systems. For training, we use a recently developed derivative-free Kalman filter method which we enhance for controller training. After training, we fix weights of our recurrent neurocontroller and deploy it in an embedded environment. Then, we carry out additional training of the neurocontroller by adapting in real time its internal state (short-term memory), rather than its weights (long-term memory). Such real-time training is done with a new combination of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) and adaptive critic. Our critic is also a recurrent neural network (RNN), and it is trained by stochastic meta-descent (SMD) for increased efficiency. Our approach is applied to two important practical problems, electronic throttle control and hybrid electric vehicle control, with apparent performance improvement.	acclimatization;actuator device component;adaptive algorithm;anatomic node;appendix;artificial neural network;attempt;biological neural networks;column (database);control system;controllers;dynamical system;embedded system;embedding;index;kalman filter;long short-term memory;lookup table;memory, long-term;node - plant part;nonlinear system;online and offline;overhead (computing);pseudocode;quantity;random neural network;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;recurrent neural network;service mapping description;simulation;simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation;stage level 1;stage level 2;weight	Danil V.

But numerous repetitive experiments are required to make a lookup table, and the program size becomes bulky. In this paper, analytic methods for finding the loss-minimizing solution are studied. Since the solution lies either in the interior or on the voltage limit boundary, two different cases are dealt with separately. In both cases, fourth-order polynomials are derived. To obtain approximate solutions, methods of order reduction and linear approximation are utilized. The accuracies are good enough for practical use. These approximate solutions are fused into a proposed loss-minimizing algorithm and implemented in an inverter digital signal processor. Experiments were done with a real PMSM developed for a sport utility fuel cell electric vehicle. The analytically derived minima were justified by experimental evidences, and the dynamic performances over a wide range of speed were shown to be satisfactory.	approximation algorithm;digital signal processor;experiment;linear approximation;lookup table;maxima and minima;performance;polynomial;power inverter;principle of good enough;signal processing	Junggi Lee;Kwanghee Nam;Seoho Choi;Soonwoo Kwon	2008	IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics	10.1109/08IAS.2008.226	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;mathematics	Visualization	58.27206643918005	-2.977519672523024	52905

For nonsymmetric input nonlinearities of saturation and deadzone, variable structure control (VSC) in combination with backstepping and Lyapunov synthesis is proposed for adaptive NN control design with guaranteed stability. In the proposed adaptive NN control, the usual assumption on nonsingularity of NN approximation for unknown control coefficient matrices and boundary assumption between NN approximation error and control input have been eliminated. Command filters are presented to implement physical constraints on the virtual control laws, then the tedious analytic computations of time derivatives of virtual control laws are canceled. It is proved that the proposed robust backstepping control is able to guarantee semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive NN control.	actuator device component;adaptive system;appendix;approximation error;arabic numeral 0;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;cascade device component;centrality;coefficient;computation;control flow;control theory;convergence (action);eighty nine;large;lyapunov fractal;mimo;multiple personality disorder;neural network simulation;nonlinear system;optimal control;petri net;shadow copy;social inequality;the matrix	Mou Chen;Shuzhi Sam Ge;Bernard Voon Ee How	2010	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks	10.1109/TNN.2010.2042611	robust control;variable structure control;approximation error;adaptive control;backstepping;nonlinear system;computer science;control theory;feedback;mathematics;mimo	Robotics	65.048119882346	-4.74267838258855	53127

In order to preserve the closed-loop stability under random network time delays, the variable selective control (VSC) methodology is introduced, which combines the idea of variable sampling control with the packet-based control methodologies. In the proposed method, event-driven sensors are employed, which sample the plant output just after a new control input signal is received by the actuator. The advantages are as follows: 1) the latest actual sampling period becomes equal to the most recent time delay, which is known by direct measurement; 2) better estimation of the actual plant states can be performed in the predictive controller; 3) less frequent and shorter packets need to be transferred through the network; and 4) the stability analysis becomes simpler and does not depend on variable-size matrices. In order to deal with packet dropout issue, a simple, yet effective, algorithm is adopted in the controller, where packet losses are considered as variable time delays. In light of this formulation, the networked control system can be considered as a switched linear system and, therefore, previously existing theoretical results are adopted for stability analysis of the VSC method. Simulation studies on a well-known benchmark problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);broadcast delay;control system;dropout (neural networks);event-driven programming;linear system;network packet;network traffic control;random graph;real-time clock;sampling (signal processing);sensor;shadow copy;simulation;simulink;telecommunications network	Behrooz Rahmani;Amir Hossein Davaie Markazi	2013	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2012.2194739	control engineering;variable structure control;real-time computing;stability;networked control system;engineering;control theory;mathematics;linear system;model predictive control	Embedded	65.87896162009548	1.664280102941038	53357

Model in this approach consists of a static nonlinear function in series with a dynamic linear system, which has been referred to Hammerstein model. Neural Networks is used to approximate nonlinear function and PSO is resorted to find, the optimal values of the coefficients of the linear part and, the parameters of the nonlinear approximator. Chebychev's polynomials and Taylor's power series are also implemented as two conventional nonlinear function approximators. In this paper despite the other works only input- output data are used to parameters identification and we don't use any other intermediate signals. The simulation results show the effectiveness of NN with respect to latter approximators. Also, numerical example shows that PSO is well suited to deal with system identification problems.	approximation algorithm;coefficient;linear system;mathematical optimization;neural networks;nonlinear system identification;numerical analysis;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;polynomial;series and parallel circuits;simulation	Ramezan Paravi Torghabeh;Hamid Khaloozadeh	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control	10.1109/ICNSC.2008.4525241	control engineering;mathematical optimization;system identification;computer science;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network	EDA	60.19605019225715	-5.879951100789845	53425

A small-gain-theorem-based sufficient stability condition, which accounts for the feedback interaction between the time-varying adaptive filter and the unmodeled dynamics existing in the closed-loop plant, is derived. This condition leads to the formulation of a constrained convex optimization problem solvable recursively using a modified RLS algorithm that preserves the converge properties of the original RLS algorithm	algorithm;bibo stability;convex optimization;recursive least squares filter	Néstor Osvaldo Pérez-Arancibia	2006		10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1660717	adaptive filter;mathematical optimization;convex optimization;adaptive control;computer science;control theory;mathematics	ML	63.92654391998617	-2.0329976574164004	53671
eab93fab895bfa757af5c685bdfb970199c620f0	robust speed control of hybrid electric vehicle using fractional order fuzzy pd and pi controllers in cascade control loop		In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed for speed control of highly nonlinear hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) having an electronic throttle control system (ETCS) in the cascade control loop. Fractional order fuzzy PD (FOFPD) and fractional order fuzzy PI (FOFPI) nonlinear controllers are developed and used as primary and secondary controllers, respectively in the cascade control loop. These controllers are variable gain fuzzy controllers having an adaptive nature. Their corresponding integral counterpart, fuzzy PD and fuzzy PI controllers are realized by keeping integer order differentiator and integrator in FOFPD and FOFPI controllers. Further, fractional order PD (FOPD) and fractional order PI (FOPI) controllers are implemented by using non-integer order operators in conventional PD and PI controllers. Extensive simulations have been carried out using National Instruments software LabVIEW™ and its add-on tools such as control design and simulation toolkit to perform a comparative study for FOFPD, FPD, FOPD and PD as primary controller and FOFPI, FPI, FOPI and PI as secondary controller for setpoint tracking of speed of HEV. Multi objective genetic algorithm is used to optimize the gains of primary and secondary controllers for minimization of integral of absolute error (IAE), maximum overshoot and settling time. Performances of tuned controllers are further evaluated for tracking of speed profile, disturbance rejection and model uncertainty. It has been observed that combination of FOFPD and FOFPI controllers outperformed rest of the controllers in servo, regulatory and uncertain environment and demonstrate very robust behavior for speed control of HEV.	control system	Vineet Kumar;K.

This paper considers the parameter identification problem of a Hammerstein multi-input multi-output (H-MIMO) system. In order to avoid the product terms in the identification model, we derive a pseudo-linear identification model of the H-MIMO system through separating a key term from the output equation of the system and present a hierarchical generalized least squares (LS) algorithm for estimating the parameters of the system. Moreover, we present a new LS algorithm to reduce the computational burden. The proposed algorithms are simple in principle and can achieve a higher computational efficiency than the over-parameterization-based LS estimation algorithm. Finally, we test the proposed algorithms by the simulation example and show their effectiveness.	algorithm;computation;estimation theory;generalized least squares;mimo;simulation;system analysis	Qianyan Shen;Feng Ding	2016	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-015-0211-5	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;least squares;statistics	ML	60.22209614867092	-5.480050001038204	53861

In both papers the steady-state control is immersed into a linear internal model. In general, the model produces the sinusoidal signals generated by an exosystem, as well as a number of their harmonics, which are induced by the system's nonlinearities. When the internal model does not account for all harmonics, there will be an error between the steady-state control needed to achieve zero steady-state regulation error and the steady-state control produced by the internal model. If the norm of this error is bounded by a constant δ, it is shown in [4] and [7] that the steady-state regulation error will be of the order O(δ). In this paper we prove a shaper result where the steady-state regulation error is shown to be of the order O(μδ), where μ is a design parameter of the continuously-implemented sliding mode controller of [4] and [7]. Therefore, the regulation error can be reduced by decreasing μ. This result allows us to tradeoff the dimension of the internal model versus the value of μ as means of reducing the regulation error.	approximation;controller (computing);linear model;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;steady state	Ranran Li;Hassan K.

Firstly, an adaptive identifier is used to estimate the unknown system dynamics. Then, a recently developed system augmentation approach is adopted to design the optimal control, where the reference signal is incorporated into the augmented system. Thus, both the feedforward control and feedback control can be obtained simultaneously. Then, a critic neural network (NN) is used to estimate the augmented performance index, and calculate the optimal control action. Thus, the widely used actor NN is not needed. Finally, a new adaptive law recently proposed by the authors is used to online update the NN weight. The closed-loop stability and the convergence of the optimal control are all proved. The feasibility of the suggested approach is demonstrated by a simulation example.	artificial neural network;feed forward (control);feedback;identifier;nonlinear system;optimal control;simulation;system dynamics	Yongfeng Lv;Jing Na;Qinmin Yang;Guido Herrmann	2016	2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727650	control engineering;real-time computing;adaptive control;computer science;control theory	Robotics	64.75218022375394	-6.053065666626071	54171
9eae7e06e70e89c5fbfe3bea2aa56fe9ef83ab6b	robust fuzzy adaptive tracking control for nonaffine stochastic nonlinear switching systems		This paper is concerned with the trajectory tracking control problem of a class of nonaffine stochastic nonlinear switched systems with the nonlower triangular form under arbitrary switching. Fuzzy systems are employed to tackle the problem from packaged unknown nonlinearities, and the backstepping and robust adaptive control techniques are applied to design the controller by adopting the structural characteristics of fuzzy systems and the common Lyapunov function approach. By using Lyapunov stability theory, the semiglobally uniformly ultimate boundness in the fourth-moment of all closed-loop signals is guaranteed, and the system output is ensured to converge to a small neighborhood of the given trajectory. The main advantages of this paper lie in the fact that both the completely nonaffine form and nonlower triangular structure are taken into account for the controlled systems, and the increasing property of whole state functions is removed by using the structural characteristics of fuzzy systems. The developed control method is verified through a numerical example.	controllers;converge;feedback;fuzzy control system;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;stochastic process;triangular matrix	Huanqing Wang;Peter Xiaoping Liu;Ben Niu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2017.2740841	backstepping;mathematical optimization;fuzzy logic;nonlinear system;control theory;lyapunov function;mathematics;fuzzy control system;lyapunov stability;adaptive control;control theory	Robotics	66.57220070997533	-4.1399357235180565	54313

Due to the communication medium being shared, it is impossible to transmit all control commands and measurement data simultaneously. As a consequence, a protocol is needed to orchestrate what data is sent over the network at each transmission instant. To effectively deal with the shared communication medium using observer-based controllers, we adopt a switched observer structure that switches based on the available measured outputs and a switched controller structure that switches based on available control inputs at each transmission time. By taking a discrete-time switched linear system perspective, we are able to derive a general model that captures all these networked and decentralized control aspects. The proposed synthesis method is based on decomposing the closed-loop model into a multi-gain switched static output-feedback form. This decomposition allows for the formulation of linear matrix inequality based synthesis conditions which, if satisfied, provide stabilizing observer-based controllers, which are both decentralized and robust to network effects. A numerical example illustrates the strengths as well as the limitations of the developed theory.	as-interface;block cipher mode of operation;distributed control system;linear matrix inequality;linear system;network switch;numerical analysis;orchestration (computing);social inequality;telecommunications network	Nicolas William Bauer;M.

The bounded measurement delay is unknown and variant. The trajectory signal is generated by a reference system. By using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequality technique, a delay-dependent criterion and the corresponding robust trajectory tracking control scheme are presented. The controller can reduce the undesirable delay effects and guarantee the boundedness of tracking error. The results with application to HiMAT (highly maneuverable technology) aircraft have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © IMechE 2012.	control theory	Qing Wang;Yingxin Zhang;Chaoyang Dong;Maolin Ni	2012	J.

The design is relied on a linear feedback control scheme and the dynamical minimization algorithm. A linear feedback signal is designed to drive the state estimation errors to zero, while the parametric updating rules are obtained with the dynamical minimization algorithm so that parameter estimation can be achieved at the same time. The success of this approach is illustrated by tackling with some typical synchronization problems found in chaotic systems, where its stability is justified by conditional Lyapunov exponents and local Lyapunov function method. The same design also serves as an effective attack, performing the cryptanalysis for chaos-based communication systems. As demonstrated with our simulation results, the securities of many proposed chaos-based cryptosystems are in fact questionable as the information of their transmitters, including the states and/or system parameters, as well as the transmitting messages, may be revealed by simply observing the transmitted signal.	algorithm;chaos theory;cryptanalysis;cryptosystem;estimation theory;feedback;kerckhoffs's principle;lorenz system;lyapunov fractal;rössler attractor;simulation;synchronization (computer science);transmitter;unified model	Ying Liu;Wallace Kit-Sang Tang	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-04227-0_10	control engineering;control-lyapunov function;theoretical computer science;lyapunov equation;control theory;mathematics;synchronization of chaos;lyapunov redesign;lyapunov exponent	EDA	66.47343253444174	2.907704059364379	54556

Two subsystems are interconnected in a nested information pattern, and output feedback controllers must be designed for each subsystem. Several special cases of this architecture have previously been solved, such as the state-feedback case or the case where the dynamics of both systems are decoupled. In this paper, we present a detailed solution to the general case. The structure of the optimal decentralized controller is reminiscent of that of the optimal centralized controller; each player must estimate the state of the system given their available information and apply static control policies to these estimates to compute the optimal controller. The previously solved cases benefit from a separation between estimation and control that allows the associated gains to be computed separately. This feature is not present in general, and some of the gains must be solved for simultaneously. We show that computing the required coupled estimation and control gains amounts to solving a small system of linear equations.	block cipher mode of operation;centralized computing;computable function;computation;convex hull;distributed control system;exemplification;interpretation (logic);kalman filter;linear equation;optimal control;state space;steady state;system of linear equations	Laurent Lessard;Sanjay Lall	2015	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2015.2400658	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;database index;von neumann stability analysis;real-time computing;controller;optimal control;nonlinear control;networked control system;engineering;control reconfiguration;automatic control;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;separation principle	Robotics	64.50348036376059	-0.04951738603383469	54636

The interface between fault detection and fault isolation considers the activation degree and the occurrence time instant of the diagnostic signals using a combination of several theoretical fault signature matrices that store the knowledge of the relationship between diagnostic signals and faults. The fault isolation module is implemented using a timed discrete-event approach that recognizes the occurrence of a fault by identifying a unique sequence of observable events (fault signals). The states and transitions that characterize such a system can directly be inferred from the relation between fault signals and faults. The proposed fault diagnosis approach has been motivated by the problem of detecting and isolating faults of the Barcelona's urban sewer system limnimeters (level meter sensors). The results obtained in this case study illustrate the benefits of using the proposed approach in comparison with the standard fault detection and isolation approach.	event (computing);fault detection and isolation;interval arithmetic;isolation (database systems);list of discrete event simulation software;observable;sensor;software bug	Jordi Meseguer;Vicenç Puig;Teresa Escobet	2010	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans	10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2052036	computer vision;fault;real-time computing;fault coverage;fault indicator;computer science;stuck-at fault;signal processing;control theory;fault model;fault detection and isolation	Robotics	56.4942322428525	-4.219323934624654	54722

A novel method is proposed for design of the switching surface. This method is based on the descriptor approach and leads to a solution in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When compared to existing methods (even for systems without delays), the proposed method is efficient and less conservative than other results, giving a feasible solution when the Kimura-Davison conditions are not satisfied. No additional constraints are imposed on the dimensions or structure of the reduced order triple associated with design of the switching surface. The magnitude of the linear gain used to construct the controller is also verified as an appropriate solution to the reachability problem using LMIs. A stability analysis for the full-order time-delay system with discontinuous right-hand side is formulated. This paper facilitates the constructive design of sliding-mode static-output-feedback controllers for a rather general class of time-delay systems. A numerical example from the literature illustrates the efficiency of the proposed method.	broadcast delay;control theory;gary kimura;interval arithmetic;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;numerical analysis;reachability problem	Xiaoran Han;Emilia Fridman;Sarah K.

b7dfaa479916d241df585ba225966d6f431b8f26	risk sensitive, nonlinear optimal control: iterative linear exponential-quadratic optimal control with gaussian noise		In this contribution, we derive ILEG, an iterative algorithm to find risk sensitive solutions to nonlinear, stochastic optimal control problems. The algorithm is based on a linear quadratic approximation of an exponential risk sensitive nonlinear control problem. ILEG allows to find risk sensitive policies and thus generalizes previous algorithms to solve nonlinear optimal control based on iterative linear-quadratic methods. Depending on the setting of the parameter controlling the risk sensitivity, two different strategies on how to cope with the risk emerge. For positive-value parameters, the control policy uses high feedback gains whereas for negative-value parameters, it uses a robust feedforward control strategy (a robust plan) with low gains. These results are illustrated with a simple example. This note should be considered as a preliminary report.	approximation algorithm;control theory;feed forward (control);iterative method;linear algebra;nonlinear system;optimal control;risk aversion;time complexity	Farbod Farshidian;Jonas Buchli	2015	CoRR		control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	ML	62.09609742782967	-0.2373925163377828	55035

This study introduces fuzzy observer-based fuzzy control design, where the premise variables depend on the state variables estimated by a fuzzy observer, to deal with the nonlinear l infin-gain control problem. The fuzzy control design for this case is more flexible but much more complex than that for the case where the premise variables depend on the state variables. First, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear discrete-time system. Next, based on the fuzzy model, a fuzzy observer-based fuzzy controller is developed to minimize the upper bound of l infin-gain of the closed-loop system under some nonlinear matrix inequality (non-LMI) constraints. A novel decoupled method is proposed in this study to transform the non-LMI conditions into some linear matrix inequality (LMI) forms. By the proposed decoupled method and the genetic algorithm, the l infin-gain fuzzy observer-based fuzzy control problem for the nonlinear discrete-time systems can be easily solved by an LMI-based optimization method. The proposed methods, which efficiently attenuate the peak of perturbation due to persistent bounded disturbances, extend the l infin-gain control problems from linear discrete-time systems to nonlinear discrete-time systems.

In this study, H∞ control is applied for the insulin delivery to prevent the hyperglycemic levels in a Type 1 diabetic patient. From a control theory point of view, the blood glucose regulation problem is reformulated as a tracking one. A glucose tolerance curve (GTC) validated from several healthy subjects is used as reference signal. A non-linear compartmental model is linearised around nominal condition and reduced for controller synthesis. The design of H∞ controller was carried out using Riccati equation. The performance of the controllers was studied by implementing them into the non-linear model. Sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions show the nominal and robust performance of the closed loop system.

We model this scenario as a convex optimization problem with a time-varying objective function and propose an adaptive discrete-time sampling prediction-correction scheme to find and track the solution trajectory while sampling the problem data at a constant rate of 1 /h. We propose approximate gradient trajectory (AGT) and approximate Newton trajectory tracking (ANT) as prediction-correction algorithms that (i) analyze the iso-residual dynamics of the optimality conditions in the prediction step, (ii) use gradient descent and Newton's method in the correction step, respectively, and (iii) approximate the partial derivative of the objective by a first-order backward derivative for the prediction step. We establish that the asymptotic error incurred by both proposed methods behaves as O(h2), and in some cases as O(h4), which outperforms the state-of-the-art error bound of O(h) for correction-only methods in the gradient-correction step. The utility of the methods is demonstrated in an object tracking problem executed by an autonomous system.	algorithmic game theory;approximation algorithm;autonomous system (internet);convex optimization;first-order predicate;gradient descent;mathematical optimization;newton;newton's method;optimization problem;sampling (signal processing)	Alec Koppel;Andrea Simonetto;Aryan Mokhtari;Geert Leus;Alejandro R.

The proposed model uses the particle filter to predict the posterior values of the aging indicators, i.e., capacitance and resistance. Unlike other prognosis methods, the proposed model predicts the RUL, considering the aging conditions such as temperature and voltage. In order to validate the proposed method, experiments have been carried out under different aging conditions. Results highlight the effectiveness of the approach in predicting capacitance and resistance, as well as the RUL for different initial conditions.	experiment;initial condition;particle filter	Asmae El Mejdoubi;Hicham Chaoui;Jalal Sabor;Hamid Gualous	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2767550	control engineering;voltage;prognostics;engineering;supercapacitor;particle filter;capacitance	Robotics	54.93364975333488	-1.7682797521746267	55263

This attack is referred to as coordinated attack. We show that the coordinated attack is capable of deriving the system states far away from the desired without being detected. Furthermore, designing such an attack practically does not require knowledge on target systems, which makes the attack much more dangerous compared to the other known attacks. Also, we present a method to detect the coordinated attack. To validate the effect of the proposed attack, we carry out experiments using a quadrotor.	experiment;routh–hurwitz stability criterion;simulation;two generals' problem;sensor (device)	Gyujin Na;Yongsoon Eun	2018	2018 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	10.1109/CCTA.2018.8511631	noise measurement;real-time computing;digital watermarking;multiplicative function;cyber-physical system;computer science	Security	56.755194422578555	0.3718492084713332	55508

Firstly, under some appropriate assumptions, some new results about mean-square admissibility are developed and the corresponding LMI sufficient condition is given. Secondly, finite-time horizon and infinite-time horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control problems for the stochastic singular system are investigated, in which the coefficients are allowed to be random in control input and quadratic criterion. Some results involving new stochastic generalized Riccati equation are discussed as well. Finally, the proposed LQ control model for stochastic singular systems provides an appropriate and effective framework to study the portfolio selection problem in light of the recent development on general stochastic LQ problems.	admissible heuristic;coefficient;letter-quality printer;linear matrix inequality;optimal control;quadratic function;selection algorithm	Qingling Zhang;Shuangyun Xing	2014	Optimization Letters	10.1007/s11590-013-0687-5	mathematical optimization;stochastic control;continuous-time stochastic process;stochastic optimization;singular solution;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	67.77016017373163	1.4757143530993762	55636

Accordingly, an electronic ballast normally comprises a buck converter to control the lamp current magnitude, and a bridge to commutate the lamp current at a low frequency. These functions can be combined in a stacked buck converter [1]. The resulting system performance depends on the dynamics of the lamp as well as the ballast, the so-called lamp-ballast interaction [2]. Competitor lamps, production spread, reduced power operation and lifetime effects lead to a wide spread in lamp parameters. Some lamp-ballast combinations tend to be poorly damped, resulting in oscillatory lamp current. In such a system, the negative incremental lamp impedance may interact with the power electronic driver. Furthermore, lamp ageing and reduced power mode operation both tend to increase re-ignition voltage overshoot, which in turn may lead to reduced lifetime, or prematurely extinguishing lamps. Because of considerable non- linearities, feedback control based on the gas discharge electrical terminal quantities can improve the lamp-ballast performance only to a limited extent. Therefore, to bring the electronic HID lamp-ballast system performance a step further, feedback of the physical lamp states is proposed in this paper. However, direct feedback of the physical lamp states is not practical due to either economic or physical constraints. For this reason, to construct unmeasured system states using a known set of system states and parameters, a ceramic metal halide lamp observer is proposed. The HID lamp observer directly enhances system performance because it allows more sophisticated control schemes that make use of physical quantities like the electrode sheath voltage and cold spot temperature, which heretofore were not accessible. The ceramic metal halide observer is based on energy balance equations that include plasma and arc tube wall dynamics. Finally, simulations and practical measurements are included to validate the observer based ceramic metal halide lamp control.	acoustic cryptanalysis;buck converter;characteristic impedance;discharger;electrical ballast;electrical connector;feedback;halide;overshoot (signal);perturbation theory;plasma active;resonance;simulation	Dolf H.

The aim is to mitigate the vehicle speed faults and provide accurate measurements for the control. Thus, the additive faults affecting the vehicle speed sensor are estimated, and accurate speed measurments are used to control the vehicle speed instead of the faulty ones. Sufficient conditions and obsrever gain are designed by use of Lyapunov theory, satisfying L2-gain norm and H∞ enterions. These conditions are derived under the well known Linear Matrix Inequality. The optimal designed gains ensure robustness against disturbances and additive sensor faults. A nonlinear longitudinal vehicle dynamic is considered to demonstrate the performance of the proposed design to achieve the spacing control task.

The main feature of NDO is that it enables neural networks to approximate the optimal feedback solution whose existence dynamic programming (DP) justifies, thereby reducing the complexities of computation and storage problems of the classical methods such as DP.

To achieve the desired temperature uniformity in a large-scale spatial setting, a temperature uniformity control strategy combining workpiece temperature compensation and intelligent proportional-integral-derivative (PID) decoupling control is presented. The temperature compensation of the workpiece is realized by establishing an air heat conduction model. Moreover, an intelligent PID decoupling control system based on a novel self-growing radial basis function neural network (SGRBFNN) is developed to eliminate the strong coupling effects of multiheating zones. SGRBFNN, with the structure being dynamically adjusted by a hybrid semifuzzy Gustafson-Kessel clustering algorithm, is proposed to realize the online tuning of the parameters of the PID controller. Both the simulation and industrial experiment results demonstrate that the proposed temperature control system can effectively achieve smooth regulations and significantly improve temperature uniformity. The application also demonstrates the validity and better control performance of the proposed system compared with conventional control systems.	algorithm;artificial neural network;circuit complexity;cluster analysis;control system;control theory;coupling (computer programming);feedback;gustafson's law;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;pid;radial (radio);radial basis function;simulation	Ling Shen;Jianjun He;Chunhua Yang;Weihua Gui;Honglei Xu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2015.2417495	control engineering;atmospheric model;temperature;temperature measurement;engineering;control theory;coupling;engineering drawing;physics	Robotics	60.07172969029716	-9.196297056551085	56000

With a priori bound for the disturbing noises of an EIVM in closed loop, a frequency-domain normalized coprime factor model (NCFM) with perturbation is derived and thus the identification of the EIVM becomes that of the NCFM. By employing the v-gap metric as an optimization criterion, the worst-case error for an identified nominal NCFM is easily quantified and the parameter optimization can be effectively solved by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). During the parameter optimization, the derivative of the nominal NCFM is constrained to some degree to reduce the effect of overfitting phenomenon. Different from other EIVM identification methods, we use v-gap metric to characterize the disturbing noises and quantify the worst-case error for the nominal NCFM. As a result, the identification result is not a deterministic model but a model set. Moreover, this model set can be perfectly combined with the robust controller design. Finally, a numerical simulation is presented to verify the proposed method.	best, worst and average case;closed-loop transfer function;computer simulation;errors-in-variables models;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;overfitting;robust control	Li-Hui Geng;Deyun Xiao;Tao Zhang;Jingyan Song	2011	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2010.2067630	computer simulation;control engineering;mathematical optimization;perturbation;noise measurement;noise;control theory;mathematics;electromagnetic coil;computational model;robustness	Embedded	65.5705525194881	-1.5505991715391505	56660

For this reason the scheduling of maintenance operations is very important to keep the high availability of transportation system. The attention in the paper is focused on a crane control problem and availability of automated material handling device, which refers to capability of a device to realise transportation operations with expected quality. An anti-sway crane control problem was solved in the paper by using indirect adaptive pole placement system with fuzzy estimator of parameters of a crane dynamic model. The paper presents the fuzzy model used to heuristic estimation of the system availability coefficient, and genetic fuzzy system that forecasts prognoses of operating time between failures.

How to get fast convergence speed and low computational complexity remains a challenging and open topic. Besides, the transient response of learning process of RNNs is a critical issue, especially for on-line applications. Conventional RNNs training algorithms such as the backpropagation through time (BPTT) and real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) have not adequately satisfied these requirements because they often suffer from slow convergence speed. If a large learning rate is chosen to improve performance, the training process may become unstable in terms of weight divergence. In this paper, a novel training algorithm of RNN, named robust recurrent simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (RRSPSA), is developed with a specially designed recurrent hybrid adaptive parameter and adaptive learning rates. RRSPSA is a powerful novel twin-engine simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) type of RNN training algorithm. It utilizes specific designed three adaptive parameters to maximize training speed for recurrent training signal while exhibiting certain weight convergence properties with only two objective function measurements as the original SPSA algorithm. The RRSPSA is proved with guaranteed weight convergence and system stability in the sense of Lyapunov function. Computer simulations were carried out to demonstrate applicability of the theoretical results.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation through time;computational complexity theory;control theory;experiment;gradient;loss function;lyapunov fractal;mean squared error;online and offline;optimization problem;random neural network;real-time clock;recurrent neural network;requirement;simulation;simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation	Zhao Xu;Qing Song;Danwei Wang;Haijin Fan	2012	2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion		mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;control theory	ML	60.7953882429161	-2.5385947870678063	56938

Motivated by recent results in statistical learning theory, we show that probabilistic guaranteed solutions can be obtained by means of randomized algorithms. In particular, we show that the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dimension) of the two problems is finite, and we compute upper bounds on it. In turn, these bounds allow us to derive explicitly the sample complexity of these problems. Using these bounds, in the second part of the paper, we derive a sequential scheme, based on a sequence of optimization and validation steps. The algorithm is on the same lines of recent schemes proposed for similar problems, but improves both in terms of complexity and generality. The effectiveness of this approach is shown using a linear model of a robot manipulator subject to uncertain parameters.	alexey chervonenkis;bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;linear logic;linear model;machine learning;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;randomized algorithm;regular expression;sample complexity;statistical learning theory;vc dimension	Mohammadreza Chamanbaz;Fabrizio Dabbene;Roberto Tempo;Venkatakrishnan Venkataramanan;Qing-Guo Wang	2014	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2014.04.005	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;probabilistic design;engineering;control theory;mathematics;randomized algorithm;statistics	Theory	62.298539676492936	-0.737719423713416	57012

Hysteresis is an important phenomenon observed in the response of these batteries. The most common observation for lithium ion batteries is open circuit voltage and these measurements exhibit hysteretic behavior. However, the effect of system dynamics on hysteresis has not been studied. In this work, simulations with a detailed electro-chemical model are presented that indicate that intrinsic system dynamics are a significant cause of hysteretic behavior in lithium-ion batteries.	closed-loop transfer function;computer simulation;constant function;current–voltage characteristic;hysteresis;open core protocol;simulation;system dynamics;triune continuum paradigm	Sepideh Afshar;Kirsten A.

More precisely, the dynamic characteristics of the external disturbance and sensor fault are described as the output of exogenous systems first. The original sensor fault and delay tolerant control problem is reformulated as an equivalence problem with designed available system output and reformed performance index. The feedforward and feedback sensor fault tolerant controller (FFSFTC) can be obtained by utilizing the solutions of Riccati matrix equation and Stein matrix equation. Based on the designed fault diagnoser, the proposed FFSFTC is further reconstructed to compensate for the sensor fault and delayed measurement effects. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed FFSFTC with different cases with various types of sensor faults, measurement delays and external disturbances.	actuator device component;algebraic riccati equation;assumed;chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia;control system;controllers;external auditory canal structure;fault tolerance;feedforward neural network;numerical analysis;otitis externa;sensor;simulation;turing completeness	Shi-Yuan Han;Yuehui Chen;Gong-You Tang	2017		10.3390/s17040700	control engineering;real-time computing;fault indicator;engineering;stuck-at fault;control reconfiguration;control theory	Robotics	65.01415077191065	1.5819625238992505	57119

The approach is based on a linear parameter varying system (LPV) representation of the nonlinear dynamics along with integral quadratic constraints (IQC) to account for the linearization errors. Past results have shown that Jacobian linearization leads to hidden coupling terms in the controlled system. These terms arise due to neglecting the higher order terms of the Taylor series and due to the use of constant (frozen) values of the scheduling parameter. This paper proposes an LPV control synthesis method that accounts for these shortcomings. The higher order terms of the linearization are treated as a memoryless uncertainty whose input/output behavior is described by a parameter varying IQC. It is also shown that if the rate of the scheduling parameter is measurable then it can be treated as a known disturbance in the control synthesis step. A simple numerical example shows that the proposed control design approach leads to improved control performance.	control engineering;control theory;input/output;interconnection;jacobian matrix and determinant;linear algebra;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;perturbation theory;scheduling (computing);series expansion	Béla Takarics;Peter Seiler	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7170834	control engineering;mathematical optimization;uncertainty;nonlinear system;taylor series;control theory;mathematics;gain scheduling;linear system;feedback linearization;linearization;statistics;robustness	Robotics	67.27665822990895	-2.2307491110422686	57248

a67ff803dca561bf16cb8d5280aa5a66e2c538d9	practical adaptive fuzzy tracking control for a class of perturbed nonlinear systems with backlash nonlinearity		Abstract This paper addresses the adaptive fuzzy tracking control problem for a class of perturbed nonlinear systems with backlash nonlinearity. In the proposed control scheme, fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unknown nonlinearity in each backstepping design, and the classic adaptive technique is employed to deal with some unknown parameters. The proposed fuzzy controller is developed by introducing some non-negative switching functions, and novel parameter adaptation learning laws are designed using the σ -modification method. It is emphasized that with the help of novel parameter adaptation laws, the high-gain phenomenon in the previous work can be avoided. In addition, by borrowing the property of the introduced non-negative functions and the inequality technique, an adaptive technique is employed to estimate the norm of the ideal weight vector such that the number of adaptation learning parameters online is reduced. By employing Barbalat’s lemma, it can be proved that all the signals in the closed-loop system remain semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, and, especially, that the tracking error converges to an accuracy predefined a priori . Two simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.	nonlinear system	Jian Wu;Jing Li;Weisheng V Chen	2017	Inf.

Recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the proposed NMPC scheme with such spectrum constraints are guaranteed by means of an appropriate ellipsoidal terminal invariant set.

First, the estimator's state space model is constructed with a stochastic linear hybrid system (SLHS) in the presence of the unknown lateral acceleration of the evader. If the mode switches of SLHS are observable, the mode decision-maker can correctly identify the mode (or discrete state) sequence with a known delay, called mode decision delay. Then, the dynamics of continuous-state estimation error is constructed analytically given the mode decision delay. To achieve the guaranteed performance, the upper bound of mode decision delay and the lower bound of mode sojourn time are found. Finally, the results are corroborated through a simulation of the typical heading-on interception scenario. The conclusions in this paper are directive to the design and performance analysis of SLHS estimator.	answer to reset;course (navigation);directive (programming);ergodic theory;hardware acceleration;hybrid system;lateral computing;lateral thinking;network switch;observable;profiling (computer programming);radar;simulation;state-space representation	Hongqi Fan;Yilong Zhu;Qiang Fu	2011	IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems	10.1109/TAES.2011.5705700	acceleration;filter;control engineering;simulation;missile guidance;engineering;noise;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory;physics;statistics	EDA	56.63987652192597	2.109191601552858	57536

174eca805f458d88d1b738f097f4877e25b11134	a new approach to non-fragile output feedback controller design for uncertain takagi-sugeno fuzzy systems	feeds;state feedback;control design;output feedback;stability analysis;electrical engineering	The paper discusses non-fragile output feedback control design Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems with uncertain parameters. In control design for physical systems, there are chances that malfunction in actuator and round-off error of the control gain calculation may occur. Hence, controller gain variations as well as uncertainty in the system parameters should be considered in the control design. For an uncertain fuzzy system, a design method of a non-fragile output feedback controller is proposed by introducing a new type of controllers where the integrals of the membership functions are involved. A non-parallel distributed compensator(Non-PDC) is a generalization of a parallel distributed compensator(PDC), which is a traditional controller for fuzzy systems, and is used for the control design. A non-fragile non-PDC output feedback controller for uncertain fuzzy systems is obtained from new fuzzy multiple Lyapunov functions and its control design conditions are given in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities(LMIs), which are easily numerically solvable. The descriptor system formulation, which leads to relaxation in controller design conditions, is also employed. These approaches reduce the conservatism of the control design conditions. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate our nonlinear control design and to show the effectiveness over other existing results.	block cipher mode of operation;control engineering;control theory;decision problem;feedback;fuzzy control system;linear programming relaxation;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;peripheral dma controller;round-off error	Jun Yoneyama;Kenta Hoshino	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	10.1109/SMC.2016.7844988	control engineering;open-loop controller;von neumann stability analysis;real-time computing;controller;nonlinear control;fuzzy number;control theory	Robotics	67.2670987389013	-2.0248559331696785	57845

An optimization problem arising from MPC is decomposed into several sub-problems, whose sizes are smaller than that of the original optimization problem, and the sub-problems can be solved in parallel. We introduce a reordering of optimization variables that exploits the specific structure of the MPC problem. This reordering reduces the number of iterations required in the proposed parallel MPC method, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical simulations.	computer simulation;iteration;linear system;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem	Naoyuki Hara;Keiji Konishi	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798614	control engineering;mathematical optimization;linear programming;control theory;mathematics;model predictive control	EDA	60.65898871243789	-0.7984105800846364	58029

For such systems, the switch command timings are shown to be periodic, and the repeat time of the solution set is derived as a function of the natural mode frequencies. Based on this result, we formulate a new approach for the quick generation of time-optimal commands for any given reference move where a finite set of these periodic solutions are computed offline, and are later used to derive time-optimal profiles by solving a much reduced subset of original problem in real-time. This provides large computational benefit over existing schemes, which require expensive computations where nonconvex and nonlinear parametric optimization problems are solved for every reference move. The proposed approach is compared with existing input shaping-based schemes in terms of computational requirement and system performance. Extensions are provided for systems with multiple flexible modes, and with different limits on maximum acceleration and deceleration.	computation;flexible display;input shaping;mathematical optimization;noise shaping;nonlinear system;online and offline;optimal control;real-time clock;real-time transcription;switching time;time complexity	Abhishek Dhanda;Gene F.

The NMB system dynamics portrayed by a Wiener model can exhibit sustained nonlinear oscillations for physiologically feasible values of the model parameters and realistic PID gains. Such oscillations, also repeatedly observed in clinical trials, lead to under- and over-dosing of the administered drug and undermine patient safety. This paper proposes an bifurcation analysis-based tuning policy for the proportional PID gain that ensures automatic recovery from those oscillations. It is shown that with a time-varying proportional PID gain, the type of equilibria of the closed-loop system remains the same as in the case of constant controller gains and no additional types of complex nonlinear behaviors are introduced by these auxiliary dynamics. The recovery time is also evaluated in simulation over a database of individualized patient models.	bifurcation theory;exemplification;functional electrical stimulation;multistage interconnection networks;nonlinear system;pid;simulation;system dynamics	Zhanybai T.

Using a feedback cascade system model we can include the effects of the global-best and personal-best values more directly in the model of the dynamics. Thus in contrast to previous study of PSO dynamics, the input-to-state stability property used here allows for the analysis of PSO both before and at stagnation. In addition, the use of input-to-state stability allows this analysis to preserve random terms which were heretofore simplified to constants. This analysis is important because it can inform the setting of PSO parameters and better characterize the nature of PSO as a dynamic system. This work also illuminates the way in which the personal-best and the global-best updates influence the bound on the particle's position and hence, how the algorithm exploits and explores the fitness landscape as a function of the personal best and global best.	algorithm;control theory;dynamical system;mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization	Daqing Yi;Kevin D.

The initial Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy models are obtained by the modal equivalence principle, where the local state-space models are placed in the rule consequents. Optimization problems are defined aiming the minimization of objective functions expressed as integrals of squared modeling errors. The variables of the objective functions are the limits of the supports of the input membership functions and the kernels of these membership functions are kept constant. SA algorithms are implemented to solve the optimization problems which yield optimal TSK fuzzy models. A set of realtime experimental results for a laboratory nonlinear servo system validates the new optimal TSK fuzzy models.	algorithm;fuzzy concept;fuzzy control system;local variable;mathematical optimization;modal logic;nonlinear system;optimizing compiler;real-time clock;servo;simulated annealing;state space;turing completeness	Radu-Emil Precup;Mircea-Bogdan Radac;Claudia-Adina Dragos;Stefan Preitl;Emil M.

Specifically, the non-identical followers are affected by parameter perturbations and controlled to achieve output synchronization with an uncertain leader. We use the adaptive control theory and the robust output regulation theory to solve this problem. The proposedmethod includes two stages,which is similar to the separation principle. In the first stage, the designed distributed control law and adaptive control law can force that the outputs of the reference generators locally exponentially converge to the output of the leader. In the second stage, the robust output regulation control law is applied in a decentralized control model, to guarantee that the output of each non-identical follower robustly tracks the output of the corresponding reference generator.

As the approximate three sections linear characteristic of titration curve in the pH neutralization process, we discussed the use of T-S fuzzy model for modelling the pH neutralization process. Due to its gradient parameters, we identified the parameters of the system using its input-output data with the method of recursive least square with fading factor algorithm (RLS-RFF). Simulations including recursive least square (RLS) and RLS-RFF have shown the efficiency of the method, and RLS-RFF has better identification accuracy and adaptive ability in the reaction process of gradient parameters. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The process is described by a time-varying nonlinear model obtained from material balance equations. Two different control problems are considered: substrate concentration control and production rate control. For each of these cases, an adaptive minimum variance control algorithm is proposed and its effectiveness is shown by simulation experiments. A theoretical proof of convergence of the substrate control algorithm is given. A further advantage of the nonlinear approach of this paper is that the identified parameters (namely the growth rate and a yield coefficient) have a clear physical meaning and can give, in real time, a useful information on the state of the biomass.	algorithm;coefficient;control theory;experiment;nonlinear system;real-time computing;simulation	Denis Dochain;Georges Bastin	1984	Automatica	10.1016/0005-1098(84)90012-8	check;control engineering;minimum-variance unbiased estimator;simulation;adaptive control;system identification;bacteria;nonlinear system;biomass;engineering;bacterial growth;fermentation;control theory;mathematics;microorganism;estimation theory;scientific control	Robotics	58.21920849419179	-5.003850517055445	59385

The compensator design problem is examined through a parameter-dependent observer-based control structure. The proposed approach uses parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions and involves slack variables in order to achieve less restrictive synthesis conditions. These synthesis conditions are expressed as a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) solvability problem. The admissibility and the H2 performance are ensured by computing appropriate gains of the state-feedback controller and the observer.

A modified stochastic Rice fading model with  disturbance-dependent Gaussian noise  is put forward to better reflect the fading phenomena in complex wireless communication networks. By introducing a novel concept of  finite-time stochastic exponential dissipative , this work designs a state-feedback controller such that the closed-loop system is finite-time stochastic bounded with a prescribed exponential dissipativity performance. Moreover, some parameters-dependent sufficient conditions on the existence of the finite-time dissipative controller are derived and the corresponding computation algorithm is given.

5563aecb5fafe65b1d02109842901e2fd26ab9bb	design of robust h_inf fuzzy output feedback controller for affine nonlinear systems: fuzzy lyapunov function approach		Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new systematic approach based on nonquadratic Lyapunov function and technique of introducing slack matrices, for a class of affine nonlinear systems with disturbance. To achieve the goal, first, the affine nonlinear system is represented via Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy bilinear model. Subsequently, the robust H∞ controller is designed based on parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. Then, the stability conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by utilizing Lyapunov function. Moreover, some slack matrices are proposed to reduce the conservativeness of the LMI stability conditions. Finally, for illustrating the merits and verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the application of an isothermal continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for Van de Vusse reactor is discussed in details.	benchmark (computing);bilinear filtering;block cipher mode of operation;control theory;fuzzy control system;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;peripheral dma controller;programme delivery control;reactor (software);slack variable;verification and validation	Leila Rajabpour;Mokhtar Shasadeghi;Alireza Barzegar	2018	CoRR			AI	67.12274387617425	-1.5050527593533447	60209

The proposed methodology does not involve a reduction step and does not require identification of the system extended observability matrix or its left null space. The performance of our proposed filters is directly connected to and linearly dependent on the errors in the Markov parameters identification process. The estimation filters operate with a subset of the system I/O data that is selected by the designer. It is shown that the proposed filters provide asymptotically unbiased estimates by invoking low order filters as long as the selected subsystem has a stable inverse. We have derived the estimation error dynamics in terms of the Markov parameters identification errors and have shown that they can be directly synthesized from the healthy system I/O data. Consequently, the estimation errors can be effectively compensated for. Finally, we have provided several illustrative case study simulations that demonstrate and confirm the merits of our proposed schemes as compared to methodologies that are available in the literature.	fault detection and isolation;ibm system i;input/output;kernel (linear algebra);linear system;markov chain;simulation;state space	Esmaeil Naderi;Khashayar Khorasani	2017	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2017.07.040	control engineering;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;statistics	Metrics	63.71108252620511	-4.297983951302811	60612
11f7e6b06e85beec4a54cca8fad78d1b450fb459	[regular paper] stochastic non-minimal state space control with application to automated drug delivery		This paper shows how a standard proportional-integral-plus controller, based on a non-minimal state space (NMSS) design, can be extended to reduce the effects of measurement noise and so yield smoother control inputs for automated drug delivery control applications. Use of a NMSS model for state variable feedback control design, in which all the states are based on the directly measured input and output variables, removes the need for state estimation. Nonetheless, a stochastic NMSS form, with a Kalman filter, can optionally be introduced to reduce the effect of measurement noise and so yield smoother control inputs. In this case, the Kalman filter attenuates measurement noise but does not address state disturbances. In this article, we propose a modification to the stochastic NMSS control system to enable the elimination of such state disturbances. This involves further extending the non–minimal state vector to include additional terms based on the innovations. We compare the deterministic, stochastic and extended stochastic NMSS controllers via a simulation of the control of anaesthesia using propofol.		Emma D. Wilson;Quentin Clairon;C.

An improved method is proposed, which captures the characteristic of sampled-data systems. Some delay-dependent criteria are derived to ensure the exponential stability of the error systems, and thus the master systems synchronize with the slave systems. The desired sampled-data controller can be achieved by solving a set of linear matrix inequalitys, which depend upon the maximum sampling interval and the decay rate.

The time-delay is assumed to be a time-varying continuous function belonging to a given interval, which means that the lower and upper bounds for the delay are available. No restriction on the derivative of the time-varying delay is needed, which allows the time-delay to be a fast time-varying function. The state-space Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) uncertain fuzzy model with interval timevarying delay is adopted. Delay-dependent conditions for the existence of robust H∞ controller are presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Data updating in the memory array is arranged in such a way that data at every time instance is updated independently, which allows successive data dropouts both in time and iteration axes. The update mechanisms for both the computed input and real input are proposed and then the update process of both inputs is shown to be a Markov chain. By virtue of Markov modeling, a new analysis method is developed to prove the convergence in both mean square and almost sure senses. An illustrative example verifies the theoretical results.	dropout (neural networks);iteration;iterative method;markov chain;mean squared error;randomness;stochastic process;system camera	Dong Shen;Jian-Xin Xu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2638044	markov decision process;time reversibility;econometrics;markov chain;mathematical optimization;markov kernel;harris chain;markov chain monte carlo;markov property;convergence of random variables;continuous-time markov chain;balance equation;mathematics;markov renewal process;additive markov chain;markov process;markov chain mixing time;markov model;statistics;variable-order markov model	ML	60.26622594314368	3.9988743919267375	60900

The experimental results obtained from the literature are used as training and testing data for developing the model. Five of six parameters namely the gap, mass, modal amplitude, frequency, and peak value of the imaginary part of the frequency response functions were used as input, whereas the modal damping ratio of impact-damped flexible concrete beams was used as output parameter for the model. The Sugeno-type fuzzy rules were constituted with the Gaussian-type membership functions in the model. In the Sugeno-type fuzzy inference model, the modal damping ratio of impact-damped flexible concrete beams is estimated according to these input parameters. ANFIS model results for modal damping ratio are in good agreement with the experimental results than those obtained from formula presented in the literature.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;experiment;frequency response;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule;imaginary time;modal logic;neuro-fuzzy;parameter (computer programming)	I.

Since buck converters have high nonlinearity and uncertainty, a terminal sliding mode controller (TSMC) is proposed to achieve robust output voltage tracking. Different from traditional sliding mode control, a terminal sliding surface is introduced to assure finite convergent time of control errors on the surface. Furthermore, if the upper bound of uncertainty is known, the overall controlled system yields finite-time convergent stability. When considering highly unknown uncertainty, an adaptive fuzzy TSMC is derived to guarantee high robustness. In addition, this controller is implemented by a PSoC (Programmable system on chip) and results in expected performance.	buck converter;converge;dc-to-dc converter;nonlinear system;optimal control;psoc;robustness (computer science);system on a chip;vii	Ya-Ting Lee;Chian-Song Chiu;Chih-Teng Shen	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2010.5611308	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.93375427097371	-5.7936221848099585	60965

The technical note proves that, for a slowly time-varying system subject to bounded noises, the estimation delay depends on the observer gain, but is independent of the variations of system parameters. Rather than estimating the delay, a novel method is proposed to calculate the delay from the observer's phase response. In terms of system identification, the delay is compensated by aligning other measurements with the lagged estimate so that they have the same lag. The simulation results of an aero engine model show significant improvements in estimation. On one hand, the proposed approach improves the estimation accuracy, and on the other hand, it removes the assumption of zero delay and gives a new insight into the high-gain observer design.	algorithm;broadcast delay;phase response;simulation;system identification;windows aero	Xuewu Dai;Zhiwei Gao;Tim Breikin;Hong Wang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2011.2169635	identification;control engineering;electronic engineering;system identification;noise;elmore delay;control theory;mathematics	EDA	67.53259456392509	-6.661609731119718	61398

A dynamic input-delay compensator obtained by adding integrators is established to compensate the input delays that can be arbitrarily large. With the input delay compensator, the original stabilization problem reduces to the problem of stabilizing an augmented linear time-delay system without input delay. Three methods are also proposed to design stabilizing controllers for the augmented linear time-delay system. The first method is based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and the second method is based on model reduction. The third method is based on pole placement and is built for the particular case that the original time-delay system has only a pure delayed state vector on its right hand side. For this method, the optimal gain such that the decay rate of the closed-loop system is maximized is also proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is illustrated by three linear time-delay systems that are open-loop unstable.	display lag;linear system	Bin Zhou	2015	Systems & Control Letters	10.1016/j.sysconle.2015.05.006	full state feedback;control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	EDA	68.04879390424546	-2.3150908447736245	61474

By constructing a sliding mode prediction model at first, the future, present and history information of the system can be used to improve the performance of sliding mode control. Because of sliding mode reference trajectory, the reachability of sliding mode is achieved, and the reaching mode can be determined by designers in advance. Due to feedback correction and receding horizon optimization, the influence of uncertainty can be compensated in time and control law is obtained subsequently. Theoretical analysis proves the closed-loop system possesses robustness to matched or unmatched uncertainty, without requiring the known bound of uncertainty. Simulation results illustrate the validity of the presented algorithm.	nonlinear system	Lingfei Xiao;Yue Zhu	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21111-9_10	variable structure control;discrete time and continuous time;real-time computing;sliding mode control;nonlinear system;computer science;control theory;predictive modelling;tracking;state observer	Robotics	65.05013370271472	-7.358869601449627	61566

Our framework combines joint estimation of time-varying global and local states with information-seeking control optimizing the behavior of the agents. It is suited to nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems and, in particular, to location-aware networks. For cooperative estimation, a combination of belief propagation message passing and consensus is used. For cooperative control, the negative posterior joint entropy of all states is maximized via a gradient ascent. The estimation layer provides the control layer with probabilistic information in the form of sample representations of probability distributions. Simulation results demonstrate intelligent behavior of the agents and excellent estimation performance for a simultaneous self-localization and target tracking problem. In a cooperative localization scenario with only one anchor, mobile agents can localize themselves after a short time with an accuracy that is higher than the accuracy of the performed distance measurements.	belief propagation;consensus dynamics;gradient descent;joint entropy;location awareness;message passing;mobile agent;nonlinear system;simulation;software propagation;times ascent	Florian Meyer;Henk Wymeersch;Markus Fröhle;Franz Hlawatsch	2015	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2015.2430519	sequential estimation;entropy;estimation;message passing;simulation;wireless sensor network;consensus;computer science;linear programming;machine learning;distributed computing;statistics;belief propagation	ML	53.89003063481239	3.386150852300476	61671

The use of multiple Lyapunov functions (MLFs) method permits removal of a common restriction in which the nonlinear structures in the non-switched nonlinear systems are restricted to a triangular structure when applying backstepping. Using the MLFs method and the adding a power integrator technique, we design state-feedback controllers for individual subsystems and construct a switching law to guarantee asymptotic stability of the closed-loop switched system. As an application of the proposed design method, the global stabilization problem of a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system and two inverted pendulums which cannot be handled by the existing methods is investigated.	nonlinear system;triangular matrix	Lijun Long;Jun Zhao	2014	J.

The PCS is controlled using a Single Input-Single Output control system structure in cart position control loop. The performance of the control structure with data-driven ADRC controllers is compared with that of a control structure with a discrete-time data-driven Model-Free Control-intelligent Proportional Integral Derivative (MFC-iPID) controller and with linear controller having the same number of tunable parameters as ADRC and MFC-iPID through real-time experimental results.

By changing of variables, we transform the actuator unsymmetrical saturation control problem into a symmetrical one. The main advantage of the proposed method is improving the dynamic performance of the closed-loop system with a region of attraction as large as possible. By the Lyapunov approach and the scheduling technology, the existence conditions for the admissible controller are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.	robust control;scheduling (computing)	Qian Wang;Anke Xue	2018	Int. J.

This observer estimates the average behavior of the system with an estimation error assurance. To design an average state observer with explicit consideration of the estimation error, we first derive a tractable representation of the estimation error system. On the basis of this representation, we provide a theoretical upper bound of the estimation error for the average state observer. As a result, a systematic procedure to design the average state observers with an estimation error assurance is presented. Finally, we show the efficiency of the average state observer through an example of spatially discretized thermal diffusion networks.	algorithmic efficiency;cobham's thesis;discretization;kalman filter;mean squared error	Tomonori Sadamoto;Takayuki Ishizaki;Jun-ichi Imura	2017	IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems	10.1109/TCNS.2016.2550866	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory;mathematics;alpha beta filter	EDA	66.29391906324501	-1.0833587724577172	62170

Then, the sufficient existence conditions of the fault detection filters and the solving method are simultaneously derived. Furthermore, a time domain optimization approach is proposed to improve the performance of the fault detection system.

An estimator and a nominal model of the plant are used explicitly at the controller node to generate control action and schedule control action updates. The data transmissions from the sensor to the network controller are “self-triggered” by imposing the scheduling of the data packet transmissions to meet a soft deadline, while the control action updates generated by the network controller are “event-triggered”, with a new measurement of the nominal model's state obtained to update control action whenever a triggering condition is satisfied or whenever the state of the nominal model is reset by the estimator.	control system;network interface controller;network packet;quantization (signal processing);scheduling (computing);telecommunications network;time-varying network	Han Yu;Eloy García;Panos J.

This technique allows nonlinear path tracking in multivariable and complex systems. This new methodology consists in finding the control action to make the system follow predefined concentration profiles solving a system of linear equations. The controller parameters are selected with a Monte Carlo algorithm so as to minimize a previously defined cost index. The control scheme is applied to a fed-batch penicillin production process. Different tests are shown to prove the controller effectiveness, such as adding parametric uncertainty, perturbations in the control action and in the initial conditions. Moreover, a comparison with other controllers from the literature is made, showing the better performance of the present approach.	complex systems;initial condition;linear algebra;linear equation;mimo;mathematical model;monte carlo algorithm;nonlinear system;optimal control;perturbation theory;spring batch;system of linear equations	M.

We reemphasize the common features found in most of the models that have appeared in the literature, which include stochastic switched systems, Markov jump systems, impulsive stochastic systems, switching diffusions, stochastic impulsive systems driven by renewal processes, diffusions driven by Lévy processes, piecewise-deterministic Markov processes, general stochastic hybrid systems, and stochastic hybrid inclusions. Then we review many of the stability concepts that have been studied, including Lyapunov stability, Lagrange stability, asymptotic stability, and recurrence. Next, we detail Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for these properties, and additional relaxations of Lyapunov conditions. Many other aspects of stability theory for SHS, like converse Lyapunov theorems and robustness theory, are not fully developed; hence, we also formulate some open problems to serve as a partial roadmap for the development of the underdeveloped pieces. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on a novel non-parallel distributed compensation (non-PDC) control scheme combined with a new non-quadratic Lyapunov function, less conservative stabilization conditions are developed. The proposed non-quadratic Lyapunov function is homogeneous polynomially parameter-dependent on membership functions. As the degree of the Lyapunov function increases, the conservatism of the obtained stabilization conditions is gradually reduced. By exploiting the algebraic property of membership functions, the stabilization conditions approach to exactness in the sense of convergence. Compared with the existing methods, no slack variables are introduced in control synthesis, and hence the same or less conservative results can be obtained with a lower computational cost. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	fuzzy control system	Dawei Ding;Xiaoli Li;Yixin Yin;Xiang-Peng Xie	2012	Inf.

The measured signals are assumed to be quantised with a logarithmic quantiser. Using a fuzzy-basis-dependent Lyapunov function, the finite frequency l2 gain definition, the generalised S-procedure, and Finsler's lemma, a set of sufficient conditions are established in terms of matrix inequalities, ensuring that the filtering error system is stable and the H∞ attenuation level, from disturbance to the estimation error, is smaller than a given value over a prescribed finite frequency domain of the external disturbances. With the aid of Finsler's lemma, a large number of slack variables are introduced to the design conditions, which provides extra degrees of freedom in optimising the guaranteed H∞ performance. This directly leads to performance improvement and reduction of conservatism. Finally, we give a simulation example to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed design method, and we show that a lower H∞ attenuation level can be obtained by our developed approach in comparison with another result in the literature.	filter design;nonlinear system	D.

906c38679482b06ff0ed4efd025b59230c35ab7d	iterative robust stabilization algorithm for periodic orbits of hybrid dynamical systems: application to bipedal running		This paper presents a systematic numerical algorithm to design optimal H∞ continuous-time controllers to robustly stabilize periodic orbits for hybrid dynamical systems in the presence of discrete-time uncertainties. A parameterized set of closed-loop hybrid systems is assumed for which there exists a common periodic orbit. The algorithm is created based on an iterative sequence of optimization problems involving Bilinear and Linear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs and LMIs). At each iteration, the optimal H∞ problem is translated into a BMI optimization problem which can be easily solved using available software packages. Some sufficient conditions for the convergence of the iterative algorithm are presented. The power of the algorithm is then demonstrated in designing robust stabilizing virtual constraints for running of a highly underactuated bipedal robot with 7 degrees of underactuation in the presence of impact model uncertainties.	algorithm;bilinear transform;brain–computer interface;brian;dynamical system;feedback;hybrid system;iteration;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimization problem;robot;robustness (computer science);scalability;simulation;underactuation	Kaveh Akbari Hamed;Jessy W.

49b1f5bcd8cb355d2aa687e2f860f42a243504ac	receding-horizon control of lti systems with quantized inputs1	tj mechanical engineering and machinery;aut;qa75 electronic computers computer science	This paper deals with the stabilization problem for a particular class of hybrid systems, namely discrete– time linear systems subject to a uniform (a priori fixed) quantization of the control set. Results of our previous work on the subject provided a description of minimal (in a specific sense) invariant sets that could be rendered maximally attractive under any quantized feedback strategy. In this paper, we consider the design of stabilizing laws that optimize a given cost index on the state and input evolution on a finite, receding horizon. Application of Model Predictive Control techniques for the solution of similar hybrid control problems through Mixed Logical Dynamical reformulations can provide a stabilizing control law, provided that the feasibility hypotheses are met. In this paper, we discuss precisely what are the shortest horizon length and the minimal invariant terminal set for which it can be guaranteed a stabilizing MPC scheme. The final paper will provide an example and simulations of the application of the control scheme to a practical quantized control problem. ∗Support from “European Project Recsys–Ist–2001–37170” and from “Progetto coordinato Agenzia 2000 CNR C00E714” †Centro “E.

Firstly, an adaptive Thau observer (ATO) is presented to estimate the quadrotor rotor fault magnitudes, and then faults with different magnitudes and time-varying natures are rated into corresponding fault severity levels based on the pre-defined fault-tolerant boundaries. Secondly, a systematic FTC strategy which can coordinate various FTC methods is designed to compensate for failures depending on the fault types and severity levels. Unlike former stand-alone passive FTC or active FTC, our proposed FTC scheme can compensate for faults in a way of condition-based maintenance (CBM), and especially consider the fatal failures that traditional FTC techniques cannot accommodate to avoid the crashing of UAVs. Finally, various simulations are carried out to show the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method.

According to the strong coupling between the variations and parameters time variable characteristics, it is difficult to set up the arithmetical model and achieve better control effects. To overcome these difficulties, this paper adopts T-S fuzzy model to describe the input-output relationship based on collected data of system. Due to the time variable character, it is hard to control with traditional PID controller. To improve the control effect, combining neural network control algorithm, this paper adopts PIDNN (PID Neural Network) controller. The PIDNN algorithm is not just tuning PID parameters by neural network, and improves the system control ability by defining proportional, integral, derivative characteristics neurons. Basing on the theoretical analysis, simulations are carried out by using MATLAB. The results of simulation experiment show that the designed model is effective and the control system achieves satisfied control effect.	algorithm;artificial neural network;control system;matlab;pid;simulation;varchar	Xue-Ling Song;Zhe-Ying Song;Chao-Ying Liu	2014	IJWMC	10.1504/IJWMC.2014.058873	pid controller;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;artificial neural network	Robotics	61.06170542837019	-8.884499882419474	64209

Compared with empirical models, the electrochemical model features more accurate state estimates over a broader and longer use of the battery. In this work, model implementation schemes are devised to make the electrochemical model uncomplicated enough to be embedded into the BMS. A nonlinear system of partial differential equations in the model is discretized into a linearized system of algebraic equations (AEs). A solver selected to evaluate the resulting system of AEs is modified for its application to the BMS. As the BMS is preoccupied by its existing tasks, the reformulated equations and optimized solver are reorganized such that the limited computational resources of the BMS are appropriately exploited. Consequently, the electrochemical model is implemented into the BMS, predicting battery behaviors in 1 s intervals while occupying a 14 kB RAM.	battery management system	Woosuk Sung;Chee Burm Shin	2015	Computers & Chemical Engineering	10.1016/j.compchemeng.2015.02.007	electronic engineering;simulation;engineering;electrical engineering	DB	54.91387357407644	-1.7672909859638417	64409

It was shown that defuzzification can be treated as a mapping from a high dimensional space to the real line. When system performance indices are considered, the defuzzification mapping which optimizes the performance indices for the given fuzzy sets is known as the optimal defuzzification mapping. Thus, finding this optimal defuzzification mapping becomes the essence of defuzzification. The problem with this idea, however, is that the space formed by all possible continuous defuzzification mappings is so large to search that the only recourse is an approximation to the optimal defuzzification mapping. With this, learning algorithms can be devised to find the optimal parameters of defuzzifiers with fixed structures. The proposed method is rigorously examined and compared with some well-known defuzzification methods. To overcome the resultant enormous computational load problem with this algorithm, the concept of defuzzification filter is additionally proposed. An application of the method to the power system stabilization problem is presented.	algorithm;defuzzification	Augustine O.

The new SMCS structure is viewed in the framework of reference trajectory tracking using a first-order nonlinear dynamic system as a local approximation of the process model. The sliding mode control signal augments the control signal specific to a model-free PI control system (CS) structure in order to compensate for the estimation errors which affect the systematic design and performance. The derivatives in the local approximation of the process model are estimated numerically using a Savitzky-Golay filter to carry out both differentiation and smoothing. A simple design approach is proposed for the SMCS structure. The real-time experimental results concerning the speed control of a laboratory nonlinear DC servo system prove the performance improvement of the SMCS structure against a model-free PI CS structure.	control system;dynamical system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;order of approximation;process modeling;real-time transcription;servo;smoothing;submarine command system	Radu-Emil Precup;Mircea-Bogdan Radac;Claudia-Adina Dragos;Stefan Preitl;Emil M.

We demonstrate our approach on two case studies, both addressing the broad class of acoustic systems for which the sound generation is obtained through the interaction of a linear system (resonator) and a nonlinear system (excitation). The first case is a physically based impact model, where the resonator is described in terms of its normal modes and the nonlinear contact force is modeled through a simplified collision equation and kernel regression. In the second case study, a model of the voice phonation is illustrated in which the vocal folds are represented by a lumped linear mass-spring system and the nonlinear flow component is modeled through simple Bernoulli-based equations and kernel regression.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;bernoulli polynomials;curve fitting;discretization;experiment;kernel (operating system);linear system;nonlinear system;normal mode;recurrent neural network;support vector machine;test set;waveform	Carlo Drioli;Davide Rocchesso	2007	Numerical Algorithms	10.1007/s11075-007-9117-z	kernel regression;support vector machine;normal mode;nonlinear system;physical model;control theory;mathematics;linear system;effective mass	Robotics	54.475121988110715	-4.524888926061701	64533

Mao’s work (Automatica 2013) on stabilization of hybrid stochastic differential equations by discrete-time feedback control. In X.R. Mao’s work, the feedback control depends on discrete-time observation of the state process but on continuous time observation of the switching process. While, in this work, we study the feedback control depending on discrete-time observations of the state process and the switching process. Our criteria depend explicitly on the regular conditions of the coefficients of stochastic differential equations and on the stationary distribution of the switching process. The sharpness of our criteria is shown through studying the stability of linear systems, which also shows explicitly that the stability of hybrid stochastic differential equations depends essentially on the long time behavior of the switching process.	coefficient;feedback;linear system;regular expression;stationary process	Jinghai Shao	2017	SIAM J.

If the constrained variables at the steady state are 0, it is rather easy to compute the maximal output admissible set Ω∞. However, if the constrained variables at the steady state are not 0, then computing Ω∞ is very difficult. We do not compute the Ω∞, but we propose a parametric characterization of Ω∞. By using this characterization, we propose an algorithm to decide reference signal r[k] on-line so that constraints are not violated. The usefulness of the proposing method is examined through numerical examples.	algorithm;maximal set;numerical analysis;numerical method;online and offline;steady state;utility	Yuzo Ohta;Izumi Masubuchi	2014	IECON 2014 - 40th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2014.7048502	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory	Vision	63.22566509943168	-0.8440388808943328	65094

1e440985cef2123c0fe879f3e8d22ec0126b38a2	reduced lpv model development and control of a solution copolymerization reactor		In this paper, a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model of a solution copolymerization reactor is developed by taking into consideration the time-varying nature of the parameters in the process. The aim is to design a controller that can ensure the stability and the desired performance of the copolymerization reactor in a prescribed range of operation. The LPV model complexity in terms of the number of scheduling variables is reduced by means of the application of a parameter set mapping (PSM) method which has proven to be effective in reducing the conservatism in LPV model development. The reduced model which only depends on one scheduling variable allows to reduce the complexity of the LPV controller synthesis for the process. Simulation results using the nonlinear model of the copolymerization reactor are provided to illustrate the improvements brought by the LPV controller in terms of reducing the convergence time and the control effort in comparison with a previously developed model predictive controller for the copolymerization process.	controller (computing);model transformation;nonlinear system;principal component analysis;reactor (software);rejection sampling;schedule;scheduling (computing);simulation;vii	Sandy Rahme;Hossam Seddik Abbas;Nader Meskin;Roland Tóth;Javad Mohammadpour	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2015.7320750	control engineering;real-time computing;engineering;control theory	Robotics	59.022153960823815	-5.8299374166488835	65685
f04b95b9701d689f1607e581d48af81457ebf059	a hybrid control strategy for real-time control of the iron removal process of the zinc hydrometallurgy plants		As part of the zinc hydrometallurgy plant, the iron removal process is a complex system with four cascaded reactors. Tighter process-index control is difficult to achieve due to the complicated, long, and time-varying removal process. The control performance is also affected by the quality of the ore source and external disturbances. Little research is documented in the literature to address these difficulties and manual control is widely used. An innovative hybrid control strategy is developed to control the iron removal process’ indices within narrow ranges with minimum cost of additive regents, including oxygen and zinc oxide. This strategy is composed of an optimal setting model, a model-based optimal controller, an integrated prediction model, a fuzzy-logic-based feedforward compensator, and a model feedback adjustor. The optimal setting model automatically optimizes the set-points of the process indices under different production conditions. To achieve the process requirements with minimal cost, the model-based optimal controller is designed. The integrated prediction model is established to provide a more accurate on-line prediction of the process indices by integrating the mechanism prediction model and an error compensation model based on the least-square support vector machine. Based on the predicted process indices, the compensator is developed for the optimal controller. The adjustor provides a parameter adjustment mechanism. Four-week-long industrial experiments in the largest zinc hydrometallurgy plant in China show that the control strategy can not only improve the process-indexes control performance, but also save 6.55% oxygen and 4.61% zinc oxide consumptions, which translates to 222 858 m3 oxygen and 1236 t zinc oxide per year (a saving of about $570 000). The hybrid control strategy can be extended to cover other similar processes in the zinc hydrometallurgy and other industries.

The stability of the uncertain system in the sliding mode is assured under certain conditions. Furthermore, the asymptotic behavior of the closed-loop system with mismatched time-varying uncertainties inside boundary layers is analyzed. The validity of the proposed control methodology is demonstrated by simulation results.	block cipher mode of operation;simulation	Ming-Chang Pai;Alok Sinha	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384904	variable structure control;real-time computing;asymptotic analysis;sliding mode control;boundary layer;control theory;feedback	Robotics	67.12806201194425	-3.7684022126820627	65931

The parts of the code that host linear system implementations need dedicated analysis tools, since intervals or linear abstract domains will give imprecise results, if any at all, on these systems. Previous work by FERET proposes a specific abstraction for digital filters that addresses this issue on a specific class of controllers.  This paper aims at generalizing the idea. It works directly on system representation, relying on existing methods from control theory to automatically generate quadratic invariants for linear time invariant systems, whose stability is provable. This class encompasses n-th order digital filters and, in general, controllers embedded in critical systems.  While control theorists only focus on the existence of such invariants, this paper proposes a method to effectively compute tight ones. The method has been implemented and applied to some benchmark systems, giving good results. It also considers floating points issues and validates the soundness of the computed invariants.	abstract interpretation;benchmark (computing);control theory;digital filter;embedded system;feret (facial recognition technology);invariant (computer science);linear system;linear time-invariant theory;provable security;time complexity;time-invariant system	Pierre Roux;Romain Jobredeaux;Pierre-Loïc Garoche;Eric Feron	2012		10.1145/2185632.2185651	mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;control theory;mathematics	Logic	65.17354990419642	-0.40223148927752755	65973

If a bound on the L norm of the disturbance is known, it is shown that the dead-zone controller outperforms the projection controller if the a priori information on the uncertainty level is sufficiently conservative. The second result shows that the projection controller is superior to the dead-zone controller when the a priori information on the disturbance level is sufficiently conservative.

The new control law retains the simplicity and robustness of sliding mode controllers while the chattering problem commonly associated with this type of controller is completely eliminated. The control law is directly expressed in a discretized format for digital implemetation. Simulations show that the new controller is chatterless, robust with respect to large parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, and simple for digital implemetation.	digital rights management;discretization;kerrison predictor;optimal control;robot;robust control	Jun Wang;W.

Our modeling framework allows for the e¢ cient online construction of limited lookahead discrete abstractions of the nonlinear continuous dynamics of the plant model. Discrete event supervisory controller synthesis techniques are used to construct a controller based on a DES specication and the abstracted plant model.

A new packet reordering method is presented to deal with packet disordering and choose the newest control input. A relationship between the reordered packet over two consecutive sampling intervals is given for the NCS with both time delays and packet dropouts. A sufficient condition for the NCS to be exponentially stable is presented by using the average dwelltime method. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.		Andong Liu;Wen-an Zhang;Li Yu;Steven Liu;Michael Z. Q.

The state controller is designed to eliminate the start-up overshoot and reduce maximal dynamic error of load change response, but the state controller is not capable of eliminating the steady-state error under the load change condition. By using an additional discrete PID controller the steady state error could be eliminated. For the next consideration, the decomposed discrete fuzzy PID controller has been analyzed. All control algorithms are performed at a continuous current mode of operation. The experimental results are presented in the paper.

In this part, the physical exertion and bilateral movement of air and materials, together with chemical reactions take place. Thus, this system has immensely complex and nonlinear dynamic equations. These equations have not worked out yet. Only in exceptional case; however, a large number of the involved parameters were crossed out and an approximation model was presented instead. This issue caused many problems for designing a cement rotary kiln controller. In this paper, we presented nonlinear predictor and simulator models for a real cement rotary kiln by using nonlinear identification technique on the Locally Linear Neuro-Fuzzy (LLNF) model. For the first time, a simulator model as well as a predictor one with a precise fifteen minute prediction horizon for a cement rotary kiln is presented. These models are trained by LOLIMOT algorithm which is an incremental tree-structure algorithm. At the end, the characteristics of these models are expressed. Furthermore, we presented the pros and cons of these models. The data collected from White Saveh Cement Company is used for modeling.	approximation algorithm;bilateral filter;branch predictor;delay-gradient congestion control;fault detection and isolation;kerrison predictor;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;preprocessor;rotary woofer;sampling (signal processing);simulation;time-scale calculus;tree structure	Masoud Sadeghian;Alireza Fatehi	2009	2009 Second International Conference on Computer and Electrical Engineering	10.1504/IJMA.2013.058377	control engineering;engineering;control theory;mechanical engineering	Robotics	58.80149734465438	-7.466437306374004	67219

Two different 2-sliding mode control algorithms are proposed, including a discontinuous one and a quasi-continuous one. The discontinuous algorithm is built based upon the Lyapunov method, and the global finite-time Lyapunov stability rather than the global finite-time convergence is established for the resulting closed-loop system by using the modified adding a power integrator technique. On this basis, a quasi-continuous 2-sliding mode algorithm is further developed, and the chattering problem can be considerably reduced.

As to this specific neural network, an adaptive learning algorithm based on improved Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is derived. Because of the complete match between the neural network and the inter-harmonic model, the presented algorithm can effectively improve the precision in the process of inter-harmonics estimation and meanwhile, accelerate its convergence. Simulation results have testified its performance with a variety of generated inter-harmonics. If noise is not taken into consideration, the introduced algorithm can accurately measure the power system inter-harmonics. Furthermore, when the signal is polluted with Gaussian noise, our method can still maintain relatively high level of accuracy.	artificial neural network;estimation theory;fast fourier transform;gaussian blur;high-level programming language;kernel density estimation;levenberg–marquardt algorithm;network model;nonlinear system;relevance;simulation;white noise	Xiuchun Xiao;Xiao-hua Jiang;Shi-Yi Xie;Xiao-min Lu;Yunong Zhang	2010	2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)	10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645220	control engineering;mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning	Robotics	59.60458928517743	-6.126617848912425	67368

In general, this norm cannot be determined explicitly. Most prior work has focused on efficiently computing upper bounds for the induced ℒ2 norm. This paper presents a complementary algorithm to compute lower bounds for this norm. The proposed approach is based on restricting the parameter trajectory to be a periodic signal. This restriction enables the use of recent results for exact calculation of the ℒ2 norm for a periodic time varying system. The proposed lower bound algorithm has two benefits. First, the lower bound complements standard upper bound techniques. Specifically, a small gap between the bounds indicates that further computation, e.g. upper bounds with more complex Lyapunov functions, is unnecessary. Second, the lower bound algorithm returns a worst-case parameter trajectory for the LPV system that can be further analyzed to provide insight into the system performance. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.	algorithm;approximation;best, worst and average case;computation;floor and ceiling functions;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;robust control;scheduling (computing);t-norm	Tamas Peni;Peter J.

This study evaluates the performance of controllers via the variation of each overlay factor and the variation of maximum overlay errors in real settings. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an empirical study was conducted in a leading semiconductor company in Taiwan and the results showed practical viability of the proposed DAPI controller to reduce overlay errors effectively than conventional exponentially weighted moving average controller used in this company.	advanced process control;algorithm;chemical-mechanical planarization;debian;deployment environment;embedded system;experiment;gnu nano;image resolution;interaction;jade;just-in-time compilation;multilayer perceptron;multistage amplifier;nonlinear system;optimal control;overlay control;process modeling;propagation of uncertainty;self-tuning;semiconductor device fabrication;semiconductor fabrication plant;semiconductor industry;software propagation;wafer fabrication	Chen-Fu Chien;Ying-Jen Chen;Chia-Yu Hsu;Hung-Kai Wang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2013.2280618	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;process control;control theory;mechanical engineering	Robotics	57.76290677568803	-8.479853598333024	67673

The computational savings of the RT solver are enhanced by the unique framework within which the OPC is posed, enabling significant reduction in the dimensionality of the search for situations where computational speed takes priority over optimality of the solutions.

By employing two Neural Networks (NNs), the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the cost function is derived without requiring a priori knowledge about system dynamics. Weights of the identifier and critic NNs are tuned online and simultaneously such that unknown terms are approximated accurately and the control signal is kept between the saturation bounds. The convergence of NNs' weights, identification error, and system states is guaranteed using Lyapunov's direct method. Finally, simulation results are performed on two nonlinear systems to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.	actuator device component;approximation algorithm;bellman equation;bounds checking;control theory;controllers;convergence (action);direct method in the calculus of variations;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;hysteresis;identifier;jacobi method;loss function;lyapunov fractal;miconazole nitrate 0.02 mg/mg topical ointment [critic-aid clear];neural networks;nonlinear system;optimal control;singular value decomposition;system dynamics;weight;hamilton rating scale for depression	Kasra Esfandiari;Farzaneh Abdollahi;Heidar Ali Talebi	2017	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2017.05.013	artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;mathematical optimization;control theory;artificial neural network;system dynamics;nonlinear system;adaptive control;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;optimal control;lyapunov function;control theory	Robotics	62.46262379670118	-3.1316025802776393	67931

Its drawbacks are the numerical convergence stability of the observer and closed-loop control performance deterioration with activated plant input/output constraints. The recent direct use of measured input and output variables to formulate a non-minimal state-space (NMSS) model overcomes these problems, but the subsequent controller is too sensitive to model mismatch. In this article, an improved structure of NMSS model that incorporates the output-tracking error is first formulated and then a subsequent predictive functional control design is proposed. The proposed controller is tested on both model match and model mismatch cases for comparison with previous controllers. Results show that control performance is improved.

In most real battery systems, the drive signals may not fully satisfy this condition at all times, which can lead to divergence and failure of the incorporated battery management system. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid battery parameter identification concept is proposed whereby the parameters are initially identified using a special random signal called the pseudo random binary sequences. Thereafter, the Kalman filter algorithm is implemented online to estimate and track any `disturbances' caused by varying operating conditions. A dynamic European drive cycle is used to experimentally verify the excellent performance of the proposed technique against a more precise electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method.		S.

The model uncertainty is assumed to be described by a discrete set of linear models (multi-plant uncertainty), and the robustness is achieved by assembling cost-contracting constraints for all the possible models in the uncertainty domain. On the basis of a suitable state-space model description, an offset free control law is obtained bymeans of a onestep optimization formulation. The usefulness of the method proposed here is illustrated with control simulations of an unstable reactor system taken from the literature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper considers the issues of detectability conditions and detection time in a nonlinear fault diagnosis scheme based on the learning approach. First, conditions are derived to characterize the range of detectable faults. Then, nonconservative upper bounds are computed for the detection time of incipient and abrupt faults.

Avoiding testing every prospective controller, we check whether every controller in the large set of controllers will work satisfactorily when they are connected with an actual but unknown plant by experimenting only a small subset of candidate controllers. In doing this, the ν-gap metric will be a main tool.	experiment;game controller;norm (social);precomputation;prospective search	Jisang Park;Robert R.

20a1d3b1f09fcc42f3cc4438734a112fe6fbd686	network-based filtering for stochastic markovian jump systems with application to pwm-driven boost converter		This paper investigates the filtering problem for a class of stochastic jump systems over network communication channel. The plant under consideration is a class of Markovian jump systems with state-dependent noise. The network communication links between the plant and filter are impact, and the effects of network-induced transmission delay and sensor saturation are taken into simultaneous consideration. The main difficulty in this filtering problem is that there exists transmission delay in the received mode signals of the filter side, which results in that the real-time information of jump mode \(r_{k}\) is not accessible. To overcome this obstacle, in this paper, an state space augmentation approach is developed for the jumping mode r(k), based on which the resulting filtering dynamics is modeled as a new Markovian jump system with two jumping parameters. A mode-dependent filtering scheme is then developed to guarantee that the resulting overall system is stochastically stable with a guaranteed \(H_{\infty }\) performance index. Finally, a numerical example of pulse-width-modulation-driven boost converter is included to show the effectiveness of the networked filtering design strategy.	boost converter;pulse-width modulation	Wei Yang	2017	CSSP	10.1007/s00034-016-0452-y	control engineering;real-time computing;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.76514918036342	1.5664049222277157	68965

Firstly, satellite attitude control system with nonlinearity and uncertainty is modeled. The residual errors can be obtained by fuzzy parity equation and they are only sensitive to the output of specific actuators (or sensors). Secondly, the time series of the output errors are used to build the autoregressive (AR) model. Therefore, the faults in the satellite attitude control system are predicted by using the AR model. Finally, the results of fault prognosis are given by fault probability. The confidence factor is determined which shows the confidence level of the fault prognosis.	autoregressive model;control system;nonlinear system;sensor;time series	Hua Song;Yi Zhang;Maolin Zhang;JingJing Shen	2013		10.3182/20130902-3-CN-3020.00134	simulation;control theory	Robotics	62.051101057003585	-5.283650372653087	69146

3211d4da4779c82aaaac8b83218d3b54b490ee54	bidirectional tracking robust controls for a dc/dc buck converter-dc motor system		Two differential flatness-based bidirectional tracking robust controls for a DC/DC Buck converter-DC motor system are designed. To achieve such a bidirectional tracking, an inverter is used in the system. First control considers the complete dynamics of the system, that is, it considers the DC/DC Buck converter-inverter-DC motor connection as a whole. Whereas the second separates the dynamics of the Buck converter from the one of the inverter-DC motor, so that a hierarchical controller is generated. The experimental implementation of both controls is performed via MATLAB-Simulink and a DS1104 board in a built prototype of the DC/DC Buck converter-inverter-DC motor connection. Controls show a good performance even when system parameters are subjected to abrupt uncertainties. Thus, robustness of such controls is verified.

dbb1bf37e0e533f6f60d3b05b118f4e156387202	guaranteed model-based fault detection in cyber-physical systems: a model invalidation approach		This paper presents a sound and complete fault detection approach for cyber-physical systems represented by hidden-mode switched affine models with time varying parametric uncertainty. The fault detection approach builds upon techniques from model invalidation. In particular, a set-membership approach is taken where the noisy input-output data is compared to the set of behaviors of a nominal model. As we show, this set-membership check can be reduced to the feasibility of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which can be solved efficiently by leveraging the state-of-the-art MILP solvers. In the second part of the paper, given a system model and a fault model, the concept of T -detectability is introduced. If a pair of system and fault models satisfies T -detectability property for a finite T , this allows the model invalidation algorithm to be implemented in a receding horizon manner, without compromising detection guarantees. In addition, the concept of weak-detectability is introduced which extends the proposed approach to a more expressive class of fault models that capture language constraints on the mode sequences. Finally, the efficiency of the approach is illustrated with numerical examples motivated by smart building radiant systems.	algorithm;cyber-physical system;fault detection and isolation;fault model;hybrid system;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;radiant ai;real-time clock;sensor;social inequality;weak measurement	Farshad Harirchi;Necmiye Ozay	2018	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2018.03.040	stuck-at fault;control theory;mathematical optimization;parametric statistics;fault model;cyber-physical system;system model;real-time computing;fault detection and isolation;affine transformation;linear programming;computer science	SE	63.67495279813289	-0.3908844725938201	69697

The formulas of frequency weights are obtained in terms of the plant, the original controller and a matrix of free parameters. By varying the free parameters in the resulting two-sided frequency weighted model reduction problem, frequency weighted error can be significantly reduced to yield more accurate low-order controllers.

It is based on a novel mapping of fuzzy relations on Boolean functions and exploits existing Boolean synthesis algorithms. In this mapping each fuzzy membership predicate is translated into a Boolean variable and proper constraints on Boolean manipulations are added to guarantee fuzziness translation. The formal consistency of the approach depends on a fuzzy semantic which easily generalizes most of the existing models, granting broad applicability to the suggested procedure. The applicability of an enhanced two-level Boolean minimizer is demonstrated, and the technique is applied to the fuzzy identification of nonlinear systems, consistently reducing the number of rules and easing application of further optimization interventions.	algorithm;boolean algebra;exploit (computer security);fuzzy rule;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system	Riccardo Rovatti;Roberto Guerrieri;Giorgio Baccarani	1995	IEEE Trans.

Recently, some FAT-based robust impedance control approaches have been presented using Fourier series expansion or Legendre polynomials for uncertainty estimation. However, the dimensions of regressor matrices in these approaches are relatively large. This problem becomes hypersensitive especially for higher degree of freedom robot manipulators. In this paper, a simpler and less computational FAT-based robust controller is presented without considering discontinuous nonlinearities. It is assumed that the lumped uncertainty can be modeled by a linear differential equation with unknown coefficients. Then, using Stone-Weierstrass theorem, it is verified that these differential equations are universal approximators. The advantage of proposed controller in comparison with previous related works is reducing the dimensions of regressor matrices.

The delays are bigger than one sample and random. By using of buffers, the original problem can be transformed into linear system with constant delay. The optimal size of the buffer is an open problem. Increase of the buffer length deteriorates the quality because of longer delay in the control loop. At the same time longer buffer decreases the probability of packet dropping and thus improves the quality. The idea is to make the system more robust by buffering and simultaneously adjusting the control loop sampling and actuation intervals. The paper presents this “co-design” approach and demonstrates it for LQ control problem of cart-pendulum model.	algorithm;control point (mathematics);control system;distributed control system;dropout (neural networks);dynamical system;heart rate variability;inverted pendulum;letter-quality printer;linear system;log management;network computing system;network packet;point of view (computer hardware company);sampling (signal processing);simulation	Wojciech Grega;Andrzej Tutaj	2014	2014 19th International Conference on Methods and Models in Automation and Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2014.6957464	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;real-time computing;controller;networked control system;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.59726677405685	1.2756027740757507	70199

For the proposed controller, proportional-derivative variant is chosen, and its input-output mapping is derived. The membership functions for inputs are s-functions, π-functions, respectively z-functions, while the output membership functions have constant values. To define the rules, a zero-order Sugeno fuzzy model is chosen.

The expression of the process output, the long-term stability conditions and the optimal discount factor of this controller are derived analytically. Furthermore, we use the proposed second-order dynamical model to illustrate the effects of mis-identification of the process I-O model on the process total mean square error (TMSE). Via a comprehensive simulation study, the model demonstrates that the TMSE may inflate by more than 150% if a second-order dynamical model with moderately large carryover effects is wrongly identified as that of a first-order model. This means that the effects of mis-identification of the process I-O model on the process total mean square error (TMSE) is not negligible for implementing a dynamic RTR process control.

In the RADRC framework, the disturbance and unmodeled dynamics associated with induction motors are treated as an additional state variable, which is then estimated and compensated for in real time. This reduces a normally complex, time-varying, nonlinear, and uncertain dynamic process to an approximately linear, time-invariant, cascade integral form, where a simple proportional plus derivative controller suffices. Simulation results demonstrate excellent tracking, disturbance rejection, and robustness performance of the RADRC in the absence of an accurate mathematical model of the induction motor.	control theory;mathematical induction;mathematical model;nonlinear system;rejection sampling;simulation;time-invariant system	Qing Zheng;Kiran K.

First, the Takagi and Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model is employed to approximate a nonlinear discrete-time system with time-delay. Next, based on the fuzzy model, a fuzzy observer-based fuzzy controller is developed to reduce the tracking error as small as possible for all bounded reference inputs. The advantage of proposed tracking control design is that only a simple fuzzy observer-based controller is used in our approach without feedback linearization technique and complicated adaptive scheme. By the proposed method, the fuzzy tracking control design problem is parameterized in terms of a linear matrix inequality problem (LMIP). The LMIP can be efficiently solved using the convex optimization techniques.

f813cd48d88299c27ae56ed05811c6586cbfc71c	mean square stability analysis and synthesis of stochastic continuous-time linear networked systems		In this technical note, we study the mean square stability-based analysis and controller synthesis of stochastic continuous-time linear networked systems. The stochastic uncertainty is assumed to enter multiplicatively in system dynamics through input and output channels of the plant. Necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square exponential stability are expressed in terms of the input-output property of deterministic or nominal system dynamics captured by the mean square system norm and variance of channel uncertainty. The stability results can also be interpreted as small gain theorem for continuous-time stochastic systems. Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI)-based optimization formulation is provided for the computation of mean square system norm for stability analysis and controller synthesis. For a special case of single input channel uncertainty, we also prove a fundamental limitation result that arise in the mean square exponential stabilization of continuous-time linear system. Overall, the contributions in this work generalize the existing results on stability analysis and controller synthesis from discrete-time linear systems to continuous-time linear systems with multiplicative uncertainty. Simulation results are presented for WSCC 9 bus power system to demonstrate the application of developed framework.	bibo stability;computation;exponential time hypothesis;input/output;linear matrix inequality;linear system;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;methods of computing square roots;simulation;stochastic process;system dynamics;time complexity	Sai Pushpak;Amit Diwadkar;Umesh Vaidya	2016	CoRR		mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.70198488867743	-0.2519650282483141	70977
0943dc278343719d5d35a6ef0da8b027ceb6099d	adaptive neural tracking control for switched high-order stochastic nonlinear systems		This paper deals with adaptive neural tracking control design for a class of switched high-order stochastic nonlinear systems with unknown uncertainties and arbitrary deterministic switching. The considered issues are: 1) completely unknown uncertainties; 2) stochastic disturbances; and 3) high-order nonstrict-feedback system structure. The considered mathematical models can represent many practical systems in the actual engineering. By adopting the approximation ability of neural networks, common stochastic Lyapunov function method together with adding an improved power integrator technique, an adaptive state feedback controller with multiple adaptive laws is systematically designed for the systems. Subsequently, a controller with only two adaptive laws is proposed to solve the problem of over parameterization. Under the designed controllers, all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded-input bounded-output stable in probability, and the system output can almost surely track the target trajectory within a specified bounded error. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.	approximation;artificial neural network;control theory;controllers;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;mathematics;neural network simulation;nonlinear system	Xudong Zhao;Xinyong Wang;Guangdeng Zong;Xiaolong Zheng	2017	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2017.2684218	control theory	Robotics	64.85476594971291	-5.824943623750096	71166

b8cdb36460445dcb723f21465a9d29ef8a89a8a4	a separation principle for embedded system interfacing		In designing systems, engineers decompose the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks. A classic example of this is the separation principle from control systems which allows one to decompose the design of an optimal feedback control system into two independent tasks by designing (a) an observer, and (b) a controller. We investigate an analogous result for embedded system interfacing that will allow separation of the design of the input and output hardware interfaces while still guaranteeing the ability of the software to meet the system requirements. We define the notions of observability (controllability) of the system requirements with respect to the input (output) interface. We show that for a system that can be modeled by a functional four-variable model, observability and controllability allow for the separation of the design of the input and output interfaces. We also show that this separation is not always possible for systems that need the general, relational fourvariable model. By strengthening either observability or controllability, we restrict the choice of input or output interfaces, but ensure separability of their designs.	control system;electrical connector;embedded system;emoticon;feedback;input/output;linear separability;output device;requirement;separation principle;system requirements	Lucian M.

The discontinuous control action does not allow the explicit identification of the coefficients of the filters, but only the identification of the so-called equivalent control coinciding with the ideal control. By coupling the variable structure control strategy with a continuous parameter adjustment mechanism it is instead possible to obtain an equivalent control which, during the sliding motion, turns out to be equal to a suitably constructed prediction error. As long as the parameter adaptation is driven by both the tracking error (which vanishes in finite time) and the prediction error, then the controller parameters prove to be exponentially convergent to the ideal values, provided that the reference signal is sufficiently persistently exciting.

2501776161246560ed945944dda3828fec56a8dd	binary mimo mrac using a passifying multiplier — a smooth transition to sliding mode control		Binary Model Reference Adaptive Control (B-MRAC) combines the advantages of Parameter Adaptive Control with those of Variable Structure Control. It was originally proposed for SISO systems. In this paper, a MIMO version of the B-MRAC is proposed for minimum phase uncertain linear plants with uniform relative degree one. In order to guarantee global stability properties, a passifying multiplier is designed so that the recently introduced generalized passivity condition called WASPR is achieved. This allows it to be applicable without the symmetry assumption on the plant uncertain high frequency gain matrix. The B-MRAC is shown to tend to the unit vector control as the adaptation gain increases to infinity. The benefits of the passifying multiplier are assessed in this transition from adaptive to sliding mode control.	mimo;minimum phase;simulation interoperability standards organization	Ivanko Yanque;Eduardo V.

The authors' attention is focused on the robust regulation of the system based on a new modeling approach under the assumption of norm-boundedness of the fast dynamics. In the proposed approach, the fast dynamics are treated as a norm-bounded disturbance (dynamic uncertainty). In this view, the synthesis is performed only for the certain dynamics of the two-time scale system, whose order is less than that of the original system. It should be noted, however, that this scheme is significantly different from the conventional approaches of order reduction for linear two-time scale systems. Specifically, in the present work, explicitly or implicitly, all the dynamics of the system are taken into consideration. In other words, the portion that is treated as a perturbation is incorporated in the design by its maximum possible gain --- in the L 2 sense --- over different values of the inputs. One of the advantagesof this approach is that --- unlike in the conventional approaches of the order reduction --- the reduced-order system still keeps some information of the `deleted' subsystem. Also, we consider the robust stability analysis and stability bound improvement of perturbed parameter (?) in the two-time scale systems by using linear fractional transformations and structured singular values (?) approach. In this direction, by introducing the parametric uncertainty and dynamic uncertainty in the two-time scale systems, we represent the system as a standard ?-interconnection framework by using linear fractional transformations, and derive a set of new stability conditions for the system in the frequency domain. The exact solution of ?-bound is characterized. It is shown that, in spite of the coupling between the dynamic uncertainties and certain dynamics, the designed H ? controller stabilizes the overall closed-loop system, in the presence of norm-bounded disturbances. To show the effectiveness of the approach, the modeling of the single-link flexible manipulator and control of the Tip-position of the manipulator by utilizing the mentioned method are presented in the case study.

Upon the case, and situations, different input data, membership functions and rules are developed dynamically for the Fuzzy predictor. Our main focus in developing the proposed controller is keeping generality of design. So, the controller can be adapted in different cases easily. To compensate for the possible lack of knowledge of experts for developing rule base of a Fuzzy controller, here, nonlinear regression is used as an alternative approach for developing the rule base. Furthermore, the performance of the controller is improved using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Also, based on the proposed Fuzzy controller and PSO, another predictor able to find one possible set of input values to catch a predefined angle is proposed. Several experimental tests were conducted to evaluate performance of the proposed controllers. Comparing experimental and predicted results shows that they are in a proper agreement with our claim.

In the proposed approach the phase state space (phase space) is beforehand somehow partitioned at observable points into given subsets (zones). The synthesizing control actions therewith are taken from the class of piecewise constant functions. The current values of control actions are determined by the subset of phase space that contains the aggregate of current states of object at the observable points (in these states control actions take constant values). In the paper such synthesized control actions are called zone control actions. A technique to obtain optimal values of zone control actions with the use of smooth optimization methods is given.

The time-varying delays lie in any two adjoining sampling instants of the plant. A technique is proposed for designing stabilizing controllers by converting NCSs with time-varying transmission delays into parameter uncertain systems with constant input delay, then the theory of robust stabilization of delay systems can be applied to solving this problem. Sufficient condition on stabilization of such NCSs is developed in terms of linear matrix inequality.	control system;display lag;input lag;linear matrix inequality;sampling (signal processing);social inequality	Mei Yu;Guangming Xie;Long Wang	2004	2004 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat.

The proposed scheme is distributed in the sense that each local state estimator exploits suitable pieces of information from parent subsystems. Moreover, differently from schemes based on moving horizon estimation, it does not require the on-line solution to optimization problems. Our method also guarantees the satisfaction of constraints on local estimation errors. We achieve our aims exploiting the notion of practical robust positive invariance developed in [1]. As an example, we illustrate the use of the distributed state estimator for reconstructing the states of a power network system.	algorithm;computation;computational resource;distributed control system;local variable;mathematical optimization;online and offline;plug-in (computing);requirement;tor messenger	Stefano Riverso;Daria Rubini;Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate	2013	2013 European Control Conference (ECC)		control engineering;mathematical optimization;invariant;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	64.95013905335522	-0.8408273829416355	73969

The ExpARMAX model has exponential-type coefficients that depend on the load of power plants and are estimated offline. In order to take advantage of existing conventional controllers and to reduce the cost of the industrial identification experiment, we propose a model structure that makes it possible for the ExpARMAX model to be identified using commercial operation data. On the basis of the model, a long-range predictive control strategy, without resorting to parameter estimation online, is investigated. The influence of some intermediate variables treated as process disturbances is studied, and the scheme using a set of multi-step-ahead predictors of the intermediate variables to improve control performance is also presented. A simulation study shows that the ExpARMAX model can give satisfactory modeling accuracy for the NOx decomposition (de-NOx) process in a large operating range, and the control algorithm proposed significantly improves the control performance	algorithm;coefficient;control theory;estimation theory;iterative method;kerrison predictor;mathematical optimization;nitrogen-vacancy center;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;online and offline;simulation;time complexity	Hui Peng;Weihua Gui;Hideo Shioya;R.

If the membership functions are unknown, the linear FD filter designs with fixed gains have been considered in the literature. To reduce the conservatism of the existing results, a switching mechanism that depends on the lower and upper bounds of the unknown membership functions is provided to construct an FD filter with varying gains. It is shown that the switching-type FD filter with varying gains can achieve a better FD performance than the linear FD filter with fixed gains. In addition, based on some time-domain inequalities, a novel weighting matrix design approach is introduced to transform the fault sensitivity specification into an H∞ constraint. Finally, two examples are given to show the advantages of the proposed FD method.	fault detection and isolation;fuzzy control system;membership function (mathematics)	Xiao-Jian Li;Guang-Hong yang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2249519	real-time computing;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;linear system;fuzzy control system	Embedded	65.88913610955665	-1.6086746907827032	74042

86db0e56cc7556fb3e649e380c7533c155baa8db	parametric sensitivity analysis of a multiple model adaptive predictive control for regulation of mean arterial blood pressure		Postsurgical complication of hypertension may occur in cardiac patients. To decrease the chances of complication it is necessary to lower high blood pressure as soon as possible. Continuous infusion of vasodilator drugs, such as sodium nitroprusside (Nipride), would quickly lower the blood pressure in most patients. However, each patient has a different sensitivity to infusion of Nipride. The parameters and the time delays of the blood pressure control system are initially unknown. Moreover, the parameters of the transfer function associated with a particular patient change over time. The objective of the study is to develop a procedure for blood pressure control in the presence of uncertainty of parameters and considerable time delays. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis was performed, changing the parameter that controls the convergence rate of weight factors (V). The simulation results showed significant changes in settling time (Ts), stressing the importance of this parameter on the control model definition. Considering a V = 0.05 was obtained Ts = 195s and, for same patient, Ts = 510s by increasing the value to V = 0.4, with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) varying but always lower than 1%.	control system;mean squared error;rate of convergence;settling time;simulation;transfer function	Humberto A.

Due to the advances in computing power, the problem of state estimation can be efficiently addressed by the particle filtering method. This requires dealing with both the geometry and the stochastics of the problem. However, the very few papers that properly deal with either are in the mathematics literature and not accessible. The engineering literature is also small but plagued with problems. With this in mind, we give a direct accessible derivation of the particle filter algorithm for state estimation in matrix Lie groups.

First the TITO process is decoupled into two higher order decoupled processes through a decoupler matrix. Next, a first order plus dead time (FOPDT) model is determined for each higher order decoupled processes. Then, diagonal PID controller is obtained for given performance specifications using the guaranteed pole placement method. The off-diagonal controller of multivariable controller is obtained by simply multiplying diagonal controller with decoupler elements. This higher order off-diagonal controller is reduced in PI form by using Maclaurin series. The performance of the proposed design method is verified on the original interactive system to show its effectiveness for the general class of the TITO systems.

First, subsystem parameters are identified before the state space partition is reconstructed. For the later step, it is common to label the states of a recorded trajectory and separate differently labeled states with the help of linear support vector machines. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to estimate switching hyperplanes in continuous time piecewise affine systems. The presented approach builds upon three components. First, a hybrid observer reconstructs the switching signal up to a bounded delay. Second, we remove the delay in the reconstructed switching signal by solving an optimization problem. We obtain more precise switching states that lie on a specific switching hyperplane. Third, the switching hyperplanes are fitted to the switching states with Total Least Squares. The paper illustrates the presented approach on a numerical example.	algorithm;approximation;existential quantification;gramian matrix;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem;picasa web albums;state space;support vector machine;switching time;total least squares	Stefan Kersting;Martin Buss	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7172029	control engineering;support vector machine;mathematical optimization;network switch;computer science;trajectory;machine learning;control theory;mathematics	EDA	64.91205005498387	-0.7868451681588369	74758

Based on the neural network approximate ability and backstepping control design technique, adaptive neural network based dynamic surface control technique is developed. The advantage is that it does not require priori knowledge of virtual control gain function sign, which is usually demanded in many designs. At the same time, by dynamic surface control scheme, the explosion of computation is circumvented. The control performance of closed-loop systems is improved by adaptive modifying the estimated error upper bound. By theoretical analysis, the signals of closed-loop systems are globally ultimately bounded and the control error converges to a small residual set around the origin.	artificial neural network;coefficient;nonlinear system	Yingchun Wang;Guotao Hui;Zhiliang Wang;Huaguang Zhang	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21105-8_39	control engineering;variable structure control;sliding mode control;adaptive control;computer science;networked control system;machine learning;automatic control;control theory;feedback;upper and lower bounds;artificial neural network	Robotics	65.27872699841745	-5.6259837868869695	74793
6bb5d359ca23deb0117a849ada2a1e3e1716ea38	optimal fractional order pid controller design for automatic voltage regulator system based on reference model using particle swarm optimization		Automatic voltage regulator (AVR) system is an important equipment in power system for maintaining the terminal voltage of the generator at a specific level. Recently, fractional order PID controller has been designed for AVR system. However, many fractional order PID controller designing methods need to calculate various performance indices in time domain and frequency domain in the process of parameter tuning, which is a tedious and complex process and satisfactory performance can not be obtained. In this paper, a new fractional order PID controller designing method is proposed AVR system based on Bodes reference model. The optimal parameters of FOPID controller is obtained through minimizing the integrated absolute error (IAE) between the output of the Bodes ideal reference model and that of the plant. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is responsible to search the solution of the IAE criterion, i.e., the parameters of FOPID controller. Extensive simulations and comparisons show that the designed FOPID controller has more excellent performance. Meanwhile, PSO algorithm is effective for searching the optimal FOPID controller parameters.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;approximation error;atmel avr;binary prefix;mathematical optimization;pid;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;pixel;rm-odp;reference model;simulation;voltage regulator	Xiao Li;Ying Wang;Ning Li;Minyu Han;Yinggan Tang;Fucai Liu	2017	Int.

The Adaptive generalized predictive control algorithm is detailed and presented. A single input single output (SISO) controlled autoregressive integrated moving average (CARIMA) model is used to predict the future behavior of the system. The online parametric adaptation algorithm (PAA) used in this work is based on recursive least squares (RLS) identification algorithm with fixed forgetting factor. The synthesis parameters (minimal prediction horizon, maximal prediction horizon, control horizon and cost weighting factor) are optimized using genetic algorithms, this technique improves the closed-loop performances. The fitness function to be minimized is a set of closed loop performance metrics (the settling time, the rise time, the overshoot and the variance of the control signal). In order to verify the validity of the proposed strategy, a simulation example of asynchronous motor speed is presented.

Based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control system, the fuzzy control model of the nonlinear supply chain system with lead times is constructed. Additionally, we design a fuzzy robust H∞ control strategy taking the definition of maximal overlapped-rules group into consideration to restrain the impacts such as those caused by lead times, switching actions among submodels, and customers’ stochastic demands. This control strategy can not only guarantee that the nonlinear supply chain system is robustly asymptotically stable but also realize soft switching among subsystems of the nonlinear supply chain to make the less fluctuation of the system variables by introducing themembership function of fuzzy system.The comparisons between the proposed fuzzy robustH∞ control strategy and the robustH∞ control strategy are finally illustrated through numerical simulations on a two-stage nonlinear supply chain with lead times.

A near optimal control policy is designed using an actor-critic framework and ADP with event sampled state vector. First, the system dynamics are approximated by using a novel neural network (NN) identifier with event sampled state vector. The optimal control policy is generated via an actor NN by using the NN identifier and value function approximated by a critic NN through ADP. The stochastic NN identifier, actor, and critic NN weights are tuned at the event sampled instants leading to aperiodic weight tuning laws. Above all, an adaptive event sampling condition based on estimated NN weights is designed by using the Lyapunov technique to ensure ultimate boundedness of all the closed-loop signals along with the approximation accuracy. The net result is event-driven stochastic ADP technique that can significantly reduce the computation and network transmissions. Finally, the analytical design is substantiated with simulation results.	actor model;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;bellman equation;biological neural networks;cardiomyoplasty;computation;control system;dynamic programming;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;event-driven programming;feedback;identifier;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;optimal control;quantum state;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;simulation;system dynamics;telecommunications network;usb on-the-go;weight	Avimanyu Sahoo;Sarangapani Jagannathan	2017	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2016.2519445	mathematical optimization;text mining;optimal control;computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;control theory;packet loss;artificial neural network;statistics	Robotics	65.70392354726995	2.2192575401276033	75780

An LDV system is, in most cases of practical interest, a family of linearized approximations of a nonlinear dynamical system indexed by the point around which the system is linearized. LDV systems emerge quite naturally in a generic trajectory tracking problem in which the tracking error is modeled as an LDV system and the tracking controller is tuned so as to minimize an LQ performance. This paper focuses on tracking a natural trajectory of a nonlinear dynamical system running over a Riemannian manifold. The associated LDV tracking error system runs over the tangent bundle and LQ minimization secures asymptotic tracking of the nonlinear trajectory.

We first show that the best state estimate can be used at any time to enhance the estimate of each framer. Then we show how to build a framer which provides the best estimate at any time. We introduce a bounded estimate within the framer bundle in order to ensure the boundness of the estimate and finally get an interval observer. This enhanced interval observer design is applied to the estimate of state variables in a photobioreactor, and especially to the specific growth rate evaluation. The microalgal model is Droop model, from which the dynamics of the growth and substrate uptake rates are derived. Various framers can be derived from this model, guarantying bounds on the prediction error. These framers are then coupled together and lead to an improved estimate.	algorithmic efficiency;estimation theory;initial condition;interval arithmetic	Francis Mairet;Olivier Bernard	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5400600	control engineering;mathematical optimization;mean squared prediction error;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;coupling;bioreactor;initial value problem;statistics	Robotics	61.125109975583605	-0.27845381469137037	76063
34b7148f5be7e51a85e1dea7b858879e5f7147bb	application of gradient-based control methods in efficient oil well placement through dynamic fuzzy neural network modeling		This study presents an approach for determining optimal locations of oil wells in an oil field such that a predetermined production policy can be achieved. In the first step, Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network (DFNN) is employed to generate an analytical and dynamic model of the reservoir. The model would be updated during the process due to current reservoir information. In order to determine optimal weights for DFNN, Orthogonal Least Square method is modified and applied. It will be shown that the method has more computational efficiency in comparison with other approaches. In the second stage, gradient-based approaches as one of the most common methods in control field are employed to determine well locations based on the generated model. The method can perform search without being obliged to use the simulator several times. Finally, simulation results show the abilities of the proposed procedure in both modeling and tracking control.		A.

The paper contains two parts. First, a group of one dimensional (1D) partial differential equations (PDEs), which are derived from the normal three dimensional (3D) PDE heat conduction equation, are proposed to describe the thermal behavior of the multi-core processers. Then, an optimal output feedback regulator is designed to manage the power consumption and balance the temperature among the cores. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is verified via an illustrative example.	central processing unit;multi-core processor	Jianfei Wang;Steven Liu	2013	J.

Semiconductor manufacturing is one of the applications of particular interest in this context with the demanding feature sizes (on the order of a few tens of nanometers) to be produced on a wafer while still requiring high throughput (greater than 100 wafers per hour). In this brief, we propose a multiscale control design method based on a reduced-order model-following scheme for the dynamic systems with such conflicting time-domain performance requirements. This method uses a dynamic reference model to make the plant output track the model output as closely as possible without increasing the overall order of the control system. Optimal proportional-integral (PI) control is used, which is essentially a modification of the conventional optimal control. A detailed analytical proof is given to show that this control scheme effectively overcomes the limitations of the conventional optimal control techniques and provides consistent performances at nano- as well as macroscale positioning with fast rise and settling times. Benefits and limitations of the proposed control scheme are described and stability and performance analyses are discussed. A six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) extended-range magnetically levitated (maglev) nanopositioning stage, which is open-loop unstable, is used as a test bed to demonstrate the developed control strategy. Step responses under a variety of conditions are obtained to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. This method exhibits significantly better and robust performances in terms of transient as well as steady-state behavior compared with conventional optimal-control schemes. Furthermore, it can be applied to a general class of higher-order linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with or without open-loop instability.	bode plot;control system;control theory;decibel;dynamical system;feedback;instability;language technologies institute;linear system;linear time-invariant theory;optimal control;overshoot (signal);performance;phase margin;reference model;requirement;semiconductor;steady state;testbed;throughput;time complexity;time-invariant system;wafer (electronics)	Huzefa Shakir;Won-jong Kim	2007	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2007.902957	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control system;dynamical system;control theory;mathematics	Visualization	68.04038345845919	-8.231585863328537	76338

Feedback linearization has reduced the computational burden, but has not yet been solved for robust model predictive control under estimation errors and constraints. In this paper, we solve this problem of robust control of a non-linear system under bounded state estimation errors and input and state constraints using feedback linearization. We do so by developing robust constraints on the feedback linearized system such that the non-linear system respects its constraints. These constraints are computed at run-time using online reachability, and are linear in the optimization variables, resulting in a Quadratic Program with linear constraints. We also provide robust feasibility, recursive feasibility and stability results for our control algorithm. We evaluate our approach on two systems to show its applicability and performance.	algorithm;computer performance;constraint (mathematics);linear system;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;quadratic programming;reachability;recursion;robust control	Yash Pant;Houssam Abbas;Rahul Mangharam	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7799144	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear control;nonlinear system;engineering;control theory;mathematics;feedback linearization;model predictive control	Robotics	63.19798575108253	-1.846612741254913	76356

The main issues of networked systems are addressed here, which are the system delay and loss of information. In fact, the proposed method overcomes the delays by filtering the errors and also compensates the loss of system information. The adaptive fuzzy control design is combined in this work with H infinity control approach to approximate the system's unknown nonlinear functions. The stability analysis of the approach is also surveyed. The results revealed that the closed loop system stability is proved in existence of system disturbances, system delays and information loss. The proposed approach is applied on an inverted pendulum system to evaluate the method's efficiency and effectiveness.	approximation algorithm;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;inverted pendulum;nonlinear system;system information (windows)	Li Jun Heng;Wang Yong Weiwei	2018	CoRR		control theory;mathematics;filter (signal processing);inverted pendulum;fuzzy logic;h-infinity methods in control theory;nonlinear system;fuzzy control system	Robotics	65.76100253365726	-5.123577287014245	76363

c1d6d243c01a56476487600da7c8aa614a85e70b	improved approaches on adaptive event-triggered output feedback control of networked control systems		Abstract This paper studies the static output-feedback control in a class of networked control systems. Different from the existing results, the transmission of control signals is based on a novel adaptive event-triggered scheme, where the adaptive thresholds depend on the dynamic error of the system rather than predetermined constants as the traditional ones. The amount of the releasing data is regulated by the adaptive thresholds that play an essential role in decision of whether releasing the sampled data or not. Through fully using the information on network-induced delay and introducing two adjusting parameters, an augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii (L–K) functional is constructed. Especially, some novel Wirtinger-based integral inequalities are utilized to reconsider those previously ignored information, which can help reduce the conservatism. Furthermore, a novel constructive method is developed to obtain the controller gain by solving the achieved linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, three numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the presented results.	block cipher mode of operation;control system;feedback	Tao Li;Zhipeng Li;Xiang Lin;Shumin Fei	2018	J.

One major contribution is that it has advanced Morse's dwell-time-switching from linear systems to a class of nonlinear systems. Another significant contribution is that it combines the idea of monitoring the adequacy of candidate models (in terms of their estimation performances) in most MMAC schemes with the idea of monitoring the performance of candidate controllers in unfalsified control. Moreover, sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability are established for the proposed dwell-time-switching based MMAC scheme when applied to the considered class of nonlinear systems. To fulfil those sufficient conditions, emphasis has been put on the design of multiple estimators, candidate controllers and monitoring signals. The carefully designed estimators, candidate controllers, and monitoring signals enable us to derive a finite time switching result and provide a characterization on the maximum number of switchings for the dwell-time-switching algorithm proposed. In order to show how the general design of our dwell-time-switching based MMAC scheme can be applied to a particular nonlinear system, a constructive design based on back-stepping is provided for the adaptive control problem for a special class of nonlinearly parameterized systems, which can satisfy all the sufficient conditions to ensure closed-loop stability.	algorithm;linear system;nonlinear system;performance;stepping level;tundra orbit	Weitian Chen;Brian D.

39f5da9cd2fcf10bba36ff44d4faaba1c522ca9c	towards a systematic path for dynamic simulation to plant operation: opc ua-enabled model adaptation method for tracking simulation		A tracking simulator is an online simulation system that utilizes dynamic parameter estimation for calibrating model parameters to achieve state synchronization with the process. It can be utilized as a plant-wide virtual sensors or as a predictive tool to provide production forecasts based on the current state of the plant. The appearance of industrial applications based on tracking simulators has been hindered by high development cost and time-consuming sustainability of simulation models. In order to overcome this, dynamic simulation models developed during the process design and engineering stages could be used for implementing industrial tracking simulators. However, before these models can be utilized online, they require going through a model adaptation procedure where their structure and parameters are updated. This paper presents a model adaptation method for the implementation of tracking simulators which utilizes OPC Unified Architecture to adapt simulation models developed during the engineering phases of the process plant and apply them at the operation and maintenance stages. In this work, the method is described, implemented and tested using a representative process.	acclimatization;dynamic simulation;estimation theory;opc unified architecture;open platform communications;population parameter;projections and predictions;sensor;user agent;web-based simulation	Gerardo Santill&#x00E1;n Mart&#x00ED;nez;Tommi Karhela;Reino Ruusu;Tuomas Lackman;Valeriy Vyatkin	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216952	process design;control engineering;simulation modeling;opc unified architecture;maintenance engineering;data modeling;engineering;synchronization;dynamic simulation;server	Robotics	53.78104394742351	-9.100121944477657	76432

Firstly, by designing a high-gain observer to estimate the states of the system and cope with the uncertainties of the system, only the output of the control system is required to be measurable. Secondly, the nonlinear function in the systems can totally unknown due to the utilization of the neural networks approximator. Finally, the arbitrarily small (mathcal {L}_{infty }) norm of the tracking error is achieve by adjusting the initial conditions of the unknown parameters.	hysteresis	Xiuyu Zhang;Dan Liu;Zhi Li;Chun-Yi Su	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-43506-0_56	control engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.75091747900849	-5.4312743585494605	76559

In general, the conventional sliding mode control design is assumed that the upper boundary of parameter variations and external disturbances is known and the sign function is used. Therefore, it causes high frequency chattering and high gain phenomenon. In this paper, we proposed a fuzzy sliding mode control of the SynRM speed drive system to avoid the above drawbacks. This method utilizes Lyapunov function to guarantee the convergence and track the speed command of the SynRM drive system asymptotically. The estimator of parameter variations and external disturbances is designed to estimate the unknown uncertainty values in real time, which is different from conventional fuzzy sliding mode control to estimate the unknown uncertainty upper boundary. Finally, we employ the experiments to validate the proposed method.	experiment;lyapunov fractal;rejection sampling;synchronous circuit	Chien-An Chen;Huann-Keng Chiang;Chih-Huang Tseng	2008	2008 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications	10.1109/ISDA.2008.33	estimator;uncertainty;stability;sliding mode control;lyapunov function;control system;high frequency;mathematical model;control theory;electronic speed control;torque;steady state;fuzzy control system;statistics	Robotics	66.50463737782769	-9.649151721606394	76648

Furthermore, the selection of an output prediction model is strongly related to the data available, while designing/altering the data collection process may not be an option. Thus, in several scenarios, selecting the most appropriate prediction model needs to be performed during runtime. To this end, this paper introduces a supervisory output prediction scheme, tailored specifically for input-output stable bilinear systems, that intends on automating the process of selecting the most appropriate prediction model during runtime. The selection process is based upon a reinforcement-learning scheme, where prediction models are selected according to their prior prediction performance. An additional selection process is concerned with appropriately partitioning the control-inputs’ domain in order to also allow for switched-system approximations of the original bilinear dynamics. We show analytically that the proposed scheme converges (in probability) to the best model and partition. We finally demonstrate these properties through simulations of temperature prediction in residential buildings.	approximation;bilinear filtering;bilinear transform;emoticon;model selection;norm (social);reinforcement learning;simulation	Georgios C.

1e3f75fdcd7e78ee714542addd633859a11bf93a	necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilization of expanding systems servomechanism problems		The problem of designing realistic decentralized controller to solve a servomechanism problem in the framework of large scale systems is considered in this paper. As any large scale system is built by expanding construction of one subsystem being connected to the existing system. In particular, it is desired to find a local stabilizing controller in terms of a free parameter (belonging to the ring of proper stable transfer functions) so that desirable properties of the controlled system, such as tracking and/or disturbance rejection for any arbitrary deterministic signal along with stabilization of the expanded overall system occur. An algorithm for designing such a free controller parameter is presented. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to the Expanding Systems with Tracking and/or Disturbance Rejection Problem are established here and characterized the corresponding full set of stabilizing controllers that solve the problem. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the design procedure of the proposed controller for the Expanded System.		Dibyendu Baksi;Kanti B.

6bcd709d118de1bf458e173e8c2f214ff82dc410	cooperative adaptive cruise control for a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles considering dynamic information flow topology		Vehicle-to-vehicle communications can be unreliable as interference causes communication failures. Thereby, the information flow topology for a platoon of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can vary dynamically. This limits existing Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) strategies as most of them assume a fixed information flow topology (IFT). To address this problem, we introduce a CACC design that considers a dynamic information flow topology (CACC-DIFT) for CAV platoons. An adaptive Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller under a two-predecessor-following IFT is proposed to reduce the negative effects when communication failures occur. The PD controller parameters are determined to ensure the string stability of the platoon. Further, the designed controller also factors the performance of individual vehicles. Hence, when communication failure occurs, the system will switch to a certain type of CACC instead of degenerating to adaptive cruise control, which improves the control performance considerably.

Based on this directly or indirectly obtained noisy timing information, each slave clock tries to follow as closely as possible the master time. This paper formulates the PTP based clock synchronization as an estimation-control problem. An LQG controller is designed which produces an optimal reconstruction of the master time at each slave in the sense of minimizing the mean square error of the estimator and minimizing an LQR cost function for the controller. The performance of the proposed optimal controller is verified by simulation results.	algorithm;clock synchronization;closed-loop transfer function;kalman filter;loss function;mean squared error;optimal control;precision time protocol;simulation;slave clock	Chongning Na;Philipp Wolfrum;Dragan Obradovic;Ruxandra Lupas Scheiterer	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2010.5611234	control engineering;clock synchronization;real-time computing;computer science;control theory	Embedded	56.00532003591029	2.2772895535367037	77689

We show that the proposed controller can achieve zero tracking error for a class of periodic references and disturbances, including scenarios specifically relevant to piezo-actuated nanopositioning systems. In particular, for the case of a sinusoidal reference input, we establish the exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of harmonic disturbances, under certain conditions on the amplitudes of the reference and disturbances. We also prove exponential stability in the case of sinusoidal reference and disturbance with two distinct frequencies. Additionally, we show that the proposed method, in conjunction with approximate hysteresis inversion, can attenuate the effect of hysteresis nonlinearity preceding linear dynamics and ensure the boundedness of the closed-loop system. Experiments conducted on a commercially available nanopositioner confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method as compared to Iterative Learning Control, a competitive technique in nanopositioning for tracking periodic references.	approximation algorithm;experiment;hysteresis;iterative method;nonlinear system;piezoelectricity;spectral density estimation;time complexity	Alex Esbrook;Xiaobo Tan;Hassan K.

Conventional centralized control schemes are not suitable for such large-scale systems due to global dynamic behavior complexity and computational difficulties. This paper introduces a general framework of agent based federated control motivated by the political structure where partially self-governing states are united by a federal government. Likewise, a multi-agent based federated control system is composed of local autonomous subsystems that cooperate to provide an overall system behavior. Formation stability and trajectory tracking control of a group of autonomous agents is designed based on this concept. Decentralized cooperative federated controllers are developed for each individual agent. Simulations show that the overall system is globally asymptotically stable to track a time-varying trajectory with a pre-designated formation for a group of nonlinear dynamic agents.	agent-based model;autonomous robot;centralized computing;computation;computer simulation;control system;file spanning;interconnection;interdependence;laplacian matrix;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;spanning tree;vii	Frank T.

fdbc67514216c3eefe2d899fde1699eb8c9e8a9c	fuzzy control as a general interpolation problem	fuzzy control;input output	The general mathematical problem of fuzzy control is an interpolation problem: a list of fuzzy input-output data, usually provided by a list of linguistic control rules, should be realized as argument-value pairs for a suitably chosen fuzzy function. However, contrary to the usual understanding of interpolation, in the actual approaches this interpolation problem is considered as a global one: one uniformly and globally defined function should realize all the fuzzy input-output data. In standard classes of functions thus this interpolation problem often becomes unsolvable. Hence it becomes intertwined with an approximation problem which allows that the given fuzzy input-output data are realized only approximately by argument-value pairs. In this context the paper discusses some quite general sufficient conditions for the true solution of the interpolation problem, as well as similar conditions for suitably modified data, i.e. for a quite controlled approximation.	approximation;fuzzy control system;polynomial interpolation	Siegfried Gottwald	2004		10.1007/3-540-31182-3_17	control engineering;mathematical optimization;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy mathematics;fuzzy classification;fuzzy number;control theory;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system	Theory	66.08123856260532	-4.003302658809948	78140

It base on the theory which a nonlinear multivariable systems to be controlled is divided a linear part and a nonlinear part. The controller parameters of the linear part are obtained by the recursive least square algorithm at the parameter estimation stage, whereas the nonlinear part is achieved the through the Back-propagation neural network. This controller is performed on-line. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the computer simulation results are presented to adapt a nonlinear multivariable system with nonminimum phase, noises and time delays and with changed system parameter after a constant time. The proposed method is effective compared with the conventional direct multivariable adaptive controller using neural network.	algorithm;artificial neural network;backpropagation;computer simulation;estimation theory;interaction;minimum phase;neural network software;nonlinear system;online and offline;recursion;recursive least squares filter;software propagation;time complexity	W.

A distributed design of ℋ2 suboptimal distributed control problem is provided using distributed linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). ℋ2 suboptimal distributed controllers can be found if there exists a feasible solution to these LMIs. These distributed LMIs consist of local and shared variables, and these shared variables are common only with their neighbors. The main contribution of this paper is that while the provided ℋ2 suboptimal control problem can be solved in a distributed way using distributed LMIs, after solving these LMIs, each node can construct its own full-order sub-controller unit, which is implementable over the given network.	bayesian network;causal system;distributed control system;h2 database engine;interaction;linear matrix inequality;shared variables	Gulnihal Kucuksayacigil;Nicola Elia	2017	2017 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2017.7963679		Robotics	64.33249565634559	3.56880823195001	78337

Here, it is considered that the network of the system is described by an undirected graph subject to fixed topology and the aforementioned controller is impacted by time-varying actuator faults. Then, the desired consensus protocols are proposed in such a way that the effects of possible uncertainties and actuator faults are compensated efficiently within a prescribed finite-time period. More precisely, the leaderless consensus analysis is carried out in the framework of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the required conditions for the existence of proposed fault-tolerant controller are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, the proposed consensus design parameters can be computed by solving a set of linear matrix inequality constraints. Finally, two examples including a formation flying satellites model are provided to show the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed control scheme.	multi-agent system	Rathinasamy Sakthivel;Ramalingam Sakthivel;Boomipalagan Kaviarasan;Hosoo Lee;Yongdo Lim	2019	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2018.10.020	control theory;machine learning;linear fractional transformation;actuator;observer (quantum physics);multi-agent system;artificial intelligence;mathematics;control theory;matrix (mathematics);linear matrix inequality;consensus	Robotics	64.94054330120132	3.6808664330727674	78391

Under the assumption that the system has order preserving dynamics, we provide an algorithmic procedure for computing the control map, which has linear complexity in the number of continuous variables. The structure of the control map with imperfect state information is the same as the one with perfect state information, implying separation between state estimation and control. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on a class of applications characterized by order preserving dynamics.	algorithm;computation;hybrid system	Michael R.

By introducing an event-triggered mechanism, the event-triggered state instead of the state itself is quantized. And the generated finite event-triggered quantized state signal is sent through a digital network to the decoder and used for constructing a sliding mode controller to stabilize the uncertain linear systems. The relation among the lower bound of the quantized measurement saturating parameter, the upper bound of the event-triggered threshold parameter and the robust stabilization condition of linear uncertain systems, is first presented. Then, under the relation and by the combination of the proposed event-triggered mechanism for the system state and the discrete on-line adjustment policy for the quantizer sensitivity, the established quantized and event-triggered SMC laws are shown to ensure the reachability of the desired switching surface and global robust stabilization of uncertain linear systems is achieved. The theoretical result is verified via simulation illustration finally.

The design scheme is based on three steps. First, the system is extended taking the unknown inputs (and possibly some of their derivatives) as new states. Then, using a high-order sliding mode differentiator (HOSMD), a new output of the system is generated in order to fulfill the Hautus condition. Finally, the system is decomposed into two subsystem, the first one being unaffected directly by the unknown inputs, and the second subsystem being obtained directly from the system output. Thus, a Luenberger observer is designed for the first subsystem. This procedure allows one to estimate the state and the unknown inputs using the least number of differentiations possible. Some simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed observer.	differentiator;linear system;simulation	Francisco Javier Bejarano;Leonid M.

The existence of naive nodes and the communication constraint in sensor networks requires a hybrid consensus filtering method. In the frame of consensus filtering, a novel consensus nonlinear filtering approach named variational Bayesian consensus cubature Kalman filter (VB-CCKF) is proposed, in which the CKF is employed to handle the nonlinear state estimation and the VB approximation is adopted to iteratively estimate the sufficient statistics of the measurement noise covariance on each step. Simulations are performed in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	approximation;collaborative filtering;computer simulation;kalman filter;nonlinear system;numerical integration;sensor;variational principle	Kai Shen;Zhongliang Jing;Peng Dong	2017	IEEE Signal Processing Letters	10.1109/LSP.2017.2751611	mathematics;mathematical optimization;measurement uncertainty;filter (signal processing);wireless sensor network;kalman filter;nonlinear system;noise measurement;nonlinear filter;covariance;control theory	Robotics	53.90225393013414	3.752259045311264	79204

In the first part, a general scheme is presented for calculating stabilizing design parameters based on the Jacobi linearization of the system. It is proven that for each system with stabilizable linearization there exist a quadratic terminal cost functional and a finite terminal region which guarantee asymptotic stability of the closed-loop. This allows the calculation of suitable design parameters for MPC based on any method available for the control of linear time-delay systems. In contrast to the delay-free case, the terminal region obtained is not characterized as sublevel set of the terminal cost functional. In the second part, a new type of terminal region is presented. Based on additional Lyapunov-Razumikhin conditions on the linear local controller it is shown that the terminal region can indeed be formulated as sublevel set of a particular terminal cost functional.	existential quantification;jacobi method;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimal control;time complexity	Marcus Reble;Frank Allgöwer	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5718067	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory;mathematics;model predictive control	Robotics	66.35907312358394	-1.2122148445877425	79423

To deal with unmeasurable states, a novel state observer that contains the quantized control is introduced. By presenting a new nonlinear decomposition for the hysteretic quantized input, the major technique difficulty coming from the discrete quantized input is overcome. By utilizing the backstepping technique and employing the stochastic small-gain theorem, a direct adaptive fuzzy output feedback control scheme is developed. The proposed design approach can guarantee that the closed-loop system is input-to-state practically stable in probability. Finally, a simulation example verifies the proposed control scheme.	block cipher mode of operation;feedback;hysteresis;nonlinear system;quantization (signal processing);simulation	Fang Wang;Zhi Liu;Yun Zhang;C.

The first method presents a procedure to estimate the natural frequencies, modal damping ratios, and modal shapes of shear buildings from their forced vibration responses. To estimate the coefficient matrices of a state-space model, an auto-regressive exogenous excitation (ARX) model cooperating with a neural network concept is employed. The modal parameters of the structure are then evaluated from the eigenparameters of the coefficient matrix of the model. Finally, modal parameters are used to identify the physical/structural (i.e., mass, damping, and stiffness) matrices of the structure. In the second method, a direct strategy of physical/structural identification is developed from the dynamic responses of the structure without any eigenvalue analysis or optimization processes that are usually necessary in inverse problems. This method modifies the governing equations of motion based on relative responses of consecutive stories such that the new set of equations can be implemented in a cluster of artificial neural networks. The number of neural networks is equal to the number of degree-of-freedom of the structure. It is shown the noise effects may partially be eliminated by using high-order finite impulse response (FIR) filters in both methods. Finally, the feasibility and accuracy of the presented model updating methods are examined through numerical studies on multistory shear buildings using the simulated records with various noise levels. The excellent agreement of the obtained results with those of the finite element models shows the feasibility of the proposed methods. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

VHMS provides real time feedbacks, information on life cycle reduction and saves operation cost and time.

This paper investigates the self-triggered MPC problem for discrete-time linear systems under network environments to reduce communication load. We first propose a novel cost function which explicitly takes the communication cost into consideration. Based on the new cost function, an adaptive self-triggered MPC strategy is designed in the sense that the self-triggered time intervals can be adaptively adjusted via optimization. We further develop a simplified approach to solving the optimal control sequences and the optimal self-triggered time intervals. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed and we show that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable if some mild controllability conditions are satisfied. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed algorithm is verified via simulation studies.	algorithm;control system;linear system;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimal control;simulation	Huiping Li;Weisheng Yan;Yang Shi	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8264589	control theory;controllability;mathematical optimization;adaptive system;discrete time and continuous time;computer science;linear system;model predictive control;optimal control;stability theory;control system	Embedded	63.53063054502536	-0.9122500262318104	79804
b0201e49403ff56e58038a789b229048a28cadd6	disturbance-observer-based control design for a class of uncertain systems with intermittent measurement		Abstract The robust control problem of a class of uncertain systems subject to intermittent measurement as well as external disturbances is considered. The disturbances are supposed to be generated by an exogenous system, while the state information is assumed to be available only on some nonoverlapping time intervals. A composite design consisting of an intermittent state feedback controller augmented by a disturbance compensation term derived from a disturbance observer is formulated. Unlike the conventional disturbance observers, the proposed disturbance observer is modelled by a switched impulsive system, which makes use of the intermittent state data to estimate the disturbances. Stability analysis of the resulting closed-loop system is performed by applying a piecewise time-dependent Lyapunov function. Then a sufficient condition for the existence of the proposed composite controllers is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The controller and observer gains can be achieved by solving a set of LMIs. Further, a procedure to limit the norms of the controller and observer gains is given. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the results.	control engineering	Wu-Hua Chen;Kui Ding;Xiaomei Lu	2017	J.

It is shown that, under conditions which can be fulfilled by most industrial plants, the closed-loop system is robustly stable in the presence of plant uncertainties and input-output constraints. There is no requirement that the plant should be open-loop stable and the analysis is valid for general forms of non-linear system representation including the case out when the problem is constraint-free. The effectiveness of controllers designed according to the algorithm analyzed in this paper is demonstrated on a recognized benchmark problem and on a simulation of a continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR). In both examples a radial basis function neural network is employed as the non-linear system model.	linear system;nonlinear system	Chandrasekhar Kambhampati;J. D.

Three issues should be taken into consideration, i.e., sensing rate control, flow control and transmission, incentives for vehicles to participate. It is highly challenging to achieve the optimal social welfare, given the arbitrary unknown contact events and the dynamic network formed by mobile vehicles. To tackle the challenges, we propose a fully distributed optimal control algorithm DBC to maximize the social welfare while keeping good network stability. Exploiting the stochastic Lyapunov optimization technique, it derives an optimal control strategy for sensing rate control and flow control. Rigorous theoretical analysis shows the gap between the DBC and the optimum is only O(1/V), where V is a tradeoff parameter between social welfare and network stability. In addition, we have conducted extensive simulations based on real taxi GPS traces, and the results show the efficacy of DBC.	algorithm;control flow;control theory;entropy maximization;flow control (data);global positioning system;lyapunov fractal;lyapunov optimization;mathematical optimization;optimal control;participatory monitoring;participatory sensing;relay;simulation;tracing (software)	Qingwen Zhao;Yanmin Zhu	2014	2014 IEEE 22nd International Symposium of Quality of Service (IWQoS)	10.1109/IWQoS.2014.6914337	computer security;computer network	Mobile	61.476738727291696	3.219386853206034	80350

For each performance index, sufficient conditions are presented based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to design the fault detection observer. In order to reduce the conservativeness of the multi-objective problem, extended LMIs are used to eliminate the couplings of Lyapunov matrices with the system state space matrices. It is shown that through an event-triggered data transmission mechanism, the amount of data that is sent to the fault detection module is decreased dramatically. Simulation results corresponding to a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) demonstrate and illustrate the effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed design methodology.	fault detection and isolation;linear matrix inequality;linear system;lyapunov fractal;simulation;state space	S.

The basic premise of this work is that a set of mobile sensors achieve better estimation performance than a set of immobile sensors. To enhance the performance of the state estimator, a network of sensors that are capable of moving within the spatial domain is utilized. Specifically, such an estimation process is achieved by using a set of spatially distributed mobile sensors. The objective is to provide mobile sensor control policies that aim to improve the state estimate. The metric for such an estimate improvement is taken to be the expected state estimation error. Using different spatial norms, two guidance policies are proposed. The current approach capitalizes on the efficient filter gain design in order to avoid intense computational requirements resulting from the solution to filter Riccati equations. Simulation studies implementing and comparing the two proposed control policies are provided.	authorization;ccir system a;collision detection;converge;decision theory;error detection and correction;intrusion detection system;kalman filter;lyapunov fractal;mobile phone;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;process state;real-time clock;requirement;sensor;simulation;sysop;velocity (software development)	Michael A.

The fuzzy logic controller (FLC) based on the double-fuzzifications methods is implemented. The FLC is different from the conventional design method. No complex algorithm is required to implement the controller. The actual performance of the novel double-fuzzification FLCs were evaluated against the performance of a traditional temperature FLCs at controlling the water tank temperature. The experiment results show that the novel double-fuzzification controllers can not only improve the control performance, but also can be carried out simply and easily. The effective methods proposed are easily implementable on commonly used equipment and almost no more resources are needed compared with general fuzzy control method.	algorithm;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set	Tianli Li;Gang Xu;Licun Fang;Kemin Zhu	2011	Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronic & Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology	10.1109/EMEIT.2011.6023385	control engineering;fuzzy electronics;real-time computing;controller;defuzzification;design methods;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;engineering;control system;automatic control;process control;control theory;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system	Robotics	60.29828491341388	-8.586635662121857	81345

The analytical model of the 3D FLC is derived to disclose its working principle and guide the control design. The derived model show that the 3D FLC has a global sliding mode structure over the spatial domain, which explains why the 3D FLC is able to process spatial information more effectively with a few more sensors. Based on its sliding mode feature, the 3D fuzzy logic control system can be analyzed and designed in the sense of Lyapunov stability. Finally, a catalytic reactor is presented as an example to validate the effectiveness of 3D FLC.	fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;ibm notes;logic control;lyapunov fractal;reactor (software);sensor	Han-Xiong Li;Xianxia Zhang;Shaoyuan Li	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811340	discrete mathematics;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;process control;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy set	Robotics	63.37963683549609	-6.459396673132819	81437

We assume that the state and measurement are corrupted by stochastic uncertain exogenous disturbance and that the system dynamic is modeled by Itoˆ-type stochastic differential equations. For general nonlinear stochastic systems, the H∞ filter can be obtained by solving second-order nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities. When the worst-case disturbance is considered in the design procedure, a mixed H2/H∞ filtering problem is also solved by minimizing the total estimation error energy. It is found that for a class of special nonlinear stochastic systems, the H∞ filtering design can be given via solving several linear matrix inequalities instead of Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities. A few examples show that the proposed methods are effective.	nonlinear system;stochastic process	Weihai Zhang;Bor-Sen Chen;Chung-Shi Tseng	2005	IEEE Trans.

9b1b796413a3708ddc9b15e5cbc52abecd6c69ea	noise-based control of social dynamics		Designing practical control strategies for opinion dynamics of social size has never been an easy job. It requires the control law cannot 1) be implemented on all individuals of the society; 2) rely on the specific opinion values of the social system. Thanks to the emerging studies on noise-induced consensus of opinion dynamics, the noise-based intervention strategy seems meet the above two requirements and displays its potential in social control, yet its general theory still lacks. In this paper, we establish a theoretical analysis on the noise-based control strategy where only part of agents are affected by randomly generated noises. That is, no matter how many agents (even only one) receive noise, the system will a.s. achieve quasi-consensus in finite time, and the critical noise strength is obtained. The result provides solid ground for implementing social control using noise.	control theory;optimal control;procedural generation;requirement;social dynamics;social system	Wei Su;Ge Chen	2018	CoRR		artificial intelligence;machine learning;social system;mathematics;social control;social dynamics	ML	62.91995060868218	3.9159585618593553	81968

The system is modeled in discrete time and may be affected by a class of stochastic uncertainties that can take finitely many values. Admissible inputs are constrained to belong to a finite set. Exploiting some optimistic planning algorithms from the artificial intelligence field, we propose two control strategies that take into account the communication constraints induced by the use of the network. Both strategies send in a single packet long-horizon solutions, such as sequences of inputs. Our analysis characterizes the relationship between computation, near-optimality, and transmission intervals. In particular, the first strategy imposes at each transmission a desired near-optimality, which we show is related to an imposed transmission period; for this setting, we analyze the required computation. The second strategy has a fixed computation budget, and within this constraint it adapts the next transmission instant to the last state measurement, leading to a self-triggered policy. For this case, we guarantee long transmission intervals. Examples and simulation experiments are provided throughout the paper.	algorithm;artificial intelligence;automated planning and scheduling;computation;control system;controller (control theory);experiment;network computing system;network packet;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimal control;random graph;simulation;stochastic process	Lucian Busoniu;Romain Postoyan;Jamal Daafouz	2016	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2015.2484358	planning;control engineering;stochastic process;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;uncertainty;optimal control;nonlinear system;computer science;networked control system;control theory;mathematics;computational model;statistics	Embedded	62.8879000787498	2.260410037453838	82312

Two different linearization methods for the non-linear system are compared in this study. One is the recursive approximating sequence approach (RASA) to design a time-varying linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for the non-linear system and the other is to design a LQR by linearizing the non-linear system at each locally ‘frozen’ state in any sufficient small sphere along the trajectory. Numerical simulation shows that the later approach gives good design results quickly by scanning the time axis only one time. The RASA method may scan the time axis several times to get a good approach. Moreover, both linearization methods give satisfying control results in attitude maneuver and vibration suppression control for the non-linear flexible spacecraft.	apache axis;linear system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;recursion;simulation;zero suppression	Jianhua Zheng	2006	IMA J.

A dynamic triggering scheme depending on system outputs is implemented to reduce the amount of communication transmissions, which is different from existing constant triggering thresholds. The parameters of actuator faults are estimated via observer state. To compensate for the fault effects on systems, the reliable controller parameters are adjusted along with the obtained estimations. By using some technical lemmas, new sufficient conditions for the closed-loop system to be asymptotically stable with prescribed H ∞ performance are formed in linear matrix inequalities. Lastly, simulations are implemented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.		Shen Yan;Mouquan Shen;Guangming Zhang;Sing Kiong Nguang	2019	J.

The greatest advantage of this method is that the controller could be easily obtained from plant parameters with good performance of closed-loop system.

523c2a2359c7562752addc20e1aef202b1afbccb	adaptive neural network control for nonlinear hydraulic servo-system with time-varying state constraints		An adaptive neural network control problem is addressed for a class of nonlinear hydraulic servo-systems with time-varying state constraints. In view of the low precision problem of the traditional hydraulic servo-system which is caused by the tracking errors surpassing appropriate bound, the previous works have shown that the constraint for the system is a good way to solve the low precision problem.Meanwhile, comparedwith constant constraints, the time-varying state constraints aremore general in the actual systems.Therefore, when the states of the system are forced to obey bounded time-varying constraint conditions, the high precision tracking performance of the system can be easily realized. In order to achieve this goal, the time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (TVBLF) is used to prevent the states from violating time-varying constraints. By the backstepping design, the adaptive controller will be obtained. A radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used to estimate the uncertainties. Based on analyzing the stability of the hydraulic servo-system, we show that the error signals are bounded in the compacts sets; the time-varying state constrains are never violated and all singles of the hydraulic servo-system are bounded. The simulation and experimental results show that the tracking accuracy of system is improved and the controller has fast tracking ability and strong robustness.

The upper bounds of the uncertainties are not needed in the procedure of the controller design, and the controller is continuous, which guarantees that the tracking error can converge to a small residual set. Furthermore, explicit formulas are given that allow for calculating the size of the residual set, and the bounds of the tracking errors at steady state can be specified a priori and guaranteed by choosing certain design parameters. Finally, a simulation study based on a two-link rigid robotic manipulator model is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.	mimo;nonlinear system;steady state	Peng Li;Jianjun Ma;Zhiqiang Zheng	2016	J.

Three kinds of communications constraints are considered during the process of information transmission among the sensors: (i) the estimation of sensors needs to be sampled before transmitting; (ii) at each sampling instant, the packet dropouts would happen to the sampled data of sensors; (iii) the noise and disturbance exist. It should be noted that the constraints of sampled information and data packet dropouts would lead that less information can be employed for each sensor, which makes the filtering problem in sensor networks more challenging and practical. Some criteria concerning the connection gains are derived and used to design efficient distributed H∞ filter to achieve the following objectives: (i) the filtering error system is exponentially mean-square stable in the absence of disturbance and noise; (ii) the prescribed H∞ performance constraint is satisfied.

1443628d123df3d1059925f36d78de2f62bfd041	particle filter approach to lifetime prediction for microelectronic devices and systems with multiple failure mechanisms		Lifetime prediction for microelectronic devices and systems is complicated by many factors including the validity of linear acceleration, choice of extrapolation model, presence of multiple failure mechanisms with common driving forces, correlation between failure mechanisms, time-variant loading (voltage pulses) etc… With real-time prognostics and health management coming up as a useful alternative to conventional post-failure reliability data analysis, significant progress has been made in estimating the individual lifetime of microelectronic devices/systems during operation (real-time). In this study, we present a case study of decoding the contributions of the bias temperature instability (BTI) and hot carrier injection (HCI) mechanisms to the overall time-dependent threshold voltage (VTH) shift observed in real-time during a conventional HCI stress test applied to a single NMOS device. Assuming no prior knowledge of the time exponents for VTH degradation for both the BTI and HCI mechanisms, our methodology enables us to deconvolute the overall VTH data signal, predict the remaining useful life (RUL) for the device (given a threshold failure criterion) and extract the distribution of the power-law exponents for the pure-HCI and pure-BTI mechanisms. We used the particle filter based sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) technique here for the prognostic study and the advantage of our approach is its generic use for non-linear systems and non-Gaussian noise trends. The impact of prognostics based data-driven algorithms in dynamic lifecycle estimation of microelectronic devices is evident in this work and such an approach can be handy in high-power space electronics applications when the reliability (health/robustness) of a single device (integrated in the satellite) needs to be studied (under normal operating conditions) and there is no large sample size population of similar devices available for a conventional accelerated stress test exercise off-field. To our knowledge, this is the first study applying the particle filter technique for a multiple failure mechanism scenario. The accuracy of our RUL estimates was compared with real data extracted from past experimental studies.	failure cause;particle filter	Nagarajan Raghavan;Daniel D.

Our approach is to mathematically model degradation-based signals from a population of components using stochastic models that combine three main sources of information: real-time degradation characteristics of component obtained by observing the component's in-situ degradation signal, the degradation characteristics of the component's population, and the real-time status of the environmental conditions under which the component is operating. Prior degradation information is used to estimate the model coefficients. The resulting generalized stochastic degradation model is then used to predict an initial residual life distribution for the component being monitored. In-situ degradation signals, along with real-time information related to the environmental conditions, are then used to update the residual life distributions in real-time. Because these updated distributions capture current health information and the latest environmental conditions, they provide precise lifetime estimates. The performance of the proposed models is evaluated using real world vibration-based degradation signals from a rotating machinery application.	coefficient;elegant degradation;experiment;real-time clock;real-time data;real-time transcription;recursion;smith–volterra–cantor set;stochastic process;time complexity	Nagi Gebraeel;Jing Pan	2008	IEEE Transactions on Reliability	10.1109/TR.2008.928245	control engineering;reliability engineering;stochastic process;engineering;stochastic modelling;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	57.748399097933394	-4.582971551825635	84111

By defining a controlled output, the synchronization problem is converted to a special suboptimal   H ∞       H  ∞         control problem. Precisely speaking, for a given disturbance attenuation level, we need to design a distributed output-feedback protocol such that the closed-loop system asymptotically reaches output synchronization when there do not exist disturbances, and the  L  2 -gain from disturbances to the controlled output is less than the given level. We first consider the case that each agent is incrementally passive. Secondly, we consider the case that each agent is feedback incrementally passive and the measured output is not influenced by disturbances. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.	nonlinear system	Shidong Zhai;Yuan Zhou;Qingdu Li	2017	Applied Mathematics and Computation	10.1016/j.amc.2016.09.020	real-time computing;control theory	ML	63.92695278111942	2.6646314167072664	84125

In order to make that the perturbation is minimal, the perturbation is provided into two parts by projection matrix--the matched and unmatched perturbation. It is also shown that when the minimum is attained and the resulting perturbation is not amplified. The controller design uses integral sliding mode concept and optimal control to ensure finite-time convergent in the effect of the unmatched uncertainty. The time convergence is chosen in advance. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed controller is robust with respect to the perturbation.

While a number of estimation algorithms are widely utilised in real-time applications, most of them are inadequate in the event of loss of observation as they are fundamentally based on the plant dynamics relying heavily on the measured output data. To overcome this shortcoming, a compensated closed-loop estimation algorithm is suggested in this work and is implemented in a spacecraft system with intermittent measured signals. The compensated observation signal, reconstructed using a linear prediction subsystem, is supplied at the measurement update step in the Kalman filtering. To limit the number of observations utilised in the linear prediction filter, a minimum mean square error based scheme is provided to obtain the size of linear prediction filter order. A Lyapunov-stability based output feedback control scheme is employed for the stabilisation problem. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the compensated algorithm wherein the aim is tackling the estimation problem subject to loss of measurements for the spacecraft application.

Furthermore the increased number of DC loads has shifted the view to DC Microgrids. This paper presents the stability and maximum time delay calculation for a DC Microgrid implementing master-slave control strategy. The communication between the master and the slave is achieved through communication network which makes the DC Microgrid a time delay system. A stability criterion based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and replacing the delay term by Newton-Leibnitz formula is used to derive a set of linear matrix inequalities. The binary iteration algorithm is used to solve the set of linear matrix inequalities and to calculate the maximum allowable delay bound. The effects of the voltage controller gains on the maximum allowable delay bound are also investigated. Further, the relation between the maximum allowable delay bound and the time delay variation rate is studied. The results are tested through simulation using Matlab/Simulink.	algorithm;broadcast delay;control theory;delay calculation;iteration;iterative method;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;matlab;microgrid;newton;newton's method;simulation;simulink;telecommunications network;voltage controller	Ashraf F.

The uncertainties under consideration are assumed to be unknown but bounded with a priori known bounds. The proposed observer is used to robustly estimate the vehicle yaw rate and lateral velocity using a vision system measurement. The road curvature is treated as an unknown input and a linear adaptive tire model is considered to take into account the changes of the road adhesion. Sufficient conditions allowing the design of such observer are derived using Multiple Quadratic ISS-Lyapunov function and an LMIs (Linear Matrix Inequalities) formulation is obtained. Performance of the algorithm is evaluated using vehicle real data, results show that the proposed estimation scheme succeeds to appropriately estimate the upper and lower bounds of vehicle lateral dynamics despite of the presence of unknown inputs.	algorithm;estimation theory;fault detection and isolation;lateral computing;lateral thinking;linear matrix inequality;linear system;lyapunov fractal;norm (social);velocity (software development);yaws	Sara Ifqir;Naima Ait Oufroukh;Dalil Ichalal;Saïd Mammar	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431486	observer (quantum physics);computer science;yaw;vehicle dynamics;matrix (mathematics);control theory;bounded function;interval estimation;upper and lower bounds;linear system	Robotics	66.16273627268873	-9.306030146336417	85873

The contributions are twofold. First, conditions for uniform ultimately bounded stability are provided in the H2/H∞ event-based context. The relation between the boundedness of the stability region and the threshold that triggers the events is studied. Second, a practical design procedure for event-based H2/H∞ control is provided. The method makes use of Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) and it is characterised by its generality, as only mild assumptions are imposed on the structures of the LKF and the cost functional. The robustness and performance of the proposed technique is showed through numerical simulations.	control system	Luis Orihuela;Pablo Millán;Carlos Vivas;Francisco R. Rubio	2014	Int. J.

The system state vector is assumed to be measurable. As part of the controller design, first, local input-to-state-like stability (ISS) for a continuously sampled controller that has been injected with bounded measurement errors is demonstrated and, subsequently, an event-execution control law is derived such that the measurement errors are guaranteed to remain bounded. Lyapunov theory is used to demonstrate that the tracking errors and the NN weight estimation errors for each NN are locally uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) in the presence bounded disturbances, NN reconstruction errors, as well as errors introduced by event-sampling. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.	artificial neural network;computer simulation;control theory;feedback;human body weight;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;optimal control;programming paradigm;sampling (signal processing)	Nathan Szanto;Vignesh Narayanan;Sarangapani Jagannathan	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798780	control engineering;von neumann stability analysis;vehicle dynamics;simulation;backstepping;nonlinear system;engineering;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network;observational error	Robotics	65.17306973879208	-5.421147476774209	85916

A controller based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed to minimize the overshoot and settling time following sudden changes in load torque. The entire system is modeled and simulated using the SIMULINK toolbox. The advantages of fuzzy logic and neural network are fused together to form a connectionist adaptive network based fuzzy logic controller. The required data for training the ANFIS controller are generated by simulation of the closed loop system with a conventional PID controller. The overshoot present in the transient response with conventional controller is eliminated using the ANFIS controller. The transient deviation of the response from the set reference following the variation in load torque is found to be negligibly small along with a desirable reduction in settling time for the ANFIS controller.	neuro-fuzzy	S.

The sub-models of the system were obtained by deriving heat transfer equations of heat loss of two zones by conduction and convection, cooling unit and fan. All models of the variable flow-rate HVAC system were generated by using MATLAB/SIMULINK, and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) parameters were obtained by using Fuzzy sets. For comfortable of people the temperatures of the two different zones were decreased to 5 C from the ambient temperature. The successful results were obtained by applying self-tuning proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-type fuzzy adaptive controller if comparing with the fuzzy PD-type and the classical PID controller. The obtained results were presented in a graphical form. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The water level control application is a practical example where the use of communication hardware is inescapable. Therefore in our study we consider that on occasions the FF loops will be rendered ineffective due to the inability of the related communication channels to transmit at the required times. We consider first the case in which some FF loops are not operational for a long time (static failure configuration) and propose a stability analysis that shows that as long as the original feedback decentralized control is stable the overall configuration, including the possibly failing FF links, will remain stable. We then consider the more challenging case of time-varying faults on these FF loops and their effect on the overall stability of the system and finally the more general case in which the control action can be FF to all upstream controllers, not just the adjacent one.	distributed control system;elegant degradation;failure;feedback;feedforward neural network;interference (communication);kalman filter;telecommunications link	Alexis J.

ff407eaa84e372316db66285c304c053e48715ab	a robust algorithm for online switched system identification		In this paper, we consider the problem of online identification of Switched AutoRegressive eXogenous (SARX) systems, where the goal is to estimate the parameters of each subsystem and identify the switching sequence as data are obtained in a streaming fashion. Previous works in this area are sensitive to initialization and lack theoretical guarantees. We overcome these drawbacks with our two-step algorithm: (i) every time we receive new data, we first assign this data to one candidate subsystem based on a novel robust criterion that incorporates both the residual error and an upper bound of subsystem estimation error, and (ii) we use a randomized algorithm to update the parameter estimate of chosen candidate. We provide a theoretical guarantee on the local convergence of our algorithm. Though our theory only guarantees convergence with a good initialization, simulation results show that even with random initialization, our algorithm still has excellent performance. Finally, we show, through simulations, that our algorithm outperforms existing methods and exhibits robust performance.	local convergence;randomized algorithm;simulation;system identification	Zhe Du;Necmiye Ozay;Laura Balzano	2018	CoRR		local convergence;residual;initialization;algorithm;mathematics;randomized algorithm;upper and lower bounds;system identification;convergence (routing)	ML	62.65137826038322	1.548683471645058	86726

776d9186cdc1723622c2168d103898796a7e7d1d	minimum weighted frobenius norm discrete-time fir filter with embedded unbiasedness		In this brief, we propose a new receding horizon finite impulse response (FIR) filter that minimizes the weighted Frobenius norm with embedded unbiasedness in discrete-time state-space. The filter, called the discrete-time weighted Frobenius norm unbiased FIR (DTWFNUF) filter, belongs to a class of maximum likelihood estimators. The Frobenius norm is introduced and minimized as a performance criterion to the filter gain matrix. It is shown that the DTWFNUF filter design problem can be cast into the optimization problem with the equality constraint and the filter gain matrix obtained by the Lagrange multiplier method. Higher robustness of the proposed filter is demonstrated in a comparison with the Kalman filter and minimum variance unbiased FIR filter based on a numerical example of the F-404 gas turbine engine.	embedded system;filter design;finite impulse response;kalman filter;lagrange multiplier;loss function;mathematical optimization;matrix multiplication;numerical analysis;optimization problem;state space	Sung Hyun You;Choon Ki Ahn;Yuriy S.

3990bcf535ba555e1a905b7eb3764209216fd9be	a distributed control approach for enhancing smart grid transient stability and resilience		Increasing deployment of information technologies and low-inertia renewable energy sources into smart grid fuel the uncertainties and reveal security and transient stability problems. Enhancing the stability margins of smart grids despite the cyber and physical disturbances emerges the need for cyber-aware robust controller design. Therefore, a distributed nonlinear robust controller is proposed to improve the transient stability margins of synchronous generators (SG) in the presence of excessive communication delay and cyber-physical disturbances. The proposed controller uses phasor measurement units to receive real-time measurements and actuates distributed storage systems to inject or absorb power in order to accelerate stabilization of frequency oscillations of SG following a disturbance. The communication dependency exposes time delay and cyber-security issues since latency is inherent and can be excessive during an attack such as denial of service. In addition, uncertainties in measurements challenge the stabilization process. Hence, the proposed controller is designed for robustness to delay and additive disturbances. A novel time delay compensation technique is developed to inject delay-free control signal into the closed-loop system. To guarantee that all tracking error signals are globally uniformly ultimately bounded, novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals are used in the Lyapunov-based stability analysis. The simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed control framework and robustness under cyber-physical practical limitations.	broadcast delay;clustered file system;computer security;denial-of-service attack;distributed control system;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;phasor;real-time clock;robust control;simulation;software deployment;suicidegirls;utility functions on indivisible goods	Muharrem Ayar;Serhat Obuz;Rodrigo D.

With the linear combination of input variables as a new input variable, the complexity of the fuzzy mechanism of PID-like fuzzy controllers is significantly reduced. However, the performance of the complexity reduced fuzzy PID controller may be degraded since the degree of freedom is decreased by the combination of input variables. To alleviate the drawback and improve the performance of the complexity reduced PID-like fuzzy controller, a flexible complexity reduced design approach is introduced in which the functional scaling factors are heuristically generated. Since the functional scaling factors are heuristically created, they can be easily adjusted for the flexible complexity reduced PID-like fuzzy controller without a priori knowledge of the exact mathematical model of the plant. Moreover, heuristic scaling factors are implemented as functionals. Therefore, the complexity of the flexible PID-like fuzzy controller will not be increased. Further, the stability of the fuzzy control system with a flexible complexity reduced PID-like fuzzy controller is discussed. Finally, the simulation results are also included to show the effectiveness of the PID-like fuzzy controller designed with the flexible complexity reduced approach.	controllers;fuzzy control system;heuristic;image scaling;mathematical model;mathematics;pid;performance;simulation;test scaling	Chin-Wang Tao;Jin-Shiuh Taur	2000	IEEE transactions on systems, man, and cybernetics.

Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, a fuzzy MIMO switched observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable states. The Nussbaumtype functions are utilized to handle the unknown gain signs of the system under study. A switched-dynamic-surface-based adaptive fuzzy control approach is then established by exploiting the average dwell time method and backstepping and the dynamic surface control technique, which constructs multiple switched first-order filters to overcome the multiple “explosion of complexity” problem when applying the backstepping recursive design scheme. Also, the proposed approach extends the classical dynamic surface control technique from its original non-switched nonlinear version to a switched nonlinear version. It is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobal uniformly ultimately boundedness under a class of switching signals with average dwell time, and the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. A mass–spring–damper system with controller switching as a practical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed data-driven approach relies on transfer Koopman and Perron-Frobenius (P-F) operators for linear representation and control of such systems. Systematic model-based frameworks involving linear transfer P-F operator were proposed for almost everywhere stability analysis and control design of a nonlinear dynamical system in previous works [1]–[3]. Lyapunov measure can be used as a tool to provide linear programmingbased computational framework for stability analysis and almost everywhere stabilizing control design of a nonlinear system. In this paper, we show that those frameworks can be extended to a data-driven setting, where the finite dimensional approximation of linear transfer P-F operator and stabilizing feedback controller can be obtained from time-series data. We exploit the positivity and Markov property of these operators and their finite-dimensional approximation to provide linear programming based approach for designing an optimally stabilizing feedback controller.	algorithm;approximation;control theory;dynamical system;koopmans' theorem;linear programming;lyapunov fractal;markov chain;markov property;matrix multiplication;nonlinear system;optimal control;time series;transfer operator	Apurba Kumar Das;Bowen Huang;Umesh Vaidya	2018	CoRR		mathematical optimization;control theory;dynamical system;control theory;dynamical systems theory;mathematics;almost everywhere;optimal control;nonlinear system;linear programming;lyapunov function	Robotics	63.28730475300922	-1.2248176918755	87593

The estimation functions are designed directly from measured inputs and outputs and have two important features. First, they enjoy convergence and optimality properties, based on classical results on parametric identification. Second, the PWA structure is based on a simplicial partition of the measurement space and allows one to implement very effectively the virtual sensor on a digital circuit. Due to the low cost of the required hardware for the implementation of such a particular structure and to the very high sampling frequencies that can be achieved, the approach is applicable to a wide range of industrial problems.	digital electronics;nonlinear system;picasa web albums;sampling (signal processing);sensor	Tomaso Poggi;Matteo Rubagotti;Alberto Bemporad;Marco Storace	2012	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2011.2161064	control engineering;electronic engineering;convergence;nonlinear system;engineering;sensor;electrical engineering;control theory;mathematics;silicon;digital electronics;sampling;physics	Visualization	60.06672901019392	-0.18189564222818763	87717

The objective is to determine the minimum of the smallest singular value of the controllability or observability Gramian over the uncertainty region. This provides a quantitative measure for the robust controllability or observability degree of the system. To this end, it is shown that the problem can be recast as a sum-of-squares (SOS) problem. In the special case when the uncertainty region is polytopic, the corresponding SOS formulation can be simplified significantly. One can apply the proposed method to any large-scale interconnected system to identify those inputs and outputs that are more effective in controlling the system. This enables the designer to simplify the control structure by ignoring those inputs and outputs whose contribution to the overall control operation is relatively weak. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the results.	approximation algorithm;arbitrary-precision arithmetic;control flow;control system;gramian matrix;input/output;linear algebra;linear time-invariant theory;matrix polynomial;numerical analysis;semiconductor industry;time complexity;time-invariant system	Somayeh Sojoudi;Javad Lavaei;Amir G.

For such system, a recursive design is used to include second subsystem into robust control. The recursive design procedure is constructive and contains two steps. First, ctitious robust controller for rst subsystem is designed as if the subsystem had an independent control. As the ctitious control, nonlinear H1 control using the energy dissipation is designed in the sense of L2-gain attenuation from the disturbance caused by uncertainties to performance. Second, the actual robust control is designed recursively by Lyapunov's second method. The designed robust control is applied to robotic system with actuators, in which physical control inputs are not the torque to robot links but electrical signals to actuators.	approximation algorithm;convex optimization;heterojunction;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;recursion;robot;robust control;series and parallel circuits;social inequality	Jong Hyeon Park;Jong-Guk Yim	2000		10.1109/IROS.2000.894578	attenuation;robust control;robot;control engineering;electronic engineering;uncertainty;design methods;adaptive control;nonlinear system;engineering;dissipation;control theory;actuator	Robotics	64.4594189480076	0.5661259288522422	88074

Such OOSM arrival can induce the “negative-time measurement update” problem, which is quite common in real multisensor tracking systems. The A1 optimal update algorithm with OOSM is presented by Bar-Shalom for one-step case. However, this paper proves that the optimality of A1 algorithm is lost in direct discrete-time model (DDM) of the process noise, it holds true only in discretized continuous-time model (DCM). One better OOSM filtering algorithm for DDM case is presented. Also, another new optimal OOSM filtering algorithm, which is independent of the discrete time model of the process noise, is presented here. The performance of the two new algorithms is compared with that of A1 algorithm by Monte Carlo simulations. The effectiveness and correctness of the two proposed algorithms are validated by analysis and simulation results.	algorithm;centralized computing;correctness (computer science);dicom;discretization;monte carlo method;preprocessor;simulation;tracking system	WenHui Zhou;Lin Li;GuoHai Chen;AnXi Yu	2007	Science in China Series F: Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-007-0012-y	mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;simulation;tracking system;computer science;control theory;mathematics;sensor fusion;statistics;monte carlo method	Theory	56.100523050655504	3.477959383796723	88142

Using the DSC technique, a novel fault diagnostic algorithm is proposed, which removes the classical assumption that the time derivative of the output error should be known. Further, an accommodation scheme is proposed to compensate for both actuator time-varying gain and bias faults, and avoids the controller singularity. In addition, the proposed controller guarantees that all signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed FTC approach is demonstrated on a simulated aircraft longitudinal dynamics example.	converge;fault tolerance;medical algorithm;nonlinear system	Qikun Shen;Zehui Mao;Vincent Cocquempot	2014	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2254493	real-time computing;adaptive control;aerodynamics;control theory;fuzzy control system;actuator	Robotics	65.54296110044203	-5.8502598339574465	88196

The phenomena of ROQ and missing measurements are governed by a Bernoulli distributed stochastic sequence. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a state estimator such that the dynamics of the estimation error is exponentially stable in the mean square and the prescribed H1 performance constraint is satisfied. By constructing proper Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals and employing stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the existence of the desired estimator. Furthermore, the explicit expression of the gain of the desired estimator is described in terms of the solution to a convex optimization problem that can be easily solved by using the semi-definite programme method. Finally, a numerical example is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed estimator design approach. & 2014 Elsevier B.V.

0dc3b572b1a7777917034cde305611809229597c	optimal h∞ fuzzy control for nonlinear multiple time-delay interconnected systems: using dithers as auxiliaries		This paper presents an effective approach to stabilize nonlinear multiple time-delay (NMTD) interconnected systems via a composite of fuzzy controllers and dithers. First, a neural-network (NN) model is employed to approximate each subsystem. Then, the dynamics of the NN model is converted into a linear differential inclusion (LDI) state-space representation. Next, in terms of Lyapunov׳s direct method, a delay-dependent stability criterion is derived to guarantee the exponential stability of the NMTD interconnected system. Subsequently, the stability conditions of this criterion are reformulated into a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Based on the LMI, a robustness design of fuzzy control is synthesized not only to stabilize the NMTD interconnected system but also to achieve the optimal  H  ∞  performance by minimizing the disturbance attenuation level. A set of high-frequency signals (commonly referred to as  dithers ) is simultaneously injected to stabilize the NMTD interconnected system when the designed fuzzy controllers cannot stabilize it. If the dithers’ frequencies are high enough, the outputs of the dithered interconnected system and those of its corresponding mathematical model, the relaxed interconnected system, can be made as close as desired. This makes it possible to get a rigorous prediction of the stability of the dithered interconnected system by establishing the stability of the relaxed interconnected system. Finally, a numerical example with simulations is given to illustrate the feasibility of our approach.	fuzzy control system;nonlinear system	Feng-Hsiag Hsiao	2014	J.

In the majority of LPV systems, it is assumed that the scheduling parameters are exactly known. In reality due to noise or possibly faulty sensors, it is sometimes impossible to have accurate knowledge of the scheduling parameters and a design based on the assumption of perfect knowledge of the scheduling parameters cannot be guaranteed to work well in this situation. This paper proposes a sliding mode observer scheme to reconstruct actuator and sensor faults in a situation where the scheduling parameters are imperfectly known.

This paper presents a systematic procedure for choosing control structure by extending previous work based on steady-state optimization to include the dynamic performance in a consistent manner. To address the problem that the dynamic performance depends on the type and the parameterization of the controllers used when comparing control structures, NMPC controllers are assumed. For each structure, the performance weights of these controllers are optimized with respect to the economic performance to yield an optimal tuning. This gives the best performance that is attainable for each structure and the structures are compared on equal grounds. The approach is demonstrated for a distillation control problem.	computation;control flow;control system;iterative method;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;real-time transcription;rejection sampling;stationary process;steady state;systems design;time complexity	Le Chi Pham;Sebastian Engell	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5280963	control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory	Robotics	60.30630706376685	-4.293230342575201	88962

A multiple-point-mass model for the high speed train against actuator failures is presented, in which the actuator failures including both partial loss of actuator effectiveness and complete breakdown are characterized by unknown varying parameters. A parallel control architecture is proposed by adding redundant control channels into closed loop to achieve the reliability of control strategy, which can ensure the stability of high speed train system when all actuators are operational as well as some actuators experience failures. In particular, our approach does not require any controller reconfiguration for occurrence of actuator failures, which is suitable for reliable control for high speed train with requirement of high reliability and safety. The controllers composing the parallel control strategy is considered as measurement feedback controllers, and the design procedure is eventually converted into a set of linear matrix inequality feasibility problems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through numerical simulations.	closed-loop transfer function;computer simulation;control theory;linear matrix inequality;numerical analysis;social inequality	Weiming Xiang;Jian Xiao	2014	17th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957792	control engineering;electronic engineering;plant;engineering;control reconfiguration;control theory	Robotics	63.06892584339746	-4.932378696964268	89029

Noisy observations of an underlying state process are available for these N sources. We consider the continuous time sensor scheduling problem in which N of these N sources are to be chosen to collect data at each time point. This sensor scheduling problem (with switching costs and switching constraints) is formulated as a constrained optimal control problem. In this framework, the controls represent the sensors that are chosen at a particular time. Thus, the control variables are constrained to take values in a discrete set, and switchings between sensors can occur in continuous time. By incorporating recent results on discrete valued optimal control, we show that this problem can be transformed into an equivalent continuous optimal control problem. In this way, we obtain the sensor scheduling policy as well as the associated switching times. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.	optimal control;scheduling (computing);sensor	H. W.

In this paper, first, the distributed cooperative H∞ optimal tracking problem is transformed into controlling the cooperative tracking error dynamics in affine form. Second, control schemes and online algorithms are proposed via adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and the theory of zero-sum differential graphical games. The schemes use only one neural network (NN) for each agent instead of three from ADP to reduce computational complexity as well as avoid choosing initial NN weights for stabilising controllers.

Based on Lyapunov-Krasovaii functional approach, a delay-dependent stability condition is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), for the discrete-time delayed systems. In the derivation of the delay-dependent stability result, the model transformation and bounding certain cross terms are avoided. Although the stability condition is given in terms of LMIs, it is found to be not suitable for control design. As a remedy for this, the stability condition is converted to the equivalent linear matrix inequalities with inverse constraints (ICLMIs) which can be employed in designing controllers.

The robust LQR problem is formulated as a minimax optimization problem, resulting in a robust optimal controller which in addition to minimizing the quadratic cost it also minimizes the level of disturbance variability.

The input/output behavior of the nonlinear/uncertain block is described by an integral quadratic constraint (IQC). A dissipation inequality is proposed to compute an upper bound for this gain. This worst-case gain condition can be formulated as a semidefinite program and the result can be interpreted as a Bounded Real Lemma for uncertain LPV systems. The paper shows that this new condition is a generalization of the well known Bounded Real Lemma for LPV systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a simple numerical example.	algorithmic efficiency;best, worst and average case;input/output;interconnection;nonlinear element;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;quadratically constrained quadratic program;semidefinite programming;social inequality;whole earth 'lectronic link	Harald Pfifer;Peter Seiler	2014	2014 American Control Conference	10.1109/ACC.2014.6858751	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	66.01133446652224	-0.8894980263446458	89790

The objective is to synthesize a reliable controller such that the considered system is stochastically stable even if the actuator suffers from failures. A mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is employed and some novel integral inequalities are utilized in order to reduce the conservatism. In this case, some criteria are established and the desired controller can be achieved by settling an optimization issue in view of the proposed criteria.

Typically, this system is nonlinear high order system which includes nonlinear switch components and resonant networks, developing of accurate model is a challenging task. In this paper, a novel technique for parameter identification of a BIPT system is presented by using chaotic-enhanced fruit fly optimization algorithm (CFOA). The fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) is a new metaheuristic technique based on the swarm behavior of the fruit fly. This paper proposes a novel CFOA, which employs chaotic sequence to enhance the global optimization capacity of original FOA. The parameter identification of the BIPT system is formalized as a multi-dimensional optimization problem, and an objective function is establishedminimizing the errors between the estimated and measured values. All the 11 parameters of this system (Lpi, LT, Lsi, Lso, CT, Cs, M, Rpi, RT, Rsi and Rso) can be identified simultaneously using measured input–output data. Simulations show that the proposed parameter identification technique is robust to measurements noise and variation of operation condition and thus it is suitable for practical application. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

An adaptive SoC estimator, named as the AdaptSoC, is developed in this paper. It is able to estimate the SoC when the model parameters are unknown, through joint SoC and parameter estimation. Design of the AdaptSoC builds up on (1) a reduced complexity battery model that is developed from the well-known single particle model (SPM) and, (2) joint local observability/identifiability analysis of the SoC and the unknown model parameters. Shown to be strongly observable, the SoC is estimated jointly with the parameters by the AdaptSoC using the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF).

Besides avoiding the explosion of complexity problem in traditional multivariable backstepping design, the proposed scheme has the following features: (1) only one parameter needs to be updated on-line regardless of the plant order and input–output dimension, (2) only the Hurwitz condition is required for the high-frequency gain matrix and (3) the ℒ∞ performance of the tracking error can be guaranteed. It is shown that all signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly bounded. Simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Different with the traditional parallel distribution compensation (PDC) method, the same premises between the PDC controller and the T-S fuzzy systems are no longer needed again in the proposed method. Under consideration of the unmatched grades of membership in the networked T-S fuzzy systems, a unified T-S fuzzy model is firstly proposed, in which a networked state-feedback fuzzy controller with communication delays is used to reconstruct the system. Then, based on the constructed model and by use of the Wirtinger-based inequality technique to deal with the cross items, two less conservative stability and stabilization criteria are derived to enhance the design flexibility. Finally, two numerical examples are used to show the effectiveness of proposed method.	fuzzy control system	Shaodong Ma;Chen Peng;Jin Zhang;Xiangpeng Xie	2017	Appl.

In order to evaluate the convergence and diversity of the PSO algorithm, two measures related to the decay rate and l2 gain of the PSO dynamics are used. These measures are characterized by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and are therefore efficiently computed by convex optimization tools. As for the measure related to the decay rate, moreover, an alternative condition in terms of nonlinear scalar inequalities is presented which can be checked more shortly and accurately than the LMI. Numerical experiments suggest that the measures are effective enough to evaluate the convergence and diversity of the PSO algorithm, which results in better understanding of the PSO algorithm from the viewpoints of exploitation and exploration abilities.	algorithm;convex optimization;experiment;exploit (computer security);linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;multiplicative noise;nonlinear system;numerical method;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;theory	Yuji Wakasa;Kanya Tanaka;Yuki Nishimura	2010	2010 IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Aided Control System Design	10.1109/CACSD.2010.5612763	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	61.226751419468755	2.203278813342213	90995

First, a fuzzy auxiliary controller is constructed based on a feedback signal not only to estimate the unknown control term, but also participates in the sliding mode control due to the fuzzy rule employed. Then, we extend our theory into the cases, where some kind of system information cannot be obtained, for better use of our theoretical results in real engineering.

We capture the mobility in the leader-follower algorithm by abstracting it as a Linear Time-Varying (LTV) system with random system matrices. In particular, a mobile node, moving randomly in a bounded region, updates its state when it finds neighbors; and does not update when it is not in the communication range of any other node. In this context, we develop certain regularity conditions on the system and input matrices such that each follower converges to the leader state. To analyze the corresponding LTV system, we partition the entire chain of system matrices into non-overlapping slices, and relate the convergence of the sensor network to the lengths of these slices. In contrast to the existing results, we show that a bounded length on the slices, capturing the dissemination of information from the leader to the followers, is not required; as long as the slice-lengths are finite and do not grow faster than a certain exponential rate.	algorithm;converge;randomness;sensor;signal processing;software propagation;stochastic process;time complexity	Sam Safavi;Usman A.

8ba78835b36d9ef39f9a948a4bbfe00bbc09f330	comparing ekf and spkf algorithms for simultaneous localization and mapping (slam)		Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is the problem in which a sensor-enabled mobile robot incrementally builds a map for an unknown environment, while localizing itself within this map. A problem with detection of correct path of moving objects is the received noisy data. Therefore, it is possible that the information is incorrectly detected. The Kalman Filter’s linearized error propagation can result in big errors and instability in the SLAM problem. One approach to reduce this situation is using of iteration in Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Sigma Point Kalman Filter (SPKF). We will show that the recapitulate versions of kalman filters can improve the estimation accuracy and robustness of these filters beside of linear error propagation. Simulation results are presented to validate this improvement of state estimate convergence through repetitive linearization of the nonlinear model in EKF and SPKF for SLAM algorithms.

dde17db3f0f1493d32f5f56b061c6232e18340a1	analysis and design for continuous-time string-connected takagi-sugeno systems		Distributed systems consist of interconnected, lower-dimensional subsystems. For such systems, distributed analysis and design present several advantages, such as modularity, easier analysis and design, and reduced computational complexity. A special case of distributed systems is when the subsystems are connected in a string. Applications include distributed process control, traffic and communication networks, irrigation systems, hydropower valleys, etc. By exploiting such a structure, in this paper, we propose conditions for the distributed stability analysis of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems connected in a string. These conditions are also extended to observer and controller design and illustrated on numerical examples.	computational complexity theory;distributed computing;fuzzy control system;modularity (networks);numerical analysis;numerical method;string (computer science);telecommunications network	Zsófia Lendek;Paula Raica;Bart De Schutter;Robert Babuska	2014	J.

At the beginning, one adjustable parameter is introduced in the fuzzy logic system, the robot manipulators system with uncertain nonlinear terms as the master device and a reference model dynamic system as the slave robot system. To overcome the limitations such as online learning computation burden and logic structure in conventional fuzzy logic systems, a parameter should be used in fuzzy logic system, which composes fuzzy logic system with updated parameter laws, and can be formed for a new fashioned adaptation algorithms controller. The error closed-loop dynamical system can be stabilized based on Lyapunov analysis, the number of online learning computation burdens can be reduced greatly, and the different kinds of fuzzy logic systems with fuzzy rules or without any fuzzy rules are also suited. Finally, effectiveness of the proposed approach has been shown in simulation example.

This is particularly true for systems with non-linearity and unmodelled disturbances. This paper proposes an Auto-Generating Fuzzy System Modelling mechanism (AGFSM) with online tuning capability. The proposed mechanism offers a universal black-box modelling tool for any system, linear or nonlinear, regardless of any prior knowledge of the physical relationship inside the system or the system behaviour. The proposed mechanism comprises of two phases, a structure-generating phase and a parameter-learning phase. Structure generating phase is based on the entropy measure used to control the model accuracy. Parameter learning phase is based on supervised learning algorithms using the back propagation algorithm. The proposed AGFSM mechanism is used to develop the models of both linear and nonlinear systems using input-output data.	algorithm;backpropagation;black box;box modeling;fuzzy control system;linear system;machine learning;nonlinear system identification;online and offline;software propagation;supervised learning	Osama Hassanein;Sreenatha G.

156cc059416f47320208f3a41e91b3567c77a3cf	integrated controller design with local controller designed independently for linear switching system with a single i/o delay		The paper presents an integrated switching controller synthesis for linear switching plant with a single I/O delay. The integrated switching controller is composed with local controllers designed independently and beforehand for different local plants. The design idea comes from the traditional stabilizing controller parameterization of LTI systems with a single I/O delay. It not only guarantees the quadratic stability of the closed-loop system for all operating points, but also considers local control performance at each operating point. The integrated control scheme can be applied in cases where the plant remains at the operating points most of the time and the switching from one point to another does not often occur. Finally, two simple numerical examples are given to show the efficiency of the proposed method.	input/output	Wei Xie	2015	J.

A finite-time optimal control approach “optimistically” determines the trajectory that provides the best tradeoff between tracking performance and the probability of the trajectory to actually execute, under possible chance constraints. The approach is also robustified, less optimistically, to ensure that the system satisfies a set of constraints for all possible realizations of the stochastic events, or alternatively for those having enough probability to realize. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic convergence in probability are given for the receding-horizon implementation of the optimal control solution. The effectiveness of the suggested stochastic hybrid control techniques is shown on a case study in supply chain management.	algorithm;automaton;closed-loop transfer function;computational complexity theory;control theory;dynamical system;fault-tolerant computer system;hybrid system;loss function;numerical partial differential equations;optimal control;optimistic concurrency control;reachability;recursion;state space	Alberto Bemporad;Stefano Di Cairano	2011	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2010.2084810	control engineering;mathematical optimization;supply chain management;stochastic control;control theory;mathematics;markov process;model predictive control;statistics;hybrid system	Embedded	60.89015229261269	-0.11088361741298369	91749

The optimal solution is obtained as a sliding mode control, whereas the conventional linear feedback control fails to provide a causal solution. Performance of the obtained optimal controller is verified in the illustrative example against the conventional LQ regulator that is optimal for the quadratic Bolza–Meyer criterion.

ec1cb2bc55da540d8132d42f000d7941619cb536	an efficient track association algorithm for the multitarget tracking problem	multitarget tracking	A new and extremely promising approach is presented for the solution of the multitarget tracking problem for an important class of targets. For the class of targets that can be described as a linear, time-invariant system, it appears that this approach may be considerably more efficient, computationally, than existing procedures. A survey of approaches to the solution of the multitarget tracking problem has been presented in Ref. [2]. As indicated there, most algorithms require the use of the Kalman filter to provide state estimation for data association and track assignment. In this report, the need for state estimation to identify feasible tracks is eliminated. The use of simpler input-output models for track prediction results in a very substantial reduction in computational burden when compared with methods requiring state estimation.#R##N##R##N#The utility of the method presented here depends, as do Kalman-filter-based methods, upon the definition of data windows that permit the identification of feasible tracks and the elimination of infeasible tracks in a timely manner and according to statistically meaningful criteria. After identifying feasible tracks, the Kalman filter can be utilized to obtain the required state estimates and to analyze and refine the information in the feasible track files.	algorithm	Harold W.

In particular, the problem of computing upper bounds of the minimum commutation time ensuring stability with respect to finite and infinite input sequences is dealt with. It is shown that such upper bounds can be established by solving LMI feasibility tests for given polynomial Lyapunov functions in the former case and homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov functions in the latter case. Lastly, the structure of the obtained tests is exploited to derive a search for less conservative upper bounds in a reduced number of variables through the solution of convex LMI optimizations at each iteration.	iteration;linear matrix inequality;loss function;lyapunov fractal;polynomial	Graziano Chesi;Yeung Sam Hung	2007	2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2007.4434128	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;stability;homogeneous polynomial;alternating polynomial;lyapunov function;stable polynomial;control theory;mathematics;matrix polynomial;upper and lower bounds;square-free polynomial;polynomial	Robotics	67.53784142850682	-0.019982882929311507	92384

Modelling and simulation study of the CHP process is important for power and thermodynamics evaluation and economic analysis. A simplified dynamic model based on the University of Warwick micro-CHP power plant is developed in this paper. In this CHP process, a gas turbine module is adopted and modelled as the gas engine based on methane combustion principle to generate electricity. Heat recovery system and auxiliary boiler modules are developed for thermal power generation. The simulation results of the gas engine and each auxiliary sub-system are validated by comparing the results with the operating data collected by the Estates Team of the University of Warwick. In addition, the dynamic performance of the whole CHP process is studied with respect to the variation from the input of syngas stream. The simulation results show the dynamic changes of key output variables, including electricity generation, thermal power output and water output temperature. The simulation results of one summer working day and one winter working day of gas engine and heat exchanger are compared with operation data.

f921ddfbefa720a0d10763c8ced1cb63b8b16214	third harmonic injection based nonlinear control of ipmsm drive for wide speed range operation		This paper presents a nonlinear controller incorporating third harmonic injection for wide speed range operation of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive. Due to magnetic saturation, constant motor parameters lead to an unsatisfactory performance for the controller. Therefore, taking parameter variations into account an adaptive backstepping based nonlinear controller is developed for an IPMSM drive. Furthermore, a sinusoidal third harmonic injection (THI) technique is integrated to increase the DC bus utilization which facilitates a higher speed operating range. The field control permits extended speed range utilizing the reluctance torque. Stability of the control law state variables are demonstrated through Lyapunov stability criterion and global asymptotic stability is assured through the application of criterion supported by Barbalat's lemma. Feasibility of the proposed drive is tested in both simulation and experiment for laboratory 3.7kW IPMSM drive. A performance comparison of the proposed harmonic injection based nonlinear controller is shown with classical vector control and nonlinear controller without THI and parameter estimation.	estimation theory;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;optimal control;simulation	Md.

ee7870073d430ff96392ab19be67dfc6341491e0	a novel repetitive control algorithm combining ilc and dead-beat control	repetitive control	In this paper it is explored whether or not a well-known adjoint Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithm can be applied to Repetitive Control (RC) problems. It is found that due to the lack of resetting in Repetitive Control, and the non-causal nature of the adjoint algorithm, the implementation requires a truncation procedure that can lead to instability. In order to avoid the truncation procedure, as a novel idea it is proposed that deadbeat control can used to shorten the impulse response of the plant to be so short that the need for truncation is removed. Therefore, convergence is guaranteed, if the adjoint algorithm is applied to the closed-loop plant with a dead-beat controller. The proposed algorithm is validated using real-time experiments on a non-minimum phase spring-mass-damper system. The experimental results show fast convergence to near perfect tracking, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed algorithm to industrial RC problems.	algorithm;causal system;display resolution;experiment;google reader;instability;iterative method;minimum phase;optimal control;real-time clock;system camera;truncation	Christopher T.

First, we focus on the class of linear continuous-time positive delay systems (Metzlerian delay systems) and outline its interesting properties. Using the stability properties associated with this class, we formulate a constrained stabilization problem for the linear time delay system and provide conditions for the existence of controllers satisfying the stability and Metzlerian constraints. The Metzlerian stabilization is solved using Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) or Linear Programming (LP). Next, we characterize the uncertainties associated with the positive delay systems and define the stability radius associated with this class which can be expressed in a closed form. Finally, we combine Metzlerian stabilization with maximum stability radius with the aid of bounded real lemma (BRL) and provide a complete solution using LMI. Examples are included for the purpose of illustration.	broadcast delay;linear matrix inequality;linear programming;self-stabilization;stability radius;time complexity	Bahram Shafai;Amirreza Oghbaee;Toshiyuki Tanaka	2014	53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2014.7039683	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	67.69346624843841	0.07805365384495039	93421

The proposed solution relies on modelling the system dynamics by a jump Markov system with a finite set of states, including the abrupt change behaviour. For each discrete state, an observed system is assumed to evolve according to a state-space model. The collaborative strategy ensures the efficiency and the robustness of the data processing, while limiting the required communications bandwith. An efficient Rao-Blackwellised Collaborative Particle Filter (RB-CPF) is proposed to estimate the a posteriori probability of the discrete states of the observed systems. The Rao-Blackwellisation procedure combines a Sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) filter with a bank of distributed Kalman filters. In order to prolong the sensor network lifetime, only few active (leader) nodes are selected according to a spatio-temporal selection protocol. This protocol is based on a trade-off between error propagation, communications constraints and information content complementarity of distributed data. Only sufficient statistics are communicated between leader nodes and their collaborators.	algorithm;coalition for patent fairness;complementarity theory;dynamical system;kalman filter;linear model;markov chain;nonlinear system;particle filter;propagation of uncertainty;recursion;relevance;self-information;software propagation;state space;state-space representation;system dynamics	Hichem Snoussi;Cédric Richard	2007	IJSNet	10.1504/IJSNET.2007.012990	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;particle filter;data processing;computer science;machine learning;distributed computing;statistics	AI	54.50281645524138	3.340460863081288	93465

The estimated packet dropout probability with error bound is considered here due to the observation that the exact one is difficult to obtain in practical systems. The packet dropout process is modeled as a Bernoulli sequence and the quantization is modeled into system uncertainty by the sector bound approach. The filtering error system is then obtained as a stochastic system with both system and probability uncertainties. A filter design procedure is given based on sufficient conditions for the filtering error system to be stochastically stable with an H∞ performance. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	bernoulli polynomials;dropout (neural networks);filter design;network packet;quantization (signal processing);stochastic process	Jing Zhang;Hongbo Song;Chaogeng Huang	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)	10.1109/ICDSP.2015.7251326	control engineering;real-time computing;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	66.30813849610303	1.868363009936387	93511

The key idea of ConvCD is to transform the approximate optimal control problem into a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. Contrary to the majority of existing AOC designs where the problem that is addressed is to provide a control design which approximates the performance of the optimal controller by increasing the “controller complexity,” the proposed approach addresses a different problem: given a controller of “fixed complexity” it provides a control design that renders the controller as close to the optimal as possible and, moreover, the resulted closed-loop system stable.

The time-domain performance specifications provided by eigenstructure assignment and robust performance specifications in the frequency domain considered by H infinity control are combined to realize joint optimal robust control design. A parametric expression for state-feedback eigenstructure assignment is introduced on the basis of a set of free parameters. The mixed performance index used as the cost function consists of two parts: robustness in the frequency domain; and system eigenstructure constraints in the time domain. The analytical gradient calculation of the cost function with respect to the free parameters is derived for optimal robust eigenstructure assignment using gradientbased optimization. The mixed time- and frequency-domain robust eigenstructure assignment is demonstrated in the design of a mode-decoupled roll-yaw autopilot.		Guoping Liu;Guang-Ren Duan;Ronald J. Patton	2000	Int. J.

Instrumental for the development of the theory is the use of parameter estimation-based observers, which combined with the dynamic regressor extension and mixing parameter estimation technique, allow the reconstruction of the magnetic flux. With the knowledge of the latter it is shown that the mechanical coordinates can be estimated with suitably tailored nonlinear observers. Replacing the observed states, in a certainty equivalent manner, with a full information globally stabilising law completes the sensorless controller design. We consider one and two-degrees-of-freedom systems that, interestingly, demand totally different mathematical approaches for their solutions.

In this work an integrated procedure combining conventional decoupling methods and Fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno observers for fault diagnosis in nonlinear systems is proposed. The advantage of the proposed AI based approach is that the design condition for the observers is relaxed in contrast with conventional approaches. Furthermore the potential use of decoupling techniques is reinforced.

Learning of the hierarchical structure and parameters of the suggested control strategy is carried out by using the genetic algorithms. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases: the first one is to search the best hierarchy, and the second to tune the consequent center values of the constituent fuzzy logic systems into the hierarchy. For the least total control rule number, the hierarchical fuzzy controller is chosen to include only the simple two-input/one-output fuzzy systems, and both binary and decimal genes are used for the selection, crossover and mutation of the genetic algorithm. The proposed approach is validated by the computer simulation. Each generation consists of 30 individuals: ten reproduced from its parent generation, ten generated by crossover, and the other ten by mutation. In the simulations, the C-axis is assumed to be driven by a vectorcontrolled AC induction motor, and the dynamic friction model suggested by Canudas de Wit et al. in 1995 is used.	apache axis;bitwise operation;computer simulation;control theory;crossover (genetic algorithm);formal system;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;hard disk drive;machine learning;mechatronics;national supercomputer centre in sweden;nonlinear system;optic axis of a crystal;servo;steady state;systems design	Lih-Chang Lin;Gwo-Yuh Lee	1999	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1023/A:1008035612395	control engineering;genetic algorithm;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;control theory;fuzzy control system	Robotics	60.45257563217468	-9.829129028606292	94458

Without the parameters of the system plant and the nominal controller, the attacker can only use the intercepted input and output data of the nominal system. The injected input attack signals are designed based on the subspace predictive control method, which can deviate the real outputs to the expected attack references in a future time horizon. Meanwhile, by injecting the designed output attack signals for compensation, the attack cannot be detected by the anomaly detector. The simulation results of an irrigation canal system illustrate the effect of the proposed strategy with satisfactory performances.	cyber-physical system	Zhe Li;Guang-Hong yang	2018	J.

Nonovershooting controllers (NOS) are a class of controllers which provide good transient response while tracking without any overshoots. But, NOS controllers developed so far for the descriptor systems are not robust to disturbances. So, to provide robustness against matched disturbances, here an integral sliding mode based non-overshooting controller is proposed. Hence, good transient performance without any overshoot during tracking and robustness can be ensured at the same time.

A novel strategy concept for reliable decision is that Stackelberg game strategy is applied. As a result, the decision makers are able to induce the disturbance as if the disturbance is optimizing the cost function of each decision maker in hierarchical. It is shown that the required strategy set can be obtained by solving cross-coupled algebraic nonlinear matrix equations (CANMEs). In order to obtain a solution set, a numerical algorithm is derived via LMI technique. A simple numerical example is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.	algorithm;linear algebra;linear matrix inequality;loss function;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;stochastic process	Hiroaki Mukaidani	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760135	game theory;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;stochastic partial differential equation;control theory;mathematics;linear system;mathematical economics;differential equation	Robotics	67.86097459266693	3.826132631841391	95448

However the traditional form of load control (shedding) is unpopular due to the resulting consumer disruption. Advances in communications and computer systems allow more selective load control though. Individual loads that are sacrificeable in the short-term can be switched with minimal consumer disruption. The paper considers the use of such non-disruptive load control for improving voltage stability. A control strategy that is based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed. MPC utilizes an internal model to predict system dynamic behaviour over a finite horizon. Control decisions are based on optimizing that predicted response. MPC is a discretetime form of control, so inaccuracies in predicted behaviour are corrected at the next control interval. A standard 10 bus voltage collapse example is used to illustrate this control strategy.	computer;control theory;denial-of-service attack;load management;system dynamics	Ian A.

dfb5952dd0d44f8e4106c2f98f871515d5297fb2	robust component fault diagnostic observer design for underactuated surface vessels using moving horizon optimization		For the consideration of improving the safety and reliability for underactuated surface vessel, the design scheme of a robust component fault detection (FD) is investigated in this paper. The main idea is to formulate the observer design as the  $H_{-}/H_{\infty }$ problem of satisfying the disturbance attenuation and optimizing the fault detectability. The sufficient conditions for performance indexes are derived in the formulation of linear matrix inequality. Considering the remarkable fact that the actual system states are not involved in the iteration process for the parameters optimization, based on the moving horizon optimization strategy, the robust component FD design approach is proposed to achieve the improvements of FD performance and feasibility. The simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	fault detection and isolation;iteration;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;simulation;social inequality;underactuation	Zhilin Liu;Guosheng Li;Lutao Liu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2817257	attenuation;computer science;observer (quantum physics);robustness (computer science);underactuation;linear matrix inequality;actuator;horizon;distributed computing;control theory;fault detection and isolation	EDA	63.62072569059777	-4.95184956461776	95786

When communication disruptions are long, compared to the speed of the control system, we propose to model them as permanent link failures. We show that the complexity of analyzing such failures is NP-hard, and discuss a way to overcome this limitation for practical cases using compositional analysis. For typical packet transmission errors (errors with short time span), we propose a transient error model where links fail for one time slot independently of the past and of other links. We provide sufficient conditions for almost sure stability (stability with probability one) in presence of transient link failures, and give efficient decision procedures. The last part of the paper deals with errors that have random time span. We show that, under some conditions, the permanent failure model can be used as a reliable abstraction.	control system;decision problem;np-hardness;network packet;robustness (computer science);schedule (computer science);sensor;telecommunications network	Gera Weiss;Alessandro D'Innocenzo;Rajeev Alur;Karl Henrik Johansson;George J.

a4480c39dd8e3c43e6dde842e59f0a2d43007dcf	closed loop control of an electromagnetic stirrer in the continuous casting process	technology and engineering	The continuous casting (CC) process is a crucial factor in determining quality of steel slabs, therefore directly affecting the scrap percentage and manufacturing costs. By braking or accelerating the liquid steel in the casting mould with the electromagnetic stirring (EMS) technique, the flow speed can remain in an optimal range in terms of slab quality. The EMS device employed in the CC of ArcelorMittal (AM) Ghent is controlled with an inferential control strategy. Here, the state of the caster is mapped to an assumed flow speed (which is not measured), revealing the need to brake or accelerate. By measuring the flow speed, using a sensor for the drag force, it was revealed that the flow is often too fast and drifts out of the optimal range, even if the machine state does not change. This paper presents the study performed to improve the current operation. A static model relating the electric current in the EMS device to the steel flow speed was derived, as well as a dynamic model. From the static model, a new inferential control strategy was proposed. Additionally, several dynamic closed loop controllers have been tested in simulations. Our study indicates that real plant implementation is feasible.	closed-loop transfer function;control theory;inferential programming;mathematical model;simulation;slab allocation	Kevin Dekemele;Clara M.

406410a6ee7ec3b79b1c609b7553bbc97b3f30b2	adaptive output feedback control of bouc-wen hysteretic systems		The hysteretic behaviour is an essential feature of many technological systems e.g. magnetorheological suspensions, buildings dampers, etc. In these systems, the hysteretic behaviour is conveniently accounted for through the well known Bouc-Wen model. But this involves several unknown parameters as well as internal signals that all are not accessible to measurements. Furthermore, not all parameters come in linearly. All these difficulties make hysteretic system control a challenging problem. Previous solutions have simplified the problem supposing some of the inaccessible internal variables to be measurable or some unknown parameters to be available. In this paper, a high-gain type adaptive output feedback controller is developed which contrasts with the previous solutions. It is shown that the resulting closed-loop control system is shown to be globally stable and the output reference tracking can be made arbitrarily small by choosing conveniently the design parameters.	block cipher mode of operation;feedback;hysteresis	J.

The MRIT2NFS uses type-2 fuzzy sets in order to enhance noise tolerance of the system. In the MRIT2NFS, the antecedent part of each recurrent fuzzy rule is defined using interval type-2 fuzzy sets, and the consequent part is of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang type with interval weights. The antecedent part of MRIT2NFS forms a local internal feedback and interaction loop by feeding the rule firing strength of each rule to others including itself. The consequent is a linear combination of exogenous input variables. The learning of MRIT2NFS starts with an empty rule base and all rules are learned online via structure and parameter learning. The structure learning of MRIT2NFS uses online type-2 fuzzy clustering. For parameter learning, the consequent part parameters are tuned by rule-ordered Kalman filter algorithm to reinforce parameter learning ability. The type-2 fuzzy sets in the antecedent and weights representing the mutual feedback are learned by the gradient descent algorithm. After the training, a weight-elimination scheme eliminates feedback connections that do not have much effect on the network behavior. This method can efficiently remove redundant recurrence and interaction weights. Finally, the MRIT2NFS is used for system identification under both noise-free and noisy environments. For this, we consider both time series prediction and nonlinear plant modeling. Compared with type-1 recurrent fuzzy neural networks, simulation results show that our approach produces smaller root-mean-squared errors using the same number of iterations.	artificial neural network;cluster analysis;cross-validation (statistics);data validation;dynamical system;feedforward neural network;fuzzy clustering;fuzzy control system;fuzzy rule;fuzzy set;gradient descent;iteration;kalman filter;linear algebra;nonlinear system;peterson's algorithm;recurrent neural network;rule-based system;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;system identification;theory;time series;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems	Yang-Yin Lin;Jyh-Yeong Chang;Nikhil R.

In this paper, we introduce a notion of robustness termed input-output dynamical stability for cyber-physical systems (CPS) which merges existing notions of robustness for continuous systems and discrete systems. The notion captures two intuitive aims of robustness: bounded disturbances have bounded effects and the consequences of a sporadic disturbance disappear over time. We present a design methodology for robust CPS which is based on an abstraction and refinement process. We suggest several novel notions of simulation relations to ensure the soundness of the approach. In addition, we show how such simulation relations can be constructed compositionally.

In order to solve this problem, a co-design approach of controller, encoder and decoder is adopted, i.e., an encoder matrix and a decoder matrix are introduced at each end of the controller-actuator channels for taking full advantage of the communication resource. The solvability conditions are firstly derived to design the feedback gain such that the closedloop system is mean-square (MS) stable. Then the regulation equations are deduced for designing the feedforward gain to drive the controlled output following the desired trajectory. Finally, a simulation is performed to implement the design method on cooperative robots, thereby showing the effectiveness of the proposed results.

Different from the existing works, the players in the present game framework are composite of a set of continuous-time players and a set of discrete-time players. Nash equilibrium seeking for such a hybrid game is challenging as some players update their actions in continuous time while the remainders update their actions in discrete time. To accommodate the hybrid games, we firstly consider a case in which the players update their actions according to the hybrid gradient play (i.e., the continuous-time players update their actions according to the continuous-time gradient play with sampled information flow while the discrete-time players update their actions according to the discrete-time gradient play). Then, we consider the case in which the players have restricted access to their opponents' actions. A hybrid consensus-based strategy is proposed for this case. The stability of the Nash equilibrium under the proposed hybrid seeking strategies is theoretically proven by utilizing Lyapunov stability analysis. Lastly, the hybrid seeking strategies are validated through a numerical example.

Uncertainties introduced by stochastic time delays increase the difficulty of modeling, analyzing the stability, and designing the controller. In this paper, a new approach for stability analysis and controller design through expectation modeling is proposed to solve for the uncertainty in wide-area controlled power systems introduced by the effect of a stochastic time delay. In the proposed method, the expectation model that considers the detailed stochastic time delay distribution is derived to accurately model the effect of a communication network on the wide-area control performance. Through a matrix transformation of the expectation model, the eigenvalue of the WADC system that considers time delay can then be calculated; this eigenvalue can be used for analyzing the system stability. A novel expectation model-based controller design procedure is established, through which traditional methods can be applied in the controller design of a power system with a stochastic time delay. Finally, the effectiveness of the stability analysis and controller design methods are validated through simulations in a power system of four generators and two areas with an HVDC link, and a power system with eight generators and 36 buses.	broadcast delay;ibm power systems;simulation;telecommunications network;transformation matrix	Xinran Zhang;Chao Lu;Xiaorong Xie;Zhao Yang Dong	2016	2016 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)	10.1109/TSG.2015.2483563	control engineering;stochastic process;mathematical optimization;electronic engineering;von neumann stability analysis;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;statistics	EDA	64.60004490135182	1.8671259455754936	96866

In order to implement a MPC algorithm, a model of the process we are dealing with is needed. Due to the complex hybrid and nonlinear nature of many industrial processes, obtaining a suitable model is often a difficult task. In this paper a hybrid fuzzy modelling approach with a compact formulation is introduced. The hybrid system hierarchy is explained and the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy formulation for the hybrid fuzzy modelling purposes is presented. An efficient method for identifying the hybrid fuzzy model is also proposed. A MPC algorithm suitable for systems with discrete inputs is treated. The benefits of the MPC algorithm employing the hybrid fuzzy model are verified on a batch-reactor simulation example: a comparison between the proposed modern intelligent (fuzzy) approach and a classic (linear) approach was made. It was established that the MPC algorithm employing the proposed hybrid fuzzy model clearly outperforms the approach where a hybrid linear model is used, which justifies the usability of the hybrid fuzzy model. The hybrid fuzzy formulation introduces a powerful model that can faithfully represent hybrid and nonlinear dynamics of systems met in industrial practice, therefore, this approach demonstrates a significant advantage for MPC resulting in a better control performance.	algorithm;fuzzy logic;hybrid system;linear model;nonlinear system;reachability;reactor (software);simulation;system identification;usability	Gorazd Karer;Gasper Music;Igor Skrjanc;Borut Zupancic	2007	Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems	10.1007/s10846-007-9166-5	control engineering;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;neuro-fuzzy;control theory;fuzzy control system;hybrid system	Robotics	59.64079342490843	-6.8605684542099405	97023

In the 2D-case this results in two control functions acting independently on the system. We study a cooperative and a non-cooperative situation. In the cooperative situation we again obtain a disturbed optimal control problem and get conditions for existence and uniqueness of such a disturbed optimal control problem. If the action of the agents is non-cooperative we assume that it is agreed that they act on an open-loop Nash/worst-case equilibrium strategy. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such an equilibrium are obtained.		Gerhard Jank	2006	Multidim. Syst. Sign.

e339a0e2eda5efa64445208e15c566a05e050eed	fuzzy logic aided fault-tolerant control applied to transport aircraft subject to actuator stuck failures		Failure to counteract in-flight actuator stuck failures within a limited amount of time can result in catastrophic consequences. Aircraft safety is also undermined when fault-tolerant control (FTC) systems are designed based on inaccurate diagnostic results. This paper presents an FTC scheme for transport aircraft subject to actuator stuck failures, which is integrated with fuzzy logic system (FLS), real finite-time sliding mode control (RFTSMC), and least squares control allocation (LSCA) techniques. First, the term, including the stuck information, is obtained by resorting to an FLS. The norm of the weight matrix is adopted in the FLS estimation, such that the amount of the adaptive parameters is independent of the number of FLS rules. Following this, a virtual fuzzy logic aided FTC strategy is developed using RFTSMC, by which the actuator stuck failure is counteracted within finite time. Furthermore, an LSCA unit is capable of distributing the commands to the fault-free actuators, with explicit consideration of incorrectly identified values of actuator effectiveness indicators. Finally, simulation studies of a nonlinear Boeing 747 longitudinal model are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	defective pixel;fault tolerance;free library of springfield township;fuzzy logic;least squares;nonlinear system;simulation	Xiang Yu;Yu Fu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2760860	sliding mode control;mathematics;control theory;fuzzy logic;actuator;fault tolerance;nonlinear system;matrix (mathematics);least squares	Embedded	62.72598386331814	-5.043702162990096	97472

The question has two sides, the first of which focuses on the lack of an external channel in the counterexample. Using existing results, we argue that the core difficulty in the counterexample is retained even in the presence of such a channel. The second side questions the LQG formulation of the counterexample. We consider alternative formulations and show that the understanding developed for the LQG case guides the investigation for these other cases as well. Specifically, we consider 1) a variation on the original counterexample with general, but bounded, noise distributions, and 2) an adversarial extension with bounded disturbance and quadratic costs. For each of these formulations, we show that quantization-based nonlinear strategies outperform linear strategies by an arbitrarily large factor. Further, these nonlinear strategies also perform within a constant factor of the optimal, uniformly over all possible parameter choices (for fixed noise distributions in the Bayesian case). Fortuitously, the assumption of bounded noise results in a significant simplification of proofs as compared to those for the LQG formulation. Therefore, the results in this paper are also of pedagogical interest.	adversary (cryptography);distributed control system;level of detail;nonlinear system;relevance;witsenhausen's counterexample	Pulkit Grover;Anant Sahai	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5718185	linear-quadratic-gaussian control;random variable;entropy;mathematical optimization;discrete mathematics;witsenhausen's counterexample;stochastic control;quantization;information theory;bayesian probability;decentralised system;noise;control theory;mathematics;upper and lower bounds;statistics	Vision	59.936221041207105	1.5166798959583323	97636

To this end, we apply model based control design. A model of the magnetic lévitation system is obtained by means of a closed-loop experiment. Several stable fractional-order controllers are identified and optimized by considering isolated stability regions. Finally, a nonintrusive controller retuning method is used to incorporate fractional-order dynamics into the existing control loop, thereby enhancing its performance. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

This paper presents an intelligent dual-voltage driving control that can simultaneously reduce the response time of the injector and improve the accuracy of the injected fuel quantity. The designed method employs a novel boost dc–dc circuit and does not require an additional independent dc–dc module that includes an inductor switch MOSFET and a controller. During the time interval between two continuous injections, the low-side MOSFET serves as a dc–dc switch, and the software in the controller controls the dual-voltage dc–dc, which uses the injector as a charging inductor of the dc–dc module. The operation principle of this intelligent driving circuit is described. Experimental results show that this method can not only significantly decrease the response time of the injector but also improve the stability of the fuel injection process.	diesel;flexible-fuel vehicle;integrated circuit;response time (technology);switch	Jian Xiong;Hong Gu	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2687038	computer network;fuel injection;control theory;injector;diesel fuel;voltage;embedded system;control engineering;computer science;common rail;response time;inductor	EDA	57.1986213607614	-9.12001605950042	97789

A novel finite-time stability criterion is presented to guarantee that the state of the system does not exceed a prescribed bound during a fixed time interval using the piecewise-like delay method. Then, a corollary is derived for the case without stochastic perturbations. Numerical examples are provided to show the less conservatism and effectiveness of the proposed linear matrix inequality conditions. Finally, the stability results are directly applied to develop the finite-time consensus conditions for the linear multi-agent system with time-varying communication delays.

A new sufficient condition is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for ensuring that the linear output feedback systems with both time-varying elemental and norm-bounded parameter uncertainties are asymptotically stable, where the mixed quadratically-coupled parameter uncertainties are directly considered in the problem formulation. A numerical example is given to show that the presented sufficient condition is less conservative than the existing one reported recently. Then, by integrating the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) and the proposed LMI-based sufficient condition, a new integrative approach is presented to find the output feedback controllers of the linear systems with both time-varying elemental and norm-bounded parameter uncertainties such that the control objective of minimizing a quadratic integral performance criterion subject to the stability robustness constraint is achieved. A design example of the robust-optimal output feedback controller for the AFTI/F-16 aircraft control system with the time-varying elemental parameter uncertainties is given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed new integrative approach.	block cipher mode of operation;control system;control theory;elemental;genetic algorithm;linear matrix inequality;linear system;numerical analysis;optimal design;taguchi methods	Shinn-Horng Chen;Wen-Hsien Ho;Jyh-Horng Chou	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384782	mathematical optimization;robust optimization;genetic algorithm;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	65.94599041008414	-1.5583408520829516	98238

In the proposed AFNN control system, a FNN with accurate approximation capability is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics of the PMLSM, and a robust compensator is proposed to confront the inevitable approximation errors due to finite number of membership functions and disturbances including the friction force. The adaptive learning algorithm that can learn the parameters of the FNN on line is derived using Lyapunov stability theorem. Moreover, to relax the requirement for the value of lumped uncertainty in the robust compensator which comprises a minimum approximation error, optimal parameter vectors, higher-order terms in Taylor series and friction force, an adaptive lumped uncertainty estimation law is investigated. Furthermore, all the control algorithms are implemented in a TMS320C32 DSP-based control computer. The experimental results due to periodic reference trajectories show that the dynamic behaviors of the proposed control systems are robust with regard to uncertainties.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;artificial neural network;control system;lyapunov fractal;neuro-fuzzy;perturbation theory;servo	Faa-Jeng Lin;Po-Hung Shen	2004	IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics, 2004.		robust control;control engineering;electronic engineering;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;friction;control theory	Robotics	64.59779889954656	-9.402706213924583	98380

However, most adaptive control literature focuses on analyzing systems where the uncertainty is represented as a weighted linear combination of fixed number of basis functions, with constant weights. One approach to modeling time variations is to assume time varying ideal weights, and use difference integration to accommodate weight variation. However, this approach reactively suppresses the uncertainty, and has little ability to predict system behavior locally. We present an alternate formulation by leveraging Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian Process adaptive elements. We show that almost surely bounded adaptive controllers for a class of nonlinear time varying system can be formulated by incorporating time as an additional input to the Gaussian kernel. Analysis and simulations show that the learning-enabled local predictive ability of our adaptive controllers significantly improves performance.	adaptive filter;adaptive grammar;algorithm;basis function;control theory;dynamical system;gaussian process;nonlinear system;relevance;simulation	Girish Chowdhary;Hassan A.

The estimator inherits the stability properties of a nonlinear observer and the near-optimal steady-state performance of the linearized Kalman filter for estimation in nonlinear systems. The multiplicative exogenous Kalman filter is derived in detail, and its error dynamics is shown to be globally exponentially stable, which provides guarantees on robustness and transient performance. It is shown in simulations and experiments to yield similar steady-state performance as the multiplicative extended Kalman filter, which is the workhorse for attitude estimation today. The filter assumes biased angular rate measurements and two or more time-varying vector measurements, and it estimates the attitude represented by the quaternion and the angular rate sensor bias.	kalman filter	Bard B.

A general algorithmic form is defined, incorporating a linear time-varying regressor filter and a linear time-varying error filter. Local convergence of the parameters in nonideal (or noisy) environments is shown via averaging theory under suitable assumptions of persistence of excitation, small stepsize, and passivity. The excitation conditions can often be transferred to conditions on external signals, and a small stepsize is appropriate in a wide range of applications. The required passivity is demonstrated for several special cases of the general algorithm.	algorithm	William A. Sethares;Brian D. O. Anderson;C.

An example is given of a nonlinear discrete time dynamic system, given by a dissipative mapping with an observation problem formulated for this system. The observation is assumed to be corrupted by unknown but bounded noise, while the total system is assumed to be observable under the absence of disturbances. The approach to the solution of the observation problem is based on constructing an information set consistent with the system dynamics and the available measurements. The example indicates that this set is disconnected and has a fractal structure. This complicates the application of standard solution schemes to the observation problem.	dynamical system;fractal;nonlinear system;observable;system dynamics	P. V. Prostiakov	2001	Appl. Math.

To unify the study of actuator saturation, passive/nonpassive external forces, asymmetric time-varying delays, and unknown dynamics in the same framework, a novel switched control scheme is developed, where a special switched filter is investigated. In the saturation scenario, the designed controller consists of a generalized controller and a nonlinear saturation function. By placing the nonlinear saturation function on the outside of the generalized controller, and further jointing with the design of switched filter, the designed generalized controller needs not consider the actuator saturation. Specifically, it is designed to be in the form of proportional plus damping injection plus switched filter. Then, the complete closed-loop system is modeled as a special switched system. It is finally established to be state-independent input-to-output stable, where the ultimate boundedness of the tracking error is ensured for any bounded exogenous forces, which is demonstrated by the experimental studies.	memory controller;nonlinear system	Dihua Zhai;Yuanqing Xia	2016	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2016.2583199	damping;robot;control engineering;real-time computing;adaptive control;network switch;computer science;engineering;control theory;actuator	Robotics	68.30685601886162	-2.506150091747593	98924

Those analysis are conducted from the point of view of the stability margins characterization and of the operating mode (either servo or regulation mode) of the control loop and tuning mode of the controller, respectively. It is well known that, specially for optimization based settings, the performance of the control loop is defined in terms of the expected operating mode of the control loop. When the control system is not operating in the same operating mode as the controller was tuned, the performance may exhibit very poor results. The performance degradation with respect to the optimal performance is defined and analyzed for settings based on ISE-like optimization criteria. As a consequence, in order to get a minimal overall performance degradation with respect to both operating modes, tradeoff settings are proposed and the stability margins for the transition between both servo and regulation tunings are obtained.	american and british english spelling differences;bibo stability;control system;degradation (telecommunications);elegant degradation;mathematical optimization;pid;profiling (computer programming);robust control;servo	Orlando Arrieta;Ramon Vilanova	2007	2007 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (EFTA 2007)	10.1109/EFTA.2007.4416817	pid controller;control engineering;real-time computing;controller;stability;engineering;control system;control reconfiguration;automatic control;control theory	Robotics	67.31119188028221	-8.2064436113051	100389

88d05f3e64f91ad353c008dfaefbdf45b93f011e	stochastic mpc approach to drift counteraction		The contribution of this paper is a novel tree-based stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) approach to solve the optimal exit-time control problem for stochastic systems, that is to maximize the expected value of the first time instant at which prescribed constraints are violated. A scenario tree with a specified number of tree nodes is used to encode the most likely system behavior, where each path on the tree corresponds to a distinct disturbance scenario. For linear discrete-time systems with an additive random disturbance, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) obtains solutions arbitrarily close to the optimal solution for a sufficient number of tree nodes. In order to compensate for an incomplete scenario tree and/or unmodeled effects, feedback is provided by recomputing the MILP solution over a receding time horizon based on the current state and disturbance / scenario tree. Two numerical case studies, including an adaptive cruise control problem, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SMPC scheme compared to dynamic programming solutions.	control theory;dijkstra's algorithm;dynamic programming;encode;linear programming;linear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;optimization problem;scheme;stochastic process;tree structure;utility functions on indivisible goods	Robert A.

The adaptive inferential feed-forward control algorithm adopts reduced model to design controller which resolves complexity of the adaptive algorithm when the order of model is unknown or too high. Meanwhile, the regularization technique is used to translate the unknown dynamic process into bounded disturbance and the relative dead zone technique is involved to identify parameters of the system, which guarantees bounded stability of the self-tuning control system. Through combining adaptive control, inferential control feed-forward control and adaptive prediction, the algorithm effectively eliminates the influence of measurable and immeasurable disturbances on the system. Finally, the validity and practicability of this algorithm is substantiates by the simulation result of superheated steam temperature control system.	adaptive algorithm;control system;control theory;feed forward (control);inferential programming;self-tuning;simulation	Junjie Gu;Luanying Zhang;Zhiming Qin	2008	2008 10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision	10.1109/ICARCV.2008.4795690	control engineering;adaptive control;computer science;engineering;control system;machine learning;control theory;feed forward;artificial neural network	Robotics	64.19174688312023	-6.967307130086957	100704

In control design for physical systems, there are chances that malfunction in actuator happens and an exact value of the control input may not be applied. Hence controller gain variations should be considered in the control design. Additionally, many results on the state feedback control design have been given in the literature. However, in the actual situation, the state of the system is rarely measured and the output feedback control design is desired. In this paper, non-fragile guaranteed cost control via output feedback control for uncertain fuzzy systems is considered and a control design of stabilizing controllers with guaranteed cost and robustness against uncertainties of system parameters and control gains is proposed. The robust stability analysis of the closed-loop system and controller design are given in terms of LMI conditions, which are less conservative than the existing results.	block cipher mode of operation;control engineering;control theory;feedback;fuzzy control system;linear matrix inequality	Jun Yoneyama;Kenta Hoshino	2015	2015 10th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244467	robust control;control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;real-time computing;controller;nonlinear control;sliding mode control;adaptive control;networked control system;engineering;control system;control reconfiguration;automatic control;control theory;fuzzy control system	Robotics	65.87338460759531	-2.944769015161965	100728

Most of the available literature on NCSs focuses on only some of these phenomena, while ignoring the others, although recently some papers appeared that consider at least three of these phenomena. In one paper time-varying delays, time-varying transmission intervals and communication constraints are considered, while in an other time-varying transmission intervals, communication constraints and quantization effects are studied. As both approaches are based on the same underlying hybrid modeling framework, it will be shown here that the models can be combined in a unifying hybrid model including the five mentioned network phenomena under some restrictions. On the basis of this model, stability will be analyzed of the closed-loop system in which the controller is obtained using an emulation approach. The analysis provides tradeoffs between the maximally allowable transmission interval (MATI), the maximally allowable delay (MAD) and the quantization parameters, while still guaranteeing closed-loop stability.

In this paper, a new optimal nonlinear stochastic controller is presented based on a bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) method to decrease the number of infected cells in presence of stochastic parameters of HIV dynamic. Bacterial foraging optimization sigmoid nonlinear control (BFO-SNC) is a novel nonlinear robust optimal method that can control the biological characteristics of nonlinear stochastic HIV dynamic by drug dosage management. The BFOA should optimize this kind of controller included three parameters. The proposed control method searches the best controller parameters domain subject to minimize a stochastic expected value of cost function. Simulation results show that the proposed BFO-SNC scheme does improve the treatment performance in compare to other control methods.

Therefore, in a typical industrial HVAC plant the following actuators are available: A cooling coil is used to decrease the air temperature and relative humidity by cooling below the dew point temperature. A steam humidifier is installed to increase the air humidity whereas the air temperature is influenced via a heating coil. Additionally, air temperature and humidity are affected by disturbances acting on the system. These disturbances include outer air temperature and humidity as well as the temperatures of hot water and cool water supply. Consequently, in the setup at hand, a plant with three manipulated inputs, four measurable disturbances and two controlled outputs has to be considered. A predictive control scheme based on a discrete time plant model is presented. The proposed controller computes the manipulated variables by solving an optimization problem at each time step. Simulation and measurement results obtained from an industrial HVAC system are shown.

9d7fb161d4d1ebd79c177f1fab328eed3a7b05c3	passivity-based asynchronous sliding mode control for delayed singular markovian jump systems		This paper is concerned with the problem of passivity-based asynchronous sliding mode control for a class of uncertain singular Markovian jump systems with time delay and nonlinear perturbations. The asynchronous control strategy is employed due to the nonsynchronization between the controller and the system modes. Considering the singularity of the system, a novel integral-type sliding surface is constructed, and then the asynchronous sliding controller is synthesized to ensure that the sliding mode dynamics satisfy the reaching condition. Sufficient conditions are presented such that the corresponding sliding mode dynamics are admissible and robustly passive.

86ab12e5e6c6630bc728d0fc90c1cbdc98568fdd	event-triggered faults tolerant control for stochastic systems with time delays		This paper is concerned with the state-feedback controller design for stochastic networked control systems (NCSs) with random actuator failures and transmission delays. Firstly, an event-triggered scheme is introduced to optimize the performance of the stochastic NCSs. Secondly, stochastic NCSs under event-triggered scheme are modeled as stochastic time-delay systems. Thirdly, some less conservative delay-dependent stability criteria in terms of linearmatrix inequalities for the codesign of both the controller gain and the trigger parameters are obtained by using delay-decomposition technique and convex combination approach. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the less sampled data transmission and less conservatism of the proposed theory.

Bernoulli process is adopted to describe the randomly varying nonlinearities, and the norm-bounded uncertain model is used to deal with the sensor failures. Then, a set of sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee that the estimation error system is stochastically stable with the prescribed l2−l∞ property. Then, using the linear matrix inequality method, the estimator gains are obtained.

Although many kinds of stability conditions for fuzzy systems with discrete delays have already been obtained, almost no stability condition for fuzzy systems with distributed delays has appeared in the literature. This is also true in case of the robust stability for uncertain fuzzy systems with distributed delays. Here we employ a generalized Lyapunov functional to obtain delay-dependent stability conditions of fuzzy systems with discrete and distributed delays. We introduce some free weighting matrices to such a Lyapunov functional in order to reduce the conservatism in stability conditions. These techniques lead to generalized and less conservative stability conditions. We also consider the robust stability of fuzzy time-delay systems with uncertain parameters. Applying the same techniques made on the stability conditions, we obtain delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the robust stability of uncertain fuzzy systems with discrete and distributed delays. Moreover, we consider the state feedback stabilization. Based on stability and robust stability conditions, we obtain conditions for the state feedback controller to stabilize the fuzzy time-delay systems. Finally, we give two examples to illustrate our results. Delay-dependent stability conditions obtained here are shown to guarantee a wide stability region.	fuzzy control system	Jun Yoneyama	2008	Inf.

The mode signal, which characterizes the switching between subsystems, is modeled as a Markov chain. We propose a feedback control law that depends only on the uniformly sampled mode information rather than the actual mode signal. We analyze the probabilistic dynamics of the sampled mode information, and develop a form of strong law of large numbers to show the almost sure asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system under the proposed control law.

In this paper, the design of event-sampled adaptive neural network (NN) state feedback control of robot manipulators is presented in the presence of uncertain robot dynamics. The event-sampled NN approximation property is utilized to represent the uncertain nonlinear dynamics of the robotic manipulator which is subsequently employed to generate the control torque. A novel weight tuning rule is designed using the Lyapunov method. Further, the Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to develop the event-sampling condition and to demonstrate the tracking performance of the robot manipulator. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the theoretical claims and to demonstrate the reduction in the computations with event-sampled control execution.	algorithmic inference;approximation;artificial neural network;computation;feedback;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;robot;sampling (signal processing);simulation;weight function	Vignesh Narayanan;Sarangapani Jagannathan	2016	2016 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727850	real-time computing;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.33363606932444	-7.083433994819197	102272

We suggest a sequential quadratic programming approach, solving at each sample a convex quadratic program approximating the nonlinear program. The method is illustrated by simulated maneuvers for a marine vessel equipped with azimuth thrusters. The example indicates reduced power consumption and increased maneuverability as a consequence of the singularity-avoidance.	approximation algorithm;list of numerical analysis software;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical partial differential equations;optimization problem;real-time clock;sequential quadratic programming;simulation;singularity project;technological singularity	Tor Arne Johansen;Thor I.

Currently, the existing SoC estimation methods can accurately estimate the SoC in a certain operation condition, but in uncertain operating environments, such as unforeseen road conditions and aging related effects, they may be unreliable or even divergent. This is due to the fact that the characteristics of lithium-ion batteries vary under different operation conditions and the adoption of constant parameters in battery model, which are identified offline, will affect the SoC estimation accuracy. In this paper, the joint SoC estimation method is proposed, where battery model parameters are estimated online using the H-infinity filter, while the SoC are estimated using the unscented Kalman filter. Then, the proposed method is compared with the SoC estimation methods with constant battery model parameters under different dynamic load profiles and operation temperatures. It shows that the proposed joint SoC estimation method possesses high accuracy, fast convergence, excellent robustness and adaptability.	kalman filter;online and offline;state of charge	Quanqing Yu;Rui Xiong;Cheng Lin;Weixiang Shen;Junjun Deng	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2709326	robustness (computer science);electronic engineering;adaptability;battery (electricity);computer science;state of charge;kalman filter;h-infinity methods in control theory;estimation theory;control engineering;lithium-ion battery;control theory	Visualization	55.08485498051593	-1.7761773813758805	102413

In a fuzzy dynamic system, a fuzzy relational matrix will be introduced as a counterpart of a differential equation in conventional control theory. Then, as an application of the concepts of fuzzy inverse problems, a new approach to the design of a fuzzy controller for a given dynamic system will also be discussed. A mathematical description of a fuzzy dynamic system will be developed; a systematic method to derive a fuzzy controller strategy from an underlying fuzzy system model will also be established. The theoretical development presented here enables the suboptimal control of the fuzzy system. The analysis proposed here may not be exhaustive but it does provide some insight into the basic operations and properties of fuzzy dynamic systems. As an illustrative example, a fuzzy controller problem with a unit delay will be discussed in detail and the simulation results will be presented.	control theory;dynamical system;fuzzy control system;mathematical model;simulation	Masaki Togai;Paul P.

The present local iterative ADP algorithm permits an arbitrary positive semidefinite function to initialize the algorithm. Employing a state-dependent learning rate function, for the first time, the iterative value function and iterative control law can be updated in a subset of the state space instead of the whole state space, which effectively relaxes the computational burden. A new analysis method for the convergence property is developed to prove that the iterative value functions will converge to the optimum under some mild constraints. Monotonicity of the local value iteration ADP algorithm is presented, which shows that under some special conditions of the initial value function and the learning rate function, the iterative value function can monotonically converge to the optimum. Finally, three simulation examples and comparisons are given to illustrate the performance of the developed algorithm.	algorithm;bellman equation;computation;converge;dynamic programming;iteration;markov decision process;nonlinear system;optimal control;simulation;state space;usb on-the-go	Qinglai Wei;Frank L.

A separate consideration is given to the case where an extremal fuzzy control process acting on an extremal fuzzy dynamic system (EFDS) (i) depends and (ii) does not depend on an EFDS state. Sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of an optimal control are proved. Applying Bellman's optimality principle and assuming that the gain–loss process exists for an EFDS, a variant of the fuzzy integral representation of an optimal control is given for continuous EFDSs. This variant employs the instrument of extended extremal fuzzy composition measures constructed in parts I and II of this work. Finally, the questions of defining a fuzzy gain relation for an EFDS are considered, taking into account the available expert knowledge on the EFDS subject matter.	dynamical system	Gia Sirbiladze	2006	Int.

This model has a variety of potential applications in the areas of pattern recognition, communication and industrial economics, etc. Its optimal solution is obtained using dynamic programming and the associated HJB equation approach. For the reason of high dimensionality, nearly optimal averaging approach is necessary to achieve consistent solutions to Riccati equations. Here the assumption is that two types of states are available exclusively which are slowly varying and rapidly varying, respectively. In another aspect, this topic is also related to hybrid control issue that indicates continuous attribute inside each rapidly varying group and discrete event attribute upon all transitions among individual slowing varying groups. In fact, real world problems are typically ambiguous and there is not a unique criterion between terms of slow and rapid (such as extremely slow, slightly slow, slightly rapid and extremely rapid). In this case, fuzzy logic has been introduced to formulate a design problem of fuzzy stochastic nearly optimal control. Procedures of fuzzy nearly optimal controller construction have been derived and a simplified case of numerical simulations has been provided as well. This article is the first formulation of fuzzy stochastic nearly optimal control in the literature.	algebraic riccati equation;ambiguous grammar;bellman equation;categorization;computer simulation;dynamic programming;fuzzy logic;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;markov chain;modulation;numerical analysis;optimal control;pattern recognition;simulation;state (computer science);symbolic computation	Zhengmao Ye;Yongmao Ye;Habib Mohamadian	2006	2006 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZY.2006.1681949	computer simulation;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;mathematical optimization;computer science;fuzzy number;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy control system	Robotics	59.82699240446617	2.306592769641353	103358

The system parameters used in the engine fuel system model are engine speed, temperature, and load. These system parameters can be measured in real time through physical or virtual sensors. A gain-scheduling controller for the obtained LPV system is then designed based on the numerically efficient convex optimization or linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation is performed to validate the gain-scheduling controller on a mixed mean-value and crank-based engine model.

The proposed controller is composed of a decoupling controller and a disturbance term observer. When designing the controller, a new tracking performance index is first defined, which reflects the desired modes of tracking errors of the closed-loop system. Based on this index, a decoupling controller with a disturbance term is derived. A disturbance term observer is then designed to estimate the disturbance term. In this research, Stability is proved for the closed loop system and it is shown that the speed and shape of response of the closed loop tracking error can be conveniently regulated with only two parameters; furthermore the closed loop system has strong disturbance rejection property. Good performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated by controlling a three-link nonlinear robot manipulator.	closed-loop transfer function;controller (computing);coupling (computer programming);nonlinear system;overshoot (signal);rejection sampling;requirement;the matrix	Yicheng Liu;Tao Zhang;Jingyan Song;Bin Liu	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)	10.1109/ROBIO.2007.4522343	control engineering;open-loop controller;process performance index;simulation;stability;engineering;control theory;tracking error;mode;second-order logic;statistics	Robotics	66.37529053595952	-8.086007749008136	103638
25c90648f41f14969e42c6fc2255790465395099	on the design of the diso controllers for a neuro-fuzzy vector control. the training data processing and some results		After some good previous results with neuro-fuzzy controllers SISO type for the speed or for the current loops in a vector control system, now the design is orientated to the DISO units. Also, the coexistence of both controllers type as neuro-fuzzy units are considered: the speed controller with a slow bias and the current with a high commutation rate for driving directly the inverter. The aim is also to provide a performing and integral intelligent-based solution for applications were the mechanical shock must be controlled (such as trams-trains, personal elevators). The design of such controllers is focused on three aspects: the conditions of a good data acquisition for training by simulation of a well tuned standard system, the data pre-processing for the training of the neural networks and the tuning of the synthesized controllers. The ANFIS methods is used for generating Sugeno fuzzy controllers. Different design details and tuning procedures are taken into account.

It is a direct method that aims at minimizing a control cost of the 2-norm type by using a batch of data collected from the plant. The minimisation is conducted in one-shot (the method is not iterative) and this makes VRFT particularly handy in many practical applications. This paper presents an application of VRFT to a benchmark active suspension system. As a by-product, this paper also delivers a new extension of VRFT that permits to cope with constraints on the input-sensitivity.	benchmark (computing)	Marco C.

7291c5b285c01f2c1774466fddb202d3e7921a8e	application of lqg combined with mras-based lffc to electromechanical motion systems		Abstract In this paper we introduce a new control structure which consists of a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller and a Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS)-based Learning Feed-Forward Controller (LFFC) to Electromechanical Motion Systems. Feed-forward is used in addition to LQG because LQG is still required to account for imperfections in the feed-forward system model. By adding a Learning Feed-Forward (LFF) component to the LQG controller, an extra degree of freedom in the controller design is created. The advantages of the proposed method are verified by simulation and experimental results. A control scheme is derived which has good properties in common with both the LQG and LFFC controller. This control structure can capture many aspects of the control problems. The responses to setpoint changes and reproducible disturbances are mainly obtained by the LFFC. The LQG is designed to obtain a stable closed-loop system that is insensitive to measurement noise and variations and uncertainties in process behavior.

f0ec3214e8b87357e0af53c3c31d5ddd09378bc2	switched mrac with improved performance using semi-initial excitation		This work generalizes the recently developed initial excitation (IE) based adaptive control by introducing the notion of semi-initial excitation (semi-IE), a still relaxed version of IE. Typically, classical adaptive controllers guarantee Lyapunov stability of the overall error dynamics (tracking error + parameter estimation error) and asymptotic convergence of tracking error to zero, while requiring a restrictive condition of persistence of excitation (PE) for parameter convergence. The authors' recent work on a new adaptive control architecture based on the milder IE condition guarantees parameter convergence while ensuring exponential stability of the overall error dynamics once the online verifiable IE condition is satisfied. The current work further relaxes the excitation condition by proposing the concept of semi-IE. The proposed adaptive controller is proved to guarantee convergence of the parameter estimation error to a lower dimensional manifold under the weaker semi-IE condition, while the stronger condition of IE guarantees convergence of the parameter estimation error to zero. The designed adaptive algorithm has been shown to significantly improve the transient response of tracking error as compared to the conventional approaches.	adaptive algorithm;estimation theory;formal verification;heuristic;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;persistence (computer science);semiconductor industry;simulation;time complexity	Sayan Basu Roy;Shubhendu Bhasin	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8431588	adaptive algorithm;control theory;control theory;computer science;lyapunov stability;architecture;adaptive control;tracking error;estimation theory;exponential stability	Robotics	66.57022158720997	-3.6978801362629206	104270

First, via system transformation, the optimal tracking problem is converted into designing an optimal regulator for the tracking error dynamics. And then, with convergence analysis in terms of value function and control policy, the iterative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is introduced to obtain the infinite-horizon optimal tracking controller which makes the value function close to its optimal value function. Next, two neural networks are used as parametric structures to implement the ADP algorithm, which aim at approximating the value function and the control policy, respectively. Finally, a simulation example is included to complement the theoretical discussions.	approximation algorithm;bellman equation;dynamic programming;iterative method;neural networks;nonlinear system;optimization problem;simulation;usb on-the-go	Chunbin Qin;Huaguang Zhang;Yanhong Luo	2012	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-012-1238-1	mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory	AI	62.34666578111926	-2.0965979796682515	104311

Periodic disturbances can be adequately attenuated using the concept of repetitive control, when provided with the known period. Optical disk drivers support various speeds. So optical disk drivers have a varying periodic disturbance. To deal with time varying periodic disturbances, a proposed repetitive controller is turned based on repetitive control to change the sampling frequency to follow the change of reference period. The proposed adaptive repetitive control consists of two portions, the repetitive controller and the frequency multiplier, where the former uses a varying sampler operating at a variable sampling rate maintained at fixed multiple times of the disturbance frequency and the latter generates a vary sampling frequency based on the disturbance frequency. An adaptive repetitive control scheme is proposed, implemented on an experimental set of an optical disk driver. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods and the improvement of the random access time.

Unlike Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) models that assume a fixed support for all time instances, we allow the support to vary temporally following a finite state Markov chain. Instead of using l1 minimization based algorithms, we cast the problem of dynamic support recovery as a multiple-hypothesis testing problem and analyze its performance. We derive an upper bound on the probability of error for the optimal decision rule which explicitly highlights the role of the time-varying priors associated with the Markov Chain. The results are valid for any transition probability matrix and choice of initial priors, and can also be used to study the MMV model as a special case.	algorithm;chernoff bound;converge;markov chain;multiuse model view;restricted isometry property;sparse matrix;stochastic matrix	Heng Qiao;Piya Pal	2017	2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)	10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227674	mathematical optimization;multiple comparisons problem;underdetermined system;prior probability;optimal decision;computer science;markov process;stochastic matrix;special case;markov chain	ML	54.5698116537669	2.3556394497257545	104389

The backbone of the proposed decentralized methodology is the design of a local sensor fault diagnosis agent dedicated to each interconnected subsystem, without the need to communicate with neighboring agents. Each local sensor fault diagnosis agent is responsible for detecting and isolating multiple faults in the local set of sensors. The local sensor fault diagnosis agent consists of a bank of modules that monitor smaller groups of sensors in the corresponding local sensor set. The detection of faults in each of the sensor groups is conducted using robust analytical redundancy relations, formulated by structured residuals and adaptive thresholds. The multiple sensor fault isolation in each local sensor fault diagnosis agent is realized by aggregating the decisions of the modules and applying a diagnostic reasoning-based decision logic. The performance of the proposed diagnostic scheme is analyzed with respect to sensor fault detectability and multiple sensor fault isolability. A simulation example of two interconnected robot manipulators is used to illustrate the application of the multiple sensor fault detection and isolation methodology.	emoticon;farkas' lemma;fault detection and isolation;internet backbone;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;network packet;nonlinear system;sensor;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;surround sound	Vasso Reppa;Marios M.

The underlying correction term depends on the output observation error and is updated in a mixed continuous-discrete fashion. The proposed observer is first introduced under a set of differential equations with instantaneous state impulses corresponding to the measured samples and their estimates. Two features of the proposed observer are worth to be pointed out. The first one consists in the simplicity of its calibration while the second one lies in its comprehensive convergence analysis. More specifically, it is shown that in the case of noise-free sampled outputs, the observation error lies in a ball centered at the origin and its radius is proportional to the bounds of the uncertainties and the sampling partition diameter. Moreover, in the free uncertainties case, the exponential convergence to zero of the observation error is established under a well-defined condition on themaximum value of the sampling partition diameter. The ability of the proposed observer to perform a suitable estimation of the reactions rates in biochemical reactors is highlighted through a simulation study dealing with an ethanolic fermentation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A set of event-based state estimators is constructed so as to reduce unnecessary data transmissions in the communication channel. Compared with the traditional state estimator whose measurement signal is received under a periodic clock-driven rule, the event-based estimator only updates the measurement information from the sensors when the prespecified “event” is violated. Attention is focused on the analysis and design problem of the event-based estimators for the addressed discrete-time complex networks such that the estimation error is exponentially bounded in mean square. A combination of the stochastic analysis approach and Lyapunov theory is employed to obtain sufficient conditions for ensuring the existence of the desired estimators and the upper bound of the estimation error is also derived. By using the convex optimization technique, the gain parameters of the desired estimators are provided in an explicit form. Finally, a simulation example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation strategy.	channel (communications);communications media;complex network;convex optimization;estimation theory;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;nonlinear system;optimization problem;partial;simulation;exponential;sensor (device)	Licheng Wang;Zidong Wang;Tingwen Huang;Guoliang Wei	2016	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2015.2478860	nickel;econometrics;mathematical optimization;text mining;estimator;computer science;noise;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;control theory;silicon;complex network;statistics	ML	66.16609350531922	1.8674151243287413	104731

485386f19f1058a553c658899ca8bbbccbfd9262	adaptive control for nonaffine nonlinear systems using reliable neural network approximation		This paper presents a once-differentiable control strategy for a class of uncertain nonaffine nonlinear systems based on self-structuring neural networks (SSNNs) approximation, such that the system output tracks the desired trajectory. The optimal weight for each neuron in current SSNN is time-varying signals factually, and current stability analysis is only fit for a dwell time. Current SSNN control laws are not smooth and even not continuous, due to addition or pruning of neurons in the approximation procedure. In this paper, a new SSNN estimator and a new weight update law are proposed to ensure the optimal SSNN weights being constant values and the control law being once-differentiable. The effectiveness of the proposed control law is illustrated by the stability analysis in the whole tracking procedure and shown by the simulation results.	approximation;artificial neural network;control theory;neuron;nonlinear system;optimal control;simulation	Tairen Sun;Yongping Pan	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2763628	estimator;artificial neural network;nonlinear system;computer science;adaptive control;trajectory;mathematical optimization;control theory;control system	Robotics	64.56561629174836	-6.815662530907969	105227

For such systems, we assume that the model is not known exactly. More precisely, the entries of the matrix representing the system structure may be affine functions of some uncertain time-varying parameters that take values within assigned bounds. We give stabilizability conditions that can be checked, in principle, by solving a min-max problem on the surface of the state-space (buffer level space) unit ball. Then, we consider a special case in which each uncertain parameter affects a single column of the system matrix and is independent of all the other ones. In this case, we propose a mixed integer linear programming algorithm to check the stabilizability conditions and we provide a stabilizing control in an explicit form.

This observer-based fault-tolerant control is obtained by means of a generalized observability canonical form multi-input multi-output. The dynamical controller is capable of linearizing the tracking errors, achieving asymptotic stability. To accomplish this, a fault diagnosis is required for systems with additive or multiplicative faults. These faults are reconstructed online and simultaneously. To illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested approach a real-time application is presented.	fault tolerance;game controller;real-time clock;real-time computing;utility functions on indivisible goods	Iván Trejo-Zúñiga;Fidel Meléndez-Vázquez;Rafael Martínez-Guerra	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526865	control engineering;electronic engineering;observability;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.52559066515737	-4.996753017917731	105501

In this framework, a decision-maker selects points in a convex feasible set to respond to a dynamically changing sequence of convex cost functions. A generic algorithm for OCP, often with provably optimal performance guarantees, is inspired by the Method of Mirror Descent (MD) developed by Nemirovski and Yudin in the 1970's. This paper highlights OCP as a common theme in adaptive control, both in its classical variant based on parameter tuning and in a more modern supervisory approach. Specifically, we show that: (1) MD leads to a generalization of classical adaptive control schemes based on recursive parameter tuning; (2) A supervisory controller switching policy that uses OCP to estimate system parameters from a sequence of appropriately regularized output prediction errors can flexibly adapt to presence or absence of output disturbances in the system.	algorithm;concordance (publishing);convex optimization;descent;feasible region;generic programming;gradient;hysteresis;interior point method;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;matrix regularization;molecular dynamics;norm (social);open core protocol;recursion;whole earth 'lectronic link	Maxim Raginsky;Alexander Rakhlin;Serdar Yüksel	2010	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2010.5717262	control engineering;programming;decision-making;mathematical optimization;delta modulation;genetic algorithm;adaptive control;network switch;computer science;mean squared prediction error;control theory;mathematics	ML	61.96812878683139	-1.7296831525118805	105514

Two illustrative examples are provided aiming a proof of concept. The proposed controller can start with no pre-defined fuzzy rules, and does not need to pre-define the range of the output or control variables. This SPARC learns autonomously from its own actions while performing the control of the plant. It does not use any parameters, explicit membership functions, any off-line pre-training nor the explicit model (e.g. in a form of differential equations) of the plant. It combines the relative older concept of indirect adaptive control with the newer concepts of (self-)evolving fuzzy rule-based systems (and controllers, in particular) and with the very recent concept of parameter-free, data cloud and data density based fuzzy rule based systems (and controllers in particular). It has been demonstrated that a fully autonomously and in an unsupervised manner (based only on the data density and selecting representative prototypes/focal points from the control hyper-surface acting as a data space) it is possible generate a parameter-free control structure and evolve it in on-line mode. Moreover, the results demonstrate that this autonomous controller is effective (has comparative error and performance characteristics) to other known controllers, including self-learning ones, but surpasses them with its flexibility and extremely lean structure (small number of prototypes/focal points which serve as seeds to form parameter-free and membership function-free fuzzy rules based on them). The illustrative examples aim primarily proof of concept.	areal density (computer storage);autonomous robot;cloud computing;control flow;dataspaces;focal (programming language);fuzzy rule;logic programming;online and offline;rule-based system;sparc;tag cloud;unsupervised learning	Pouria Sadeghi-Tehran;Ana Belén Cara;Plamen P.

Sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the error system is stochastically stable and has a guaranteed H ∞ attenuation level. Furthermore, an explicit expression of the desired filter is also given.

4361bf0782d52020ad0d694a50bbecd2989ec855	selection of decoupling control methods suited for automated design for uncertain tito processes		This paper evaluates different decoupling control methods for uncertain TITO processes with respect to automated design: Static and Dynamic Simplified Decoupling Control, Centralized Inverted Decoupling Control and Centralized PID Control by Decoupling. Each decoupling control method requires different approximation steps. High approximation accuracies are crucial for the control performance but cannot be achieved for every combination of decoupling control method and system specific characteristics. Thus, the goal of this paper is to support the selection of the most appropriate decoupling control method. For this purpose new quantitative criteria are developed. They allow selecting the method directly based on the most relevant system characteristics. A good selection allows an automated and repeatable design procedure and good control performances for uncertain, time variant and nonlinear systems. The applicability and the best selection of the decoupling control method is illustrated for three examples and results are compared to decentralized PI control. For practical reasons, all evaluations are restricted to Two-input Two-output systems whose transfer functions can be approximated with First-order time delay elements.	approximation algorithm;broadcast delay;centralized computing;coupling (computer programming);first-order predicate;nonlinear system;pid;performance;requirement;transfer function	Michael Noeding;Julius Martensen;Nicholas Lemke;Wilhelm Tegethoff;Juergen Koehler	2018	2018 IEEE 14th International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2018.8444216	control engineering;decoupling (cosmology);pid controller;pi;automatic control;transfer function;engineering;control theory;nonlinear system;linear system	Robotics	63.52789117967807	-6.473828723396127	106153

The objective is to compensate for the identified actuator faults that are subject to uncertainties and detection time delays, in the attitude control subsystems of formation flying satellites. The proposed distributed fault recovery scheme is developed through a two-level hierarchical framework. In the first level, or the agent level, the fault is recovered locally to maintain as much as possible the design specifications, feasibility, and tracking performance of all the agents. In the second level, or the formation level, the recovery is carried out by enhancing the entire team performance. The fault recovery performance of our proposed distributed (semi-decentralised) scheme is compared with two other alternative schemes, namely the centralised and the decentralised fault rec...		N. R.

These links may be subject to intermittent or persistent failure. In particular, we assume that the availability of the communication links over time can be modeled by a Markov chain. For the control design, it is shown in a first step that the combination of the LTI system dynamics and the stochastic model of the time-varying communication topology is a special case of Jump Markov Linear Systems (JMLS). Next, constraints on the information structure are introduced, restricting the subsystems' local knowledge about the global network state. This assumes that each subsystem can only detect the availability of incoming communication links. Finally, the synthesis of a stabilizing distributed feedback control law respecting the given information structure and a guaranteed bound on the expected ℋ∞-performance is formulated and solved as a semidefinite program.	block cipher mode of operation;control flow;distributed control system;feedback;global network;linear system;linear time-invariant theory;markov chain;mega man network transmission;network packet;network switch;network topology;optimal control;semidefinite programming;system dynamics	Martin Jilg;Jens Tonne;Olaf Stursberg	2015	2015 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2015.7171879	control engineering;decentralised system;computer science;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing;markov process;network topology	Robotics	65.07036727795362	2.423275753091767	106345

However, in practice, most multi-agent systems are complicated nonlinear system subjected to disturbances. In this paper, the coordinated tracking problem for nonlinear undirected multi-agent systems with exogenous disturbances is studied in the framework of consensus theory. The exogenous disturbances generated by both linear exosystems and nonlinear exosystems are considered. Disturbance observers are developed to estimate the disturbances generated by the linear exogenous systems. The Lyapunov stability theorem is used to prove the asymptotical consensus of the systems. The dynamic gain technique is used to construct the disturbance observer for the disturbance generated by a nonlinear exosystem. Based on the adaptive disturbance observer, a consensus protocol is proposed for the nonlinear multi-agent system. Finally, the proposed design approaches are verified though simulation examples.	asymptote;consensus (computer science);first-order predicate;graph (discrete mathematics);lyapunov fractal;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;simulation	Xiaozhi Yu;Zhen He;Feng Yu	2015	2015 12th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO)		control engineering;simulation;consensus;computer science;artificial intelligence;multi-agent system;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.61670785205546	3.7849414520110365	106501

The initial state of the system is drawn from a known Gaussian distribution, and the final state distribution is required to reach a given target Gaussian distribution, while minimizing the expected value of the control effort. We derive the linear optimal control policy by first presenting an efficient solution for the diffusion-less case, and we then solve the case with diffusion by reformulating the system as a superposition of diffusion-less systems. We show that the resulting solution coincides with a LQG problem with particular terminal cost weight matrix.	algorithm;bellman equation;control theory;linear system;loss function;nonlinear system;observable;optimal control;stochastic process;time complexity	Maxim Goldshtein;Panagiotis Tsiotras	2017	2017 IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2017.8264189	matérn covariance function;control theory;computer science;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;mathematical optimization;estimation of covariance matrices;rational quadratic covariance function;cma-es;covariance;optimal control;covariance function	Robotics	60.142267100408056	1.4144018704884525	106597

Not only multiple state/input delays but also the parametric uncertainty are considered simultaneously in this paper. First, the fuzzy output regulator is proposed by introducing a memoryless fuzzy observer and a fuzzy integral compensator. Next, the asymptotic output regulation is achieved based on solving a linear matrix inequality problem (LMIP). Note that the information of partial states, each time-varying delay, and the desired operational point are not required in the design. Moreover, an Hinfin performance criterion is guaranteed for disturbance attenuation.

The present paper proposes a method for the synthesis of the learning fuzzy controllers where an expert knowledge about a process is applied to form a learning mechanism that is used to acquire information for the knowledge base of the main fuzzy controller. According to the proposed method an expert knowledge is used to describe how the controller should learn to control rather than to control the process. The results of experiments on heating system and level/pressure system prove the practical relevance of the design strategy of a learning fuzzy controller.	disk controller;experiment;fuzzy concept;fuzzy control system;knowledge base;nonlinear system;relevance	Vytautas Kaminskas;Raimundas Liutkevicius	2005	Informatica, Lith.

Using a constrained polynomial interpolation technique, an input signal is computed that satisfies the desired time-domain constraints on the input and state-trajectories. The computed input is constructed by nonlinear combinations of the states, such that a nonlinear state feedback law is obtained. Stability of the resulting closed-loop polynomial system is analyzed using sum-of-squares techniques. An illustrative example is presented, showing that the proposed nonlinear controller outperforms its linear counterpart. To validate the proposed method, experiments on a fourth-order motion system have been carried out.	computation;control theory;experiment;fall time;feedback;linear system;motion system;nonlinear system;overshoot (signal);polynomial interpolation;smt placement equipment;settling time;system of polynomial equations	Wouter H.

The considered networked control systems are modeled as parameter uncertain systems with stochastic packet dropout meeting Bernoulli distribution. Sufficient conditions for the asymptotical stability of the residual systems with H∞ performance are presented in terms of Lyapunov functional approach in delta domain. The parameters of the designed filter which can guarantee the robustness of residual systems to the unknown disturbances are obtained by linear matrix inequalities.

When specifications are discrete, this problem can be solved by first approximating the continuous plant model by a (nondeterministic) automaton, and then synthesizing discrete (supervisory) control for the automaton. A necessary condition is that the approximation behaviour contains the behaviour of the underlying continuous plant model. Then, any controller forcing the approximation to obey the specifications will also force the continuous model to satisfy the specifications. We use a version of this approach which allows adjustment of approximation accuracy to address two simple process control problems: supervisory control of a three-tank laboratory experiment and safety enforcement for an evaporator. In both cases, the entire design process is carried through: we first determine a suitable abstraction, compute the minimally restrictive supervisor, and then present examples for closed loop trajectories.	approximation;automata theory;automaton;closed-loop transfer function;control system;discrete manufacturing;feedback;nondeterministic algorithm;systems theory	Jörg Raisch;Eberhard Klein;Siu O'Young;Christian Meder;Alexander Itigin	1997		10.1007/3-540-49163-5_16	control system;continuous automaton;process control;control theory;automaton;algorithm	Logic	59.32989895758374	-1.5002536737472156	106960

A nonlinear stochastic dynamic model with time delays is proposed for describing a coupled nonlinear network under time delays, intrinsic parameter fluctuations, and extrinsic disturbances. We propose a robust synchronization criterion for attenuating these intrinsic parameter fluctuations and compensating process delays to achieve robust synchronization of nonlinear stochastic coupled networks from the nonlinear stochastic stability perspective. Furthermore, in order to avoid solving the complicated Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities (HJI) for the robust synchronization behavior, based on Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy time-delay model and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) technique, a systematic synchronization is proposed. Finally, a simulation example of coupled Brusselator systems is provided to illustrate our main results.	approximation algorithm;approximation error;broadcast delay;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;jacobi method;linear matrix inequality;mathematical model;nonlinear system;simulation;social inequality;synchronization (computer science)	Shih-Ju Ho;Bor-Sen Chen	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2012.6250822	stochastic process;synchronization;mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy control system;statistics	Robotics	64.85561575563807	2.2157363627065236	107210

First, the dynamics of the steer-by-wire (SBW) EPS system and six-phase PMSM drive system with a lumped uncertainty are described in detail. Then, to alleviate the chattering phenomena in a traditional sliding-mode control (SMC), a second-order sliding-mode control (2OSMC) is designed. Moreover, the I2OSMC is developed to improve the required control performance of the EPS system. In the I2OSMC, the WFNN-AMF estimator with accurate approximation capability is employed to estimate the lumped uncertainty. Furthermore, the adaptive learning algorithms for the online training of the WFNN-AMF are derived using the Lyapunov theorem to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system. In addition, a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor (DSP), i.e., TMS320F28335, is adopted for the implementation of the proposed control approach. Finally, some experimental results are illustrated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed I2OSMC using the WFNN-AMF estimator for the EPS system.	32-bit;action message format;algorithm;approximation;artificial neural network;asymptote;digital signal processor;lyapunov fractal;machine learning;neuro-fuzzy;signal processing;spy-bi-wire;wavelet	Faa-Jeng Lin;Ying-Chih Hung;Kai-Chun Ruan	2014	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2300168	uncertainty;sliding mode control;control theory;mathematics;torque;electromagnetic coil;fuzzy control system;statistics	Robotics	63.45045854275951	-8.465345166575148	107375

First, the network structure and the online learning algorithm of an NN are described. To guarantee the convergence of error states, analytical methods based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function are proposed to determine the varied learning rates of a three-layer NN with one hidden layer. A rotary traveling-wave type ultrasonic motor (USM), which is driven by a newly designed high-frequency two-phase voltage source inverter using double inductances double capacitances resonant technique, is studied as an example of nonlinear time-varying plant to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control system. Then, a robust control system is designed using two NNs to control the rotor position of the USM. In the proposed control system, the Jacobian of the USM drive system is identified by a neural-network identifier to provide the sensitivity information to a neural-network controller.	artificial neural network;rotary system	Faa-Jeng Lin;Rong-Jong Wai;Chun-Ming Hong	2001	IEEE Trans.

This strategy combines the power of type-2 fuzzy logic systems with the adaptive control theory to achieve accurate tracking and robustness to higher uncertainties. Unlike other controllers, the proposed strategy does not require electrical transducers and hence, no explicit currents loop regulation is needed, which yields a simplified control scheme. But, this limits the machine's operation range since it results in a higher energy consumption. Therefore, a modified reference frame is also proposed in this paper to decrease the machine's consumption. To better assess the performance of the new reference frame, comparison against its original counterpart is carried-out under the same conditions. Moreover, the stability of the closed-loop control scheme is guaranteed by a Lyapunov theorem. Simulation and experimental results for numerous situations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed controller in standstill, transient, and steady-state conditions.	control theory;formal system;fuzzy logic;logic control;lyapunov fractal;reference frame (video);simulation;steady state;transducer	Hicham Chaoui;Mehdy Khayamy;Abdullah Abdulaziz Aljarboua	2017	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2017.2650858	fuzzy logic;control engineering;mathematical optimization;uncertainty;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;computer science;control system;fuzzy number;friction;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy set;torque;physics;fuzzy control system;statistics	Robotics	61.05330391086995	-8.94305642962387	107651

However, little of them considered what should be done once a control system performance is degraded during the operation. The aim of this paper is to maintain the performance of a control system at an acceptable level based on a pre-defined reference model. A maintenance approach is proposed and experimented in this paper. The method is to insert a compensator into the faulty control system and make the compensator and the faulty open loop system working together to track the pre-defined reference model. The proposed method is illustrated by reference to a mini process rig and shows the potential to industrial processes.

In [1] , the continuous-time model of the plant is described by: { E ̇ x(t) = Ax (t) + Bu (t) + Gw (t) z(t) = Cx (t) + Du (t) + Hw (t) (1) where x (t) ∈ R n is the state vector, u (t) ∈ R m is the control input vector, z(t) ∈ R p is the controlled output, and w (t) ∈ L 2 [0 , ∞ ) is the external disturbance. The matrix E is singular and its rank is r . The system state x ( t ) is sampled by sensors periodically, and h is the sampling period. The sampled data x ( kh ) is transmitted to the event detector and is transmitted (or released) at the instants t k h (t k ∈ N ) by the event detector, the event detector uses the following condition to decide whether the current signal should be transmitted to the controller: t k +1 h = t k h + min l { lh | e T (i k h ) e (i k h ) ≥ σ x T (t k h ) x (t k h ) } , (2) where 0 ≤ σ < 1 is a given scalar parameter, > 0 is a positive matrix to be determined, and e ( i k h ) is the error between the two states at the latest transmitted sampling instant and the current sampling instant, i.e. e (i k h ) = x (t k h ) − x (i k h ) , where i k h = t k h + lh, l ∈ N . The input of the controlled plant in the time interval [ t k h + τt k , t k +1 h + τt k +1 ) can be described as u (t) = Kx (t k h ) , t ∈ [ t k h + τt k , t k +1 h + τt k +1 ) (3) where K is the controller gain, τt k stands for the network-induced delay of the data released at t k h .

By denoting τ (t) = t − i k h (∀ t ∈ T l ) , the closed-loop system can be described by (11) of [1] as follows: { E ̇ x(t) = Ax (t) + BKx (t − τ (t)) + BKe (i k h ) + Gw (t) , z(t) = Cx (t) + DKx (t − τ (t)) + DKe (i k h ) + Hw (t) . (5) Then, LMIs-based stability conditions are given in Theorem 1 of [1] . Based on these conditions in Theorem 1, a stabilization result is obtained in Theorem 2 of [1] . However, the stability conditions given in Theorem 1 of [1] are incorrect. Therefore, the stabilization result proposed in [1] is also false. Now, let us analyze the incorrectness of the stability conditions given in Theorem 1 of [1] . First at all, it should be noted that the matrices [ N M − N 0 M 0] and E in of (16) of [1] are incompatible. Obviously, the dimensions of [ N M − N 0 M 0] and E are 5 n × 5 n and n × n , respectively. From the expressions of 1 and 2 in the proof of Theorem 1 in [1] , one can easily find that the correct expression of should be = [ N E (M − N ) E 0 ME 0] (6) rather than = [ N M − N 0 M 0] E described in Theorem 1 of [1] . Secondly, the matrix inequality (16) in Theorem 1 of [1] does not hold when E is singular. If inequality (16) was true, then φ 1 + + T < 0 and the (2,2) block of φ 1 + + T should be negative definite. From the expressions of φ 1 and the correct in (6) , the (2,2) block of φ 1 + + T is σ + (M 2 − N 2 ) E + E T (M 2 − N 2 ) T , where N T = [ N T 1 N T 2 N T 3 N T 4 N T 5 ] , M T = [ M T 1 M T 2 M T 3 M T 4 M T 5 ] , and N i ∈ R n ×n , M i ∈ R n ×n (i = 1 , 2 , · · · , 5) . From the positive definiteness of and 0 ≤ σ < 1, one can see that (M 2 − N 2 ) E + E T (M 2 − N 2 ) T < 0 should be true. On the other hand, as stated in the beginning of the proof of Theorem 1 in [1] , there exist two invertible matrices F and R ∈ R n ×n , such that F ER = [ I r 0 0 0 ] . Noting that (M 2 − N 2 ) E + E T (M 2 − N 2 ) T = (M 2 − N 2 ) F −1 [ I r 0 0 0 ] R −1 + R −T [ I r 0 0 0 ] F −T (M 2 − N 2 ) T = R −T ( R T (M 2 − N 2 ) F −1 [ I r 0 0 0 ] + [ I r 0 0 0 ] F −T (M 2 − N 2 ) T R ) R −1 , (7) it is known that (M 2 − N 2 ) E + E T (M 2 − N 2 ) T < 0 is equivalent to R T (M 2 − N 2 ) F −1 [ I r 0 0 0 ] + [ I r 0 0 0 ] F −T (M 2 − N 2 ) T R < 0 .

This condition is almost impossible to accomplish due to the excess number of required sensors or unavailability of states for measurement in most of the practical situations. Hence, the need for an estimator or observer is obvious to estimate all the state variables by observing the input and the output of the controlled system. As such, the goal of this paper is to provide a control design methodology based on a Luenberger observer design that can assure the closed-loop performances of a vehicle drivetrain with backlash, while compensating the network-enhanced time-varying delays.

d9259ccdbfe8b1816400efb8c44f5afb3cae4a3b	identification of flux linkage map of permanent magnet synchronous machines under uncertain circuit resistance and inverter nonlinearity		This paper proposes a novel scheme for the identification of the whole flux linkage map of permanent magnet synchronous machines, by which the map of dq-axis flux linkages at different load or saturation conditions can be identified by the minimization of a proposed estimation model. The proposed method works on a conventional three-phase inverter based vector control system and the immune clonal based quantum genetic algorithm is employed for the global searching of minimal point. Besides, it is also noteworthy that the influence of uncertain inverter nonlinearity and circuit resistance are cancelled during the modeling process. The proposed method is subsequently tested on two PMSMs and shows quite good performance compared with the finite element prediction results.	control system;finite element method;genetic algorithm;linkage (software);nonlinear system;optic axis of a crystal;phase inversion;power inverter	Kan Liu;Jianghua Feng;Shuying Guo;Lei Xiao;Zi Qiang Zhu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2017.2722470	control engineering;computer science;flux;flux linkage;finite element method;magnet;linkage (mechanical);nonlinear system;vector control;inverter;control theory	EDA	58.9905677914918	-7.418046957178038	108166
e133d65854f7b0699d7d936cffb01d146a6b2eb1	synthesis of strongly stable state-derivative controllers for a time-delay system using constrained non-smooth optimization	time delay system	The paper presents an optimization-based algorithm for stabilizing retarded systems using a statederivative feedback controller. It is shown that an application of such a controller results in neutral dynamics of the closed-loop system if small feedback delays occur. Therefore, the strong stability theory of neutral systems needs to be considered in the controller synthesis problem. The stabilization approach is based on minimizing the spectral abscissa of the closed-loop system over the controller parameter space, subject to a strong stability constraint. The constrained optimization problem is first turned into an unconstrained problem by application of a barrier method. Subsequently, the optimization is performed using both Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and hybrid algorithms for non-smooth optimization Matlab utilities. In the application example, the theoretical results are applied to regenerative chatter suppression in cutting process.	broadcast delay;broyden–fletcher–goldfarb–shanno algorithm;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);control theory;fletcher's checksum;interior point method;matlab;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;subgradient method;zero suppression	Tomás Vyhlídal;Wim Michiels;Paul McGahan	2010	IMA J.

It is assumed that the switching between a fault-free and finitely many faulty conditions can be modelled by a finite-state Markov chain and the continuous dynamics of the observed system can be described for the fault-free and each faulty condition by non-linear non-Gaussian models with a fully observed continuous state. The design of an optimal active fault detector that generates decisions and inputs improving the quality of detection is formulated as a dynamic optimization problem. As the optimal solution obtained by dynamic programming requires solving the Bellman functional equation, approximate techniques are employed to obtain a suboptimal active fault detector.	admissible heuristic;approximation algorithm;derivative-free optimization;dynamic programming;iteration;iterative method;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;stochastic process;time-invariant system	Ivo Puncochár;Miroslav Simandl	2014	Applied Mathematics and Computer Science		control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	61.69871211997822	1.2817299508620887	108265

An approach is proposed to significantly improve the system performance while reducing the number of scalar decision variables in linear matrix inequalities. The main points of the approach are: (i) two coupling integral inequalities are proposed to deal with some integral items in the derivation of the stability criteria; (ii) an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is constructed by including both the lower and upper bounds of the interval time-varying delays; and (iii) neither model transformation nor free weighting matrices are employed in the theoretical result derivation. As a result, some improved sufficient stability criteria are derived, and the maximum allowable delay bound and controller gains can be obtained simultaneously by solving an optimization problem. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This can be viewed as an extension of the H optimal control problem, where the transmission from the plant output sensors to the controller, and from the controller to the plant are over sporadically failing channels. We consider two different scenarios for unreliable communication. The first one iswhere the communication channel provides perfect acknowledgments of successful transmissions of control packets through a clean reverse channel, that is the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Under this setting, we obtain a class of output feedback minimax controllers; we identify a set of explicit threshold-type existence conditions in terms of the H disturbance attenuation parameter and the packet loss rates that guarantee stability and performance of the closed-loop system. The second scenario is one where there is no acknowledgment of successful transmissions of control packets, that is the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). We consider a special case of this problemwhere there is nomeasurement noise in the transmission from the sensors. For this problem, we obtain a class of corresponding minimax controllers by characterizing a set of (different) existence conditions. We also discuss stability and performance of the closed-loop system. We provide simulations to illustrate the results in all cases. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Differing from the full state constraints without considering the time-varying delay in nonlinear systems, a well defined Barrier Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is designed to address the difficult in this paper. By defining a continuous function and combining with mean value theorem, system is modeled with dead zone. Furthermore, a novel adaptive control scheme is developed based on recursive backstepping method. It is proved that the proposed approach can guarantee a desired tracking performance and semi-global asymptotically stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, some simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

The aim of this problem is to find a robust state feedback controller such that the closed-loop system has not only a bounded response in a finite duration of time for all admissible uncertainties but also a minimal guaranteed cost. A neural network (NN) based approximate optimal GCC design is developed. Initially, by modifying the cost function to account for the nonlinear perturbation of system, the optimal GCC problem is transformed into a finite-horizon optimal control problem of the nominal system. Subsequently, with the help of the modified cost function together with a parametrized bounding function for all admissible uncertainties, the solution to the optimal GCC problem is given in terms of a parametrized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (PHJB) equation. Then, a NN method is developed to solve offline the PHJB equation approximately and thus obtain the nearly optimal GCC policy. Furthermore, the convergence of approximate PHJB equation and the robust admissibility of nearly optimal GCC policy are also analyzed. Finally, by applying the proposed design method to the entry guidance problem of the Mars lander, the achieved simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;control theory;controllers;convergence (action);gucy2c protein, human;gucy2c wt allele;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;jacobi method;loss function;lunar lander (video game series);nonlinear system;online and offline;optimal control;simulation;hamilton rating scale for depression	Huai-Ning Wu;Mao-Mao Li;Lei Guo	2015	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2346233	mathematical optimization;optimal control;nonlinear system;computer science;machine learning;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;artificial neural network;robustness	Robotics	62.30001909824163	-2.8714179962273465	108642

Because of non-linear, strong coupling and large disturbance, it is difficult to reach a suitable working state of drum system by using traditional control methods. It is necessary to explore new methods to realize optimal control of drum water level. The back propagation (BP) neural network model of boiler drum system is built in this paper firstly, then the optimal control of the drum system by the dual heuristic dynamic programming (DHP) algorithm is realized, and compared with the heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) algorithm at last.

In order to control hydraulic devices on irrigation canals or rivers, detailed information on the hydraulic state of the system must be available. This is particularly true when the control algorithms are based on Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) or Predictive Control (PC) approaches using full state space models. Usually, the only known quantities are water levels, measured in limited locations. In this case, the design of an observer is a very useful tool for reconstructing unmeasured data, such as discharges or water levels at other locations, unknown perturbations, such as inflows or outflows, and model parameters. Several approaches are able to provide such observers. The paper illustrate the use of Kalman Filter or sequential Monte Carlo State Observer on these water management problems.	advanced process control;algorithm;data assimilation;irrigation informatics;kalman filter;monte carlo method;real-time clock;state space	Nelly Jean-Baptiste;Pierre-Olivier Malaterre;Christophe Dorée;Jacques Sau	2011	Mathematics and Computers in Simulation	10.1016/j.matcom.2010.12.021	kalman filter;simulation;data assimilation;control theory;mathematics;statistics;monte carlo method	AI	57.65025966424514	-5.208401504517618	108943

To solve the stabilisation problem as a first step are presented the conditions that assures the stability of the systems in closed-loop with a proportional feedback, these condition are derived with a novel methodology based on a discrete time approach. The stability conditions are used to design an observer (predicting) scheme that provides adequate convergent error. The proposed scheme results similar to the traditional Smith predictor that can be used on the case of stable systems. The observer scheme is complemented by the use of a PI compensator to follows step reference signals.	control theory;first-order predicate	Basilio Del-Muro-Cuéllar;Juan Francisco Marquez-Rubio;Martín Velasco-Villa;José de Jesús Álvarez-Ramírez	2011	IJCAT	10.1504/IJCAT.2011.042236	control engineering;mathematical optimization;von neumann stability analysis;control theory;mathematics	EDA	67.719303037825	-4.345604163149611	108944

It can transform the rulers of fuzzy logic control to a pair of input-output samples of multilayer forward neural network.The knowledge is not expressed by a serial of rules but distributed into the whole network. Based on this model, we have designed a two-stage fuzzy neural network temperature control system for industrial heating furnace. The first-stage controller is responsible for determining the control variable according to deviation information of controlled variable. The second-stage controller takes charges of adjusting the control variable coming from the first-stage controller through other process parameters. The system takes full account of the impact of many process parameters on controlled variable. It uses two-stage fuzzy neural network controller to decentralize process of control parameters, which makes it easy to extract fuzzy rules, greatly reduces the number of fuzzy rules and produces reasonable control outputs. Engineering applications show that the system has a lot of advantages such as high accuracy, strong robustness, etc. Its quality is superior to conventional control and it is suitable for long lag, nonlinear system in particular.	artificial neural network;control system;fuzzy logic;logic control;network interface controller;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;robustness (computer science)	Xiaohong Peng;Zhi Mo;Shiyi Xie	2012	JCP	10.4304/jcp.7.2.433-438	defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;computer science;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;temperature control;control theory;artificial neural network;fuzzy control system	Robotics	60.265900006038265	-9.030147185693592	109331

The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is used for representing a nonlinear system, where the parameters of the fuzzy model are obtained from both the fuzzy rules and online updates. An inverse function is cascaded with the plant to cancel the effects of dead-zone. Based on the fuzzy model, a state feedback controller is developed to override the nonlinearities and external disturbances such that the uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed loop and the H∞ tracking performance are achieved. From Lyapunov stability and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), the effect of the external disturbance on the tracking error can be attenuated to any prescribed level. An inverted pendulum system is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	control theory;inverted pendulum;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system	Ho-Sheng Chen;Wen-Shyong Yu	2010	International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584112	full state feedback;inverted pendulum;mathematical optimization;pendulum;dead zone;stability;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;nonlinear system;linear matrix inequality;fuzzy number;control theory;mathematics;inverse function	Robotics	65.44963791640471	-5.443743498768911	109333

TSN nodes are networked through interpolation and activation, similar to a gain-scheduling or local model/controller network.  However, to achieve accuracy and ease of commissioning without requiring a large number of nodes, an algorithm has been developed first to identify optimum transition nodes within the entire operating envelope.  Then the TSN approaches a nonlinear plant globally, not just locally, without requiring linearization.  If desired or necessary, global optimisation provides an enhancement in the design process for TSNs.  Since optimising only one aspect (a single objective) of performance while compromising others is undesirable, multi-objective designs have been developed concurrently to deliver or improve multiple aspects of performance.#N##N#Following the development of a TSN, it is applied to nonlinear system modelling, and this TSN is termed a Trajectory-Scheduling Model (TSM).  A TSM possesses the same properties and design features as the TSN generic framework.  A nonlinear system, a coupled liquid-tank, is used to examine this modelling technique.  Results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the methods developed and validates the TSM.#N##N#Further, the TSN technique is applied to nonlinear controller design, by way of a Trajectory-Scheduling Controller (TSC) network.  It is illustrated through the design of a networked, easy-to-understand and easy-to-use PID control system for the coupled liquid-tank.  Results show that the methods developed offer a high-performance linear control system with nonlinear capabilities to handle practical systems operating in a broad range and to cope with conflict between setpoint following at transient and disturbance rejection at steady state.  This method is then applied to the PID network design problems for two nonlinear chemical processes.	control system;scheduling (computing)	Gregory Chow Ye Chong	2006			control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	EDA	57.14674165651104	-3.548489914686353	109388

Feasibility (constraints satisfaction by the approximated solution), convergence and optimality of this distributed optimization method are mathematically proved. For an automated irrigation channel, the satisfactory performance of the proposed distributed model predictive control method in attenuation of the undesired upstream transient error propagation and amplification phenomenon is illustrated and compared with the performance of another distributed model predictive control method that exploits a single-level architecture for communication. It is illustrated that the distributed model predictive control that exploits a two-level architecture for communication has a better performance by better managing communication overhead.

Inspired by prescribed performance control (PPC), a new performance function called finite-time performance function (FTPF) is defined for the first time. With the aid of neural networks and backstepping, an adaptive finite-time tracking controller is properly designed. Different from the existing finite-time results, the proposed method can guarantee that the tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small region at any settling time and all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally practical finite-time stable (SGPF-stable). Two simulation examples are given to exhibit the effectiveness and superiority of the presented technique.	artificial neural network;strict function	Yang Liu;Xiaoping Liu;Yuanwei Jing	2018	Inf.

The genetic algorithm is used to obtain the values of the variables required by the fuzzy logic controller, removing the need for expert knowledge. The system employs genetic search to extract the fuzzy rules and membership functions using an objective function calculated from the fuzzy logic system evaluation function. The extracted rules are used in the fuzzy associative memory matrix entries so that the fuzzy logic system performance fits the desired behaviour. Results show that the controller developed is able to predict the desired output for the flexible pole-cart balancing problem with high accuracy.		Elmer P. Dadios;David J.

In particular, the EKF has been applied to the estimation of the weights of feedforward and recurrent neural network models, i.e. to their training, and shown to be more efficient than recursive and non recursive first-order training algorithms; nevertheless, these first applications to the training of neural networks did not fully exploit the potentials of the EKF. In this paper, we analyze the specific influence of the EKF parameters for modeling problems, and propose a variant of this algorithm for the training of feedforward neural models which proves to be very efficient as compared to non recursive second-order algorithms.

In this context, we focus on the design of a nonlinear estimation procedure consisting in a bias estimator together with a linear Luenberger structure augmented with an adaptive weighted pseudo-inverse combination of the available measurements. It is shown that the proposed scheme is characterized by higher performances compared to the classical compensation of the observer output injection using the estimated bias.

This paper reviews and presents new results on recursive neural filters through introducing those based on a multilayer perceptron with output feedbacks and proposing dynamical range reducers and extenders for applications where the range of the measurement or signal process expands in time or is too large for the recurrent neural network to handle for the filtering resolution required. As opposed to the conventional analytic approach to deriving filter equations, recursive neural filters are synthesized from exemplary realizations of the signal and measurement processes, which are obtained by either computer simulations or actual experiments. No assumptions such as linear dynamics, Gaussian distribution, additive noise, and Markov property are required. A properly trained recursive neural filter with a proper architecture carries the most """"informative"""" statistics in its dynamical state and approximates the optimal performance to any accuracy. The recursive neural filter is a massively parallel algorithm ideal for real-time implementation. Dynamical range reducers and extenders proposed are preprocessors and postprocessors of a recurrent neural network that, respectively, reduce the range of the exogenous input and extend that of the output of the recurrent neural network. While a dynamical range reducer reduces the exogenous input range by subtracting an estimate of the exogenous input from it, a dynamical range extender extends the output range by adding an estimate of the output to it. Three types of dynamical range reducer by estimate subtraction and five types of dynamical range extender by estimate addition are provided, which have different levels of effectiveness and computational costs. Selection from the different types for an application is determined by the tradeoff between the effectiveness and computational cost. Two types of dynamical range extender by estimate addition use an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to generate the added estimate. They can be viewed as methods of using a recursive neural filter only to make up the nonlinear part ignored by the EKF."""	additive white gaussian noise;algorithmic efficiency;artificial neural network;broadcast delay;computation;computer simulation;convex hull;digital media player;dynamical system;emoticon;experiment;extended kalman filter;feedback;global optimization;information;input/output;markov chain;markov property;mathematical model;maxima and minima;monte carlo method;multilayer perceptron;network architecture;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;online and offline;parallel algorithm;primitive recursive function;random neural network;real-time clock;recurrent neural network;recursion (computer science);recursive neural network;synthetic intelligence;transformers;transient state;utility functions on indivisible goods	James T.

Using the minimax robust estimation principle and the unbiased linear minimum variance (ULMV) rule, based on the worst-case conservative system with the conservative upper bounds of noise variances, the local and five weighted fused robust time-varying Kalman predictors are designed, which include a robust weighted measurement fuser, three robust weighted state fusers, and a robust covariance intersection (CI) fuser. Their actual prediction error variances are guaranteed to have the corresponding minimal upper bounds for all admissible uncertainties of noise variances. Their robustness is proved based on the proposed Lyapunov equation approach. The concept of the robust accuracy is presented, and the robust accuracy relations are proved. The corresponding steady-state robust local and fused Kalman predictors are also presented, and the convergence in a realization between the time-varying and steady-state robust Kalman predictors is proved by the dynamic error system analysis (DESA) method and the dynamic variance error system analysis (DVESA) method. Simulation results show the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed results.	best, worst and average case;binary prefix;centralized computing;emoticon;fuser (unix);kalman filter;kerrison predictor;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;minimax;steady state;time-invariant system;unified framework	Wenjuan Qi;Peng Zhang;Gui-Huan Nie;Zi-Li Deng	2014	Digital Signal Processing	10.1016/j.dsp.2014.03.011	robust control;econometrics;control theory;mathematics;statistics	ML	57.53707425996912	4.0999703531795735	110419

So the network induced time delay and data dropouts are unavoidable in NCSs. The time delay may degrade the performance of control systems and even destabilize the systems if the systems are designed without considering the effects of the time delays properly. Once the structure of a NCS is confirmed, it is essential to identify what the maximum time delay is allowed for maintaining the system stability which, in turn, is also associated with the process of controller design. This paper proposes a new method for estimating the maximum allowable time delay in networked control system with norm bounded nonlinearity. Some studies have been reported in estimation of the maximum time-delay allowed for retaining the system stability. However, most of the reported methods are normally over complicated for practical applications. A new stability method based on using the finite difference approximation for the delay term is proposed in this paper for estimating the maximum time-delay tolerance in networked control system with bounded nonlinearity, which has a simple structure and is easy to apply.	approximation;broadcast delay;control system;finite difference;network computing system;nonlinear system;real-time clock;telecommunications network	Ashraf F.

Moreover, with the introduction of an error modification and an initialisation technique, it is proved that the tracking performance can be achieved.	block cipher mode of operation;nonlinear system	Xiaowei Yu;Yan Lin	2014	Int.

579e72105230002758a096c83e5d94f5739b447c	a novel robust interval kalman filter algorithm for gps/ins integrated navigation		Kalman filter is widely applied in data fusion of dynamic systems under the assumption that the system and measurement noises are Gaussian distributed. In literature, the interval Kalman filter was proposed aiming at controlling the influences of the system model uncertainties. The robust Kalman filter has also been proposed to control the effects of outliers. In this paper, a new interval Kalmanfilter algorithm is proposed by integrating the robust estimation and the interval Kalmanfilter inwhich the systemnoise and the observation noise terms are considered simultaneously. The noise data reduction and the robust estimation methods are both introduced into the proposed interval Kalman filter algorithm. The new algorithm is equal to the standard Kalman filter in terms of computation, but superior for managing with outliers.The advantage of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated experimentally using the integrated navigation of Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Inertial Navigation System (INS).	computation;dynamical system;experiment;global positioning system;inertial navigation system;kalman filter;peterson's algorithm;runge–kutta–fehlberg method	Chen Jiang;Shubi Zhang;Qiuzhao Zhang	2016	J.

6be67db567e1e543bf8da03ca8e6fc441eb10d26	control barrier functions for constrained control of linear systems with input delay		The concept of Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF) has been used to design control laws robust to disturbances and modeling errors, while Control Barrier Functions (CBF) have been used to adhere to state constraints in the operating space. The two can be combined and methods that employ Quadratic Programming (QP) have recently gained popularity. In this paper we consider a CLF-CBF QP design for linear systems with input delay. One obstacle is that input delays prevent the CLF concept from being extended to either Razumikhin or Krasovsky version. Instead, this paper starts with the CLF $V$ for the zero-delay system and employs its value predicted by the delay time $\tau$. While this predicted $V$ is not positive definite, when used with the QP-based design it produces a controller that renders the origin globally asymptotically stable. A similar approach is followed with the barrier function – a predicted value of the CBF for the zero-delay system is used to form a QP constraint for the delay system. The controller combining the two provides essentially the same benefits as its non-delay counterpart. The results are illustrated on an example by simulations.	barrier function;common look and feel;control flow;display lag;input lag;linear system;lyapunov fractal;quadratic programming;rendering (computer graphics);simulation	Mrdjan Jankovic	2018	2018 Annual American Control Conference (ACC)	10.23919/ACC.2018.8430747	positive-definite matrix;computer science;control theory;control theory;barrier function;quadratic programming;stability theory;lyapunov function;linear system;exponential stability	EDA	67.92487285515065	-3.329687142367092	111380

Each controller is optimal for the intercept of a single vehicle, i.e., for the  segment  of the complete time varying multiple vehicle target set. The switching rule guarantees that after every switch the time to the target set is shorter with a certain predefined probability. Furthermore, the rule guarantees that the target set is reached after a finite number of switches and the rule scales well with the number of vehicles, i.e., the segments covering the target set. The problem and results are illustrated by a numerical example.		Dejan Milutinovic;David W.

1f302092c98729c2c5bf6d302a86adab6eadf1b2	state estimation using physics-based equivalent circuit models of a li-ion cell and kalman filter		We have previously proposed a novel parameter identification method for the Li-ion battery equivalent circuit model (ECM) considering the electrochemical properties, with which a second order ECM resistances/capacitances values can be obtained from electrochemical parameters. In this paper, we apply this physics-based ECM with Kalman filter for cell SOC estimation. To implement the Kalman filter to nonlinear systems, we adopted both extended Kalman filter, which has most widely been used to linearize the nonlinear system models with Taylor-series expansion, and sigma-point Kalman filter, in which the nonlinear equations are directly used to propagate the sigma points through the system state equation and the observation equation so that the means and the covariance of the state vector can be estimated better than by the EKF. Simulation results show EKF/SPKF can give accurate estimation with error bounds, which verify the applicability of our method for cell SOC estimation. Besides, EKF and SPKF results are compared.	cell (microprocessor);entity name part qualifier - adopted;equivalent circuit;extended kalman filter;ions;lithium;nonlinear system;population parameter;series expansion;simulation	S.

First, since there exist packet dropouts when the information is transmitted through the band-limited channels, a novel compression compensation (C–C) method is proposed to ensure the integrity of transmission. Based on this method, a compound control strategy is established to deal with the data transmission synchronization problem under the band-limited channels. Then, a nonlinear switched system model with uncertainty is constructed, in which both the inter-sampler behavior and the packet dropouts behavior are considered. Furthermore, some more general stability results of the NLSCSs with band-limited channels are obtained by using a packet dropouts dependent Lyapunov functional method, and then the compound state feedback controller can be designed. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.	bandlimiting;control system;control theory;existential quantification;lyapunov fractal;network packet;nonlinear system;numerical analysis	Guotao Hui;Huaguang Zhang;Zhenning Wu;Yingchun Wang	2014	Inf.

Initially, Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation is derived in infinite-dimensional space. Subsequently, a novel neural network (NN) identifier is introduced to approximate the nonlinear dynamics in the 2-D PDE. The optimal control input is derived by online estimation of the value function through an additional NN-based forward-in-time estimation and approximated dynamic model. Novel update laws are developed for estimation of the identifier and value function online. The designed control policy can be applied using a finite number of actuators at the boundaries. Local ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is studied in detail using Lyapunov theory. Simulation results confirm the optimizing performance of the proposed controller on an unstable 2-D Burgers’ equation.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;bellman equation;biological neural networks;control theory;controllers;dynamic programming;epilepsies, partial;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;identifier;jacobi method;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;nonlinear system;numerical partial differential equations;optimal control;simulation;unstable medical device problem;update (sql)	Behzad Talaei;Sarangapani Jagannathan;John Singler	2018	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2736786	artificial intelligence;applied mathematics;boundary value problem;pattern recognition;partial differential equation;neumann boundary condition;computer science;optimal control;lyapunov function;mathematical optimization;pde surface;burgers' equation;bellman equation	Robotics	62.270443000660386	-2.8548958147623456	112023

This work intends to present a study developed using a control solution based on optimal control, applied on a heat exchanger network (HEN) with bypasses. The HEN is frequently used in chemical processes to promote energy integration, reducing the utility consumption as its main objective. A H-Infinity model matching control was developed successfully to the network by using time domain specification instead of the traditional frequency domain specification. The results of the simulations have demonstrated that the proposed optimal control leaded to a reasonable control performance, i.e., process variables became almost totally decoupled, null offset, and the output responses presented a small time constant.	optimal control;pid;simulation	Fabio Delatore;Fabrizio Leonardi;Luis Fernando Novazzi;José Jaime Da Cruz	2011	2011 9th IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2011.6138094	control engineering;optimal control;heat exchanger;time domain;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;time constant;helium;model predictive control;frequency domain	Robotics	57.45422317096333	-6.226949792416168	112335
28a5fe47077612082bfb92292bd62c947e90da68	generación y optimización de controladores difusos utilizando el modelo nefcon		The design of algorithms that operate on unmodeled dynamics plants still represents a challenge in automatic control area. A solution could be the use of algorithms able to learn in real time by direct interaction with the plant. NEFCON, allows to build a Mamdani fuzzy controller able to learn rules and adapt the fuzzy sets. The main advantage of NEFCON compared with other learning approaches, is that its design express the current error state of the plant to be controlled. However, a disadvantage of NEFCON is its poor exploration of the states of the plant during the learning; disable its application on nonlinear dynamic systems. In this work the addition of Gaussian noise to the states of the plant is proposed with the objective to assure a wide exploration of the states, simplifying the convergence, when it is applied to nonlinear systems. In particular, the effectiveness of our proposal is shown in the control of the “ball and beam” dynamic system.	algorithm;automatic control;controller (control theory);dynamical system;fuzzy set;nonlinear system;real-time computing	Erik Valdemar Cuevas Jiménez;Daniel Zaldivar;Marco A.

The sampling period considered here is assumed to be less than a given bound. By introducing a Bernoulli distributed stochastic variable, the information of probabilistic time-varying delay is transformed into the deterministic time-varying delay with stochastic parameters. A new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed and by using quadratic convex approach, reciprocal convex technique and Jensen's inequality, sufficient conditions for the synchronization of complex networks are derived. Based on the average dwell-time method and delay-probability-distribution-dependent condition, the synchronization criterion is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. & 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, according to the characteristics of causal systems, the descriptor system is transformed into an algebraic equation and a normal system represented by a dynamic equation. Second, by using the discrete lifting technique, the normal multirate system is converted to a single-rate system. Then by making use of the standard linear qudratic (LQ) preview control method, we construct the augmented error system, and the optimal preview control law of the augmented error system is obtained. The control law for the augmented system is then transformed to the optimal preview control law of the descriptor causal system in a multirate setting. The stabilisability and detectability of the lifted single-rate system and the augmented error system are discussed in detail.

The disturbances generated from a unknown linear exosystem are completely compensated. The order of the exosystem is assumed known and the eigenvalues are distinct. No other assumptions are needed in the control design. This means that the proposed control design is able to completely compensate the disturbances without knowing their amplitudes, frequencies and phases, as long as the number of di3erent frequency components in the disturbances is known. A new formulation of state estimation is introduced to ensure the global stabilization and complete disturbance suppression. Adaptive control technique is used to design an adaptive internal model based on a recently introduced formulation of unknown exosystems and the parameters in the adaptive internal model converge to the actual values, from which the unknown disturbance frequencies can be calculated. In the proposed control design, a number of control coe5cients are made adaptive so that the result is global with respect to unknown frequencies in the disturbances. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is well known that time-delay and dead-zone characteristics are frequently encountered in various engineering systems. The dead-zone phenomena may occur in various components of control systems including sensors, amplifiers and actuators, especially in pneumatic valves, in electric servo motors and in hydraulic components. On the other hand, the time-delay phenomena are quite commonly found in chemical process, hydraulic systems and pneumatic systems. In most practice motion systems, the dead-zone characteristics are usually poorly known and may vary with time. Therefore, by using a description of a dead-zone and exploring the properties of this dead-zone model intuitively and mathematically, a robust adaptive fuzzy control method is presented without constructing the dead-zone inverse. According to some adaptive laws, the unknown nonlinear functions of the plant are approximated by the fuzzy logic system. Based on Lyapunov stability theorem, the proposed robust adaptive fuzzy control scheme can guarantee the robust stability of the whole closed-loop nonlinear time-delay system with an unknown dead-zone in the actuator and obtain good tracking performance as well. Finally, an example and simulation results are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed control method.	amplifier;approximation algorithm;broadcast delay;dead code elimination;dead reckoning;formal system;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;lyapunov fractal;mit engineering systems division;nonlinear system;sensor;servo;simulation;xfig	Chiang-Cheng Chiang;Mon-Han Chen	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence)	10.1109/FUZZY.2008.4630395	fuzzy logic;robust control;real-time computing;adaptive control;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence;control theory;fuzzy control system;robustness	Robotics	65.07210550085034	-7.611862568454385	113263

The considered systems are with multiple time delays and nonlinear uncertainties, and the uncertain nonlinearities are bounded by nonlinear functions with unknown coefficients. The actuator parameters are time-varying and their bounds are unknown, moreover the signs of them are not available. To deal with unknown actuator parameters problem, we decompose the system into two subsystems. For the resultant system, we develop the corresponding tolerant controller design method with the help of Nussbaum function. By constructing the Lyapunov Krasovskii functional, we prove the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system.

ba2718d68f26b513f4ceb21cecc6dc6370ed1942	stabilization of a class of nonlinear systems with actuator saturation via active disturbance rejection control	computacion informatica;stabilization;grupo de excelencia;actuator saturation;active disturbance rejection control;nonlinear systems;ciencias basicas y experimentales;linear matrix inequalities;domain of attraction	The stabilization problem of a class of nonlinear systems with actuator saturation is investigated via active disturbance rejection control (ADRC). We first present results for systems with nonlinear ADRC and show that local stabilization can be achieved in a region including the origin. Then, for the linear ADRC, the linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for determining the estimate of the domain of attraction of the resulting closed-loop system are formulated based on a quadratic candidate Lyapunov function and a generalized sector condition. An LMI-based algorithm is correspondingly established to design the linear ADRC controller. The obtained results suggest a new way to stabilize the saturated nonlinear system, even in the case that the state of the system is not fully available for measurement and system nonlinear dynamics are largely unknown. An illustrative example validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

34e8d1dd8efe9af131e5f84f98ee95206af77fc2	a dynamic neural network-based sliding mode observer method for a class of uncertain dynamic systems		A dynamic neural network (DNN)-based observer design is presented, which amalgamates an adaptive neural network-based technique with a finite-time sliding mode estimation method. The proposed observer design is motivated by practical quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle tracking control applications, where direct sensor measurements of translational and rotational rates are not available for feedback. While sliding mode estimation strategies are well established as an effective means to compensate for bounded disturbances and dynamic model uncertainty, the proposed observer design employs a feedforward adaptive DNN-based estimation term in addition to a robust, high-gain feedback sliding mode element. The use of the DNN-based term in the estimator design is motivated by the desire to improve transient performance and reduce steady state error. In addition, the proposed sliding mode estimator design is proven to compensate for input-multiplicative parametric model uncertainty. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first DNN-based sliding mode estimator result to rigorously prove asymptotic state estimation in the presence of parametric actuator uncertainty. A Lyapuov-based stability analysis is utilized to prove that the proposed DNN-based observer achieves asymptotic estimation of the quadrotor altitude and attitude rates in the presence of model uncertainty and bounded disturbances (e.g., sensor noise). Numerical simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the improved performance that is achieved by incorporating the adaptive DNN in the observer.	academia (organization);actuator device component;aerial photography;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;drug vehicle;dynamical system;feedforward neural network;genetic translation process;image noise;lyapunov fractal;mathematical model;neural network simulation;parametric model;rem sleep behavior disorder;steady state;system dynamics;unmanned aerial vehicle;vehicle tracking system;yaws	Shane Stebler;William MacKunis;Natalie Ramos-Pedroza;Mahmut Reyhanoglu	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	10.1109/CCTA.2017.8062431	estimator;steady state;parametric model;observer (quantum physics);artificial neural network;feed forward;parametric statistics;state observer;control engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	65.40159471241853	-7.090144343128395	113553
5f9d97d6a69a9243a728d7e1c092e7be21e47a5b	nonlinear adaptive control method for treatment of uncertain hepatitis b virus infection		Abstract In this paper, a nonlinear adaptive control method is presented for the treatment of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection. Nonlinear dynamics of the HBV, modeling uncertainties and three state variables (the numbers of uninfected and infected cells and free viruses) are taken into account. The proposed control law is designed for the antiviral drug input such that the number of free viruses and consequently the number of infected cells decrease to the desired values. An adaptation law is also presented to overcome modeling uncertainties by updating estimations of the system parameters during the treatment period. The stability of the process and convergence to desired state values are investigated by utilizing the Lyapunov theorem. The performance of the proposed adaptive control strategy is evaluated via comprehensive simulations employing the nonlinear HBV model with different levels of uncertainty. The consideration of modeling uncertainties is in accordance with the reality where the HBV has different characteristics in different bodies. According to the obtained results, the proposed strategy can achieve the desired control objectives (reduction of viruses and infected cells) by adjusting the drug usage.

It is assumed that the feedback loop consists of two discrete-time systems, the clock frequency ratio of which has a special rational form, and is close to one. A Toeplitz matrix approach is taken to model the input/output relationship of the arising feedback systems. Based on this representation, the effect of synchronization errors on stability of the feedback systems is analyzed. It is shown that stability of the synchronized feedback loop can not guarantee stability of the loop in the presence of synchronization errors.

A two-step design procedure is proposed to derive non-conservative robust FDI filters. The first step consists of designing an optimal FDI filter that maximizes fault sensitivity performance and simultaneously minimizes the influence of unknown inputs, for a large class of model perturbations. The design problem is formulated so that all free parameters are optimized via Linear Matrix Inequality techniques. The second step consists of a systematic post-design analysis procedure. A test is proposed to check if all FDI objectives are achieved for all specified model perturbations. The problem is formulated using an appropriate performance index over a specified frequency range. The solution is based on the generalized structured singular value. Finally, experimental results from a pilot laboratory system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The technique under discussion is grounded in numerical solution of the moment differential equations to predict the state mean of the stochastic dynamical system and the corresponding error covariance matrix. Here, we apply an efficient embedded Runge-Kutta pair possessing superior stability and many other attractive features, including automatic global error control, in order to improve performance of the complex computational procedure consisting of the extended Kalman filter and the underlying adaptive ODE solver. Thus, we introduce a new continuous-discrete adaptive extended Kalman filter and show its advantage over the standard variant on two test examples. In practice, this technique allows for much longer sampling intervals without any loss of accuracy, and that improves the applied potential of the extended Kalman filtering method, significantly.	discretization error;dynamical system;embedded system;error detection and correction;extended kalman filter;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;numerical partial differential equations;runge–kutta methods;sampling (signal processing);solver;whole earth 'lectronic link	Gennady Y.

The related investigations show that the state reconstruction problem may be quite ill conditioned in the sense that different states may exist that lead to roughly the same output. It seems however that when constrained receding-horizon estimation is used together with a dedicated crossing singularity heuristic, state reconstruction is possible even in presence of measurement noise and up to 10% error on the r.h.s of the ODE’s describing the system’s dynamics. The efficiency and the real-time implementability of the overall scheme is shown through illustrative scenarios including both simulation and experimental validation.	batch processing;heuristic;nonlinear system;real-time clock;reconstruction conjecture;simulation;singularity project	Mazen Alamir;Nida Sheibat-Othman;Sami Othman	2008	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2008.021002	control engineering;mathematical optimization;polymer;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	63.478838609520544	-2.8662276995886384	114477

The results presented here can be considered as extension of previous work that assumes that the upper value of the nonlinear perturbation weight is known. Here, adaptive control schemes are developed to guarantee asymptotic stabilization of the closed-loop system when the upper bound of the state feedback gain perturbation is known and unknown.	algorithm;control theory;dynamical system;nonlinear system	Hazem N.

a579e39d7a8e6426a2c6833c3100ae373c4a76ff	adaptive position tracking control system based on recurrent fuzzy wavelet neural networks for robot manipulators		In this article, we propose an adaptive recurrent fuzzy wavelet neural network control strategy to improve high-accuracy position tracking for robot manipulators. In order to deal with the unknown knowledge of the robot system problems, the adaptive recurrent fuzzy wavelet neural networks are applied in the main controller to approximate the unknown dynamics without the requirement of prior knowledge. In addition, an adaptive robust control law is also developed to eliminate uncertainties that consist of estimation errors and disturbances from the robot control system. The design of the adaptive online learning algorithms is determined using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Therefore, the proposed controller proves that it can guarantee not only the stability and robustness but also the tracking performance of the robot manipulators control system. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparative simulation and experimental results.	artificial neural network;control system;robot;wavelet	Thanglong Mai;Yaonan Wang	2014	J.

Hence, the utilization of communication resource and the requirement of control specification should be analyzed and properly designed when implementing a control system over a network architecture. In this paper, we analyze the performance of information sharing of multiple cooperative agents over one communication network, and propose design methodologies of guaranteeing acceptable control and communication performance in a networked control system. In particular, we study the relationship between the sampling rates of a control system,and the transmission rates of a communication network, and then utilize an integrated networked control design chart to help select design parameters and visualize overall system performance at different sampling and transmission rates. Based on the design parameters selected, the communication modules by utilizing deadband control and state estimation are presented for guaranteeing both control and communication performance. Simulation studies are conducted in a network-and-control simulation tool that is developed on the Matlab/Simulink platform and is used to demonstrate the proposed design methodologies.

Specifically, the reduced-order models of the PDEs are constructed on the basis of historical data-based empirical eigenfunctions by applying Karhunen-Loève expansion. Several EMPC systems each using a different ROM (i.e., different number of modes and derived from either using analytical sinusoidal/cosinusoidal eigenfunctions or empirical eigenfunctions as basis functions) are applied to a tubular reactor example where a second-order reaction occurs. The model accuracy, computational time and closed-loop economic performance of the closed-loop tubular reactor under the different EMPC systems are compared.	basis function;computation;control system;nonlinear system;numerical partial differential equations;parabolic antenna;reactor (software);read-only memory;time complexity;tor messenger	Liangfeng Lao;Matthew Ellis;Antonios Armaou;Panagiotis D.

This paper focuses on structural durability of the main steam header under load following to illustrate how the life-extending control of fossil fuel power plants can be achieved via feedforward/feedback. This concept is potentially applicable to both new and aging power plants under a variety of operational modes such as hot start-up, scheduled shutdown, and load following where the plant power is rapidly maneuvered to meet the varying load demand. The feedforward control policy is synthesized via nonlinear optimization of a multi-objective cost functional of dynamic performance and service life under the constraints of actuator saturation, operational limitations, and allowable structural damage, including thermomechanical fatigue and plastic deformation. A linear robust feedback control law that is superimposed on the feedforward sequence is synthesized based on induced &-norm techniques. The results of simulation experiments are presented to demonstrate that the proposed feedforward/feedback control policy is potentially capable of ramping the plant power up at a rate of 10% of the full load per minute while maintaining the specified performance and satisfying the damage constraints.	durability (database systems);experiment;fossil;feed forward (control);feedback;feedforward neural network;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimal control;shutdown (computing);simulation	P.

Since the introduction of exhaust after-treatment catalysts, the emissions have been reduced by well over two orders of magnitude. Low emissions have to be maintained in the presence of hardware faults, degraded catalysts, and varying fuel composition such as ethanol content. Contributions to this achievement come from engine, chemical, and control engineering. The presentation will try to illuminate the role played by control and, in parallel, illustrate selection and application of models in control design. The models considered in this presentation range from very simple to very complex - from frequency domain to PDEs. Operation of the overall emission control system will be described and control designs for several subsystems explained in some detail. The subsystems that are covered in the presentation are the “inner” air-fuel ratio loop which features the Smith Predictor, catalyst modeling for control of the “outer” loop, and adaptive ethanol detection in flex fuel vehicles.

The main aim of the paper is to analyze the efficiency of the approximation method from the nonlinear discretized into the discrete piece-wise affine model. The system under consideration is the car of the hill system with state nonlinearities and input saturation. Primary motivations are applications in control systems design. Both accuracy and numerical complexity of the piece-wise affine control system grow with the number of polyhedral partitions, describing the system. The efficiency of the proposed PWA approximation method is evaluated on the numerical example.	approximation algorithm;control system;discretization;dynamical system;linear model;memory controller;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;online and offline;optimal control;picasa web albums;polyhedron;settling time;systems design	Przemyslaw Orlowski	2018	2018 23rd International Conference on Methods & Models in Automation & Robotics (MMAR)	10.1109/MMAR.2018.8486004	computer science;control theory;hill system;control theory;linear model;model predictive control;discretization;affine transformation;nonlinear system;control system	Robotics	63.27608696806062	-1.5371256393142723	115803

The controller guarantees a minimum interval between triggering times and takes the actual evolution of the state/the effect of disturbances into account to avoid an unnecessary utilization of the input. We propose tailored methods for the co-design of the triggering scheme and the controller.

The unknown functions are addressed via online function approximation, which results in two types of uncertainty. Parametric uncertainty due to online function approximation and non-parametric uncertainty. The non-parametric uncertainty results from the inability of any function approximator to perfectly model an unknown function and from terms unmodeled by the output feedback form. The non-parametric terms are assumed to be bounded by unknown constants. The backstepping procedure is applied to adapt with respect to both parametric uncertainties and the upper bound on the non-parametric uncertainties. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One of the most important device for obtaining efficient ESSs is the Battery Management System (BMS). It includes all the electronic components and algorithms for the monitoring and management of the ESS status. The key task of the BMS is the estimation of the State of Charge. Currently the most promising methods are based on state observers, which require an accurate model of the cell. In this paper a novel technique for modeling the transient behavior of the cell is proposed. It is based on a single nonlinear dipole composed of a standard linear resistor and a nonlinear voltage driven capacitor connected in parallel. A method for the parameters identification based on a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm has been developed. Both the identification algorithm and the proposed model are validated on a A123 cell obtaining very stable solution and better accuracy with respect to models based on linear components.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;battery management system;electronic component;equivalent circuit;genetic algorithm;hybrid algorithm;hysteresis;linear model;mathematical model;memetic algorithm;memristor;nonlinear system;particle swarm optimization;phase-shift oscillator;rc circuit;series and parallel circuits;state of charge	Massimiliano Luzi;Maurizio Paschero;Antonello Rizzi;Fabio Massimo Frattale Mascioli	2016	2016 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2016.7743806	estimation;capacitor;control theory;computational model;statistics	EDA	54.81505684498548	-1.9419438039621528	116241

The method utilizes the sum of squares decomposition of polynomials and results in a nonpolynomial control law fulfilling amplitude constraints of the input. Consideration of input rate constraints can be included by extending the optimization problem. The resulting sum of squares optimization problems are bilinear. Thus, an iterative algorithm is used to obtain a solution. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by an example system, for which it turns out that the resulting controller exploits the given amplitude range very well and leads to better control performance than a polynomial controller.	algorithm;bilinear filtering;iterative method;mathematical optimization;optimal control;optimization problem;polynomial;sum-of-squares optimization	Thomas Gussner;Jürgen Adamy	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5400942	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;iterative method	Robotics	64.2650970224379	-1.5946750876265672	116245

The uncertainty is considered in both the system dynamics and constraint. It is bounded, and the knowledge of the bound only lies within a fuzzy set. We propose an adaptive robust control for the mechanical system for approximate constraint-following. Both the mechanical system model and control scheme are deterministic and not if-then heuristic rules-based. An optimal design problem using the fuzzy description of the uncertainty is proposed. We prove that the global solution to the resulting optimization problem always exists and is unique. Under the control, the performance of the mechanical system is both deterministically guaranteed and fuzzily optimized.	approximation algorithm;deterministic algorithm;fuzzy set;heuristic;mathematical optimization;optimal design;optimization problem;robust control;system dynamics	Ruiying Zhao;Ye-Hwa Chen;Shengjie Jiao	2016	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2502275	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;uncertainty;defuzzification;adaptive control;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;adaptive system;neuro-fuzzy;control theory;mathematics;mechanical system;force;servomotor;fuzzy control system	Robotics	62.15878749400149	-5.718710521180929	116320

The quality of strip casting process depends on many process parameters, such as molten steel level in the tundish, solidification position and roll gap. Their relationships are complex and the strip casting process has the properties of nonlinear uncertainty and time-varying characteristics. Hence, it is difficult to establish an accurate process model for designing a model-based controller to monitor the strip quality. In this paper, a model-free control strategy is employed to overcome this problem. The self-organizing fuzzy control (SOFC) strategy is developed to control the molten steel level of a strip casting process. It has on-line learning ability and the rule tables can be modified automatically and continuously for responding to the system’s nonlinear and time-varying behaviors. Since this model-free controller has simple control structure and small number of control parameters, it is easy to implement. Simulation results based on semi-experimental system dynamic model and parameters are executed to show the control performance of the proposed intelligent controller.

5ae288cc4a03fa890482cd1adfcb394db342f856	recovering robustness in model-free reinforcement learning		Reinforcement learning (RL) is used to directly design a control policy using data collected from the system. This paper considers the robustness of controllers trained via model-free RL. The discussion focuses on the standard modelbased linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) problem as a special instance of RL. A simple example, originally formulated for LQG problems, is used to demonstrate that RL with partial observations can lead to poor robustness margins. It is proposed to recover robustness by introducing random perturbations at the system input during the RL training. The perturbation magnitude can be used to trade off performance for robustness. Two simple examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed method for enhancing robustness during RL training.	numerical analysis;perturbation function;reinforcement learning;robustness (computer science)	Harish K.

Design/methodology/approach – The approach contains fuzzy neural networks controller (FNNC), RBF network identification (RBFNI) and HGU system. FNNC may give control value to control HGU via fuzzy NN reasoning and computing according to HGU rotate speed error and error varying rate. RBFNI is used to identify the character of HGU system and predict its output. FNNC may adjust parameters and member function according to the identifying and predictive outcome of RBFNI. Findings – Sees that the hybridized control system is feasible and stable, and the controlling performance of the hybridized system is superior to conventional fuzzy controller. Research limitations/implications – The theoretical proof of stability of the proposed scheme still remains to be studied. Accessibility and availability of membership functions and control rules is also a limitation applied. Practical implications – The main advantage of the proposed method is that FNNC has reasoning, learning, and optimizing capability which can control effectively HGU. This will be useful for control engineers to control complex industrial plants. Originality/value – The paper proposes new combined approach to optimal control of HGU using FNNC, and it is aimed at operational researches and engineers, especially those who dealt with HUG controller.	accessibility;algorithm;artificial neural network;control system;control theory;fuzzy control system;machine learning;method (computer programming);nl (complexity);network interface controller;neuro-fuzzy;online and offline;optimal control;performance rating;radial basis function network;settling time;simulation	Zhihuai Xiao;Jiang Guo;Hongtao Zeng;Pan Zhou;Shuqing Wang	2009	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684920910994079	electricity generation;optimal control;membership function;design methods;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;artificial neural network;electric generator;hybrid system	AI	62.39201133511676	-8.519672822738807	116629

The system dynamic is modelled by Itô-type stochastic differential equations. For general nonlinear stochastic systems, the H∞ control can be obtained by solving a second-order nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi inequality. In general, it is difficult to solve the second-order nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi inequality. Using fuzzy approach (T-S fuzzy model), the H∞ fuzzy control design for the nonlinear stochastic systems can be given via solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) instead of a second-order Hamilton-Jacobi inequality. A singular value decomposition (SVD) method is proposed in this study to solve the H∞ static output feedback fuzzy control problem. By the proposed SVD method, the problem of H∞ static output feedback fuzzy control design for nonlinear stochastic systems is characterized in terms of solving an eigenvalue problem (EVP). This EVP can be easily solved by using a LMI-based optimization method. Simulation example is provided to illustrate the design procedure and the expected performances.	block cipher mode of operation;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;jacobi method;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;nx bit;nonlinear system;performance;simulation;singular value decomposition;social inequality;stochastic process;system dynamics	Chung-Shi Tseng;Bor-Sen Chen	2010	International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584715	stochastic process;mathematical optimization;stochastic differential equation;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy control system;statistics	Robotics	67.64219901480273	0.005322259995460446	116890
06ae31142d9764f6ba16776615920665c9b57528	chaos synchronisation of continuous systems via scalar signal		By analyzing the issue of chaos synchronization in the literature, it can be noticed the lack of a general approach, which would enable any type of synchronization to be achieved. Similarly, there is the lack of a unified method for synchronizing both continuous-time and discrete-time systems via a scalar signal. This paper and the companion one [1] aim to bridge these two gaps by presenting a novel general unified framework to synchronize chaotic systems via a scalar signal. The framework, based on the concept of observer, enables any type of synchronization defined to date to be achieved for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems via a scalar signal. This paper focuses on continuous-time systems, while the companion paper [1] deals with discrete-time systems. Herein, the observer-based framework exploits a structural condition related to the uncontrollable eigenvalues of the error system. Several examples of different types of synchronization are illustrated, with the aim to show the capabilities of the approach.	chaos theory;synchronization of chaos;unified framework	Giuseppe Grassi;Adel Ouannas;Ahmad Taher Azar;Ahmed Gomaa Radwan;Christos K.

In this paper, we propose a new robust fixed-time controller design based on control Lyapunov function (CLF). The proposed controller guarantees fixed-time stability and achieves sector margin robustness. The homogeneous CLF in bi-limit is used to design a fixed-time controller. To simplify the discussion, we design a fixed-time controller for the double-integrator system.

The control action consists of the function of system state and disturbance components. The design of the function of state is based on the pole-placement technique and the function of disturbance is for the complete disturbance-counteraction on system performance. This work is based on the combination of functional observer design and multirate output sampling technique. Necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of the proposed controller are derived and the design procedure is given. It is shown that the proposed method relaxes some of the conditions of disturbance decoupled functional observer design, provided that the variation of disturbance in the two consecutive sampling instances is not significant. Numerical example is considered to illustrate the design procedure and its simplicity.	controller (control theory);data system;feedback;numerical method;sampling (signal processing);utility functions on indivisible goods	Neeli Satyanarayana;Sivaramakrishnan Janardhanan	2014	2014 American Control Conference	10.1109/ACC.2014.6858809	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;state observer	EDA	65.29016074586721	-2.84298834695654	117716

The control strategy, implemented using discrete-time model predictive control (MPC) is optimized using a certain set of constrains applied to the control signal u(k). MPC provides an integrated solution for controlling systems with interacting variables, complex dynamics and constraints. The paper will show that with a small modification in the control signal, the degree of performance deterioration can be reduced if the constraints are incorporated in the implementation, leading to the idea of constrained control.	complex dynamics;control theory;geforce 8 series;interaction;mathematical optimization;pitch (music);unified model	R.

Different from all previous works on this topic, we employ stochastic instead of periodic perturbations, allow arbitrarily long output delays and consider a dynamic map to be optimized. We incorporate a novel predictor feedback for delay compensation and show local exponential stability along with convergence to a small neighborhood of the unknown extremum point. For the purpose of the proof, we apply a backstepping transformation and averaging theory in infinite dimensions for stochastic systems. Moreover, simulations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed predictor-feedback scheme.	algorithm;kerrison predictor;map;maxima and minima;newton;simulation;stochastic process;time complexity	Damir Ru&#x0161;iti;Giulio Evangelisti;Tiago Roux Oliveira;Matthias Gerdts;Miroslav Krsti&#x0107;	2019	IEEE Control Systems Letters	10.1109/LCSYS.2018.2851602	periodic graph (geometry);backstepping;mathematical optimization;exponential stability;convergence (routing);mathematics	Vision	66.90799839524469	0.24878891770836686	118633

The swarm intelligence-based structure preservation MOR can be used for a standard model as a criterion for different structure preservation interconnect MOR methods. In the proposed technique, the PSO method is used for predicting the unknown elements of structure-preserving reduced-order modelling of interconnect circuits. The prediction is based on minimising the difference of transform function between the original full-order and desired reduced-order systems maintaining the full-order structure in the reduced-order model. The proposed swarm-intelligence-based structure-preserving MOR method is compared with published work on structure preservation MOR SPRIM techniques.

Particularly, it is simple, it uses fewer control parameters and its convergence is independent of the initial conditions. In this paper, a novel artificial bee colony based maximum power point tracking algorithm (MPPT) is proposed. The developed algorithm, does not allow only overcoming the common drawback of the conventional MPPT methods, but it gives a simple and a robust MPPT scheme.

These techniques are essential for maintaining efficiency in recursive computations with zonotopes and are widely used in set-based estimation, hybrid systems verification, and fault detection. We first review existing methods and provide a new theoretical analysis of the method recently introduced by Scott et al. (2016). We then compare methods in terms of computational cost and overestimation error, and investigate the effects of zonotope dimension, initial order, and reduced order on these metrics. These results provide valuable guidance for the design of robust estimation and control algorithms that more effectively balance accuracy with computational cost.	zonohedron	Xuejiao Yang;Joseph K.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding a control strategy for a discrete time positive monotone system with bounded uncertainties such that the evolution of the system is guaranteed to be confined to a safe set in the state space for all times. By exploiting monotonicity, we propose an approach to this problem which is based on constraint programming. We find control strategies that are based on repetitions of finite sequences of control actions. We show that, under assumptions made in the paper, safety control of monotone systems does not require state measurement. We demonstrate the results on a signalized urban traffic network, where the safety objective is to keep the traffic flow free of congestion.	biological network;constraint programming;control theory;network congestion;state space;monotone	Sadra Sadraddini;Calin Belta	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7799014	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;control system;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.29220979785013	1.6068459123324927	119001

For low frequency noise generally it is employing an Active Noise Control (ANC) system. ANC systems operate generating a secondary anti-noise signal according to the superposition principle. Nevertheless, anti-noise signal generation requires techniques such as Filtered-X Least Mean Square (FxLMS) adaptive control algorithm. In this paper, a Single Frequency ANC system is evaluated to obtain an optimal step size to be employed in a Delayed FxLMS Algorithm in order to improve the system time response; thus, analysis, simulations and experiments for a prototype of Single Frequency ANC system are discussed.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;computer simulation;control system;experiment;least mean squares filter;prototype;settling time;simulation;superposition principle;system time;vii	Edgar A.

A more practical model of actuator failures than outage is considered. Based on linear matrix inequality approach, a method of designing a less conservative reliable controller is proposed. The resultant control system is regular, impulse-free and stable for all admissible uncertainties when all control components are operational. In fact, these property of the proposed control systems still hold even when some control components experience failures. Moreover, the result extends the case of observer-based reliable fuzzy control.

5877b87755db72cc097e11b5f6d0e40a1e3f3798	design of h2 (h∞)-based optimal structured and sparse static output feedback gains	journal article	This paper is devoted to the problem of designing an H2H2 (H∞H∞)-based optimal sparse static output feedback (SOF) controller for continuous linear time invariant systems. Incorporating an extra term for penalising the number of non-zero entries of the static output (state) feedback gain into the optimisation objective function, we propose an explicit scheme and an iterative process in order to identify the desired sparse structure of the feedback gain. In doing so, the so-called reweighted l1-norm, which is known as a convex relaxation of the l0-norm, is exploited to make a convex problem through an iterative process rather than the original NP-hard problem. This paper will also show that this problem reformulation allows us to incorporate additional constraints, such as regional pole placement constraints which provide more control over the satisfactory transient behavior and closed-loop pole location, into the designing problem. Then using the obtained structural constraints, we solve the structural H2H2 (H∞H∞) SOF problem. Illustrative examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.	block cipher mode of operation;h2 database engine;sparse matrix	Ahmadreza Argha;Li Li;Steven W. Su	2017	J.

The control strategy is based on the input-output feedback linearization and fuzzy approximation of controller synthesized to take care of the nonlinear, time-varying plant parameter changes.

84950b7a304612e55dec853e57c65634f5cc4ff3	switch observability for differential-algebraic systems.: analysis, observer design and application to power networks		This thesis deals with observability of switched systems with unknown switching signals. Switched systems are used to model systems whose dynamics are subject so sudden changes. They can be used, for example, to model component outages in networked systems. Observability of switched systems describes the ability to reconstruct the state and the switching signal from input and output data. If the switched system models component outages, observability of the switching signal is related to fault detection and identification. In order to model electrical circuits and power networks, the individual modes of the switched system are given by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). This results in a switched DAE Eσẋ = Aσx+Bσu, y = Cσx+Dσu with switching signal σ. A switch might lead to jumps or even Dirac impulses in the solution of a switched DAE. In order to make use of these phenomena in the observability characterization, the concept of switch observability is introduced. It describes the ability to reconstruct state and switching signal from input and output data in case of a nonconstant switching signal. Switch observability is stronger than switching time observability, but weaker than switching signal observability. All three notions are analyzed and characterized both for homogeneous and inhomogeneous switched DAEs. In the inhomogeneous case, a focus lies on strong observability, i.e. observability for all inputs. Based on the concept of switch observability, a new observer is introduced: The switch observer combines information obtained before, at, and after a switching instant to simultaneously estimate state and switching signal of the system. The benefit of switch observability and the corresponding observer is highlighted by power network examples.	differential algebraic equation;dirac delta function;fault detection and isolation;input/output;switching time	Ferdinand Küsters	2018				Embedded	67.27727585770857	3.3150607135708463	120449

In the proposed method, the well-known H\(_\infty \) concepts are used for minimizing the effects of the uncertainty on the estimation of the states and reconstruction of the faults using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Also LMIs are developed for providing a sufficient condition for the stability of the observer. As the case study, an industrial boiler is considered as a nonlinear system and the proposed robust observer illustrates robust performance on estimation of its states and reconstruction of its fault in the presence of uncertainties. The resulting outcomes demonstrate promising capabilities of the proposed methodology.	nonlinear system	Hesam Odin Komari Alaei;Alireza Yazdizadeh	2017	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-016-2046-9	computer science;mathematical optimization;observer (quantum physics);nonlinear system;matrix (mathematics);state observer;control theory	Robotics	63.857237447741895	-4.72420102166571	120761
4b08159b8c797e7544cf5d79def588fe16b48ed7	flatness based control of a hvac system		This paper studies the flatness-based control of a nonlinear multi-input multi-output heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) system. First, a novel method for checking flatness property is used to verify that the given HVAC model is flat and that the flat outputs are the temperature and the humidity ratio of the thermal space. Since the flat outputs are also the variables, which one usually wants to control, it is relatively easy to construct a flatness-based feedforward control for the HVAC model. We define the appropriate trajectories for the flat outputs and then the controller is computed from the parametrization of system inputs in terms of flat outputs and their derivatives. The trajectories of flat outputs are chosen such that the temperature and the humidity ratio converge asymptotically from the initial values to the desired values. Simulations are made, which show the effectiveness of the approach.

eb6a971503f8d2ce11ea39a396ff5f0d057e89df	data-driven modeling of a coupled electric drives system using regularized basis function volterra kernels		In this paper, we consider the problem of data-driven modeling for systems containing nonlinear sensors. The issue is explored via an established nonlinear benchmark in the system identification community, referred to as the “coupled electric drives.” In the benchmark system, nonlinearity emerges in the pulse transducer used to measure the angular velocity of a pulley, which is invariant to the direction of rotation. In order to model the nonlinear dynamics without the use of extensive prior knowledge, we estimate a nonparametric Volterra series model using a regularized basis function approach. While the Volterra series is typically an impractical modeling tool due to the large number of parameters required, we obtain accurate models using only a short estimation dataset, by directly regularizing the basis function expansions of each Volterra kernel in a Bayesian framework.	basis function;volterra's function	Jeremy G.

Other works attempt to circumvent the matching condition by using multiple observers in cascade, or higher order sliding modes, whilst the minimum phase condition can be relaxed at the cost of some faults and the states being not estimated, or the fault estimation being corrupted by the fault time derivative (or other dynamics). For the proposed scheme in this paper, only one observer is required, the minimum phase condition is relaxed to detectability, and the matching condition is greatly simplified to a condition related to the system dimensions which makes the scheme also applicable to the case where there are less outputs than faults. Finally, a simulation example is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed observer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed hybrid-learning algorithm changes the interval type-2 model parameters adaptively to minimize some criterion function as new information becomes available and to match desired input-output data pairs. Its antecedent sets are type-2 fuzzy sets, its consequent sets are type-1 fuzzy sets, and its inputs are interval type-2 non-singleton fuzzy numbers with uncertain standard deviations. As reported in the literature, the performance indices of hybrid models have proved to be better than those of the individual training mechanisms used alone. Comparison with non-hybrid interval A2-C1 type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic systems and with non-hybrid A1-C0 type-1 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic systems shows that the proposed hybrid mechanism is a well-performing non-linear adaptive method that enables the interval type-2 fuzzy model to match an unknown non-linear mapping and to converge very fast. Experiments were carried out involving the application of the hybrid interval A2-C1 type-2 non-singleton type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic systems for modeling and prediction of the scale-breaker entry temperature in a hot strip mill for three different types of coils. The results demonstrate how the interval type-2 fuzzy system learns from selected input-output data pairs and improves its performance as hybrid training progresses.	formal system;fuzzy logic	Gerardo M.

dfd66e827ec2ccb7baf1779af22f530cb0f31102	network abstraction with guaranteed performance bounds		A proper abstraction of a large-scale linear consensus network with a dense coupling graph is one whose number of coupling links is proportional to its number of subsystems and its performance is comparable to the original network. Optimal design problems for an abstracted network are more amenable to efficient optimization algorithms. From the implementation point of view, maintaining such networks are usually more favorable and cost-effective due to their reduced communication requirements across a network. Therefore, approximating a given dense linear consensus network by a suitable abstract network is an important analysis and synthesis problem. In this paper, we develop a framework to compute an abstraction of a given large-scale linear consensus network with guaranteed performance bounds using a nearly linear time algorithm. First, the existence of abstractions of a given network is proven. Then, we present an efficient and fast algorithm for computing a proper abstraction of a given network.

This paper proposes the use of a multimodel framework for optimal trajectory profile generation for such processes using only routine operating data instead of rigorous first principle models. Local linear models developed at the operating points are interpolated to describe the nonlinear dynamics of the process. The multi-model developed is the basis for trajectory optimization. The novelty of the work lies in the usage of plant archived data for training the multimodel framework. Further a simplified weighting strategy is proposed for interpolation of local model dynamics during transition. Simulation results on a polystyrene process illustrate the capability of the proposed approach.	algorithm;archive;computation;interpolation;linear model;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;p versus np problem;polymer;process modeling;scheduling (computing);simulation;small-bias sample space;trajectory optimization;wikiwikiweb	Jain Rajni;Gugaliya Jinendra;Srinivasan Ranganathan	2013	2013 American Control Conference	10.1109/ACC.2013.6580358	control engineering;open-loop controller;mathematical optimization;computer science;engineering;control theory	Robotics	57.274655550779336	-5.687712731190692	121280

The hybrid control strategy comprises a state estimator, namely Luenberger-like nonlinear estimator (LNE) and the feedback linearizing controller (FLC). The observation scheme aims to estimate the imprecisely known parameter based on the available measurement. For the representative distillation unit, the state predictor is formulated using eywords: atch rectifier imulation uenberger-like nonlinear estimator eedback linearizing controller only a component material balance equation around the condenser–reflux drum system. It clearly indicates the existence of a process/model mismatch and this discrepancy is efficiently taken care of by the corrector part of the LNE. In the subsequent phase, the FLC is synthesized for the example system. The derived nonlinear FLC–LNE controller shows better performance compared to a traditional proportional integral (PI) law. The simple structure, straightforward design and good performance make this nonlinear controller attractive for online use. . Introduction Batch processing is becoming more important due to the rapid xpansion of fine chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. atch operations are widely applied in these industries because f the low amount and the frequent change of the products. Withut using a train of continuous columns, one single batch rectifier as the ability to separate a multicomponent mixture into several roducts at a much lower capital cost. Now-a-days, the product purity requirements are usually strict nd a significant economic penalty exists when the specification equirements are not met. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a orrect methodology for tight composition control. Frattini-Fileti nd Rocha-Pereira (1997) formulated the predictive and adaptive ontrol laws to deal with the time-varying nature of the batch disillation. Barolo and Berto (1998) derived a state estimator based onlinear internal model control. To compute the top product omposition from selected tray temperature measurements, they esigned the extended Luenberger observer. A nonlinear model redictive controller was synthesized by Dechechi, Luz, Assis, aciel, and Maciel Filho (1998) for distillate composition regulaion. Alvarez-Ramirez, Monroy-Loperena, Cervantes, and Morales 2000) investigated the performance of a classical PID controller ith antireset windup and an observer. In the subsequent period, isiovici and Cruz (2001) proposed an inferential control structure or the multicomponent batch columns using an extended Kalman lter.

Then, Li and Wozny (2001) proposed an adaptive controller, in which, a recursive least-square estimation with a variable forgetting factor is used. Monroy-Loperena and Alvarez-Ramirez (2003) presented a method for the identification and nonlinear control of a batch distillation. Recently Gundale and Jana (2007) reported an adaptive estimator-based generic model controller for a multicomponent batch rectifier. Batch distillation is a nonlinear, complex and high-order separation process. It is intrinsically dynamic, making the control a more challenging task. Composition profiles and operating conditions may change over a wide range of values during the entire batch operation and the state estimators can effectively deal with the nonstationary nature of the batch rectifiers (Mujtaba & Macchietto, 1996). Most of the work reported the nonlinear state estimation and control of continuous distillation systems. Relatively few articles address the issue of estimator-based nonlinear control of batch rectifiers. It is with this intention that the present work has been undertaken. The main contributions of this work are highlighted below. (i) It is realized that most of the nonlinear state estimation algorithms involve complex and lengthy formulation. Originally, the large predictor model and complex structure of the closed-loop observer complicate the overall design. In this contribution, the Luenbergerlike nonlinear estimator (LNE) (Biagiola & Figueroa, 2004) has been developed for the example system. Keeping the issue of observer design complexity in mind, the LNE is formulated such a way that the predictor model includes only component mole balance equation around the condenser–reflux drum envelope and an extra state equation having no dynamics.

The homogeneous domination approach and the Nussbaum-type gain method are applied to design an adaptive state-feedback controller. A hysteretic type of quantiser is incorporated to reduce actuator chattering. The proposed controller can ensure that all signals of the nonlinear system are globally bounded, and that the system state asymptotically converges to zero. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed techniques.	nonlinear system	Wenhui Liu;Cheng-Chew Lim;Shengyuan Xu	2017	Int. J.

The design conditions are obtained by using a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function and the Finsler's Lemma. A robust filter, that minimizes an upper bound to the H∞ performance of the estimation error, is obtained as the solution of an optimization problem. A more precise geometric representation of the parameter time variation was used in order to obtain less conservative design conditions. Robust filters for time-invariant, as well as arbitrarily time-varying, polytopic systems can be obtained as a particular case of the proposed method.

The control aim is to maintain the pH within specific limits and to minimize CO2 losses. The control scheme is based on a Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) algorithm with sensor deadband approach. In this algorithm, the controller execution frequency is adapted to the process dynamics. The event-based scheme works with low sampling frequency if controlled variable, pH in this case, is inside an established band. Otherwise, when the pH value is outside the band, the controller actuation frequency is increased to try to drive it quickly near the setpoint based on the selected tolerance. In such a way, the event-based control algorithm allows to establish a tradeoff between control performance and number of process update actions. This fact can be directly related with reduction of CO2 injection times, what is also reflected in CO2 losses. The control structure is first evaluated through simulations using a nonlinear model for microalgal production in tubular photobioreactors. Afterwards, real experiments are presented on an industrial photobioreactor in order to verify the results obtained through simulations. Additionally, the real tests on the industrial plant are used to verify the event-based control scheme in the case of plant-model mismatch, presence of measurement noise and disturbances. Moreover, the control results are compared with classical time-based solutions using well-known control performance indexes.

Firstly, a variety of nonlinear mathematical models for these satellite control systems are described and analyzed for the purpose of fault diagnosis. These satellite control systems are classified into two classes of nonlinear dynamical systems. Then, several fault diagnostic observers using sliding mode and learning approaches are presented. Sliding mode with time-varying switching gains, second order sliding mode, and high order sliding mode differentiators are respectively used in the proposed diagnostic observers to deal with modeling uncertainties. Neural model-based and iterative learning algorithms-based online learning es-timators are respectively used in the diagnostic observers for the purpose of isolating and estimating faults. Finally, conclusions and future work on the health monitoring and fault diagnosis for satellite control systems are provided.	algorithm;control system;dynamical system;estimation theory;fault detection and isolation;isolation (database systems);iterative method;machine learning;mathematical model;nonlinear system;online machine learning;simulation	Qing Wu;Mehrdad Saif	2009	JCP	10.4304/jcp.4.10.1022-1032	simulation;index term;computer science;control system;mathematical model;control theory;observer	Robotics	63.22235595691392	-8.012713785685614	122024

Flat systems have the useful property that the input and the state can be completely characterised by the so-called flat output. We propose a spline parametrisation for the flat output, the performance output, the states and the inputs. Using this parametrisation the problem of constrained trajectory planning can be cast into a simple quadratic programming problem. An important result is that the B-spline parametrisation used gives exact results for constrained linear continuous-time system. The result is exact in the sense that the constrained signal can be made arbitrarily close to the boundary without having intersampling issues as one would have in sampled-data systems. Simulation examples are presented, involving the generation of rest-to-rest trajectories. In addition, an experimental result of the method is also presented, where two methods to generate trajectories for a magnetic-levitation maglev system in the presence of constraints are compared and each method's performance is discussed. The first method uses the nonlinear model of the plant, which turns out to belong to the class of flat systems. The second method uses a linearised version of the plant model around an operating point. In every case, a continuous-time description is used. The experimental results on a real maglev system reported here show that, in most scenarios, the nonlinear and linearised models produce almost similar, indistinguishable trajectories.	motion planning;polynomial;spline (mathematics)	Fajar Suryawan;José A.

However, it is a very important problem how to tune PID parameters, because these parameters have a great influence on the stability and the performance of the control system. On the other hand, lots of works for the robust control have been carried out to cope with system uncertainties. Then, some PID parameter tuning methods have been proposed based on the robust stability. However, if the range of uncertainties is very wide, the control performance becomes quite conservative. By the way, the support vector machine (SVM) has been proposed as one of the pattern recognition methods and gets lots of attention in last decades. The main motivation in this paper is to present a design scheme of controllers with the switching structure, in which some robust PID controllers are suitably switched using the SVM. Finally, the proposed control scheme is numerically evaluated on a simulation example.	computer;control system;numerical analysis;numerical weather prediction;pid;pattern recognition;principal component analysis;process architecture;robust control;simulation;support vector machine	Kenji Takao;Toru Yamamoto;Takao Hinamoto	2006	The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings	10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247121	pid controller;robust control;control engineering;support vector machine;adaptive control;computer science;control system;machine learning;control theory	Robotics	62.74936795494986	-9.01706024722921	122376

187bb642a6827b323cc37a47dbfbc95799e95400	interval methods for real-time capable robust control of solid oxide fuel cell systems		Reliable control strategies for complex dynamic systems have to account for stability and robustness despite the presence of both parameter uncertainty and measurement errors. In addition, such control strategies have to comply with performance specifications that can be described either by the minimization of suitable cost functions or by direct specifications of desired reference trajectories. To handle bounded uncertainty and errors in a reliable way, it is possible to include the use of interval analysis in real-time control environments. Previous work has shown that approaches based on the general methodology of sliding mode and predictive control are promising options in this context. This paper presents a comparison of the properties of interval extensions of both types of control procedures for the thermal subsystem of a high-temperature solid oxide fuel cell.

To provide a better precision of the fresh-air temperature, the system works in three different modes which need three different control rules. In this paper, these three modes are introduced firstly, and then a design of the three fuzzy controllers is described in detail.

These mechanisms use derivative action in processing opponent actions and, in some cases, can lead to behavior converging to Nash equilibria in previously nonconvergent situations. We analyze convergence in the case of exact and approximate derivative measurements of the dynamic update mechanisms.

In the case of approximate derivative measurements, we derive a characterization of local convergence that shows how the dynamic update mechanisms can converge if the traditional static counterparts do not.

We assume that wind is strong enough to let each WTs produce the required power and propose different closed-loop model predictive control (MPC) dispatching algorithms. Similar to the existing approaches based on MPC, our methods do not require to replace WT hardware components, but only software changes in the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system or integration with the middleware system of the WF. However, differently from other MPC schemes, we augment the model of a WT with an auto regressive moving average (ARMA) predictor of the wind turbulence, which captures the wind dynamics over the MPC control horizon. This allows us to develop both stochastic and deterministic MPC algorithms. In order to compare different MPC schemes and demonstrate improvements with respect to classic open-loop schedulers, we performed simulations using the SimWindFarm toolbox for MATLAB. We show that MPC controllers allow to achieve reduction of stresses even in the case of large installations, such as the 100-WTs Thanet offshore WF.	algorithm;data acquisition;kerrison predictor;matlab;middleware;nasa world wind;simulation;turbulence	Stefano Riverso;Simone Mancini;Fabio Sarzo;Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate	2017	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2016.2572170	wind speed;control engineering;simulation;computer science;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;predictive modelling;model predictive control	Visualization	56.574965434628744	-6.861944482009582	122760

The model combines the mass balances and a fuzzy inference system for approximating the uncertain dynamic of the kinetic reactions. The convergence, stability, and robustness of the observer are analyzed.

In this article, a decentralized control algorithm is proposed for large-scale linear building structures. A large-scale building structure is divided into a set of smaller substructures based on its finite element model. Interconnections between adjacent substructures are treated as disturbances to the individual substructure. Each substructure is controlled by its own local controller using linear quadratic Gaussian control scheme with acceleration measurements as feedback signals. A computational procedure is developed for the recursive estimation of the unknown disturbances to each substructure. Two cases, with substructure interface measurement and without substructure interface measurement respectively, are considered. A numerical example of the decentralized control of the 20-story Structural Engineers Association of California (SAC) benchmark linear building under seismic excitation is studied to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the decentralized control algorithm has quite good control performance compared with the conventional centralized control approach. Therefore, the proposed decentralized control algorithm is viable for structural control of largescale linear structural systems.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);centralized computing;control theory;distributed control system;finite element method;numerical analysis;recursion;simulation	Ying Lei;D.

While the proposed approach can, in general, be applied to multi-input systems, single-input systems are considered here for simplicity. It is shown that if a nominal control law is available to globally asymptotically stabilize the nominal system (without the input unmodeled dynamics), then a dynamic scaling based redesign of the control law can be performed to achieve global asymptotic stabilization of the system with the input unmodeled dynamics. The proposed control redesign approach is applicable to a wide class of nonlinear systems including triangular and non-triangular structures as long as a set of structural and inequality conditions on the system dynamics is satisfied and yields a global robust output-feedback stabilizing controller.	block cipher mode of operation;emoticon;hp 48 series;image scaling;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;optimal control;polynomial;reduction (complexity);social inequality;system dynamics;triangular matrix	Prashanth Krishnamurthy;Farshad Khorrami	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2630924	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;lyapunov redesign	Robotics	66.71980775823452	-3.7492993028646713	123106

Unlike usual results on linear systems, linear supply-rates are employed here for robustness and performance analysis using L1and L∞-gains. Robust stability analysis is performed using Integral Linear Constraints (ILCs) for which several class es of uncertainties are discussed. The approach is then extended to robust stabilization and performance optimiza tion. The obtained results are expressed in terms of robust linear programming problems that are equivalently turned i nto finite dimensional ones using Handelman’s Theorem.

Particularly, it has created a new perspective of decoupling and linearization. With reference to the non-linearization and strong coupling of multivariable permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), this paper presents internal model control (IMC) of PMSM using RBF neural network inverse (RBF-NNI) system. In the proposed control scheme, the RBF-NNI system is introduced to construct a pseudo-linear system with original system, and internal model controller is utilized as a robust controller. Therefore, the new system has advantages of above two methods. The efficiency of the proposed control scheme is evaluated through computer simulation results. By using the proposed control scheme, original system is successfully decoupled, and expresses strong robustness to load torque disturbance, the whole system provides good static and dynamic performance.

6e1a39476d5224c9c1a2d53989666fc185a26494	equivalent neural network optimal coefficients using forgetting factor with sliding modes		The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) concept is familiar in methods whose task is, for example, the identification or approximation of the outputs of complex systems difficult to model. In general, the objective is to determine online the adequate parameters to reach a better point-to-point convergence rate, so that this paper presents the parameter estimation for an equivalent ANN (EANN), obtaining a recursive identification for a stochastic system, firstly, with constant parameters and, secondly, with nonstationary output system conditions. Therefore, in the last estimation, the parameters also have stochastic properties, making the traditional approximation methods not adequate due to their losing of convergence rate. In order to give a solution to this problematic, we propose a nonconstant exponential forgetting factor (NCEFF) with sliding modes, obtaining in almost all points an exponential convergence rate decreasing. Theoretical results of both identification stages are performed using MATLAB® and compared, observing improvement when the new proposal for nonstationary output conditions is applied.	approximation;artificial neural network;bimalleolar fractures;coefficient;complex systems;convergence (action);estimation theory;matlab;np-equivalent;point-to-point protocol;population parameter;rate of convergence;recursion;stochastic process;exponential	Karen Alicia Aguilar Cruz;José de Jesús Medel Juárez;Romeo Urbieta Parrazales	2016		10.1155/2016/4642052	mathematical optimization;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;statistics	ML	57.62761388487974	2.4207188423750403	123412

A proximal aiming controller design scheme is presented, which involves a certain modification of the original dynamics. The modified dynamics in effect provide state constraint removal. Both a feasible near-set of initial states associated with the proposed feedback scheme and a procedure for obtaining the modified dynamics are also developed. The novel feature of the proposed discontinuous feedback control law is that it can steer the system state back to the interior of state constraint set S as quickly as possible when state arrives at (or near) the boundary of S. A numerical example is also given to illustrate the effectiveness of the design scheme.	convex set;differential inclusion;emoticon;feedback;multi-function printer;numerical analysis;optimal control	Yong-Mei Ma;Guang-Hong yang	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2007.4389419	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	66.79731089108483	-1.097084804931934	123539

To address this problem, we firstly prove the equivalence of the partial and full sampling strategies for the decoupled nonlinear system. Then a compressed form is presented by reformulating the cross-correlation items.

This expansion could provide much more flexibility than a conventional PI-PD controller design. The tuning method is based on the solution of an optimization problem. For setting the six parameters of the fractional PI<sup>α</sup>-PD<sup>ß</sup> controller, the proposed method is based on the minimum integral squared error (ISE) criterion with a minimum control effort. The integral criterion is calculated by using Hall-Sartaurius method.

039412010d342265d46eee45f41ac02bb5d80ef2	fuzzy approximation of des state		State estimation of dynamic systems is a resort often used when only a subset of the state variables can be directly measured; observers are the entities computing the system state from the knowledge of its internal structure and its (partially) measured behaviour. The problem of discrete event systems (DES) estimation has been addressed in (Ramirez, 2003) and (Giua 2003); in these works the marking of a Petri net (PN) model of a partially observed event driven system is computed from the evolution of its inputs and outputs. The state of a system can be also inferred using the knowledge on the duration of activities. However this task becomes complex when, besides the absence of sensors, the durations of the operations are uncertain; in this situation the observer obtains and revise a belief that approximates the current system state. Consequently this approach is useful for non critical applications of state monitoring and feedback in which an approximate computation is allows. The uncertainty of activities duration in DES can be handled using fuzzy PN (FPN) (Murata, 1996), (Cardoso, 1999), (Hennequin, 2001), (Pedrycz, 2003), (Ding, 2005); this PN extension has been applied to knowledge modelling (Chen, 1990), (Koriem, 2000), (Shen, 2003), planning (Cao, 1996), reasoning (Gao, 2003) and controller design (Andreu, 1997), (Leslaw, 2004). In these works the proposed techniques include the computation of imprecise markings; however the class of models dealt does not include strongly connected PN for the modelling of cyclic behaviour. In this article we address the problem of state estimation of DES for calculating the fuzzy marking of a Fuzzy Timed Petri Net (FTPN); for this purpose a set of matrix expressions for the recursive computing the current fuzzy marking is developed. The article focuses on FTPN whose structure is a Marked Graph (called Fuzzy Timed Marked Graph -FTMG) because it allows showing intuitively the problems of the marking estimation in exhibiting cyclic behaviour.	approximation algorithm;computation;dynamical system;entity;entity–relationship model;feedback;fixed-pattern noise;item unique identification;marked graph;petri net;recursion;sensor;strongly connected component	Juan Carlos González-Castolo;Ernesto López-Mellado	2009		10.4018/978-1-59904-849-9.ch102	discrete mathematics;fuzzy logic;petri net;marked graph;computer science	AI	58.27034222712804	1.1357620999313895	124764

A new set of formula based on geometric construction are proposed to estimate the steady-and-oversaturation delay, which occasionally have the only one kind of controllable variable of the green splits. As a dynamic model, it can automatically adjust the split green ratio to achieve the minimal delay.Since the objective function of over-saturation delay is linear and under-saturation delay is nonlinear, the combination of linear and nonlinear program can be applied to either over-saturation or under-saturation situation. The simulation result shows that dynamic allocation of green time using LP combined with NLP can obtain less delay than using single liner programming.	natural language processing	Xuan Zhou;Beom Seok Park;Young Chul Kim	2010			control engineering;mathematical optimization;linear-fractional programming;nonlinear programming;mathematics;linearity;algorithm	ML	61.29533606896822	-0.969627771486106	124835

The optimal information-constrained control problem reduces to an infinite-dimensional convex program and admits a decomposition based on the Bellman error, which is the object of study in approximate dynamic programming. In this paper, we apply our general theory to an information-constrained variant of the scalar linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem. We give an upper bound on the optimal steady-state value of the quadratic performance objective and present explicit constructions of controllers that achieve this bound. We show that the obvious certainty-equivalent control policy is suboptimal when the information constraints are very severe, and exhibit another policy that performs better in this low-information regime. In the two extreme cases of no information (open-loop) and perfect information, these two policies coincide with the optimum.	approximation algorithm;bellman equation;convex optimization;cost efficiency;distortion;dynamic programming;linear system;markov property;mutual information;network address translation;optimal control;steady state	Ehsan Shafieepoorfard;Maxim Raginsky	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760793	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;optimal projection equations;mathematical optimization;linear-quadratic regulator;convex optimization;optimal control;multidimensional systems;control theory;mathematics;markov process;quadratic programming	ML	60.617661037845856	1.0526701249878798	124997

The state observer is designed in terms of a disturbance estimator. A stabilizing state feedback control is designed for the observer by the backstepping transformation, which is an observer based output feedback stabilizing control for the original system. The well-posedness and stability of the closed-loop system are concluded. The numerical simulations show that the proposed scheme is quite effectively. This is a first result on active disturbance rejection control for a PDE with both boundary uncertainty and external disturbance.	block cipher mode of operation	Hongyinping Feng;Bao-Zhu Guo	2017	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2017.08.004	estimator;alpha beta filter;backstepping;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;heat equation;separation principle;observer (quantum physics);active disturbance rejection control;state observer;control engineering	Robotics	67.31720973819931	-3.2294199411819515	125260

In this paper, the VDSE is addressed through the method based on Bayesian inference. A priori including the fault position among other grid conditions is used to estimate the residual voltage at each bus based on the measurement quantities, including their uncertainties. The dip duration is calculated with the time setting of protection system incorporating the uncertainties due to dip detection algorithm of the root mean square values.

With the advancement in artificial intelligence techniques, the applications of fuzzy logic-based control systems have increased manifolds. This paper proposes a reduced rule fuzzy logic controller (FLC) in the voltage control loop of a shunt active power filter (APF), which is approximating a conventional large rule FLC. The difference between the controlled outputs of two controllers is compensated by proposed compensating factors. The dynamic response and harmonic compensation performance of proposed 4-rule approximated fuzzy logic controller (AFLC) is compared with 25-rule FLC. A three-phase shunt APF is used for harmonic and reactive power compensation. The proposed scheme is tested with randomly varying single and multiple non-linear loads. The simulation results presented under transient and steady-state conditions confirm that the proposed 4-rule AFLC efficiently approximates the 25-rule FLC. The proposed control methodology takes less computational time and computational memory as the numbers of rules are reduced significantly.	approximation algorithm;electric power quality;fuzzy logic	Rambir Singh;Asheesh K.

We provide results for the synthesis of distributed output-feedback LPV controllers for heterogeneously scheduled distributed LPV systems in linear fractional (LFT) representation. This result includes multi-agent systems (MAS) as a special case and therefore allows gain-scheduled control when each agent's LPV dynamics is dependent on individual parameter values. This in turn, makes it possbile to consider nonlinear agent models if they can be represented as quasi-LPV models. Furthermore, we propose robust stability and performance conditions for switching interaction topologies. We also provide a convex analysis condition with decomposable parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions for reduced conservatism.	block cipher mode of operation;convex analysis;distributed control system;layer four traceroute;lyapunov fractal;multi-agent system;nonlinear system	Christian Hoffmann;Annika Eichler;Herbert Werner	2013	2013 American Control Conference		robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;convex optimization;control theory;feedback;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	64.49528512444579	3.630140532933622	126662
913e44fe4afd453bf9fb416a328412c6ad352c8e	an integrated control strategy to solve the disturbance decoupling problem for max-plus linear systems with applications to a high throughput screening system	manufacturing systems;max;computacion informatica;max algebra;grupo de excelencia;algebra;ciencias basicas y experimentales;discrete event systems;geometrical control theory	This paper presents the new investigations on the disturbance decoupling problem (DDP) for the geometric control of max-plus linear systems. The classical DDP concept in the geometric control theory means that the controlled outputs will not be changed by any disturbances. In practical manufacturing systems, solving for the DDP would require further delays on the output parts than the existing delays caused by the system breakdown. The new proposed modified disturbance decoupling problem (MDDP) in this paper ensures that the controlled output signals will not be delayed more than the existing delays caused by the disturbances in order to achieve the just-in-time optimal control. Furthermore, this paper presents the integration of output feedback and open-loop control strategies to solve for the MDDP, as well as for the DDP. If these controls can only solve for the MDDP, but not for the DDP, an evaluation principle is established to compare the distance between two output signals generated by controls solving for the MDDP and DDP, respectively. This distance can be interpreted as the number of tokens or firings that are needed in order for the controls to solve for the DDP. Moreover, another alternative approach is finding a new disturbance mapping in order to guarantee the solvability of the DDP by the same optimal control for the MDDP. The main results of this paper are illustrated by using a timed event graph model of a high throughput screening system in drug discovery.	control theory;coupling (computer programming);linear system;throughput	Ying Shang;Laurent Hardouin;Mehdi Lhommeau;Carlos Andrey Maia	2016	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2015.10.030	control engineering;control theory;mathematics	Arch	68.01517064276081	-1.669513545821668	126714

This paper proves that for each causal linear time-invariant ILC, there is an equivalent feedback that achieves the ultimate ILC error with no iterations. Remarkably, this equivalent feedback depends only on the ILC operators and hence requires no plant knowledge. This equivalence is obtained whether or not the ILC includes current-cycle feedback. If the ILC system is internally stable and converges to zero error, there exists an internally stabilizing feedback that approaches zero error at high gain. Since conventional feedback requires no iterations, there is no reason to use causal ILC. ? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We focus on the design of robust full order and reduced order filters, which can guarantee a prescribed energy-to-peak disturbance attenuation level. Two approaches are presented to solve the filtering problem: delay-independent (suitable for systems with unknown delay bounds) and delay-dependent (suitable for systems with known delay bounds). Sufficient conditions for the existence of admissible filters are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities, upon which both the delay-independent and dependent filtering problems are cast into convex optimization problems. These two approaches also incorporate a new parameter-dependent stability result into the filter designs. This greatly reduces the conservatism of the quadratic framework.

Typically, switching control is based on convex, in particular quadratic, Lyapunov functions, which impose conservative solutions. In this brief we propose a switching technique based on ad hoc nonconvex Lyapunov functions, recently introduced in the literature. Remarkable advantages can be shown by considering well-known criteria such as L2 and H∞. We propose a switching strategy based on the minimum of quadratic Lyapunov functions and we show that such a strategy outperforms the effect achieved with the optimal constant gain. Explicit bounds can be assured. The scheme is amenable for implementation as very simple tools such as Lyapunov and Riccati equations are involved. Results are also validated by simulations of a realistic building structure under seismic action, based on the recorded data of the El Centro earthquake.	hoc (programming language);lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;simulation	Franco Blanchini;Patrizio Colaneri;Daniele Casagrande;Paolo Gardonio;Stefano Miani	2014	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2013.2258920	damping;control engineering;mathematical optimization;lyapunov function;engineering;gain-switching;vibration control;lyapunov equation;control theory;mathematics;lyapunov redesign	Visualization	66.58112424697417	-0.6667863680652908	127186

To develop an intelligent fault-tolerant control system, we begin by constructing a design model of the system using a hierarchical learning structure in the form of Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems. Afterwards, the fault-tolerant control scheme is designed based on stable adaptive fuzzy/neural control, where its on-line learning capabilities are used to capture the unknown dynamics caused by faults. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods has been studied by extensive analysis of system zero dynamics and asymptotic tracking abilities for both indirect and direct adaptive control cases, and by “component level model” simulation of the General Electric XTE46 turbine engine.	fault tolerance;fuzzy control system;online and offline;online machine learning;simulation	Yixin Diao;Kevin M.

Systems with conventional LQR controllers present good stability properties and are optimal with respect to a certain performance index. However, LQR control does not assure robust stability when the system is highly uncertain. In this paper, a convex model of converter dynamics is obtained taking into account uncertainty of parameters. In addition, the LQR control for switching converters is reviewed. In order to apply the LQR control in the uncertain converter case, we propose to optimize the performance index by using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As a consequence, a new robust control method for dc-dc converters is derived. This LMI-LQR control is compared with classical LQR control when designing a boost regulator. Performance of both cases is discussed for load and line perturbations, working at nominal and non nominal conditions. Finally, the correctness of the proposed approach is verified with experimental prototypes.	boost converter;computer simulation;computer-aided design;correctness (computer science);inverter (logic gate);linear matrix inequality;matlab;oracle application server;perturbation theory;prototype;pulse-width modulation;race condition;robust control;software prototyping;switched-mode power supply	Carlos Olalla;Ramon Leyva;Abdelali El Aroudi;Isabelle Queinnec	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2009.2017556	robust control;control engineering;linear-quadratic regulator;electronic engineering;process performance index;uncertainty;optimal control;linear matrix inequality;engineering;control system;power electronics;control theory;mathematics;robustness	Robotics	67.48088647511955	-7.984254775290676	127391
e8e49ae9e74c90497a541aacacfb9f7b48e88837	particle swarm optimization based fuzzy gain scheduled subspace predictive control		Abstract The key feature of data-driven Subspace Predictive Control (SPC) is its capability in on-line and automatically adaptation of SPC gains with no need to obtain the explicit model of the system. This feature makes SPC suitable to control nonlinear and time-varying systems. However, in conventional SPC persistently excitation (PE) signals are required to update the SPC gains in the presence of system variations. This procedure demands high computational load and has convergency issues. In this paper we propose a new approach to eliminate the requirement of applying PE signals without degrading the SPC performance. This can be done by using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Fuzzy Gain Scheduling (FGS) method to optimally update the SPC gains directly with no need to apply PE signals. The method is denoted by PSO-based FGS-SPC. In PSO-based FGS-SPC the SPC gains are optimally adapted by utilizing and evaluating auxiliary scheduling variables, which are correlated with the changes in system dynamics, as soon as a changes are observed in system dynamics without applying PE signals. Eliminating the PE in our proposed method reduces the computational load drastically. Moreover, in PSO-based FGS-SPC, the controller gain ranges (CGRs) of FGS technique are optimally auto-tuned by minimizing the SPC cost function via the PSO algorithm. As a result, the difficulty in finding the CGRs in FGS procedure for inverting the normalized gains is overcome by applying PSO technique on FGS. Consequently, the PSO-based FGS-SPC shows more efficient controlling performance than the SPC by optimally adapting the SPC gains. In addition, PSO-based FGS-SPC shows fast convergence capability and time efficiency over the SPC. Simulation results confirm efficiency and robustness of the method in the presence of constraints and noisy data.	mathematical optimization;particle swarm optimization	Saba Sedghizadeh;Soosan Beheshti	2018	Eng.

The architecture of the control system is based on two decoupled Proportional-Integral controllers, one for the set-point following and the other one for the load disturbance rejection task. The distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that, by assuming a first-order-plus-dead-time model of the process, the two controllers have the same parameters and the reference tracking performance is improved by suitably modifying the reference signal applied to the set-point following controller. Illustrative examples of the technique are given, including a comparison with an event-based one-degree-of-freedom Proportional-Integral controller.	control system;control theory;first-order predicate;integral theory (ken wilber);reduction (complexity);rejection sampling	Manuel Beschi;Sebastián Dormido;José Sánchez;Antonio Visioli	2012	2012 American Control Conference (ACC)		control engineering;feedforward neural network;real-time computing;controller;computer science;sensor;process control;control theory;automaton	Robotics	66.19731100235786	-6.825463470413398	127516

Abstract Uniform ultimate boundedness of a new class of switched linear systems is considered. A switched linear system in this class consists of m subsystems, and none of the individual subsystems need to be stabilizable. The switched linear system is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded for any pre-given bound if the combination of controllable components of states for all subsystems covers the entire state space. An algorithm for the design of continuous controllers and the switching strategy is given to provide the design of continuous controllers and the switching strategy. Finally, the simulations show the validity of the result.	algorithm;linear system;simulation;state space	Xiaoli Zhang;Yushun Fan	2003		10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1243809	mathematical optimization;controllability;computer science;state space;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Embedded	68.09873219308109	0.4424025875084298	127699

Plant feasibility is guaranteed upon convergence, but not at the successive operating points computed by the algorithm prior to convergence. This paper presents a strategy for guaranteeing rigorous constraint satisfaction of all iterates in the presence of plant-model mismatch and uncertainty in the gradient estimates. The proposed strategy relies on constructing constraint upper-bounding functions that are robust to the gradient uncertainty that results when the gradients are estimated by finite differences from noisy measurements. The performance of the approach is illustrated for the optimization of a continuous stirred-tank reactor.	gradient;modifier key	Alejandro G.

7f4fefde9e4eed0cefe74fd60ceea6e7b7dfe105	evaluation of a fault-tolerant scheme in a six-degree-of-freedom motion flight simulator		This paper discusses the evaluation of a neurally augmented fault-tolerant flight control scheme for a high-performance military aircraft featuring an adaptive actuator and sensor failure detection, isolation, and identification algorithm in a motion-based flight simulator. The design of the fault-tolerant control scheme is based on a nonlinear dynamic inversion scheme with a neural network-based augmentation for reducing the dynamic inversion errors associated with the occurrence of an actuator failure while a set of online learning neural observers is used for dealing with specific sensor failures. The failure detection, isolation, and identification scheme is based on an adaptive threshold technique for estimating failure bounds associated with both actuator and sensor failures. Also, an ‘ad-hoc’ parameter is proposed here for the novel task of evaluating the pilot workload in compensating for both actuator and sensor failures onboard the aircraft. A general outcome of the effort is a demonstration of the importance of realistic motion-based simulation environments for evaluation of this specific class of flight control laws. The study also demonstrated the importance of the neural augmentation for failure accommodation purposes and the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive threshold technique for failure identification purposes.	algorithm;artificial neural network;fault tolerance;fault-tolerant computer system;flight simulator;identification scheme;nonlinear system;simulation	Girish K.

68f02f7692d8ad97868831e6865bedaa7037a636	a novel model predictive controller for uncertain constrained systems		Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a method of choice for control of many industrial applications. MPC uses optimization based prediction of a model in a predetermined horizon to determine control action. While uncertainty is an inherent part of most dynamical systems, model mismatches in the case of uncertain dynamical system lead to undesirable closed loop response from steady state errors to instability. There are several research studies for robust MPC. However, most of the results are very conservative, where optimality is sacrificed to obtain worst case constraint satisfaction. This paper presents a novel MPC for control of non-linear uncertain dynamical systems with reliability type constraints, where the probability of violation of constraints is limited. We utilize polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) in order to propagate uncertainties. We show that it is possible to transform probabilistic constraints to a deterministic constraint on PCE coefficients. This approach prevents sampling of the uncertainty, thus it is efficient numerically and computationally.		Ehsan Harati;Hossein Ahmadi Noubari	2016	J.

A new exact-memory control scheme is first proposed, which consists of a standard linear state-feedback control law and an internal delay loop. The delay loop is embedded in the controller structure so as to reproduce the input delay behavior of the plant. With this controller structure, the resulting delay control synthesis problem is fully characterized by a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are convex on all design variables including the scaling factors associated with the IQC multipliers. The corresponding results on memoryless state-feedback control are also derived for cases when input-delay information is not available for feedback control. A numerical example has been used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	algorithmic efficiency;control theory;convex function;display lag;embedded system;feedback;gene regulatory network;image scaling;input lag;lagrange multiplier;linear matrix inequality;linear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;quadratically constrained quadratic program;robust control	Chengzhi Yuan;Fen Wu	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798332	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;von neumann stability analysis;real-time computing;control theory;mathematics;linear system	Robotics	64.63608961933241	-0.5187165549838002	128190
e6f2c9fe16395f08c70e1d4ad1e9cf1033230554	feedforward linearization and disturbance rejection of mechanical systems using acceleration measurements		Abstract   In this paper a time-delayed acceleration measurement is used to linearize a second order nonlinear system. A theoretical foundation is developed, and a control strategy is presented which handles the challenges related to classical linearization. Utilizing the acceleration measurement to directly cancel the nonlinearities constitute a feedforward approach which increases robustness with respect to unmodeled dynamics and model uncertainties. Due to the time-delay, one or more perturbation terms dependent on a previous state of the system appears. This work outlines a stability criterion which these terms must satisfy in order for the linearization to be valid, where it is shown that the performance of the scheme is dependent on the measurement time-delay. The proposed method proves feasible when compared to two other nonlinear control strategies, including a conventional linearization control law and a sliding mode control law. In comparison, the feedforward linearization features robust performance without aggressive control input.	feed forward (control);rejection sampling	Øivind Kåre Kjerstad;Roger Skjetne	2012		10.3182/20120620-3-DK-2025.00146	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;feedback linearization;linearization	Robotics	66.72948929671828	-9.776274654413774	128245

To overcome the difficulty to directly predict the plant state under uncertainties, a control design is based on a developed decomposition procedure, where a ‘generalised error’ in conjunction with auxiliary linear dynamic blocks with adjustable gains is introduced and the sliding variable is formed on the basis of this error. The effect of such a decomposition is to pull the input delay out of first step of the design procedure. As a result, similarly to the classical Smith predictor, the adaptive control architecture based only on the lumped-delays, i.e. without conventional in such cases difficult-implemented distributed-delay blocks. Two new adaptive control schemes are proposed. A linearisation-based control design is constructed for feedback control of an urban traffic ...	feedback;input lag;nonlinear system	Boris M.

850c0bd9464c087ffc4a96a4c04150041dbad850	simulation-based reachability analysis for nonlinear systems using componentwise contraction properties		A shortcoming of existing reachability approaches for nonlinear systems is the poor scalability with the number of continuous state variables. To mitigate this problem we present a simulationbased approach where we first sample a number of trajectories of the system and next establish bounds on the convergence or divergence between the samples and neighboring trajectories. We compute these bounds using contraction theory and reduce the conservatism by partitioning the state vector into several components and analyzing contraction properties separately in each direction. Among other benefits this allows us to analyze the effect of constant but uncertain parameters by treating them as state variables and partitioning them into a separate direction. We next present a numerical procedure to search for weighted norms that yield a prescribed contraction rate, which can be incorporated in the reachability algorithm to adjust the weights to minimize the growth of the reachable set.	algorithm;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;reachability;scalability;simulation	Murat Arcak;John N.

Finite-based model predictive control has proven to be an alternate digital control method for power converters. However, there are some real-time implementation issues, including specifically time delay, that have to be addressed in order to achieve the system reliability and stability as well as better performance. The proposed method compensates the delay time arising from measuring, calculating, and applying the optimal control sequence in the digital processor. In this way, the delay time is considered in the system input and optimal switching states are applied to the converter once they are available. The proposed method is studied through two benchmarks and verified numerically via MATLAB/Simulink.	benchmark (computing);broadcast delay;converter device component;matlab;numerical analysis;optimal control;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulink;switched-mode power supply	Mahlagha Mahdavi Aghdam;Li Li;Jianguo G.

In this method, an input-output linearization approach is applied to the system. Then a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) is formulated based on system constraints and the desired output performance. The solution to this GEVP leads to a controller which makes the output performance desirable and at the same time the estimated region of attraction is maximized.

However, such network characteristics have not been well considered in the fault detection and isolation of NCS. Making use of those statistical characteristics of NCS network-induced delay, a delay-distribution-based fault detection model is proposed, which is greatly different from the existing Markov switching process model. From this model together with a tighter bounding technique for cross-product terms, a delay-distribution-dependent H∞ fault detection filter is carried out with significantly improved results.

A reference velocity is designed for the autonomous vehicles to do contour line tracking. Based on Lashall invariance principle, an ideal controller is designed for the vehicle with ideal model and ideal information about the environmental concentration function to track the desired contour line. For the vehicle with possibly modeling uncertainty, we combine a neural controller containing a wavelet neural network (WNN) identifier with a robust control to construct a robust adaptive WNN control for the vehicle to track the desired environmental contour line. Then we give theoretical proof of the efficiency of the designed robust adaptive WNN control.

Further, the superheat temperature setpoint is conveniently taken as a constant value over the wide range of operating conditions. However, direct measurement of superheat is not always available, and estimates of superheat have limited robustness. Therefore identifying alternate signals in the control of vapor compression machines that correlate to efficiency is desired. In this paper, we consider a model-free extremum seeking algorithm that adjusts compressor discharge temperature setpoints in order to optimize energy efficiency. While perturbation-based extremum seeking methods have been known for some time, they suffer from slow convergence rates-a problem emphasized in application by the long time constants associated with thermal systems. Our method uses a new algorithm (time-varying extremum seeking), which has dramatically faster and more reliable convergence properties. In particular, we regulate the compressor discharge temperature using setpoints selected from a model-free time-varying extremum seeking algorithm. We show that the relationship between compressor discharge temperature and power consumption is convex (a requirement for this class of realtime optimization), and use time-varying extremum seeking to drive these setpoints to values that minimize power. The results are compared to the traditional perturbation-based extremum seeking approach. Experiments are performed demonstrating discharge temperature optimization from 72°C to 62°C for a particular set of experimental conditions where the power consumption is decreased from 525 W to 450 W, resulting in an increase in observed coefficient of performance (COP) of 14%.	algorithm;ccir system a;coefficient;control theory;convex function;discharger;emoticon;experiment;inner loop;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;setpoint (control system)	Daniel J.

645f4575f99d30a70e75b46858d44f738d3eca35	sliding mode control design for a sensorless sun tracker		The photovoltaic sun tracker is generally used to increase the electrical energy production. The sun tracker considered in this study has two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) and characterized by the lack of sensors. In this way, the tracker will have as set point the sun position at every second during the day for a specific period of five years. After sunset, the tracker goes back to the initial position automatically, which is sunrise. Sliding mode control is an important method used to solve various problems in control systems engineering. In robust control systems, the sliding mode control is often adopted due to its inherent advantages of easy realization, fast response and good transient performance as well as insensitivity to parameter uncertainties and disturbance. In this work, we apply sliding mode control (SMC) to ensure the tracking mechanism. Also, we design a sliding mode observer to replace the velocity sensor which is affected from a lot of measurement disturbances. The control results are established using Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations are shown to illustrate all the main results derived in this work. Experimental measurements show that this automatic dual-axis sun tracker increases the power production by over 40%.

The proposed computation procedure gives a discrete solution of the inverse problem constrained within the preliminary assumed discrete levels of the input. The number of these levels is directly connected to the final computation accuracy. The consistency of the proposed computation scheme for solving the inverse problem is extensively analyzed on a test dynamic process.

Thus, we propose the modified composite controller to show the ultimate boundedness of the singularly perturbed system with measurement noise. key words: singular perturbation, measurement noise, ultimate boundedness		Kyung-In Kang;Kyun-Sang Park;Jong-Tae Lim	2013	IEICE Transactions		singular perturbation;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics;algebra	Embedded	67.96083198887386	-3.9166498476380585	130078

4f735405f55e5abbfda92fa7833b0683758f4f44	asynchronous fault detection for continuous-time switched delay systems		This paper focuses on the fault detection (FD) problem for a class of continuous-time switched systems with state delay. Main goal is to design a switching strategy and its associated fault detection filters (FDFs) to detect faults. The switching signal of FDFs is first assumed to be with switching delay, which results in the asynchronous switching between the system modes and FDFs. Then, by constructing a novel switching strategy depending on the state and switching delays, the residual signal generated by FDFs is sensitive to fault while robust against disturbance under asynchronous switching. In addition, it is also shown that the proposed delay-dependent switching strategy can include some previous results, which illustrates its generality. The admissible solution of the FD problem is obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by an example. & 2015 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One of the crucial problems is that the effective wind speed cannot be measured directly due to the high disturbance of the wind speed and the high cost of sensors. Three algorithms are used to estimate the effective wind speed by solving power balance equations, and the estimated wind speed is used to determine the optimal speed reference for a generator control system. The control performance of the fuzzy logic controller is verified in the whole system and compared with a conventional PI controller. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness against parameter variations of the proposed control design.	algorithm;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;maximum power transfer theorem;sensor;simulation	Jianxing Liu;Yabin Gao;Sijia Geng;Ligang Wu	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2599542	fuzzy logic;wind speed;computer science;sensor;control system;mathematical model;control theory;fuzzy control system;statistics	Robotics	60.05240466732868	-8.35374955385213	130191

Specifically, necessary and sufficient conditions for equivalent, control-theoretic characterizations of the proposed balanced coordinated resource allocation design problem are derived, which are based on a new notion of semiobservability and a new semistable Lyapunov equation. With this theory, we first unveil a striking connection between the balanced coordinated network resource allocation design problem and optimal semistable control theory by means of a stochastic optimal semistable control technique. Then we convert this optimal control-based design problem into a constrained, nonlinear optimization problem to look for possible numerical solutions to the original balanced coordinated resource allocation algorithm design problem. To this end, we propose a class of randomized swarm optimization-based numerical algorithms called multiagent coordination optimization to solve the constrained, nonlinear optimization problem. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the proposed design framework and an application of a target search problem for threat detection and resource allocation is presented to further show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	agent-based model;algorithm design;control theory;linear system;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;memory management;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;optimization problem;program optimization;randomized algorithm;search problem;swarm;threat (computer)	Qing Hui;Haopeng Zhang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426426	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;convergence;optimal control;resource allocation;control theory;mathematics	Embedded	61.681569960832775	2.3387350667552966	130369
1766698d3b957c797f60f27ce5a876418991c6a9	comparison between two nonlinear kalman filters for reliable soc estimation on a prototypal bms		Energy Storage Systems (ESS)s have become widely pervasive in several sectors, both in the civil and in the industrial fields. Among the several applications, two of the most critical concern energy storing in the future Smart Grids and microgrids and power sourcing for Electric and Hybrid Vehicles. In this context, the management of the ESS represents a crucial task in order to guarantee efficient, effective and robust energy storing. The Battery Management System (BMS) is the device designated for performing this management. It has to avoid damages to the cell, to estimate the State of Charge (SoC), the State of Health (SoH) and to perform the cell equalization. In this paper, the SoC estimation by means of state observers has been investigated. In particular, the performances obtained by the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and by the Square Root Unscented Kalman Filter (SR-UKF) have been compared on a prototypal BMS. Results show that the SR-UKF succeeds in coping with the nonlinearities of the battery, obtaining better and more robust estimations than the classic EKF.	algorithm;battery management system;cell signaling;extended kalman filter;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;microgrid;nonlinear element;nonlinear system;performance;pervasive informatics;power supply;prototype;real-time testing;state of charge;state of health	Massimiliano Luzi;Maurizio Paschero;Angelo Rossini;Antonello Rizzi;Fabio Massimo Frattale Mascioli	2016	IECON 2016 - 42nd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2016.7794054	control engineering;simulation;engineering;control theory	Robotics	54.94521666611585	-1.770253483609561	130541

The data communications among sensor nodes are equipped with redundant channels subject to random packet dropouts that are modeled by mutually independent Bernoulli stochastic processes. The practical phenomenon of uncertain packet dropout rate is considered, and the norm-bounded uncertainty of the packet dropout rate is asymmetric to the nominal rate. Sufficient conditions on the existence of the desired distributed filters are established by employing the scaled small gain theorem to ensure that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable and achieves a prescribed average H∞ performance index.

In order to overcome the iterative type-reduction overhead, the intelligent algorithms are proposed using uncertainty bounds, inner- and outer-bound sets, which provide estimates of the uncertainties contained in the output of an interval type-2 FLS without having to perform the costly computations of type-reduction.

When considering problems of tracking, controlling the transient behavior of the error is more important when compared to its derivatives. We introduce a concept of virtual output, which converts an arbitrary relative degree system into a relative degree one system. The virtual output is chosen in such a way that the tracking error approaches it from the initial time and the difference between the virtual output and the tracking error can be made arbitrarily small. Assuming that the state derivatives are not available for feedback we use a high-gain observer to estimate the derivatives and construct the virtual output. By designing a performance funnel for the virtual output we are able to make the error evolve within the funnel.	algorithm;feedback	Dhrubajit Chowdhury;Hassan K.

This paper presents a multiple-degrees-of-freedom control structure for optimal controller design for infinite-dimensional systems. The approach for design of the controllers uses the internal model control design method that is applicable to infinite-dimensional systems, which alleviates the need for finite-dimensional approximation of partial differential equations. The control structure enables the multi-objective controllers to effectively deal with input saturation nonlinearities when the manipulated inputs saturate. A multi-objective infinite-dimensional control system is designed for a distributed parameter system motivated by tissue engineering. The control system is shown to remain optimal when controllers are taken off-line in the event of component failures, without redesigning any of the on-line controllers.	approximation;control flow;control system;line level;online and offline;optimal control;simulation	Ali Mesbah;Masako Kishida;Richard D.

In this case, it is convenient to design a reconfiguration strategy which switches on-line the right controller to achieve the same performances for a given objective. An additional detection-accommodation loop is proposed to the robust control feedback. The switching performances of the plant and the stability of the corresponding switched discrete-time linear systems are discussed.

Gas turbine compressor system is most widely used in chemical industries. The primary objective of this kind of setup is to control the flow rate of high pressure steam. Different controller architecture has been taken up to control the flow of gas. Firstly, a conventional PID controller is used to control the flow, which cannot provide an optimal control due to its inherent disadvantages. To overcome this problem artificial intelligence techniques using fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms have been implemented. The transient and steady state response and performance criteria IAE, ITAE have been discussed.

The motivation for this novel type of distinguishability stems, in particular, from the stability and performance requirements of worst-case adaptive control methodologies. The main results presented herein show that, in most practical cases, a persistence of excitation type of condition and a minimum number of iterations are required to properly distinguish two dynamic systems. We also demonstrate that the former constraint can be written as a lower bound on the intensity of the exogenous disturbances.

We consider the optimal control problem for a class of systems with dynamics defined at the vertices of a directed acyclic graph, and dynamic propagation along the edges of the graph. The controller is also constrained to use information flowing along the edges of the graph. With the additional assumption of transitive closure, such problems have linear optimal controllers. We show that, under the factorization condition that every disturbance non-sink takes state feedback, these problems separate into several independent subproblems and hence they can be explicitly solved. This technique generalizes and unifies several existing approaches for optimal decentralized control, and it further provides the optimal controller for many cases in which the optimal control was previously unknown. The optimal solutions are expressed in terms of a series of Riccati equations whose sizes are bounded by the system order. The separated problems highlight the structure of the optimal controller. We demonstrate our approach on a salvo guidance problem for a team of networked missiles.	consensus dynamics;directed acyclic graph;distributed control system;optimal control;software propagation;state space;transitive closure	Jong-Han Kim;Sanjay Lall	2015	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2014.2378931	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;mathematical optimization;linear-quadratic regulator;optimal control;decentralised system;algebraic riccati equation;control theory;mathematics;transfer function	Robotics	64.97943541135822	3.400421697093185	131590

One is an intelligent adaptive controller with optimization (IACO) developed based on a neural network and genetic algorithm. The other is an intelligent adaptive controller with constraints (IACC) developed based on a neural network and expert rules. In the IACO, a modified back-propagation neural network (MBPNN), in which a dynamic factor is attached and the learning rate can be adjusted in the learning process is used for the online modelling of the milling system. In addition, a modified genetic algorithm (MAG), in which the search domain can be adjusted in every generation is used for the real-time optimal control of the milling process.

The main focus of the manuscript lies in the development of a computationally efficient method to identify the optimal control action with respect to predefined performance criteria. An optimal control problem is formulated and is solved using standard, gradient-based, search algorithms. Employing nonlinear transformations and assuming piece-wise constant control action, the dynamic optimization problem is reformulated as a nonlinear optimization one with analytically computed sensitivities. The proposed method lies at the interface between collocation and shooting methods, since the distributed states are discretized explicitly in space and time and their sensitivity to the control action is analytically computed, reminiscent of collocation methods, while the states now enter the optimization problem explicitly as a nonlinear function of the control action and are eliminated from the equality constraints, thus reducing the number variables, evocative of shooting methods.	algorithmic efficiency;collocation;discretization;dynamic programming;gradient;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimal control;optimization problem;parabolic antenna;search algorithm	Antonios Armaou	2009	Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2009.5400926	control engineering;shooting method;optimization problem;mathematical optimization;probability density function;optimal control;nonlinear programming;collocation method;parabolic partial differential equation;control theory;mathematics;hafnium;model predictive control;partial differential equation;search algorithm	Robotics	61.926232512811715	-1.3240074167725593	131984

The new control design is a direct scheme in the sense that it adaptively updates the desired control without estimating the unknown disturbance. The proposed new control has several advantages. First, its adaptation gain can be arbitrarily chosen without upsetting the system stability if given the exact system model. Second, it can be applied to not only minimum-phase systems, but also non-minimum phase systems. Third, the new control law is independent of where the disturbance enters the system. Finally, a robustness analysis is made to show that the proposed control is robust with respect to un-modelled dynamics.	feed forward (control);linear system	Chih-Hsien Chung;Min-Shin Chen	2012	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2011.09.034	control engineering;simulation;adaptive control;engineering;control theory	Robotics	67.37132292345579	-5.5142340781652575	132119

However, the complexity of this so-called explicit MPC can be prohibitive even for low-dimensional systems. In this paper, we introduce a new synthesis method for low-complexity suboptimal MPC controllers based on function approximation from randomly chosen point-wise sample values. In addition to standard machine learning algorithms formulated as convex programs, we provide sufficient conditions on the learning algorithm in the form of tractable convex constraints that guarantee input and state constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility and stability of the closed loop system. The resulting control law can be fully parallelized, which renders the approach particularly suitable for highly concurrent embedded platforms such as FPGAs. A numerical example shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.	algorithm;approximation;cobham's thesis;constraint satisfaction;convex optimization;embedded system;field-programmable gate array;machine learning;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimal control;parallel computing;precomputation;randomness;recursion;rendering (computer graphics);robust optimization;sampling (signal processing)	Alexander Domahidi;Melanie Nicole Zeilinger;Manfred Morari;Colin Neil Jones	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6161258	convex function;control engineering;mathematical optimization;robust optimization;control theory;mathematics;model predictive control	Robotics	62.05979931992442	-2.1049458393700835	132447

Methods of structured uncertainty analysis (μ-analysis) are extended towards systems with dynamical and non-causal spatial coordinates. The stability is understood in a broad sense and includes decay (localization) of system response along the noncausal spatial coordinates. Robustness of dynamical stability and spatial localization of response and boundary effects are addressed in a unified way. The main technical condition enabling the technical results of the paper is that the feedback loop including a multidimensional plant and controller does not have a feedthrough in the dynamical (time) coordinate sense. As an example, the paper applies the multidimensional structured uncertainty analysis to closed-loop control of a cross-directional paper machine process. The paper formulates multidimensional models of the process, its controller, and a structured uncertainty. The uncertainty corresponds to a combination of errors in the actuator mapping, the cross-directional response gain, and the response width.	causal filter;control theory;decision theory;dynamical system;feedback;multidimensional system	Dimitry M.

In this work, with the nonlinearity considered in the system's model, a suitable criterion which takes into account both the nonlinearity's sector and slope bounds is employed to establish its global stability condition. The result is then incorporated into the existing H∞ synthesis in the controller/loop filter design. The searches are expressed in terms of convex linear matrix inequalities which are computationally tractable.

For stochastic approximation based consensus algorithms, the existing convergence analysis with dynamic topologies heavily relies on quadratic Lyapunov functions, whose existence, however, may be difficult to ensure for switching directed graphs. Our main contribution is to introduce a new analytical approach. We first show a fundamental role of ergodic backward products for mean square consensus in algorithms with additive noise. Subsequently, we develop ergodicity results for backward products of degenerating stochastic matrices converging to a 0-1 matrix via a discrete time dynamical system approach. These results complement the existing ergodic theory of stochastic matrices and provide an effective tool for analyzing consensus problems. Under a joint connectivity assumption, our approach may deal with switching topologies, delayed measurements and correlated noises, and it does not require the double stochasticity condition typically assumed for the existence of quadratic Lyapunov functions.	additive white gaussian noise;approximation algorithm;computable function;consensus (computer science);directed graph;dynamical system;ergodic theory;ergodicity;lyapunov fractal;mean squared error;stochastic approximation;stochastic matrix;utility functions on indivisible goods	Minyi Huang	2012	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2012.2199149	stochastic approximation;mathematical optimization;combinatorics;discrete mathematics;consensus;directed graph;ergodicity;control theory;mathematics;approximation theory	Theory	68.29547402881202	2.458511576733523	132794

In the proposed technique, referred to as the TS-FTA, the events in the conventional FTA can be expressed in terms of fuzzy possibilities, and the gates that represent the relations among the top event and the primary events are replaced by T–S fuzzy gates derived from the T–S model. The magnitudes of the faults in the system are expressed in term of fuzzy variables. Since the proposed TS-FTA is derived from fuzzy logic and the T–S model, it can readily handle fuzzy information and uncertainties in the relationships among events. Therefore, the TS-FTA is suitable for systems where exact information on the fault probabilities of the components and the failure mechanisms are not available. The proposed TS-FTA is applied to analyze the reliability of an Inertial Navigation System and Global Position System (INS/GPS) integrated navigation system.	failure cause;fault tree analysis;fuzzy logic;gps navigation device;global positioning system;inertial navigation system;remote desktop services	Hua Song;Hong-Yue Zhang;C.

aaed6e195d2ce152e2e153f2fce1294446adbfbb	control design of an electro-pneumatic gearbox actuator		The paper deals with the model-based control of an electro-pneumatic gearbox actuator. Electro-pneumatic systems have many advantages, such as long lifetime and high operational safety, but their nonlinear behavior makes predicting and controlling them difficult. The objective of the research is to design an optimal control of an electro-pneumatic gearbox actuator. In order to control a nonlinear system with linear control methods a multi-state state-space representation of the system is presented. Based on a preliminary comparison an open-loop, a PID, and a linear quadratic controller were chosen for development. The developed controllers were tested in a Model in The Loop environment, and their performances were compared based on previously defined controlling requirements. Both the open-loop and the PID controller were able to meet the given requirements. The open-loop controller has high parameter sensitivity and relative low performances in case of collision speed and shift time, while the PID controller has the highest number of solenoid valve actuations. The linear quadratic controller has good overall performance in case of neutral to gear changes, however it cannot stabilize the system in neutral position within the required time, which can be a consequence of the given simplifications. With respect to the results of the Model in the Loop tests two suggestions were made regarding the applicable controller.	control system;game controller;nonlinear system;optimal control;pid;performance;process identifier;requirement;state-space representation	Adam Szabo;Tamas Becsi;Péter Gáspár;Szilárd Aradi	2018	2018 14th IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications (MESA)	10.1109/MESA.2018.8449145	solenoid;pid controller;control theory;actuator;optimal control;pneumatic actuator;computer science;solenoid valve;control theory;shift time	Robotics	58.64600736178315	-8.381587775953289	133065

Our objective is to design mode-dependent $$H_{\infty }$$ H ∞ filter in the network environment in order to ensure the filtering error system is not only exponentially mean-square stable, but also satisfies a prescribed $$H_{\infty }$$ H ∞ norm level for the limited communication capacity and for all admissible uncertainties. We use the delay system method to deal with signal transmission delay and data packet dropout, utilize the sector bound approach to handle measurement quantization. We also construct a comprehensive stochastic Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional to show the inherent mode-dependent state delays in the neural networks itself and the network-induced signal transmission delay. The free-weighting matrix technique and a set of strict linear matrix inequalities are employed to derive novel conditions for the desired mode-dependent $$H_{\infty }$$ H ∞ filter.

The design objective is to minimize the number of linear controllers associated with rule conclusions and tune the triangular-shaped membership function parameters of a fuzzy controller to satisfy stability and desired dynamic performances in the presence of system parameter variation. The robust performance objective function is derived based on an interval Diophantine equation. Thus, the objective of a fuzzy logic-based control scheme is to place all the closed-loop control system characteristic polynomial coefficients within desired intervals. The reproduction process in the proposed Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is based on the arithmetical crossover, uniform and non-uniform mutation along with gene deletion/insertion mutation ensuring a diversity of genomes sizes, as well as a diversity in the parameter space of membership functions. The proposed algorithm was implemented to design a fuzzy logic-based anti-sway crane control system taking into consideration the rope length and the mass of a payload variation. The results of experiments conducted using the EA for different conditions assumed for system parameter intervals and desired closed-loop system performances are compared with results achieved using the iterative procedure which is also described in the paper.	characteristic polynomial;coefficient;control system;control theory;evolutionary algorithm;experiment;feasible region;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;iterative method;loss function;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;performance	Jaroslaw Smoczek	2013	Applied Mathematics and Computer Science	10.2478/amcs-2013-0056	fuzzy logic;control engineering;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;interval;evolutionary algorithm;control theory	Robotics	61.50312000038361	-6.765180997843678	133357

A novel derivation of the control law enables the link to minimum variance benchmarking to be explored and exploited. The main advantage lies in the generality of the weighted cost index and the simplicity of the results. The only price for this simplicity is the assumption on the choice of weightings. Simple expressions are provided for each of the cost terms that enable performance to be assessed, including the total performance index, variance of error and control signals and variance of weighted signals.

The approach hereby proposed feedback to the time derivatives of the membership functions through a multi-index control law that cancels out the terms responsible of former a priori local conditions. Thus, a nonquadratic controller design in the form of linear matrix inequalities is achieved; it does not require bounds on the time derivatives nor any extra parameters. The examples included are shown to outperform former approaches.	closed-loop transfer function;controllers;feedback;leuprolide mesylate injectable suspension;linear matrix inequality;locality of reference;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;numerous;optimal control	Temoatzin González;Miguel Bernal;Antonio Sala;Braulio Aguiar	2017	IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics	10.1109/TCYB.2016.2589543	mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.7088586201321	-3.1538101001668566	133418

Hence, this process may excessively consume limitedly available computational resources and large amount of computational time, which may degrade system performances, particularly for the case of online updating of parameter estimates. Thus reducing the number of parameters to be estimated is a promising way to solve the problem. The state-of-the-art result in the area is to update just one adaptive parameter. However, the tracking errors are only ensured bounded and thus the resulting closed-loop system is not asymptotically stable. Hence, a question that arises is whether such a result of non-zero tracking errors is the price paid for reducing the number of updating parameters. Up to now, there is still no answer to this question. In this paper, we address such an issue and realize asymptotic stability with online estimation of just one parameter. To achieve such a goal, a novel dynamic loop gain function based approach is proposed to incorporate with the backstepping control design procedure, which enables us to solve the algebraic loop problem caused by all the existing traditional Nussbaum function based approaches and thus establish system stability. A bound for the tracking error is explicitly established in terms of L2 norm, which helps improve the transient performance by selecting the control parameters. Moreover, guaranteed by the Barbalat’s Lemma, the tracking error is further ensured to approach zero asymptotically. Finally, simulation examples are conducted to testify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The structure and parameters of the FNNs are determined dynamically by using an incremental FNN. By incorporating incremental learning and adaptive control with multiple models, the proposed method not only reduces complexity and computation induced by the use of multiple models, but also provides favorable transient and tracking performance. The multiple FNNs are switched or blended to improve the transient response when manipulating objects are changed. The parameters are refined adaptively to compensate for system uncertainties. The resulting closed-loop system with a switching or blending law is proven to be asymptotically stable. The proposed scheme is applied to control a two-link robot manipulator in conjunction with varying payloads.	alpha compositing;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;cluster analysis;computation;fuzzy clustering;fuzzy rule;job stream;robot;scheme;system dynamics	Chang-Hyun Kim;Joon-Hong Seok;Byoung-Suk Choi;Ju-Jang Lee	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2009.5354368	control engineering;adaptive control;network switch;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;transient response	Robotics	63.45831222589865	-8.913633247465317	133656

The conventional lake-aquifer dynamics are transformed into a multi-input multioutput linear time-invariant model with a bounded uncertainty. The robust performance of the system is obtained through an H-infinity controller to address a bounded model uncertainty, satisfactory reference input tracking and disturbance rejection behaviour, and maximum profitability of the water extraction process. The robust optimization design results demonstrate that the designed robust controller maintains the desired aquifer level under a bounded model uncertainty and an exogenous input excitation while maximizing the corresponding environmental utility. Therefore, the proposed framework offers a new worst-case deterministic optimization algorithm for policy makers during efficient water management policy decisions, maximizing economical benefits while ensuring sustainable social, biological and environmental activities.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;linear time-invariant theory;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;real life;real-time transcription;rechargeable battery;rejection sampling;robust optimization;system dynamics;systems theory;time complexity;time-invariant system	Muhittin Yilmaz;Venkatesh Uddameri	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2010.5611173	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory	Robotics	57.65284071178271	-4.40363631650084	134082

The acceleration motion is traditionally modeled as a linear function with the state which consists of target position, speed and acceleration in the x, y and possibly z coordinates. The state elements in different coordinate are assumed uncoupled. However, This assumption is not generally true, as the state elements in different coordinates are correlated by the common target heading. Thus, a nonlinear constant heading model is suggested in this paper. To implement this nonlinear model, a two-stage least squares method is developed for track initiation, and an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) are proposed to estimate the state in track maintenance. Performance of the nonlinear model is demonstrated through simulation data, and results show that the proposed nonlinear model outperforms the traditional linear model.	course (navigation);experiment;extended kalman filter;hardware acceleration;initial condition;linear function;linear least squares (mathematics);linear model;missile guidance;nonlinear system;simulation	Rong Yang;Gee Wah Ng;Boon Poh Ng	2010	2010 13th International Conference on Information Fusion	10.1109/ICIF.2010.5712089	control engineering;computer vision;invariant extended kalman filter;engineering;control theory	Robotics	55.63046304689459	2.7131664765387553	134346
46bcbad4e9127326c4b43d856a70f1b6edc30af7	neuro-fuzzy identifiers and controllers		A neuro-fuzzy identifier for fuzzy modeling of a system is explained, and a control structure using this neurofuzzy identifier is proposed. The neuro-fuzzy identifier contains not only an adaptive clustering process for determining center points of the input and virtual output membership functions but also an adaptive process for deciding the shapes of the input membership functions. Moreover, linguistic fuzzy rules of a system can be obtained from the proposed neuro-fuzzy identifier, which can learn the initial implication fuzzy control rules of the system and then compensate for the error of the initial fuzzy control rules by a feedback control structure that maintains the stability of the system. Computer simulation shows that neuro-fuzzy identification is very effective in modeling fuzzy systems the fuzzy rules of which cannot be obtained easily and the neuro-fuzzy controller gives very effective control results by a learning process.	neuro-fuzzy	Minho Lee;Soo-Young Lee;Cheol Hoom Park	1994	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-1994-2101	membership function;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;type-2 fuzzy sets and systems;fuzzy classification;computer science;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;control theory;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system	Robotics	61.69435168358312	-8.093163355526901	134360

High-order sliding-mode approach is modified for this sake, and a list of continuous controllers is built depending only on the given relative degree n of the system output sigma. Provided the relative degree is globally well-defined and the system growth rate is restricted, the global finite-time stabilization is possible. The asymptotic accuracies in the cases of discrete and noisy sampling are estimated. In particular, for any q > 0 the stabilization accuracy sigma (i) = O (zeta n-i+q ), i = 0, 1, ..., n - 1, is obtained, where zeta is the sampling interval, and q is an arbitrarily chosen positive feedback parameter. Output-feedback controllers are constructed.

The estimators carry over directly to estimating other information measures of stationary ergodic processes, such as entropy rate and mutual information rate, and provide alternatives to classical approaches in the existing literature. Guided by the theoretical results, we use context tree weighting as the vehicle for the implementations of the proposed estimators. Experiments on synthetic and real data are presented, demonstrating the potential of the proposed schemes in practice and the efficacy of directed information estimation as a tool for detecting and measuring causality and delay.	causality;context tree weighting;entropy rate;ergodic theory;ergodicity;experiment;minimax;mutual information;petri net;sensor;stationary process;synthetic intelligence	Jiantao Jiao;Haim H.

2b83c95c897d04faf17d8c439c55a74a6b42b23f	data-based approximate policy iteration for nonlinear continuous-time optimal control design		This paper addresses the model-free nonlinear optimal prob lem with generalized cost functional, and a data-based reinforcement learning technique is developed. It is known that the nonlinear optimal control problem relies on the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, w hich is a nonlinear partial di fferential equation that is generally impossible to be solved analytically. Even worse , most of practical systems are too complicated to establish their accurate mathematical model. To overcome these di fficulties, we propose a data-based approximate policy iteration (API) method by using real system data rather than syste m model. Firstly, a model-free policy iteration algorithm is derived for constrained optimal control problem and its c onvergence is proved, which can learn the solution of HJB equation and optimal control policy without requiring any k nowledge of system mathematical model. The implementation of the algorithm is based on the thought of actor-crit ic structure, where actor and critic neural networks (NNs) are employed to approximate the control policy and cost func tio , respectively. To update the weights of actor and critic NNs, a least-square approach is developed based on th e method of weighted residuals. The whole data-based API method includes two parts, where the first part is impleme nted online to collect real system information, and the second part is conducting o ffline policy iteration to learn the solution of HJB equation an d the control policy. Then, the data-based API algorithm is simplified for solving uncon strained optimal control problem of nonlinear and linear systems. Finally, we test the e fficiency of the data-based API control design method on a simpl e nonlinear system, and further apply it to a rotational /translational actuator system. The simulation results dem onstrate the e ffectiveness of the proposed method.	application programming interface;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;bellman equation;benchmark (computing);digraphs and trigraphs;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;iteration;iterative method;jacobi method;linear system;markov decision process;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;online and offline;optimal control;reinforcement learning;simulation;system information (windows)	Biao Luo;Huai-Ning Wu;Tingwen Huang;Derong Liu	2013	CoRR		control theory;mathematical optimization;reinforcement learning;mathematics;artificial neural network;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;linear system;nonlinear system;system model;convergence (routing);optimal control	Robotics	61.901665693727	-2.8396427462014726	135255

The new fuzzy controller mainly consists of fuzzification interface, defuzzification interface, rule-base and inference mechanism. Considering the actual application, the fuzzy controller was designed as a 2inputs&1-output closed-loop system. The inputs are the distance from nozzle to crop row and its change rate, the output is the control signal to the execution unit. Based on the design project, we selected the FMC chip NLX230, the EMCU chip AT89S52 and the EEPROM chip AT93C57 to make the fuzzy controller. Experimental results show that the project is workable and efficient, it can solve the shortcomings of existing controller perfectly and the control efficiency can be improved greatly.	control theory;defuzzification;domain of discourse;eeprom;execution unit;flight management system;fuzzy control system;fuzzy set;intel matrix raid;overshoot (signal);robot;rule-based system;ski combinator calculus	Jianqiang Ren	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-12220-0_30	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	60.42287835930934	-8.618614514058628	135362

The design objectives aim at ensuring that all pairwise state differences of the networked systems converge to zero in an appropriate norm and that the states of these systems satisfy the control objective. The proposed static output feedback controllers thus contain a term that addresses the control objective and a consensus term that ensures synchronization. The synchronization gains of the resulting aggregate systems can be viewed as the strengths of the interconnections among the network nodes. Two different optimization schemes for the non-zero entries of the associated graph Laplacian are proposed. An alternate design proposes the on-line adjustment of the entries of the graph Laplacian matrix via an adaptation involving available output signals of the networked systems. The proposed results are demonstrated by a numerical example for a 1D partial differential equation.	aggregate data;block cipher mode of operation;constrained optimization;converge;laplacian matrix;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;norm (social);numerical analysis;online and offline;optimization problem;simulation;synchronization (computer science)	Michael A.

First, the data-driven iterative adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is presented with a convergence analysis. Then, the error bounds for this algorithm are provided considering the approximation errors of function approximation structures. To implement the developed algorithm, two neural networks are used to approximate the state-action value function and the control policy.

The controller is designed from the fuzzy interval ranges of the system parameters. Indeed, for a given degree of confidence on the fuzzy system parameters, the control objective can be viewed as maintaining the system output within a tolerance envelope, around the exact trajectory, specified by a degree of preference on the fuzzy trajectory.

Single-input–single-output discrete-time nonlinear systems are considered, where the objective is to recursively construct an input such that the corresponding system output tracks a prescribed reference trajectory as closely as possible on finite horizon. The problem is formulated in terms of extremum seeking control, which is amenable to a range of local and global optimisation methods. Contrary to the existing ILC literature, the formulation allows the initial condition of each iteration to be incorporated as an optimisation variable to improve tracking. Sufficient conditions for convergence to the reference trajectory are provided. The main feature of this approach is that it does not rely on knowledge about the system’s model to perform iterative learning control, in contrast to most results in the literature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast with the distributed filters with linear consensus estimate, a distributed extended Kalman filter (EKF) is developed with nonlinear consensus estimate. Specifically, a new nonlinear consensus protocol with polynomial form is proposed to generate the consensus estimate. By using the variance-constrained approach, the Kalman gain matrix is determined for each node to guarantee an optimized upper bound on the state estimation error covariance despite consensus terms and linearization errors. It is shown that the Kalman gain matrix can be derived by solving two Riccati-like difference equations. The effectiveness of the proposed filter is evaluated on an indoor localization of a mobile robot with visual tracking systems.	extended kalman filter;nonlinear system	Wenling Li;Yingmin Jia;Junping Du	2017	J.

c6c86403d345ed08fe6aec1e79c0ac816fbc4d01	set-membership method for discrete optimal control		The objective of this paper is twofold. First we propose a new approach for computing Ct0,t f the subset of initial states of a system from which there exists at least one trajectory reaching a target T in a finite time t f from a timet0. This is done considering a discrete time tk and a control vector continuous over a time [tk−1, tk]. Then, using the previously mentioned work and given a cost function, the objective is to estimate an enclosure of the discrete optimal control vector from an initial state of Ct0,t f to the target. Whereas classical methods do not provide any guaranty on the set of state vectors that belong to the Ct0,t f , interval analysis and guaranteed numerical integration allow us to avoid any indetermination. We present an algorithm able to provide guaranteed characterizations of the inner C− t0,t f and an the outer C + t0,t f of Ct0,t f , such that C− t0,t f ⊆ Ct0,t f ⊆ C + t0,t f . In addition to that, the presented algorithm is extended in order enclose the discrete optimal control vector of the system, form an initial state to the target, by a set of discrete trajectories.	algorithm;dijkstra's algorithm;interval arithmetic;loss function;numerical analysis;numerical integration;optimal control;planning	Rémy Guyonneau;Sebastien Lagrange;Laurent Hardouin;Mehdi Lhommeau	2013		10.5220/0004458001930200	discrete optimization;optimal control	Theory	62.323623944200875	0.1639190643797253	135790

By means of introducing an auxiliary variable, a newly coupled, switched system model is derived first. Then, based on a predictive network control scheme, the conditions for guaranteed control performance of the overall system in terms of linear matrix inequalities are given. Next, a novel control design method, involving convex optimization technique to find solutions for the controllers that vary according to network delays and data-dropouts, is developed. It is shown from theory that the obtained criteria are much less conservative than existing ones. Finally, two illustrative examples, the second one being a laboratory-scale rig, are elaborated on to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method. Both numerical and simulation results appear favorable to this novel network control system synthesis.	computer simulation;control system;convex optimization;linear inequality;linear matrix inequality;mathematical optimization;network computing system;network packet;numerical analysis;simulation	Sheng-Li Du;Ximing Sun;Wei David Wang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering	10.1109/TASE.2014.2320322	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;real-time computing;networked control system;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.60616824008767	0.13283550834600616	135798

A new delaydependent criterion is presented for the stability of unforced nominal delayed systems. Based on the obtained criterion, a new linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed for the robust stabilisation of a class of uncertain delayed systems via a linear memoryless state feedback control law. The results are dependent on the size of the delays and are given in terms of LMIs. The presented method does not require a tuning procedure for scalars and/or matrices and produces results that are less conservative than delay-independent results.

Since the control input vector decides the shape of the output probability density function (PDF), the purpose of the controller design is to select a proper control input vector, so that the output PDF of the SDCS can be as close as possible to the target PDF. In virtue of the statistical characterizations of the SDCS, a new framework based on a statistical manifold is proposed to formulate the control design of the input and output SDCSs. Here, the Kullback–Leibler divergence is presented as a cost function to measure the distance between the output PDF and the target PDF. Therefore, an iterative descent algorithm is provided, and the convergence of the algorithm is discussed, followed by an illustrative example of the effectiveness.	algorithm;control system;gradient descent;information geometry;input/output;kullback–leibler divergence;loss function;portable document format;statistical manifold	Zhenning Zhang;Huafei Sun;Linyu Peng;Lin Jiu	2014	Entropy	10.3390/e16084338	mathematical optimization;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;kullback–leibler divergence;statistics	ML	60.20681324034735	1.7221401535369334	136306

56e3e737d19fd9cbb5f6109d61cc4bb58109cfd6	observer-based adaptive control of uncertain nonlinear systems via neural networks		In this paper, a novel observer-based control strategy is proposed for a class of uncertain continuous-time nonlinear systems based on the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. Due to the complexity of nonlinear systems, the approximately optimal control for affine uncertain continuous-time nonlinear systems is pursued. Considering that only the output variables can be measured in the control practice, the state observer is designed to reconstruct all system states by using the output variables. The observer-based policy iteration algorithm can solve the HJB equation within the adaptive dynamic programming framework for the unknown-state uncertain nonlinear systems, where a critic neural network is constructed to approximate the optimal cost function, and then, the approximate expression of the optimal control policy can be directly derived from solving the HJB equation. In addition, the stability of the whole closed-loop system is provided based on the Lyapunov analysis.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;bellman equation;control theory;dynamic programming;hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;iteration;iterative method;jacobi method;loss function;lyapunov fractal;markov decision process;neural network software;nonlinear system;optimal control	Chaoxu Mu;Yong Zhang;Ke Wang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2859263	control theory;computer science;distributed computing;nonlinear system;adaptive control;lyapunov function;observer (quantum physics);hamilton–jacobi–bellman equation;dynamic programming;optimal control;state observer	Robotics	62.37930118444427	-2.5522852152985935	136716

It is assumed that each sensor node transmits its local estimate to a fusion center whenever an appropriately chosen error norm exceeds a threshold. The fusion rule is a modified version of the Covariance Intersection Algorithm. We investigate how to incorporate the event information of not having transmitted at the fusion center such that the filter remains unbiased and consistent with regard to its error covariance. An upper bound on the error covariance matrix is derived by exploiting the structure of the posterior probability distribution. This enables us to replace the event information by the virtual transmission of consistent local estimates. Based on the consistency-preserving property of the proposed scheme, we show stability of the event-triggered state estimator in terms of a bounded mean square error.	algorithm;covariance intersection;exploit (computer security);mean squared error;norm (social);sensor node	Adam Molin;Henrik Sandberg;Karl Henrik Johansson	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7403403	kalman filter;estimation of covariance matrices;minimum mean square error;econometrics;covariance intersection;law of total covariance;noise measurement;covariance;control theory;mathematics;extended kalman filter;upper and lower bounds;statistics;covariance function	Robotics	54.05267330117292	3.8234194468840403	136784

An auxiliary input signal is applied in AFD. This signal injection in the system will in general allow us to obtain a fast change detection/isolation by considering the output or an error output from the system. The classical cumulative sum (CUSUM) test will be modified with respect to the AFD approach applied. The CUSUM method will be altered such that it will be able to detect a change in the signature from the auxiliary input signal in an (error) output signal. It will be shown how it is possible to apply both the gain and the phase change of the output signal in CUSUM tests. The method is demonstrated using an example.	active format description;arc converter;transfer function	Niels Kjølstad Poulsen;Henrik Niemann	2008	Applied Mathematics and Computer Science	10.2478/v10006-008-0043-6	parametrization;control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory;mathematics	ML	57.00299100701122	0.044362309818468254	137028

This paper presents the application of the adaptive extremum seeking control (AESC) scheme to the PV MPPT problem. A state-space model is derived for the PV system with buck converter. The AESC is used to maximize the power output by tuning the duty ratio of the pulse-width modulator (PWM) of the DC-DC buck converter. To address the nonlinear PV characteristics, the radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used to approximate the unknown nonlinear I-V curve. The convergence of the system to an adjustable neighborhood of the optimum is guaranteed by utilizing a Lyapunov-based adaptive control method. The performance of the controller is verified through simulations.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;buck converter;dc-to-dc converter;duty cycle;lyapunov fractal;maxima and minima;maximum power transfer theorem;nonlinear system;pulse-width modulation;radial (radio);radial basis function;simulation;state space	Xiao Li;Yaoyu Li;John E.

For a smooth enough reference signal this can be replaced with extrapolation. Here, the properties for constant reference signals are examined, time varying references will be covered with another article. The method guarantees asymptotical stability and zero steady state tracking error. The elaborated techniques satisfy the separation principle for an arbitrary deterministic or stochastic state estimator. The reference tracking problem for a quadrotor helicopter is solved by the method. The trajectory tracking control is successfully applied both with reference signal preview and extrapolation (considering time varying references also).	asymptote;extrapolation;feedforward neural network;letter-quality printer;linear time-invariant theory;optimal control;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;separation principle;steady state	Péter Bauer;Balázs Kulcsár;Jozsef Bokor	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications	10.1109/CCA.2008.4629643	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.0191774150946	-1.7828420831331675	137142

The algorithm uses on-line a neural model of the process to determine its local linear approximation and a nonlinear free trajectory. Unlike the fully-fledged nonlinear MPC technique, which hinges on non-convex optimisation, thanks to linearisation the suboptimal algorithm requires solving on-line only a quadratic optimisation problem. Two nonlinear processes are considered: a polymerisation reactor and a distillation column. In the first case MPC based on a linear model is unstable, in the second case it is slow. It is demonstrated that the suboptimal algorithm in comparison to the nonlinear MPC with full nonlinear optimisation: (a) results in similar closed-loop control performance and (b) significantly reduces the computational burden.	computation;nonlinear system	Maciej Lawrynczuk	2011	Appl.

Moreover, conic sectors can be used to characterize a variety of input-output properties, such as gain, phase, and minimum gain. This paper proposes a linear-matrix-inequality-based approach to the synthesis of conic controllers that minimize an upper-bound on the closed-loop v-norm.

To overcome certain shortcomings in traditional JITL, such as the incomplete usage of primary variable information and inaccurate feature weights assignment, an adaptive sample selection approach is introduced. First, to keep both input and output information, a dual-objective optimization scheme with an adaptive parameter is considered. Then, an adaptive feature weight assignment strategy is present to construct a suitable similarity criterion for JITL. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, it is applied to online prediction of the crude oil endpoint in an industrial fluidized catalytic cracking unit. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can help improve the prediction performance.	communication endpoint;experiment;input/output;just-in-time compilation;mathematical optimization;password cracking	Kun Chen;Yi Liu	2013	2013 10th IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation (ICCA)	10.1109/ICCA.2013.6565160	data modeling;mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;control theory;chemical process;predictive modelling	Robotics	58.97476709543641	-5.602449988986178	137738

The control surfaces of the proposed system are compared to those of traditional fuzzy and PD controllers, and the results are almost the same when a small correction factor is included.

The main idea of the developed algorithm is to use the parameter settings of an AIMD network congestion control scheme, where parameters may assign the desired network’s window covariance, with respect to the current network conditions. The aim is to search for the optimal AIMD parameters of a feedback gain matrix such that the objective functions defined via appropriate robustness measures and covariance assignment constraints can be optimized using an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA). It is shown that the results can be used to develop tools for analyzing the behavior of AIMD communication networks. Quality of service (QoS) and other performance measures of the network have been improved by using the proposed congestion control. The accuracy of the controller is demonstrated by using MATLAB and NS software programs.	approximation algorithm;condition number;end-to-end principle;genetic algorithm;loss function;matlab;network congestion;numerical analysis;optimal matching;optimization problem;quality of service;simulation;software release life cycle;tcp congestion control;telecommunications network;utility functions on indivisible goods;weight function	Amir Esmaeili Abharian;Hamid Khaloozadeh;Roya Amjadifard	2012	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-012-1192-y	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	ML	63.719663901040065	0.7746558473939367	137906
7351a75c76fb52c2c9046c04516b33ed491e6d96	implementation of adaptive fuzzy dual rate pid controller for networked control systems		In Network Control Systems (NCSs), a dual rate controller is an approach that is applied to reduce the influence of packages loss and random delays. If the output measuring sensors is slower than the control action update can be reached, the dual rate controller is used as a possible solution. In this paper, a fuzzy controller will be combined with a dual rate controller in an NCS to regulate the gain parameter online. The fuzzy dual rate PID is designed by slitting a convention PID into two parts performing at different sampling rate. A Controller Area Network (CAN) is the mode of communication in this system. Furthermore, the Fuzzy-dual rate PID controllers performance is compared with that of a conventional PID controller. Based on the simulation results and experimental results, the fuzzy dual rate PID controller provides a superior position response with a faster rise time, faster settling time and it minimizes the amount of overshoot.	biological science disciplines;can bus;control system;controllers;dual;exhibits as topic;fuzzy logic;hearing loss, high-frequency;hypothalamic area, lateral;logic control;network computing system;overshoot (signal);pid;population parameter;reason applied by forcast logic to project this vaccine:finding:point in time:^patient:nominal;rise time;sampling (signal processing);sensor;settling time;simulation;small;zinostatin	Hoang Ngoc Tran;Vinh Quang Nguyen;Nhan Van Phan Tran;Kien Minh Le;Jae Wook Jeon	2017	IECON 2017 - 43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2017.8216574	can bus;fuzzy logic;rise time;control engineering;engineering;pid controller;control theory;settling time;overshoot (signal);control theory;control system	Robotics	60.92139117194152	-9.436203718912589	137909

By defining a multiple Lyapunov function, a new sufficient condition guaranteeing the H∞ performance of the TS fuzzy systems is first derived, which is expressed by a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Both theoretical analysis and numerical examples show that such a new condition is less conservative than previous results obtained within the quadratic framework. Based on this new condition for H∞ performance, the corresponding H∞ controller design problem is then investigated. Different from the traditional quadratic framework, the synthesis problem is solved by exploiting the cone complementarity linearization (CCL) method, together with a sequential minimization problem subject to LMI constraints obtained for the existence of admissible controllers, which can be readily solved by using standard numerical software.	complementarity (physics);fuzzy control system	Huijun Gao;Zidong Wang;Changhong Wang	2005	Inf.

The paper shows that in some particular situations it is not necessary to comprise an advanced control methodology to provide efficient performance. The work demonstrates that with the standard control techniques, it is possible to drive the system to follow up a challenging set point trajectory.

The stabilization and control of this class of systems is difficult stabilizing because of the unusual behavior in both time and frequency domains. The paper shows that fuzzy control is a successful control solution for this class of systems. With this regard, the paper proposes two hybrid fuzzy controllers of Takagi-Sugeno type that cope with the class of second-order non-minimum phase systems with a “right half plane zero”.	algorithm;approximation;backpropagation;control theory;fuzzy concept;fuzzy control system;minimum phase;neuron;simulation;software propagation;transfer function;two-hybrid screening	Radu-Emil Precup;Stefan Preitl;Alexandra-Iulia Stînean;Claudia-Adina Dragos;Mircea-Bogdan Radac	2012	2012 7th IEEE International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)	10.1109/SACI.2012.6249970	control engineering;mathematical optimization;stability;computer science;control system;control theory;mathematics;transfer function;fuzzy control system;statistics	Embedded	66.81963872625296	-6.695171663358012	138868

In this paper, we focus on a finite control horizon and propose a design methodology where the constrained control problem is formulated as a chance-constrained optimization problem depending on some parameter. This parameter can be tuned so as to decide the appropriate tradeoff between control cost minimization and state constraints satisfaction. An approximate solution is computed via a randomized algorithm. Precise guarantees about its feasibility for the original chanceconstrained problem are provided. A numerical example shows the efficacy of the proposed methodology. & 2016 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, by combining with forwarding technique, uncertainty observers are designed to estimate uncertainties including parameter perturbations and external disturbances in a bottom-up way; at the same time, the convergence rate of estimate error of uncertainty observers is analysed in detail. The insensitivity to uncertainties for each manifold, no need of a prior knowledge on the bound of the uncertainty and the feasibility of practical implementation are three advantages of the proposed scheme. Moreover, approximate error of uncertainty observer can be made sufficiently small by tuning the parameters. The design procedures are elaborated and the boundedness of all trajectories of the closed-loop systems is guaranteed.

Considering the old age of both SOF problems and direct search methods, surprisingly good performances will be obtained compared to a state-of-the-art method. The motivation is to emphasize the fact that direct search methods are too much neglected by the control community. These methods are very rich for practical purposes on a lot of complex problems unyielding to classical optimization techniques, like linear matrix inequalities, thanks to their ability to explore even non-smooth functions on non-convex feasible sets.	block cipher mode of operation;line search;linear matrix inequality;linear time-invariant theory;mathematical optimization;performance	E.

The proposed decentralized overlapping control law is obtained by using the inclusion principle, i.e., by decomposing the original system model by an appropriate input/state expansion, and by applying the linear quadratic (LQ) optimization to the locally extracted subsystems. The local quadratic criteria directly reflect the desired system performance. Optimization is carried out by using a sequential algorithm adapted to the lower block triangular (LBT) structure of the closed-loop system model. Contraction to the original space provides a decentralized platoon controller which preserves the asymptotic stability and the steady-state behavior of the controller obtained in the expanded space. Conditions for eliminating the “slinky effect” and obtaining the strict string stability are defined; it is shown that the corresponding constraints on the controller parameters are not too restrictive. A new dynamic platoon controller structure, consisting of a reduced order observer and a static feedback map, is obtained by applying the inclusion principle to the decentralized overlapping platoon control design in the case when the information from the preceding vehicle is missing. Numerous simulation results show that the proposed methodology provides a reliable tool for a systematic and efficient design of platoon controllers within IVHS.	letter-quality printer;mathematical optimization;optimal control;program optimization;sequential algorithm;simulation;steady state	Srdjan S.

In BF operation, the molten iron temperature as well as the Si content ([Si]), the phosphorus content ([P]), and the sulfur content ([S]) is the most essential quality (MIQ) indices. The measurement, modeling, and control of these indices have always been important issues in metallurgic engineering and automation. This paper proposes a novel data-driven nonlinear state-space modeling method for the prediction and control of multivariate MIQ indices by integrating hybrid modeling and control techniques together. First, to improve modeling efficiency, a data-driven hybrid method that combines canonical correlation analysis and correlation analysis is established to identify the most influential controllable variables as the modeling inputs from multitudinous factors. Then, a Hammerstein model for the prediction of MIQ indices is established using the Least squares support vector machine-based nonlinear subspace identification method. Such a model is further simplified by using piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial method. Compared with the original Hammerstein model, it has been shown that this simplified model can not only significantly reduce the computational complexity, but can also exhibit a good reliability and accuracy for a stable prediction of MIQ indices. In order to verify the practicability of the developed model, it is applied to the design of a genetic algorithm based nonlinear predictive controller for the multivariate MIQ indices by directly taking the established model as a predictor. Industrial experiments show the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.	blast;brainfuck;broadcast delay;computational complexity theory;control theory;cubic function;experiment;genetic algorithm;hermite interpolation;interaction;kerrison predictor;least squares support vector machine;nonlinear system;polynomial interpolation;state space	Ping Zhou;Heda Song;Hong Wang;Tianyou Chai	2017	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2016.2631124	control engineering;engineering;control theory	Robotics	58.551197190034316	-6.843065298014328	139570

The largely graph-based current framework of the crisp DES is unsuitable for the expansion, and we have thus reformulated it using state vectors and event transition matrices which can be extended to fuzzy vectors and matrices by allowing their elements to take values between 0 and 1. To measure information related to fuzzy DES, we generalize the crisp DES observability. The new observability allows one to determine whether or not the system output observed is sufficient for decision making. Finally, we extend the optimal control of DES to fuzzy DES. The new fuzzy DES theory is consistent with the existing theory, both at the conceptual and the computation levels, in that the former contains the latter as a special case when the memberships must be either 0 or 1.

Notice that the network transmission capacity is limited, a novel combination event-triggered mechanism is designed. Based on the fractional Lyapunov stability criterion and adaptive control technique, an event-triggered adaptive controller is constructed and a sufficient networked synchronization condition for the above-mentioned fractional-order chaotic systems with uncertainties and disturbances is attained. The detailed theoretical derivation and specific numerical simulation demonstrate that the proposed networked synchronization strategy can reduce the burden of network bandwidth effectively without losing the desired synchronization performance.

The controller is required to retain the stability of the system under sensor failure or, in the presence of faults in servovalve and supply pump. A mathematical model describing the hydraulic actuator is derived in which sensor failures and component faults are captured as uncertainties in the model parameters. A robust controller is designed, using quantitative feedback theory (QFT), to maintain key properties of the closed-loop system, i.e., stability and disturbance rejection. The designed controller is easy to implement and no online tuning or adaptation is necessary. The feasibility of the controller was evaluated by implementing it on an experimental test rig. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller under abrupt sensor failures or incorrect supply pump pressures.	fault tolerance;mathematical model;positioning system;rejection sampling;servo	Navid Niksefat;Nariman Sepehri	2002	IEEE Trans.

With indirect learning, the neural network learns the nonlinear basis functions of the system inverse dynamics by a modified backpropagation learning rule. The basis set spans the locally partitioned vector space of inverse dynamics with direct adaptation when indirect learning is achieved within a prescribed error tolerance. For localization of the state space of inverse dynamics, the hash addressing technique from CMAC is used for selecting only a small subset of the network hidden nodes according to where the input vector lies. As such, the global control performance can be obtained by the cooperation of many local convergence properties. For uniform stability, sliding mode control is introduced when the neural network has not sufficiently learned the plant dynamics. With suitable assumptions on the controlled plant, global stability and tracking error convergence proof can be given.

Two nonlinear controllers, one of sliding mode type and the other PI-fuzzy logic-based, define a new control structure. Both controllers are combined by means of an expert system based on Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy reasoning. The sliding-mode controller acts mainly in a transient state while the PI-like fuzzy controller acts in the steady state. The new structure embodies the advantages that both nonlinear controllers offer: sliding-mode controllers increasing system stability limits and PI-like fuzzy logic based controllers reducing the chattering in permanent state. The scheme has been implemented and experimentally validated.	control flow;experiment;expert system;fuzzy logic;mathematical induction;nonlinear system;steady state;transient state	Federico Barrero;Angel Gaspar Gonzalez-Rodriguez;Antonio Torralba;Eduardo Galvan;Leopoldo García Franquelo	2002	IEEE Trans.

An observertype protocol is formulated, which only requires the relative output information of neighbours and does not require information exchange between controllers. It is shown that the protocol bridges some existing ones of the same nature. A robust control approach is presented for consensus protocol design, which requires one to solve a Riccati equation and a linear matrix inequality. Dual results are also discussed. By virtue of lowand high-gain techniques, it is shown that certain solvability conditions are to be satisfied to achieve consensus for agents that are not exponentially unstable or are minimum-phase, leading to a unified point of view for some existing results. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the advantages of the proposed design method.	block cipher mode of operation;communications protocol;consensus (computer science);control theory;information exchange;lagrange multiplier;linear matrix inequality;minimum phase;multi-agent system;numerical analysis;robust control;social inequality;unified framework	Xianwei Li;Yeng Chai Soh;Lihua Xie	2017	Automatica	10.1016/j.automatica.2017.03.001	robust control;control engineering;consensus;multi-agent system;control theory;mathematics;distributed computing;high-gain antenna	Robotics	65.02762622265801	4.051373238412484	140699

Yet all known solutions of sampled-data H problems are limited to the case when the feedthrough part of the lifted system, D̆1 : L 2[0, h] 7→ L2[0, h], satisfies ‖D̆1‖ < γ, where γ is the required H performance level. While this condition is always necessary in feedback control, it might be restrictive in signal processing applications, where some amount of delay or latency between measurement and estimation can be tolerated. In this paper the sampled-data H fixed-lag smoothing problem with a smoothing lag of one sampling period is studied. The problem corresponds to the a-posteriori filtering problem in the lifted domain and is probably the simplest problem for which a smaller than ‖D̆1‖ H performance level is achievable. The necessary and sufficient solvability conditions derived in the paper are compatible with those for the sampled-data filtering problem. This result extends the scope of applicability of the lifting technique and paves the way to the application of sampled-data methods in digital signal processing.	data system;digital signal processing;feedback;lambda lifting;sampling (signal processing);smoothing	Leonid Mirkin;Allan C.

A control theoretic spline is a smoothing spline that is generated as an output of a given linear dynamical system. Conventional design requires exactly the same number of base functions as given data, and the result is not robust against outliers. To solve these problems, we propose to use L1 optimality, that is, we use the L1 norm for the regularization term and/or the empirical risk term. The optimization is described by a convex optimization, which can be efficiently solved via a numerical optimization software. A numerical example shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.	convex optimization;dynamical system;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;smoothing spline;spline (mathematics);t-norm;taxicab geometry;theory	Masaaki Nagahara;Clyde F.

Unfortunately, it is normally difficult to determine the optimal size of networks, particularly, in the sequential training applications such as online control. In this paper, an online training algorithm with a dynamic pruning procedure is proposed for the online tuning and pruning the neural tracking control system. The conic sector theory is introduced in the design of this robust neural control system, which aims at providing guaranteed boundedness for both the input–output signals and the weights of the neural network. The proposed algorithm is applied to a multilayer perceptron with adjustable weights and a complete convergence proof is provided. The neural control system guarantees the closed-loop stability of the estimation, and in turn, a good tracking performance. The performance improvement of the proposed system over existing systems can be qualified in terms of better generalization ability, preventing weight shifts, fast convergence and robustness against system disturbance. r 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Various non-PDC (parallel distribution compensation) fuzzy controllers are proposed to close the feedback loop. The characteristic of T-S fuzzy model is considered to facilitate the stability analysis. Under a particular case, the time-derivative information of the membership functions vanishes, which simplifies the stability analysis and leads to relaxed stability analysis results. A general case is then considered. An improved non-PDC fuzzy controller is proposed based on the properties of the T-S fuzzy model. The improved non-PDC fuzzy controller exhibits a favourable property to relax the stability conditions. Based on the fuzzy Lyapunov function, stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived to guarantee the system stability. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed non-PDC fuzzy control schemes.	feedback;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;peripheral dma controller;programme delivery control;simulation	Hak Keung Lam;Mohammad Narimani;Johnny C.

This paper presents a simple but effective tuning strategy for robust static output feedback (SOF) controllers with minimal quadratic cost in the context of multiple parametric uncertainties. Finding this type of controller is known to be computationally intractable using conventional techniques. This is mainly due to the non-convexity of the resulting control problem, which has a fixed structure. To solve this kind of control problem easily and directly, without using any complicated mathematical manipulations, we utilize Kharitonov’s theorem and an evolutionary algorithm (EA) for the resolution of the underlying constrained optimization problem. Using Kharitonov’s theorem, a family of bounded, robustly stable static output feedback controllers can be defined and EA is used to select the controller that ensures a minimal quadratic cost within this family. The resulting tuning strategy is applicable to both stable and unstable systems, without any limitations on the order of the process to be controlled. A numerical study was conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed tuning procedure.	block cipher mode of operation;computational complexity theory;constrained optimization;constraint (mathematics);control theory;evolutionary algorithm;kharitonov's theorem;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimization problem	Rosario Toscano;Patrick Lyonnet	2010	Inf.

A major assumption they make is that the inputs of the system should be white and mutually independent. It is shown that in that case most of the properties of linear subspace identification theory can be extended to similar properties for bilinear systems. The link between the presented bilinear subspace method and Kalman filter theory is made. Finally, the practical relevance of the method is illustrated by making a direct comparison between linear and bilinear subspace identification methods when applied on data from a model of a distillation column.	bilinear filtering;filter design;kalman filter;relevance	Wouter Favoreel;Bart De Moor;Peter Van Overschee	1999	IEEE Trans.

This paper provides a tutorial overview of RTO in automotive and aerospace applications, with particular focus on MPC which is probably the most largely investigated method. First, we review the features that make RTO appealing for Au0026A applications. Then, due to the model-based nature of these control methods, we describe the key first principle models and opportunities that these provide for RTO. Next, we detail the key steps and guidelines of the MPC design process which are tailored to Au0026A systems. Finally, we discuss numerical algorithms for implementing RTO, and their suitability for implementation in embedded computing platforms to in Au0026A domains.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;computation;embedded system;loss function;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimal control;real-time clock;real-time transcription;recovery time objective;software deployment	Stefano Di Cairano;Ilya V.

The control performance is guaranteed against parametric uncertainties which are assumed to be norm-bounded. This design procedure involves the solution of a Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved via off-the-shelf algorithms.

fb279bc44d9b694d609827f7c1225b5dad748a87	transient performance improvement in model reference adaptive control using h∞ optimal method		Poor transient performance is considered as a drawback of model reference adaptive control. To achieve a better transient behavior, the standard model reference adaptive controller is modified by adding a compensator in this paper. Based on the augmented tracking error dynamics, the compensator can be designed as an   H ∞        H    ∞          optimal controller to eliminate the adverse effect caused by the parameter estimation error in initial stage, so that the transient performance is improved. The proposed modified adaptive controller will not destroy the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop adaptive system as well as the ideal properties of adaptive law, and a predefined transient performance index is taken into account throughout the controller design. The performance analysis using   L ∞        L    ∞          tracking error bound and mean squared tracking error bound in any interval reveals that the amount of the transient performance improvement depends on the performance level of the   H ∞        H    ∞          compensator.

However, fuzzy PID controller design is still a complex task due to the involvement of a large number of parameters in defining the fuzzy rule base. This paper investigates different fuzzy PID controller structures, including the Mamdani-type controller. By expressing the fuzzy rules in different forms, each PLD structure is distinctly identified. For purpose of analysis, a linear-like fuzzy controller is defined. A simple analytical procedure is developed to deduce the closed form solution for a three-input fuzzy inference. This solution is used to identify the fuzzy PID action of each structure type in the dissociated form. The solution for single-input-single-output nonlinear fuzzy inferences illustrates the effect of nonlinearity tuning. The design of a fuzzy PID controller is then treated as a two-level tuning problem. The first level tunes the nonlinear PID gains and the second level tunes the linear gains, including scale factors of fuzzy variables. By assigning a minimum number of rules to each type, the linear and nonlinear gains are deduced and explicitly presented. The tuning characteristics of different fuzzy PID structures are evaluated with respect to their functional behaviors. The rule decoupled and one-input rule structures proposed in this paper provide greater flexibility and better functional properties than the conventional fuzzy PHD structures.	behavior;controllers;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule;inference;nonlinear system;pid;programmable logic device;rule (guideline);rule-based system;staggered tuning	George K.

Thus, data reconciliation for dynamic systems is fundamental and important for control, fault detection, and system optimization. Attempts to successfully implement estimators are often hindered by serve process nonlinearities, complicated state constraints, and un-measurable perturbations. As a constrained minimization problem, the dynamic data reconciliation is dynamically carried out to product smoothed estimates with variances from the original data. Many algorithms are proposed to solve such state estimation such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the unscented Kalman filter, and the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). In this paper, we investigate the use of CKF algorithm in comparative with the EKF to solve the nonlinear dynamic data reconciliation problem. First we give a broad overview of the recursive nonlinear data dynamic reconciliation (RNDDR) scheme, then present an extension to the CKF algorithm, and finally address the issue of how to solve the constraints in the CKF approach. The CCRNDDR method is proposed by applying the RNDDR in the CKF algorithm to handle nonlinearity and algebraic constraints and bounds. As the sampling idea is incorporated into the RNDDR framework, more accurate estimates can obtained via the recursive nature of the estimation procedure. The performance of the CKF approach is compared with EKF and RNDDR on nonlinear process systems with constraints. The conclusion is that with an error optimization solution of the correction step, the reformulated CKF shows high performance on the selection of nonlinear constrained process systems. Simulation results show the CCRNDDR is an efficient, accurate and stable method for real-time state estimation for nonlinear dynamic processes.	approximation algorithm;dynamic data;dynamical system;extended kalman filter;fault detection and isolation;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;numerical integration;process architecture;program optimization;real-time clock;recursion;sampling (signal processing);simulation;smoothing;spatial variability	Min Bian;Jianlin Wang;Weimin Liu;Kepeng Qiu	2017	Cluster Computing	10.1007/s10586-017-0926-0	dynamical system;estimator;kalman filter;constrained optimization;computer science;fault detection and isolation;nonlinear system;dynamic data;mathematical optimization;extended kalman filter	EDA	57.76652245117267	3.5438337119110974	141873

Different from the previous results, the control directions of the considered systems are completely unknown. Adopting the adding a power integrator design technique, we develop an adaptive switching controller with a tuning parameter. Due to control directions unknown, a novel logic switching regulation is established based on Lyapunov function method to overcome this main obstacle. According to this switching rule, the design parameter is tuned online in a switching way. With the help of the obtained adaptive switching controller, the global finite-time stability of the closed-loop systems is shown. To verify the effectiveness of the control algorithm, a simulation example is presented.	adaptive switching;algorithm;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;simulation	Jian Wu;Jing Li;Guangdeng Zong;Weisheng V Chen	2017	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2016.2613998	mathematical optimization;computer science;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	66.76862393680925	-4.469877002306648	141875

Particularly, we focus on systems with a time-delay and/or unstable zeros which cannot be neglected in many applications. For the purpose of the simultaneous attainment of a controller and a model of the plant, we introduce a specific structure of the feedback controller with a tunable parameter in IMC. And then, we utilize the fictitious reference iterative tuning (FRIT), which is a useful controller parameter tuning with only one-shot experimental data, for the tuning of the parametrized feedback controller and the parameterized internal model. In addition, we explain how the utilization of FRIT and the proposed structure on the feedback controller are effective for obtaining not only the desired control parameter but also an appropriate mathematical model of the plant. Finally, in order to show the validity of the proposed method, we give an illustrative example.	control theory;iteration;iterative method;mathematical model;memory controller	Osamu Kaneko;Yusuke Wadagaki;Hien Thi Nguyen;Shigeru Yamamoto	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2011.6044369	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.72611865549928	-3.5887949276793694	141961

71c9eab2f6ba4456d72d2823b5351ddfe06ce48b	a self-tuning hybrid active noise control system		Active Noise Control (ANC) systems are increasingly used to reduce environmental noises. A hybrid ANC system is a combination of feedforward and feedback structures in which the anti-noise signal is generated using both structures. Employing the advantages of feedforward and feedback structures enables a hybrid structure to have a high performance in controlling unwanted noise. The step size of filters used in ANC systems plays an essential role in its performance. Any variation from the appropriate value leads to divergence or inefficiency of the noise controller system. These parameters are often set experimentally, which is a time-consuming task. In addition, there is no guarantee that the system can adapt itself to situational changes. The objective of this paper is to propose a new self-tuning hybrid ANC method. Using this technique, the system continuously estimates the parameters during its operation. Results of computer simulations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.	control system;self-tuning	Laleh Mokhtarpour;Hamid Hassanpour	2012	J.

Motivated by recent research on re-engineering cyber-physical systems, we propose a reverse- and forward-engineering framework which consists of two steps. Firstly, we reverse-engineer a dynamic system as a gradient algorithm to solve an optimization problem. Secondly, we use a forward-engineering approach to systematically design distributed control or modify the existing control. As a result, the system can automatically track the optimal solution of a predefined optimization problem and the control scheme can be implemented in a distributed and closed-loop manner. In order to investigate how general this framework is, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which a linear dynamic system can be reverse-engineered as a gradient algorithm to solve an optimization problem. Those conditions are characterized using properties of system matrices and relevant linear matrix inequalities. A practical example regarding frequency control in power systems demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.	algorithm;convex optimization;cyber-physical system;distributed control system;dynamical system;gradient descent;hamiltonian (quantum mechanics);ibm power systems;linear matrix inequality;linear time-invariant theory;mathematical optimization;model-driven architecture;nonlinear system;optimization problem;reverse engineering;steady state;system dynamics;time complexity;type system	Xuan Zhang;Antonis Papachristodoulou;Na Li	2015	2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2015.7403042	control engineering;linear-quadratic-gaussian control;mathematical optimization;optimal control;computer science;engineering;control system;automatic frequency control;control theory;linear system;steady state	Robotics	61.97967490106192	0.5045487472299832	142402

Based on this signal, the overall system is modeled in min-plus algebra.

An algorithm is devised that generates a fuzzy controller which is functionally identical to a given time-invariant or time-varying finite-dimensional linear controller. The benefit of this transformation is that it provides an automated technique for the initial fuzzy controller setup while vital knowledge-based attributes are integrated afterwards. An important result of this work is that once a linguistic mapping into the fuzzy domain has been performed, one can see in linguistic terms how the linear controller operates. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated with a model for a flexible robot that exhibits nonminimum phase characteristics. An extension is outlined to use this deterministic approach for the case of a general dynamic control-law, and several applications to nonlinear control problems are discussed.	algorithm;controllers;exhibits as topic;fuzzy concept;linguistics;mimo;minimum phase;nonlinear system;numerous;preparation;robot;time-invariant system	Eric Kubica;Daniel R.

fe64f37459dc45742cd4ec462e9a23cf9c625db5	support vector regression-based adaptive divided difference filter for nonlinear state estimation problems		We present a support vector regression-based adaptive divided difference filter (SVRADDF) algorithm for improving the low state estimation accuracy of nonlinear systems, which are typically affected by large initial estimation errors and imprecise prior knowledge of process and measurement noises. The derivative-free SVRADDF algorithm is significantly simpler to compute than other methods and is implemented using only functional evaluations. The SVRADDF algorithm involves the use of the theoretical and actual covariance of the innovation sequence. Support vector regression (SVR) is employed to generate the adaptive factor to tune the noise covariance at each sampling instant when the measurement update step executes, which improves the algorithm’s robustness. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by estimating states for (i) an underwater nonmaneuvering target bearing-only tracking system and (ii) maneuvering target bearing-only tracking in an air-traffic control system. The simulation results show that the proposed SVRADDF algorithm exhibits better performance when compared with a traditional DDF algorithm.	algorithm;control system;disk data format;divided differences;nonlinear system;sampling (signal processing);simulation;support vector machine;tracking system	Hongjian Wang;Jinlong Xu;Aihua Zhang;Cun Li;Hongfei Yao	2014	J.

Estimation is performed using a maximum a posteriori probability estimator (MAP) within a given window of interest. To mediate the incorporation of information from other sensors we introduce Lagrange multipliers to penalize the disagreement between neighboring estimates. We show that the resulting distributed (D-)MAP algorithm is able to track dynamical signals with a small error. This error is characterized in terms of problem constants and vanishes with the sampling time as long as the log-likelihood function satisfies a smoothness condition.	algorithm;converge;distributed computing;dynamical system;lagrange multiplier;sampling (signal processing);scott continuity;sensor;stochastic process	Felicia Y.

The design procedure consists on three steps. Firstly, an Input/Output feedback linearization is applied to transform the nonlinear model into a linear equivalent one. Secondly, by defining a quadratic performance, an optimal sliding surface will be designed. Finally, a super-twisting algorithm with time delay estimation is proposed for high accuracy tracking trajectory. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the finite-time convergence of the sliding surface and its derivative. This structure is used to estimate unknown dynamics and to reduce the control effort and the chattering phenomenon.

The method is implemented in real-time and is able to operate in open loop or closed loop. The recursive identification is performed via the subsequent solution of only three linear problems, which are solved using recursive least squares. The recursive implementation of the method is not only able to identify linear time-invariant models from measured data, but can also be used to track slowly time-varying dynamics if adaptive filters are used. The computational complexity is reduced by exploiting the structure in the data equations and by using array algorithms to solve the main linear problem. This results in a fast recursive predictor-based subspace identification method suited for real-time implementation. The real-time implementation and the ability to work with multi-input and multi-output systems operating in closed loop makes this approach suitable for online estimation of unstable dynamics. The ability to do so is demonstrated by the detection of flutter on an experimental 2-D-airfoil system.	adaptive filter;algorithm;closed-loop transfer function;computational complexity theory;control theory;experiment;kerrison predictor;linear programming;linear time-invariant theory;modal logic;numerical analysis;real-time clock;real-time computing;real-time transcription;recursion (computer science);recursive least squares filter;singularity project;technological singularity;time complexity;time-invariant system;wow and flutter measurement	Ivo Houtzager;Jan-Willem van Wingerden;Michel Verhaegen	2012	IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology	10.1109/TCST.2011.2157694	adaptive filter;control engineering;open-loop controller;mathematical optimization;aerodynamics;nonlinear programming;control theory;mathematics;markov process;statistics;recursive partitioning	Embedded	61.08252982950012	-3.0001023451308777	143714
4e16fd1e32b35479eea11fef1cf0d236b54364f5	a new smooth parameter projection high order tuner for robust adaptive control		Abstract   Adjustable parameters in an adaptive controller are usually constrained into a specified convex set from the viewpoint of realizing an adaptive controller and/or guaranteeing the robust stability in adaptive loop. In conventional studies [13, 14, 17, 18, 21], the convex set to be constrained is a hyper-rectangular or a hyper-sphere in order to accomplish a realization of adaptive controller, an efficient estimation and a robust stability of adaptation loop. These methods are suitable for an adaptive control such as dynamic certainty equivalent (DyCE) control or an adaptive backstepping control. In this paper, we propose new two smooth projection high order tuner which can not only achieve the ability of conventional restraint but also improve the deterioration of the transient response of the adaptive control system based on DyCE principle. According to this smooth projection adaptation law, the adjustable parameters can be constrained into the inside of  hyper-parallelogram.

To prevent this side effect, regulation of the blood pressure for this kind of patient is necessary. The aim of an automatic drug control system is to quickly reduce the oscillatory change in mean blood pressure through infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP). In this paper, a new adaptive PI algorithm updating variations in time-delay and sensitivity of the patient is proposed and its effectiveness is analysed in detail. Simulation under clinical conditions is also carried out and the results show that this control system can handle the changes in patient’s dynamics.	algorithm;control system;simulation	K. Y. Zhu;U.

The nonlinear systems addressed in this paper are assumed to possess unmodeled dynamics in the presence of unstructured uncertainties and dynamic disturbances, where the unstructured uncertainties are not linearly parameterized, and no prior knowledge of their bounds are available. Fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate the unstructured uncertainties, and a state observer is developed to estimate the unmeasured states. By combining the backstepping technique with the small-gain approach, a stable adaptive fuzzy output feedback control method is proposed. It is shown that by applying the proposed adaptive fuzzy control approach, the closed-loop systems are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated from simulation results.	approximation algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;feedback;formal system;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;nonlinear system;simulation	Shaocheng Tong;Xianglei He;Huaguang Zhang	2009	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2021648	fuzzy logic;robust control;mathematical optimization;index term;backstepping;nonlinear system;computer science;control theory;mathematics;state observer;fuzzy control system	Robotics	65.40884019796528	-5.362257793314006	143850

The overall architecture is in fact a system advisor, which provides information to the anaesthetist about the adequate infusion-rates of propofol and remifentanil simultaneously.   METHODS AND MATERIAL The developed fuzzy multivariable controller includes three rule-bases and takes into account the synergetic interactions between the above drugs and uses such knowledge to achieve rapidly the desired depth of anaesthesia (DOA) level.   RESULTS The result of the study is a closed-loop control scheme, which adjusts efficiently the infusion-rates of two drugs in response to DOA changes. This controller can either be used in an advisory mode or closed-loop feedback mode in the operating theatre during surgery.   CONCLUSION It is hoped that this control scheme coupled with the patient model presented in Part I of this study will be used routinely in the operating theatre in the very near future.	base;control theory;controllers;direction of arrival;interaction;operating room;operating tables;patients;propofol;simulation;synergetics (fuller);algorithm	Mahdi Mahfouf;Catarina S.

In addition to this extended Kalman filter being designed as a locally optimal minimum variance estimator, this work proves that it also has local finite-time mean-square boundedness of the estimation error, stochastic H2, and H∞ properties.

This new approach is based on an algorithm previously introduced by the authors, which elaborates on a convergent sequence of linear deterministic-stochastic state-space approximations. In the previous algorithm the bilinear term between the time varying parameter vector and the state vector is allowed to behave as a white noise process when the scheduling parameter is a white noise sequence. However, this is a strong limitation in practice since, most often than not, the scheduling parameter is imposed by the process itself and it is typically a non white noise signal. In this paper, the bilinear term is analysed for non white noise scheduling sequences. It is concluded that its behaviour depends on the input sequence itself and it ranges from acting as an independent colored noise source, mostly removed by the identification algorithm, down to a highly input correlated signal that may be incorrectly assumed as being part of the system subspace. Based on the premise that the algorithm performance can be improved by the noise energy reduction, the bilinear term is expressed as a function of past inputs, scheduling parameters, outputs, and states, and the linear terms are included in a new extended input.	algorithm;approximation;best, worst and average case;bilinear filtering;colors of noise;computer performance;mimo;monte carlo method;noise generator;quantum state;scheduling (computing);simulation;state space;system identification;white noise;worst-case scenario	Paulo J.

The Activated Sludge Process (ASP), as the most commonly applied biological wastewater purification technique, attracts a great deal of attention from the research community. We developed for this class of processes a State Dependent Differential Riccati Filter (SDDRF) for state estimation of nonlinear model describing the system. The resulting software sensor is simple to implement and has a relatively low computational cost. The results are compared with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in order to demonstrate the better performance of the SDDRF filter. The filter allows the on-line tracking of process variables, which are not directly measurable. The simulation results point out to the advantage of using this approach.	algorithmic efficiency;extended kalman filter;netapp filer;nonlinear system;online and offline;purification of quantum state;sensor;simulation;the filter	Abdelhamid Iratni;M.

The reservoir properties are highly heterogeneous; its states change as production progresses which require varying injection and production settings for economic recovery. As water is injected into the reservoir, more oil is expected to be produced. There is also likelihood that water is produced in association with the oil. The worst case is when the injected water meanders through the reservoir; it bypasses pools of oil and gets produced. Therefore, any effort geared toward finding the optimal settings to maximize the value of this venture can never be over emphasized. Traditional optimal control is an open-loop solution, hence cannot cope with various uncertainties inevitably existing in any practical systems. Reservoir models are highly uncertain. Its properties are known with some degrees of certainty near the well-bore region only. In this work, a novel data-driven approach for control variable (CV) selection was developed and applied to reservoir waterflooding process for a feedback strategy resulting in optimal or near optimal control. The results indicated that the feedback control method was close to optimal in the absence of uncertainty. The loss recorded in the value of performance index, net present value (NPV) was only 0.26%. Furthermore, the new strategy performs better than the open-loop optimal control solution when system/model mismatch was considered. The performance depends on the scale of the uncertainty introduced. A gain in NPV as high as 30.04% was obtained.	best, worst and average case;control theory;dynamic data;feedback;optimal control;system on a chip;whole earth 'lectronic link	Alhaji S.

In this paper, we propose a robust generalized maximum likelihood (GM)-estimator based power system forecasting-aided state estimation, which integrates the statistical characteristics of both loads and DGs, i.e., spatial and temporal correlations. A first order vector auto-regressive model (VAR(1)) is developed to capture the statistical characteristics of load and DGs, facilitating short-term loads and DGs forecasting. These forecasted power injections are further combined with power balance equations to derive a new state transition model, where the relationship between forecasted state vector and predicted power injections is expressed explicitly. After that, a redundant batch regression model that simultaneously processes predicted state vector and received observations is derived, allowing the development of a robust estimator. To this end, we propose a robust GM-estimator that leverages modified projection statistics and a Huber convex score function, to bound the influence of observation outliers while maintaining its high statistical estimation efficiency. Finally, the iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is adopted to solve the GM-estimator. Numerical comparisons on IEEE benchmark systems with DGs integration demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);data-flow analysis;estimation theory;high-level programming language;huber loss;ibm power systems;iteratively reweighted least squares;numerical method;real-time locating system;simulation;state transition table;time series	Junbo Zhao;Gexiang Zhang;Zhao Yang Dong;Massimo La Scala	2018	IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid	10.1109/TSG.2016.2615473	control engineering;econometrics;computer science;engineering;statistics	EDA	54.630385302949	-0.4445232801886366	145062

The quantization error in low resolution sensors cannot be neglect, and then a stabilizer should take the error into account. The stabilizer may be realized as an event-based controller because measurement is performed when low resolution sensors output quantized values. The measurement output may be a constant value when the ideal output of the plant is within a quantization width. Therefore it is difficult to design a controller and estimator of the systems according to ordinary linear control system designs in the use of the measurement output. This paper proposes a simple controller designed which is based on the generalized holder concept to overcome this problem. The generalized holder consists of a dynamic holder and corrector, and this paper also presents the separation theorem about the pole assignments of both dynamic holder and corrector in our case.	control system;gabbay's separation theorem;image resolution;linear system;quantization (signal processing);sensor;simulation;stabilizer code	Masami Iwase;Satoru Katohno;Teruyoshi Sadahiro	2009	2009 IEEE Control Applications, (CCA) & Intelligent Control, (ISIC)	10.1109/CCA.2009.5280930	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	64.03032715281523	-4.14895021993526	145228

An integrator is augmented to the system due to the responses exhibiting steady-state error. In order to apply the CDM method, the augmented system must be firstly linearized and converted into controllable canonical form by a transform matrix. Then a feedback gain matrix in sense of CDM can be obtained. One can observe that the design procedure of the proposed controller is easy compared to other methods. The experimental results are shown in order to verify the effectiveness of the controller.	coefficient diagram method;control theory;inverted pendulum;servo;steady state;transformation matrix;trionic	A.

259abef89fef49f06e779a348cf7bbce210b4ca2	integral concurrent learning: adaptive control with parameter convergence without pe or state derivatives		Concurrent learning is a recently developed adaptive update scheme that can be used to guarantee parameter convergence without requiring persistent excitation. However, this technique requires knowledge of state derivatives, which are usually not directly sensed and therefore must be estimated. A novel integral concurrent learning method is developed in this paper that removes the need to estimate state derivatives while maintaining parameter convergence properties. A Monte Carlo simulation illustrates improved robustness to noise compared to the traditional derivative formulation.	estimation theory;lyapunov fractal;monte carlo method;simulation;system identification;on-line system	Anup Parikh;Rushikesh Kamalapurkar;Warren E.

The method is first demonstrated on a simple linear system and is then applied to the start-up of a drive with a three-phase asynchronous motor with constant torque, representing a strongly nonlinear fifth order dynamic system. The proposed controller is verified through simulation using the MATLAB software package.

It is assumed that the non-linear discrete-time system is described by a state equation subject to a random disturbance, and the state is measured in the contamination with random noise. The disturbance is denoted as mismatched time-varying uncertainty, and the estimates for the state and the uncertainty are taken by using the proposed weighted least squares estimator (WLSE). The proposed adaptive SMC is constructed on the basis of the estimates obtained by the proposed WLSE. It is verified by the Lyapunov method that the estimation error equation and the non-linear discrete-time system are ultimately stable under the action of the proposed adaptive SMC. The effectiveness of the proposed method is indicated by the simulation experiment in a simple numerical example.	discrete-time signal;least squares;lyapunov fractal;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;numerical analysis;simulation	Toshio Yoshimura	2008	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2008.021162	control engineering;mathematical optimization;sliding mode control;adaptive control;engineering;control theory	Robotics	66.07488490564552	-3.8190532587811714	145592

First, the transient phase of the unit response of the closed loop system is taken into consideration and the response is divided into certain regions which are assigned in accordance with the number of membership functions defined for the error input of the fuzzy logic controller. Secondly, the relative importance or influence of the fired fuzzy rules of the fuzzy logic controller are determined for each region and the meta-rules are derived for the adjustment of corresponding fuzzy rule weight values to obtain an efficient and appropriate control signal that will achieve a desired system response. For this purpose, two simple functions based on the absolute value of the normalized system error are used for the assignment of the rule weights by an adequate arrangement in accordance with the meta-rules derived. The effectiveness of the proposed self tuning method is demonstrated on various processes by simulations. The proposed new fuzzy rule weighting method improves the transient response in terms of overshoots, oscillations and settling time.	closed-loop transfer function;fuzzy control system;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule;online and offline;pid;settling time;simulation	Onur Karasakal;Müjde Güzelkaya;Ibrahim Eksin;Engin Yesil	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642306	pid controller;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy classification;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy set;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system	Robotics	61.847421143404524	-7.809479007526019	145629

In order to deal with these constraints, we introduce a coordinate transformation to eliminate the average mode and assure stabilizability and detectability of the remaining modes. To design networks with low communication requirements, we seek solutions to the ℓ1 regularized version of the standard ℋ2 optimal control problem. Such solutions trade off network performance and sparsity of the controller. We also identify a class of optimal control problems that can be cast as semidefinite programs.

The model of the underlying leader-following MAS contains Lipschitz-type nonlinearities and external disturbances. In order to accomplish consensus tracking while simultaneous actuator faults may occur in some of the followers, an active fault-tolerant controller composed of online fault estimation and accommodation schemes is proposed. To obtain real-time information of the unknown time-varying fault functions, an observer-based fuzzy wavelet neural network is developed in each follower. Then, based on the estimated faults, an accommodation scheme is introduced to compensate the effects of faults. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed fault-tolerant control approach, simulation results on a group of rotary-wing air vehicles are provided.	actuator device component;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;consensus dynamics;contraction mapping;drug vehicle;fault tolerance;nonlinear system;real-time data;rotary woofer;simulation;visual accommodation;wavelet	Maryam Salimifard;H.

The new methodology invokes ideas from the anti-windup literature in order to address the problem from a practical point of view. This leads to a design procedure very much like that found in anti-windup design: first a linear controller ignoring output constraints is designed; then an additional compensation network which ensures the output limits are, as far as possible, respected, is added. As the constraints occur at the output, global results can be obtained for both stable and unstable plants.	closed-loop transfer function;control theory;game controller;linear matrix inequality;linear system;numerical stability;small-signal model	Matthew C.

Then, we compute the sensitivity of such a desired transfer function with respect to its characteristic ratio and we explore its specifications. The relation between the coefficient diagram shape and the relative stability of the closed loop system is discussed. Also, the closed loop poles variations due to the changes in the characteristic ratios are investigated. Finally, we study a pseudo second order process to verify the robust performance of the characteristic ratio assignment approach with RST control structure. & 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As universal approximators, they are capable of representing any continuous nonlinear system dynamics with arbitrary accuracy by means of a rule base. First, basic definitions of both systems are revisited here, and unifying canonical forms are given. Then, a stability criterion is derived for the system classes, which is based on approximating piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions and formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The main contribution is the demonstration of the stability analysis and estimation of region of attraction by means of these models, outperforming methods reported in the literature.	approximation;bilinear filtering;fuzzy control system;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;rule-based system;structural similarity;system dynamics	Stefan Gering;Luka Eciolaza;Jürgen Adamy;Michio Sugeno	2015	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2417870	mathematical optimization;mathematical analysis;computer science;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;circle criterion;fuzzy control system	Embedded	62.952105472942094	-3.3246066757355526	146446

The uncertainties occurring in the system parameter is assumed to be random and satisfy the Bernoulli distribution. The main objective of this work is to design a non-fragile sampled-data controller such that the resulting closed-loop system is robustly stochastically stable and strictly ( Q , S , R ) - α -dissipative. By constructing a suitable augmented Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) with Lyapunov stability theory, some sufficient conditions are composed in the structure of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and it can be interpreted through some known software collection. Finally, a practical example with simulation is provided to indicate the usefulness of the suggested control design technique.	control system;randomness	S.

If the violation at some buses falls outside the prescribed range, it will be necessary to correct the problem by controlling reactive power resources. In this paper, an optimal algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by identifying the voltage buses, that will have a maximum effect on the affected buses, and setting their new set-points. This algorithm is based on the Eigen-Value Decomposition of the fast decoupled load flow Jacobian matrix.

It is well known that Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model describes a wide class of nonlinear systems especially when its premise variables include immeasurable functions. However, when it comes to control design of such a fuzzy system with immeasurable premise variables, a conventional parallel distributed compensator(PDC) is not feasible because it shares the same premise variables as those of a fuzzy system. In this paper, we introduce an output feedback controller with the estimate of the premise variables of an original fuzzy system. We then formulate the stabilization problem for a fuzzy system with immeasurable premise variables. Our control design method is based on a set of strict LMI conditions. No tuning parameter is necessary a priori to solve LMI conditions. Our method includes tuning matrices for control gains in a controller and hence they can be chosen to optimize the control performance of the system. Furthermore, we extend our results to a class of fuzzy systems with uncertain parameters. A design method of robust controller for such uncertain systems is also given. Numerical examples are finally given to illustrate our control design method.	block cipher mode of operation;control engineering;control theory;feedback;fuzzy control system;linear matrix inequality;log management;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;numerical method;robust control	Jun Yoneyama	2010	International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/FUZZY.2010.5584574	mathematical optimization;defuzzification;design methods;nonlinear system;computer science;artificial intelligence;fuzzy number;control theory;mathematics;fuzzy set operations;fuzzy control system	Robotics	65.31597251397687	-3.395277901023138	146798

The adaptive critic design consist of three entities, an observer to estimate the system states, an action network that produces optimal control input and a critic that evaluates the performance of the action network. The critic is termed adaptive as it adapts itself to output the optimal cost-to-go function which is based on the standard Bellman equation. By using the Lyapunov approach, the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the estimation and tracking errors and weight estimates is demonstrated. The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated for the task of nanomanipulation in a simulation environment.	artificial neural network;bellman equation;block cipher mode of operation;control theory;entity;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;optimal control;reinforcement learning;simulation	Qinmin Yang;Sarangapani Jagannathan	2007	2007 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Intelligent Control	10.1109/ISIC.2007.4450950	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	62.79120992986024	-3.4935968816841716	146896

Because of the two-timescale characteristics of flexible manipulators, applying the existing model-free control methods may lead to ill-conditioned numerical problems. In this paper, the dynamics of a flexible manipulator is decomposed into two subsystems which are linear and controllable at different timescales by singular perturbation (SP) theory and a model-free composite controller is designed to alleviate the ill-conditioned numerical problems. To do this, a model-free composite control strategy is constructed which facilitates in designing the controller in slow and fast timescales. In the slow timescale, the slow subsystem controller is designed by adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) based on the measurements of the slow inputs and the position, while the vibration in the slow timescale is estimated by the least square method. In the fast timescale, the vibration is reconstructed based on the measurements of vibration and its estimate in the slow timescale, by which the fast controller is designed using ADP.

It was already proven that this fusion method combines strong fundamental properties with attractive features in accuracy and computational requirements. However, these features were derived for linear processes with observability of the state vector in at least one of the local measurements. Therefore, several empirical case-studies are performed to assess ellipsoidal intersection with respect to three real-life limitations. A scenario of cooperative adaptive cruise control is used to analyze the absence of observability in any local measurement. Furthermore, the Van-der-Pol oscillator and a benchmark application of tracking shockwaves on highways assess the fusion method for nonlinear process models. The latter example is also used in a set-up where the employed state estimation methodology differs per node, so to meet different computational requirements per node.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);computation;extended kalman filter;local variable;nonlinear system;observable;real life;requirement;van der pol oscillator	Joris Sijs;Mircea Lazar	2011	14th International Conference on Information Fusion		control engineering;mathematical optimization;engineering;control theory	Robotics	59.093338094443396	2.857571313701573	147001

The input variables are estimated using an unscented Kalman filter applied to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements of position, speed, and bearing. The resulting test statistic is evaluated in a field study where three smartphones are used as measurement probes. A general framework for performance evaluation and estimator calibration is presented as depending on a generic loss function. Furthermore, we introduce loss functions designed for applications aiming to either minimize the number of missed detections and false alarms, or to estimate the risk level in each cornering event. Finally, the performance characteristics of the estimator are presented as depending on the detection threshold, as well as on design parameters describing the driving behavior. Since the estimation only uses GNSS measurements, the framework is particularly well suited for smartphone-based insurance telematics applications, aiming to avoid the logistic and monetary costs associated with, e.g., on-board-diagnostics or black-box dependent solutions. The design of the estimation algorithm allows for instant feedback to be given to the driver and, hence, supports the inclusion of real-time value-added services in usage-based insurance programs.	algorithm;black box;field research;kalman filter;loss function;on-board data handling;performance evaluation;real-time clock;satellite navigation;sensor;smartphone;telematics;time value of money	Johan Wahlström;Isaac Skog;Peter Händel	2015	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2015.2431293	kalman filter;embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;machine learning;computer security	Visualization	56.426153318609295	1.9872244103211911	147156
22ae2b42763957e09e3e25702d46bb5d53133c39	parameter estimation of fuzzy neural network controller based on a modified differential evolution	fuzzy neural network;modified differential evolution;inverted pendulum;identifier	A tracking control of a nonlinear system is proposed in this paper via a fuzzy neural network (FNN) controller based on a modified differential evolution (MDE). The proposed modified differential evolution fuzzy neural network controller (MDEFNN) is composed of an FNN identifier, a hitting controller, a computation controller and a MDE estimator. First, the FNN identifier is used to estimate parameters of the nonlinear system. In order to compensate the uncertainties of the system parameters and achieve robust stability of the considered system, the hitting controller is adopted. The computation controller is used to sum up the outputs of the FNN identifier and hitting controller. Furthermore, there are two main learning phases in MDEFNN controller - the training phase and the online phase. In training phase, the mutation operation of the proposed MDE estimator according to fitness function effective produces a mutation vector. The MDE estimator is adopted to estimate the parameters of the MDEFNN controller. Therefore, there are several parameters such as the learning rates of the back-propagation (BP) algorithm, the parameters of error terms which are used in BP algorithm. The initial values of the FNN identifier and some preset parameters of MDEFNN controller can also be estimated by MDE estimator. After the best preset parameters are obtained, the nonlinear system is controlled by using MDEFNN controller. Further, the online parameter learning of the FNN identifier is based on the BP algorithm using error terms in the online phase. Finally, the simulation results are provided to demonstrate robustness, effectiveness and accurate tracking performance of the proposed MDEFNN controller under the conditions of external disturbance.	artificial neural network;differential evolution;estimation theory;network interface controller;neuro-fuzzy	Hung-Ching Lu;Ming-Hung Chang;Cheng-Hung Tsai	2012	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2012.02.017	open-loop controller;inverted pendulum;identifier;computer science;machine learning;control theory;artificial neural network	ML	62.65248431465808	-9.359651561376358	147203

Firstly, a sequence of step signals with various amplitudes are supplied to the system. The structure of the static nonlinear function is obtained from the input step signals and their corresponding steady-state responses. Once the structure of the nonlinearity is determined, the parameters describing the nonlinearity are estimated through minimizing an objective function. Secondly, the parameters of the linear dynamic subsystem are estimated using random input from the view point of optimization. Particle swarm optimization is used to solve the two optimization problems involved in parameter estimation of static nonlinear function and linear dynamic subsystem. The proposed method makes the identification problem of nonlinearity separate from that of linear part and simplifies the identification procedure significantly. Also, it does not require any structure information about the static nonlinear function. Two examples are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Utilising the polynomials parameter-dependent quadratic functions and a suitable change of variables, the required sufficient conditions with high precision for the design of a desired observer-based control are established in terms of delay-dependent parameter-independent linear matrix inequalities. An observer-based controller guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system and satisfying a prescribed level of performance to the LPV neutral system with constant delay parameters is developed. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii method underlies the observer-based control design. A numerical example with simulation results illustrates the effectiveness of the methodology. ∞ H	convex optimization;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;polynomial;quadratic function;simulation	Hamid Reza Karimi;Peter Maass	2008	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2008.021160	control engineering;mathematical optimization;linear matrix inequality;control theory;mathematics;state observer;separation principle;alpha beta filter;state variable	Robotics	65.96943808941187	-2.0525523614960974	147355

The algorithm introduces a reference model to generate a desired output and minimizes a performance index based on the error between the reference and plant output. To minimize the performance index, the control input and the membership functions are simultaneously updated by a gradient method. Using the algorithm, we can easily achieve good control rules with a minimal amount of prior information about the environment. In particular, when this algorithm is applied to a tracking problem with a nonlinear plant we obtain efficient control rules with fewer number of rules and higher learning speed than those of the fixed membership function.	auto-tune	Byeong-Mook Chung;Jun-Ho Oh	1993	Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems	10.3233/IFS-1993-1408	defuzzification;fuzzy classification;fuzzy number;machine learning;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	61.59397856933781	-8.30242376819575	147367

Such power plants are being considered for industrial applications with a wide range of power levels, and thus power-level regulation is an important for the efficient and stable operation. Stimulated by the high regulation performance given by nonlinear controllers, a novel dynamic output-feedback nonlinear power-level regulator is presented in this paper based on iterative damping assignment (IDA). This controller can provide the L2 disturbance attenuation performance under modeling uncertainty or exterior disturbance, and can guarantee the globally asymptotic closed-loop stability without uncertainty and disturbance. This newly-built control is then applied to the power-level regulation of the HTR-PM plant, and numerical simulation results show the feasibility and high performance of this control strategy. Moreover, the relationship between the control parameters and the regulation performance is not only illustrated numerically but also analyzed theoretically.	block cipher mode of operation;computer simulation;control theory;iterative method;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;reactor (software)	Zhe Dong	2012	2012 12th International Conference on Control Automation Robotics & Vision (ICARCV)	10.1109/ICARCV.2012.6485259	damping;control engineering;electronic engineering;power control;engineering;control theory;feedback;mathematics;iterative method	Robotics	59.28048944932593	-3.449068742574569	147390

70e0974050edd8fa26a7716ca1d769b52b440d1c	closed-loop instrumental variable identification of propofol anesthesia		One of the challenges in the development of high-performance closed-loop anesthetic drug delivery systems is the lack of accurate models. Physiological models have limited accuracy and drug effect varies largely between patients, while data-driven modeling of individual responses is challenging due to limited excitation and disturbances. This paper proposes a multi-input single-output (MISO) approach to deal with the effect of disturbances by identifying a plant model as well as a disturbance model. Furthermore, a MISO extension to closed-loop instrumental variable (IV) identification is proposed. Closed-loop IV methods are consistent without the need for identification of intermediate variables or noise-model parameters. Identification of fewer parameters is expected to be advantageous in this application where excitation is limited. The proposed approach is compared to closed-loop prediction-error methods. IV estimation achieved similar performance to a tailor-made parametrization. Bias in direct output-error (OE) estimates due to noise is limited. Closed-loop methods that require a controller description or that introduce additional computational complexity do not significantly improve model accuracy compared to direct OE estimation in this application.	anesthetics;clinical data;common variable immunodeficiency;computational complexity theory;controllers;convex optimization;disruptive, impulse control, and conduct disorders;drug delivery systems;estimated;excitation;jenkins;low-pass filter;mathematical optimization;numerous;patients;propofol;soft-in soft-out decoder;system analysis;system identification;variable (computer science);negative regulation of type iv pilus biogenesis;neuron projection extension involved in neuron projection guidance	Klaske van Heusden;John Mark Ansermino;Guy Albert Dumont	2017	2017 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)	10.1109/CCTA.2017.8062616	drug delivery;instrumental variable;anesthetic;propofol;control theory;parametrization;control theory;medicine	Robotics	55.57901496166794	-7.9184320259594365	147412

In this paper we extend existing results on robust stability of min-max MPC to the case of systems with uncertainties which depend on the state and the input and not necessarily decaying, i.e. state and input dependent bounded uncertainties. This allows us to consider both plant uncertainties and external disturbances in a less conservative way. It is shown that the input-to-state practical stability (ISpS) notion is suitable to analyze the stability of worst-case based controllers. Thus, we provide Lyapunov-like sufficient conditions for ISpS. Based on this, it is proved that if the terminal cost is an ISpS-Lyapunov function then the optimal cost is also an ISpS-Lyapunov function for the system controlled by the min-max MPC and hence, the controlled system is ISpS. Moreover, we show that if the system controlled by the terminal control law locally admits certain stability margin, then the system controlled by the min-max MPC retains the stability margin in the feasibility region.	maxima and minima;nonlinear system	Daniel Limón;Teodoro Alamo;Francisco Salas;Eduardo F.

After the fault has been detected and diagnosed, several controller reconfigurations are proposed as candidate corrective actions for the fault compensation. The solution of a set of constrained DMPC optimization problems with different actuator and setpoint reconfigurations is derived by means of an original approach that exploits the information on the active constraints in the non-faulty subsystems, so as to split the global optimization problem into two optimization subproblems, which enables the on-line computation burden to be greatly reduced. Subsequently, the performances of different candidate controller reconfigurations are compared, and the better performing one is selected and then implemented to compensate the fault effects. Simulation results on a benzene alkylation process have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed performance optimization algorithm in the fault tolerant distributed model predictive control.	active set method;algorithm;computation;fault tolerance;global optimization;mathematical optimization;online and offline;optimization problem;performance tuning;setpoint (control system);simulation	Alexey Zakharov;Elena Zattoni;Miao Yu;Sirkka-Liisa Jämsä Jounela	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	10.1109/CoASE.2015.7294193	control engineering;real-time computing;engineering;control reconfiguration;control theory	Robotics	59.99948238231781	-3.3738169638044995	147523

Different from some traditional anti-disturbance results, T-S fuzzy models are firstly employed to describe the nonlinear disturbances, in which a disturbance observer based on T-S exogenous models is designed under different conditions to estimate the unknown nonlinear disturbances for the plants with known and unknown nonlinearities, respectively. By integrating the estimates of disturbance with PI-type control input, a composite controller based on convex optimization theory is proposed to ensure the system stability and convergence of the tracking error to zero. Meanwhile, the favorable disturbance estimation and attenuation performance can also be achieved by the designed convex optimization algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes is verified by simulations for flight control systems with three different types of nonlinear disturbances.	fuzzy concept;nonlinear system	Yang Yi;Xiang Xiang Fan;Tianping Zhang	2016	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2015.07.039	mathematical optimization;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	65.3662955797038	-5.481489193319249	147589

Faults are detected by using a novel (FD) observer consisting of two online approximators in discrete-time (OLAD) and a robust adaptive term. Upon detection, a fault diagnosis scheme is introduced to determine the fault type by monitoring the input residual generated via the first OLAD output. Then the appropriate OLAD is included in the observer while the other OLAD is switched off. Next, by using both the parameter update law of the active OLAD and user-selected failure thresholds, an online time-to-failure (TTF) scheme is introduced. Boundedness and asymptotic convergence of the residual and parameter estimation errors respectively are derived in the case of multiplicative and additive faults respectively. Finally a simulation example is used to demonstrate the proposed fault diagnosis scheme.	estimation theory;fault detection and isolation;mathematical model;nonlinear system;online and offline;simulation;test template framework;unified model;utility functions on indivisible goods	Hasan Ferdowsi;Sarangapani Jagannathan	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6161292	robust control;control engineering;mathematical optimization;failure analysis;discrete time and continuous time;food additive;unified model;control theory;mathematics;estimation theory	Robotics	64.24777943903791	-5.048724310853241	147839

The introduction of the reset element in the adaptive law can decrease the overshooting and settling time of the estimation process without sacrificing the rising time. The stability and convergence LMI-based analysis of the proposed ReO is addressed and, additionally, an easily computable method to determine the L2 gain of the ReO dealing with noise-corrupted systems is presented.	algorithm;computable function;dynamical system;log management;lyapunov fractal;nonlinear system;requirement;rise time;settling time;simulation	David Paesa;Carlos Franco;Sergio Llorente;Gonzalo López-Nicolás;Carlos Sagüés	2012	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2011.2164819	control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;control theory;mathematics;hybrid system	Visualization	67.15484196123992	-3.6982221764415804	147841
68ee052e12b86ea2cc948aadcb71de0fca7dd589	sparse wide-area control of power systems using data-driven reinforcement learning		In this paper we present an online wide-area oscillation damping control (WAC) design for uncertain models of power systems using ideas from reinforcement learning. We assume that the exact small-signal model of the power system at the onset of a contingency is not known to the operator and use the nominal model and online measurements of the generator states and control inputs to rapidly converge to a state-feedback controller that minimizes a given quadratic energy cost. However, unlike conventional linear quadratic regulators (LQR), we intend our controller to be sparse, so its implementation reduces the communication costs. We, therefore, employ the gradient support pursuit (GraSP) optimization algorithm to impose sparsity constraints on the control gain matrix during learning. The sparse controller is thereafter implemented using distributed communication. Using the IEEE 39-bus power system model with 1149 unknown parameters, it is demonstrated that the proposed learning method provides reliable LQR performance while the controller matched to the nominal model becomes unstable for severely uncertain systems.	algorithm;centralized computing;control theory;converge;gradient;ibm power systems;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;onset (audio);reinforcement learning;small-signal model;sparse matrix	Amirhassan Fallah Dizche;Aranya Chakrabortty;Alexandra Duel-Hallen	2018	CoRR		control theory;operator (computer programming);electric power system;mathematics;control theory;matrix (mathematics);reinforcement learning;oscillation;grasp;convergence (routing)	Robotics	61.23277639398747	-2.0008426830201134	148087

The modeling is under the Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework, which is a data-driven approach. To address he time-varying phenomenon which commonly exists in the manufacturing processes, an online GPR algorithm is adopted. Next, model predictive control (MPC) is designed based on the obtained GPR model which aims to minimize the difference between the actual process output and the reference or target. The advantage of incorporating the GPR modeling in the MPC design is that, GPR based prediction not only gives the predicted output but also the associated prediction uncertainty. By utilizing the additional information, the tolerance for prediction uncertainty is set as one of the constrains in the MPC design. From practical point of view, the GPR based MPC design provides the opportunity for safe operation or quality control by knowing and setting the tolerance for the prediction uncertainty, which is significantly important in manufacturing process control. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are validated through simulation based studies.	algorithm;control theory;gaussian process;kriging;multistage amplifier;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;sid meier's alpha centauri;simulation;workstation	Min Zhou;Zhao-Qin Guo;Xiang Li	2016	2016 IEEE 21st International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)	10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733737	control engineering;systems modeling;ground-penetrating radar;uncertainty;engineering;machine learning;mathematical model;control theory;gaussian process;predictive modelling;model predictive control;statistics	Robotics	57.436337288847305	-5.200649282323532	148456

The DO dynamics can be represented by a bilinear model for which we are interested in both parameter identification and control. The estimation of key parameters of the process model is important because the values of these parameters cannot be obtained from direct measurement. Hence a least-squares procedure for obtaining unique parameter estimates is developed and then combined with a minimum variance control algorithm to obtain an adaptive controller which is used both to generate useful parameter estimates and to control the process. Extensions to the case where the parameters vary at the same rate as the DO are also discussed.		Kay Yuh-Ju Ko;Bayliss C. McInnis;Graham C.

These gases contributeto the greenhouse effect, and in addition jeopardizes its productive capacity. From the voltage (output) and current(input) signals and based on Systems Identification Theory, the ARX models of the electrolytic smelter pot are built torepresent the steady state operation and the anode effect occurrence. After the simulations based on real anode effectsignal and algebraic properties of the transfer functions some models are validated based on the time response speed ofconvergence. The selected transfer functions of the electrolytic smelter pot are used to perform the steady staterepresentation and are oriented to predict the anode effect by the increasing of voltage. Therefore, this paper showsour latest investigation on parametric ARX models that represent the behavior of the plant in the neighborhood of itsinstability operation point.	arx;genetic algorithm;linear algebra;loss function;polynomial;powerbuilder foundation classes;qualis (capes);simulation;steady state;the pot calling the kettle black;transfer function	Antonio Jose da Silva;João Viana da Fonseca Neto;Nilton Freixo Nagem	2009	2009 11th International Conference on Computer Modelling and Simulation	10.1109/UKSIM.2009.94	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;control theory	Vision	55.84736761718288	-5.084298518834728	148808

By using the internal model principle and the adaptive control technique, a novel distributed adaptive control scheme is developed. Contrary to most existing results, the proposed controller is applicable to multi-agent systems with agents of non-identical relative degrees and non-identical unknown control directions under a general digraph. Moreover, any existing Nussbaum-type functions can be adopted in the proposed control scheme, and the adopted Nussbaum-type functions can be non-identical for each agent. It is shown that global cooperative output regulation of the controlled multi-agent system can be achieved under some mild assumptions. A numerical example is finally presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.	control theory;directed graph;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;numerical analysis	Meichen Guo;Dabo Xu;Lu Liu	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2609281	control engineering;nickel;nonlinear control;adaptive control;engineering;control theory;steady state	Robotics	64.53524192563839	4.150205655254531	149141

The FDI approach is based on the separation of invariant sets that characterise healthy system operation from invariant sets that characterise faulty operation. The derivation of these sets takes into account the closed-loop system reconfigured by means of the virtual actuator under all considered fault situations. We provide analytic conditions, in terms of closed-loop system parameters and bounds on external signals, which guarantee the aforementioned set separation and, thus, closed-loop stability of the scheme under all considered fault situations.	fault detection and isolation;fault tolerance;flexible display interface	María M.

Many real world processes, however, can not be described by one model with one set of parameters, because they have different dynamic and static characteristics under different operating conditions. The paper presents a simple modification of well-known identification and simulation methods so that a single algorithm can itself estimate and simulate different sets of parameters for different operating conditions.

bc449fcba945490dbc978a4f38957125ac68b95e	model free ipid control for glycemia regulation of type-1 diabetes		Objective: The objective is to design a fully automated glycemia controller of Type-1 Diabetes (T1D) in both fasting and postprandial phases on a large number of virtual patients. Methods: A model-free intelligent proportional-integral-derivative (iPID) is used to infuse insulin. The feasibility of iPID is tested in silico on two simulators with and without measurement noise. The first simulator is derived from a long-term linear time-invariant model. The controller is also validated on the UVa/Padova metabolic simulator on 10 adults under 25 runs/subject for noise robustness test. Results: It was shown that without measurement noise, iPID mimicked the normal pancreatic secretion with a relatively fast reaction to meals as compared to a standard PID. With the UVa/Padova simulator, the robustness against CGM noise was tested. A higher percentage of time in target was obtained with iPID as compared to standard PID with reduced time spent in hyperglycemia.  Conclusion: Two different T1D simulators tests showed that iPID detects meals and reacts faster to meal perturbations as compared to a classic PID. The intelligent part turns the controller to be more aggressive immediately after meals without neglecting safety. Further research is suggested to improve the computation of the intelligent part of iPID for such systems under actuator constraints. Any improvement can impact the overall performance of the model-free controller. Significance: The simple structure iPID is a step for PID-like controllers since it combines the classic PID nice properties with new adaptive features.	actuator device component;bearberry;blood glucose;computation;controllers;diabetes mellitus;diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent;hyperglycemia;linear time-invariant theory;meal (occasion for eating);metabolic process, cellular;pid;patients;simulators;time complexity;time-invariant system;type-1 owa operators	Taghreed MohammadRidha;Mourad A&#x00EF;t-Ahmed;Lucy Chaillous;Michel Krempf;Isabelle Guilhem;Jean-Yves Poirier;Claude H.

Parametric uncertainties are considered and the dimension of the state vector is allowed to vary among modes. To deal with the hybrid nature of the system, and the possible discontinuities of its solutions at switching times, a properly amended tracking control problem is defined and a feedback control law based on a discontinuous version of the classical internal model principle is proposed. The innovative design of the discrete-time dynamics of the compensator guarantees the robust existence of a steady-state response giving zero tracking error in the controlled output, and local convergence to it.	electronic switching system;feedback;hybrid system;local convergence;optimal control;parametric oscillator;steady state	Sergio Galeani;Laura Menini;Alessandro Potini	2012	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2011.2162884	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory;feedback;mathematics;hybrid system	Embedded	67.74980747419076	-5.0331781583931345	149555

This requires the discretization of the (linear time-invariant) dynamics and the cost functional leading to discrete-time optimization problems. Although the question of convergence of the sequence of optimal controls, obtained by solving the discretized problems, to the true optimal continuous-time control signal when the discretization parameter (the sampling interval) approaches zero has been addressed in the literature, we provide some new results under less restrictive assumptions for a class of constrained continuous-time linear quadratic (LQ) problems with mixed state-control constraints by exploiting results from mathematical programming extensively. As a byproduct of our analysis, a regularity result regarding the costate trajectory is also presented.	approximation;discretization;letter-quality printer;linear time-invariant theory;mathematical optimization;optimal control;quantum state;sampling (signal processing);time complexity;time-invariant system	Lanshan Han;M.

96b6e845cd29e6782d205033cc36c8891826e307	comparison of modeling-free learning control algorithms for galvanometer scanner's periodic motion		For an accurate and precise periodic scanning motion of a galvanometer scanner, this paper presents iterative learning control (ILC) that is designed and implemented in the frequency domain to compensate for system nonlinearities, such as static friction. For a case that system identification in advance is difficult due to the nonlinearities, the frequency-domain ILC itself incorporates and performs system identification during iterative learning, as modeling-free inversion-based iterative control (IIC). A learning law is derived for a nonlinear system, where the internal system identification is formulated as an estimation problem of a Jacobian matrix that represents the system. In order to find a suitable Jacobian estimation method in the IIC, this paper compares Broyden's method and the linear method, as well as the secant method. To decease the algorithms, the IIC is operated only at the harmonic frequencies of the motion trajectory. In the implementation of the modeling-free IIC, the control input update is explicitly separated from the Jacobian estimation, so that the IIC can still decrease the motion error even when the Jacobian estimation is interrupted for stability. The experimental results demonstrate that the secant method is the best of the three for raster scanning due to its fast learning and high tracking performance.	algorithm;broyden's method;interrupt;iterative method;jacobian matrix and determinant;nonlinear system;raster scan;secant method;system camera;system identification	Shingo Ito;Han Woong Yoo;Georg Schitter	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	10.1109/AIM.2017.8014207	jacobian matrix and determinant;frequency domain;control theory;control engineering;iterative learning control;secant method;nonlinear system;raster scan;algorithm;system identification;harmonic;mathematics	Robotics	67.50419419560028	-9.788157061580314	149841

The original nonlinear systems are converted into polynomial systems with modeling uncertainties. In order to highlight the approximation accuracy, the piecewise polynomial approximation functions are utilized. A novel polynomial state-feedback controller is designed to solve the stabilization problem. Furthermore, switched polynomial state-feedback controllers are designed to improve the performance. The stabilization conditions are presented in terms of sum of squares, which can be numerically solved via SOSTOOLS.

The robust guidance laws are obtained by means of an appropriate subsystem decomposition, providing passivation by feedback and feedforward control. Hence, L/sub 2/ stability of the missile-target closed-loop system is warranted by direct application of the passivity theorem. The resulting terminal guidance laws ensure robust stability of the null miss distance in the case of 1) a maneuvering target whose acceleration lies in L/sub 2/, and 2) bounded parametric uncertainties of second-order models of the missile flight control dynamics.

The proposed techniques apply to continuous, state feedback controllers which are defined in a subset of the state space where the time derivative of a known, candidate Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) can be made negative definite under the input constraints. This set is associated with the domain of this class of controllers and depends on the CLF. The analysis problem concerns approximating the domain and is posed via appropriately formulated set containment relationships through the generalized S-procedure with sum of squares (SOS) constraints. The optimization problem is concerned with the adjustment or enlargement of the domain and constitutes a way of controller synthesis. These objectives are pursued via optimizing over the coefficients of polynomial CLFs, through a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP) problems with SOS constraints. By partitioning the state space based on the structure of the input value set and building upon earlier results on SOS methods, the SDP problems are subject to only convex constraints, rendering thus the proposed techniques computationally viable. The capabilities of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated through numerical examples.	algorithm;coefficient;common look and feel;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;norm (social);numerical analysis;numerical method;optimization problem;parameter (computer programming);polynomial;s-procedure;semidefinite programming;state space	Dimitrios Pylorof;Efstathios Bakolas	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526769	control engineering;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;control theory;mathematics	Robotics	63.359457836992505	-0.8038495639343857	150271

The second adaptive law is suboptimal and includes additionally the estimation of the unknown Lipshitz constant and the unknown norm of exogenous disturbance. The suboptimality is achieved by exploiting a cone estimation algorithm and the linearity of the control criterion with respect to unknown parameters. Both adaptive laws utilize the nonlinear feedback by Xie and Guo based on nonparametric estimation of the uncertainty.	algorithm;first-order predicate;nonlinear system;time-invariant system;x image extension	Victor F.

At the same time, the use of an output integral sliding mode term (also based on the estimation processes) for the Nash strategies robustification for both players ensures the compensation of the matched uncertainties.

In this paper we investigate the problem of fault diagnosis in rigid-link robotic manipulators. A learning architecture, with neural networks as on-line approximators of the oo-nominal system behavior, is used for monitoring the robotic system for faults. The approximation of the oo-nominal behavior provides a model of the fault characteristics which is used for the detection of faults. The stability and performance properties of the proposed fault detection scheme in the presence of system failure are rigorously established. Simulation examples illustrate the ability of the neural network based fault diagnosis methodology described in this paper to detect and accommodate faults in a two-link robotic system. This paper presents an approach for designing nonlinear fault diagnosis algorithms.

This motivates the development of a modeling approach that is tailored for this situation. An identification algorithm is presented here for parameter estimation based on minimizing the simulated prediction error, across multiple signals. The additional complexity of estimating the initial states corresponding to each signal is removed from the estimation algorithm. A numerical simulation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm performs well in comparison to the often-used least squares method (which leads to biased estimates when identifying systems from measurement noise corrupted signals). The approach is applied to the identification of the passive oculomotor plant; parameters are estimated that describe the dynamics of the plant, which represent the time constants of the visco-elastic elements that characterize the plant connective tissue.	arx;computer simulation;connective tissue;estimated;estimation theory;genetic algorithm;least squares;logical connective;population parameter;signal-to-noise ratio;standard sea level;structured-light 3d scanner;system identification	Sean R.

However, the energy-constrained nature of WSNs poses new issues in control design; in particular the discharge of batteries of sensor nodes, which is mainly due to radio communications, must be taken into account. In this paper we present a novel transmission strategy for communication between controller and sensors which is intended to minimize the data exchange over the wireless channel. Moreover, we propose an energy-aware control technique for constrained linear systems based on explicit model predictive control (MPC), providing closed-loop stability in the presence of disturbances. The presented control schemes are compared to traditional MPC techniques. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed energy-aware approach, which achieves a profitable trade-off between energy savings and closed-loop performance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The Riccati equation that arises while developing the nonlinear H∞ observer is compared with the Riccati equation arising from the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Variations between the two Riccati equations translate into the differences in the performance of these alternative estimation methods. The H∞ filter offers faster convergence of the estimation covariance at large estimation errors during the transience of the filter. The Extended Kalman Filter, on the other hand, maintains higher levels of optimality at steady state at the expense of higher computational load. An LMI formulation for the H∞ filter is also presented that allows leveraging the bound on the nonlinearity to seek a stable filter for nonlinear systems.	algebraic riccati equation;control theory;extended kalman filter;instability;jacobian matrix and determinant;linear matrix inequality;nonlinear system;steady state	Amir Valibeygi;I.

This paper studies estimation of the statistics of grid state variables and ambient fluctuations using time-stamped nodal measurements collected from limited PMUs in the grid. We show that in the presence of time-stamped observations that enable computation of delayed covariances, PMUs located at half of the number of grid buses are sufficient to reconstruct all state and noise statistics exactly. For lower number of available PMUs, we provide a convex optimization framework for estimating the covariance matrices that outshines standard schemes that do not utilize the availability of time-stamped measurements.	algorithm;ambient occlusion;computation;computer simulation;convex optimization;mathematical optimization;power management unit;procurement	Deepjyoti Deka;Armin Zare;Andrey Y.

In this paper, an enhanced robust fault diagnosis scheme is presented for the non-Gaussian stochastic distribution system. A B-spline neural network model is established, where a static neural network is applied to model the output PDFs and a non-linear dynamic model is used to describe the relationships between the input and the weight. The composite observer for SDCs is constructed by combining a fault diagnosis observer with a disturbance observer, with which the fault can be diagnosed and the disturbance can be rejected simultaneously. Lastly, an illustrated example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and satisfactory results have been obtained.	rejection sampling	Lina Yao;Ziyang Yin;Hong Wang	2014	IJMIC	10.1504/IJMIC.2014.060732	control engineering;mathematical optimization;probability density function;linear matrix inequality;engineering;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	64.4726807637934	-5.460777543560441	151207

5f755349ac6168f3857471ed5111605a2d21aad6	a new computationally efficient algorithm for optimal sensors and actuators placement for large-scale systems		Sensor and actuator placement is an important step in control of large-scale systems. Decisions in this context, directly affect the control performance. Therefore a suitable actuator and sensor placement is a prerequisite for the success of any control strategies. The methods developed for optimal placement of the sensors and actuators are known to be computationally expensive in particular for large-scale systems. To remedy this, in this paper a new algorithm which is called Restricted Genetic Algorithm (RGA) is introduced. The RGA is a new genetic-based algorithm which is developed specifically for sensors and actuators placement. This innovative framework not only solves the problem of optimal sensors and actuators placement, but also reduces the computational burden significantly. The method is interesting in particular for applications in control of large-scale systems for which the state-of-art placement methods are not efficient. The effectiveness of presented technique is illustrated by numerical examples.	as-interface;algorithmic efficiency;analysis of algorithms;genetic algorithm;numerical analysis;numerical method;sensor	Masoud Seyed Sakha;Hamid Reza Shaker	2017	2017 4th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)	10.1109/CoDIT.2017.8102735	control engineering;mathematical optimization;control theory	Robotics	57.57153453486827	-2.2446027938480775	151317

Given a prescribed rate of convergence for asymptotic stability, we introduce an event-triggered control implementation that opportunistically determines the transmission instants and the finite precision data to be transmitted at each transmission. We show that our design exponentially stabilizes the origin while guaranteeing a positive lower bound on the inter-transmission times, ensuring that the number of bits transmitted at each transmission is upper bounded, and allowing for the possibility of transmitting fewer bits at any given time if more bits than prescribed were transmitted on a previous transmission. In our technical approach, we consider both the case of instantaneous and non-instantaneous transmissions.

459e314292a84c3d24e6fbc444fa28ca887e79ec	formal guarantees in data-driven model identification and control synthesis		For many performance-critical control systems, an accurate (simple) model is not available in practice. Thus, designing controllers with formal performance guarantees is challenging. In this paper, we develop a framework to use input-output data from an unknown system to synthesize controllers from signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. First, by imposing mild assumptions on system continuity, we find a set-valued piecewise affine (PWA) model that contains all the possible behaviors of the concrete system. Next, we introduce a novel method for STL control of PWA systems with additive disturbances. By taking advantage of STL quantitative semantics, we provide lower-bound certificates on the degree of STL satisfaction of the closed-loop concrete system.

The optimal motor control is computed by discretizing the control problem and using nonlinear programming methods. The computed controls are piecewise almost constant and thus can be closely approximated by piecewise constant controls. The optimization of the piecewise constant control values considerably speeds up the optimization process and will be useful in practical applications using real-time control techniques.	approximation algorithm;discretization;dynamical system;experiment;ipopt;map;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;optimal control;real-time clock;state of charge;type system;vii	Angie Burtchen;Helmut Maurer;Sabine Pickenhain	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7799409	control engineering;mathematical optimization;optimal control;engineering;mathematical model;control theory;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	58.47435110898536	-3.5880457260808343	151894

The algorithm is developed for hybrid systems with partitioned state space. It uses a version of the hybrid minimum principle that allows optimal trajectories to pass through intersections of switching manifolds, which enables the algorithm to vary the sequence. Consequently, the combinatorial complexity of former algorithms can be avoided, since not each possible sequence has to be investigated separately anymore. The convergence of the algorithm is proven and a numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of the algorithm.	algorithm;gradient descent;hybrid system;mathematical optimization;numerical analysis;optimal control;pontryagin's maximum principle;state space;trajectory optimization	Benjamin Passenberg;Marion Sobotka;Olaf Stursberg;Martin Buss;Peter E.

The main control objective is disturbance rejection while simultaneously reducing the feedback communication effort compared to a continuous control loop. The event-triggered control loop is shown to be ultimately bounded and, moreover, a bound for the deviation between this control loop and the continuous reference system is derived, which depends on the threshold of the event generator. Hence, by appropriately choosing the event threshold the event-based controller can be made to mimic the continuous control with desired accuracy. The novel control approach is evaluated by its application to a continuous stirred tank reactor.	control system;control theory;event generator;linearizability;nonlinear system;norm (social);reactor (software);rejection sampling;soft-in soft-out decoder	Christian Stöcker;Jan Lunze	2011	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and European Control Conference	10.1109/CDC.2011.6160526	control engineering;input/output;variable structure control;continuous stirred-tank reactor;estimation;real-time computing;sliding mode control;nonlinear system;control reconfiguration;chemical reactor;automatic control;mathematical model;temperature control;control theory;feedback;mathematics;statistics	Robotics	65.52693960858878	-6.726523537126115	152270

In the approach, we do not directly employ the Lyapunov approach, as do in most of traditional fuzzy control design approaches. Instead, sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the robust stability for the considered systems are derived in terms of the matrix spectral norm of the closed-loop fuzzy system. The stability conditions are further formulated into linear matrix inequalities so that the desired controller can be easily obtained by using the Matlab linear matrix inequality (LMI) toolbox. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	assignment problem;block cipher mode of operation;broadcast delay;feedback;fuzzy control system;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;matlab;nonlinear system;simulation;social inequality;the matrix	Song-Shyong Chen;Yuan-Chang Chang;Shun-Feng Su;Sheng-Luen Chung;Tsu-Tian Lee	2005	IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems	10.1109/TFUZZ.2004.839673	robust control;mathematical optimization;discrete time and continuous time;uncertainty;linear matrix inequality;computer science;artificial intelligence;matrix norm;mathematical model;control theory;feedback;mathematics;fuzzy control system	Robotics	66.95662368560286	-0.6022394753656604	152572

Since in real gene networks the current jump mode is not easily accessible, the filter parameters are considered to be independent from the current system mode. By using mode-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovski functionals, appropriate conditions for the stochastic stability and disturbance attenuation of mixed GRN/filter system is derived. Mode independent filter gains are then obtained from some sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities which are easy to solve by numerical methods. In the end, a numerical example and the relevant simulations are presented to evaluate the results.	filter design;gene regulatory network	Mohammad Mohammadian;Amir Hossein Abolmasoumi;Hamid Reza Momeni	2012	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2012.01.027	adaptive filter;gene regulatory network;mathematical optimization;linear matrix inequality;control theory;mathematics	EDA	67.86858423780183	1.478903926715185	152622

To improve the performance of the previous DR technique, the state-matching error is defined and directly minimised by using the state-matching error cost function. Also, the discretisation error of the interconnection term is eliminated through an exact discrete-time design approach. Sufficient conditions of the proposed DR techniques are obtained in the Lyapunov sense and are converted into optimal problems with linear matrix inequalities.

A unified framework is established to solve the addressed H∞ filtering problem by exploiting linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. The proposed control law is based on indirect adaptive fuzzy control and uses two on-line estimations. The adaptive fuzzy tracking control using Variable Structure (VS) control technique is derived based on Lyapunov criterion to resolve system uncertainties and external disturbances. This is done in such a way that all states of the system are bounded and the H∞ tracking performance is achieved. Finally, A numerical example is investigated to demonstrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;control theory;fuzzy control system;linear matrix inequality;lyapunov fractal;mimo;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;online and offline;optimal control;social inequality;unified framework	Chengcheng Li;Guanglin Wang	2016	2016 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)	10.1109/URAI.2016.7734072	mathematical optimization;adaptive control;nonlinear system;computer science;control system;artificial intelligence	Robotics	65.43088648336122	-5.200912962412057	153198

This controller is based on an affine PDC (parallel distributed and compensation) control law and an augmented fuzzy observer to reject disturbances. Stability and stabilization of the closed loop is proved by a Lyapunov approach using a quadratic function. The whole conditions of stabilization can be put in the form of a LMI problem that can be conveniently solved.	rejection sampling	Mohamed Ksontini;François Delmotte;Thierry-Marie Guerra;A.

The purpose is to obtain an explicit formula for the maximum allowable sampling period (MASP) that guarantees exponential synchronization. Two implementation scenarios are considered. We first propose an approach on finding the MASP for periodic time-triggered sampled-data control. Then, a periodic event-triggered communication and control strategy is formulated, where a communication function and a control function are designed for each agent to determine whether or not the sampled data or the control input should be transmitted at each sampling instant. It is shown that there is a tradeoff between the sampling frequency and the convergence performance. The theoretical results are illustrated in simulations.	computation;control theory;multi-agent system;nonlinear system;sampling (signal processing);simulation;time complexity	Pian Yu;Dimos V.

The learning of the FLC is performed by a hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA). First, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is applied to initialize the HGA population, in order to reduce the computational cost and increase the performance of the HGA. The HGA is composed by five hierarchical levels and it is an automatic tool since it does not require any prior knowledge concerning the structure (e.g. the number of rules) and the database (e.g. antecedent and consequent fuzzy sets) of the FLC, and concerning the selection of the adequate input variables and their respective time delays. After the extraction of the FLC by the proposed method, in order to obtain a better control results, if necessary, the learned FLC can be improved manually by using the information transmitted by a human operator, and/or the learned FLC could be easily applied to initialize the required fuzzy knowledge-base of adaptive controllers. In order to improve the results of the learned FLC, a direct adaptive fuzzy controller is applied. Moreover, the proposed method is applied on control of the dissolved oxygen in an activated sludge reactor within a simulated wastewater treatment plant. The results are presented, showing that the proposed method successfully extracted the parameters of the FLC.	cluster analysis;compiler;computation;computational complexity theory;fuzzy clustering;fuzzy cognitive map;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set;genetic algorithm;hercules graphics card;input/output;nonlinear system;reactor (software)	Jérôme Mendes;Rui Araújo;Tiago Matias;Ricardo Seco;Carlos Alberto Belchior	2014	IECON 2014 - 40th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society	10.1109/IECON.2014.7048490	control engineering;defuzzification;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;fuzzy classification;engineering;fuzzy number;neuro-fuzzy;machine learning;control theory;fuzzy associative matrix;fuzzy set operations	Robotics	60.89251146370036	-8.056288534876638	154041

Specifically, we consider allocating limited distributed control resources among a subset of a network's nodes, to minimize the dominant eigenvalue of a linear dynamical spread process associated with the network. Structural characterizations of the closed-loop dynamics at the optimum are obtained. These results are then used to 1) develop constructive algorithms for optimal resource allocation, 2) identify limits on the control performance, and 3) understand the relationship between the network's graph and the optimal resource profile. While the focus here is on a simplified linear model, an exploratory study of the design's applicability to realistic stochastic and nonlinear spread processes is undertaken, via simulation examples. As a whole, this study advances a research thrust on disease spread control in networks, toward the realistic paradigm that control resources can only be allocated at a subset of network locations.	algorithm;distributed control system;dynamical system;linear model;nonlinear system;programming paradigm;simulation;sparse;thrust	Jackeline Abad Torres;Sandip Roy;Yan Wan	2017	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2593895	mathematical optimization;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;resource management;theoretical computer science;process control;control theory;distributed computing;computational model	Theory	62.359572074196805	2.207182958356466	154286
793cc56d704041c009831a5cd33f7ce8f78268cc	observer-based fuzzy adaptive control of nonlinear systems with actuator faults and unmodeled dynamics		In this paper, an adaptive fuzzy output feedback fault-tolerant control scheme is developed for a class of nonlinear systems with actuator faults, unmodeled dynamics and without assuming the states being available for control design. Fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate unknown nonlinear functions, and a fuzzy state observer is established to estimate the unmeasured states. By combining adaptive backstepping technique with changing supplying function technique and the nonlinear fault-tolerant control theory, a novel adaptive fuzzy fault-tolerant output feedback control approach is developed. It is proved that proposed control approach guarantees that all the variables of the closed-loop system are bounded. The simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. Compared with the existing results, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) the proposed control method removes the restrictive assumption that all the states of the controlled system be measured directly; and (2) the proposed control method cannot only compensate for the actuator faults, but also solve the problem of the unmodeled dynamics.	approximation algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;control theory;fault tolerance;feedback;formal system;fuzzy logic;nonlinear system;simulation	Yinyin Xu;Shaocheng Tong;Yongming Li	2013	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-013-1495-7	real-time computing;adaptive control;plant;control theory	Robotics	65.58325160215344	-5.331604892610147	154292

We focus on a class of order preserving systems with a constant input disturbance that is extracted from a known probability distribution. Leveraging the structure of the system, we construct an explicit supervisor that guarantees the system state to be kept outside the undesired set with at least probability P. We apply this supervisor to a collision avoidance problem, where a semi-autonomous vehicle is engaged in preventing a rear-end collision with a preceding human-driven vehicle, while stopping at a stop sign. We apply the designed supervisor in simulations in which the preceding vehicle trajectories are taken from a test data set. Using this data, we demonstrate experimentally that the probability of preventing a rear-end collision while stopping at the stop sign is at least P, as expected from theory. The simulation results further show that this probability is very close to P, indicating that the supervisor is not conservative.	algorithm;autonomous robot;experiment;linear function;overfitting;p (complexity);radar;semiconductor industry;simulation;test data	Mojtaba Forghani;John M.

The sampled-data control is adopted to guarantee the synchronization of the network systems. The proposed sampled-data control strategy can reduce the updating frequency of the controller and the network communication burden. The closed-loop system is equivalently rewritten as the feedback interaction of a linear time-invariant system and a time-delay operator. The small gain theorem is utilized to calculate the upper bound of the sampling intervals. Furthermore, the integral quadratic constraints can provide the passivity-type property of the operator and give less-conservative results. Moreover, in order to further use the information about the sampling pattern and sawtooth structure, the time-delay integral operator is replaced by sample-data integral operator, and less-conservative results are proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed sampled-data distributed control strategy is demonstrated by a numerical example.	control theory;distributed control system;linear time-invariant theory;numerical analysis;sampling (signal processing);sawtooth (cellular automaton);synchronization (computer science);time complexity;time-invariant system	Yuanqing Wu;Hamid Reza Karimi;Renquan Lu	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2018.2808903	control theory;operator (computer programming);decentralised system;small-gain theorem;control theory;control engineering;engineering;sampling (statistics);synchronization;sawtooth wave;upper and lower bounds	Robotics	65.52906564330301	1.728456686337616	155119

In our approach, we separate the nonlinear cost function into two simple cost functions and present a gradient iterative algorithm for estimating directly the time delay and the parameters. The cost function used to estimate the time delay is an integer nonlinear programming problem (IP) and the solution of the integer version of a nonlinear optimization problem is obtained by rounding the solution for its continuous relaxation (CP). Furthermore, we give an appropriate choice of the convergence factor. Finally, the effectiveness of this method has been illustrated through simulation.	algorithm;broadcast delay;gradient;iterative method;linear programming relaxation;loss function;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;rounding;simulation	Saida Bedoui;Majda Ltaief;Kamel Abderrahim	2013	52nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control	10.1109/CDC.2013.6760596	control engineering;mathematical optimization;integer programming;convergence;nonlinear programming;elmore delay;control theory;mathematics	EDA	61.75242538477562	-1.4785220406311397	155223

The novelty of the proposed model is to more effectively include the time-varying nature, and also the inter-patient variability, associated with the glucose-control problem. Importantly, this is achieved in a manner that straightforwardly facilitates well-known and standard controller synthesis procedures. In that way, an average Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model that captures the dynamics from the insulin delivery input to the subcutaneous-glucose concentration output is constructed based on the Universities of Virginia (UVA)/Padova metabolic simulator. In addition, a system-oriented reinterpretation of the classical ad-hoc 1800 rule is applied to adapt the model's gain. In order to quantify the effectiveness of this approach, the ν-gap between this new modeling strategy and the UVA/Padova model is computed at different glucose levels, together with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the glucose deviation predicted by both models. For comparison purposes, both open(RMSE) and closed-loop (ν-gap metric) metrics are also determined for other control-oriented models previously presented. From the results, it could be concluded that the proposed model is more suitable for controller design than the other control-relevant models, due to the fact that it provides a better fit and a smaller distance to the UVA/Padova model in a closed-loop setting. Furthermore, it would allow one to obtain a LPV controller for both postprandial and overnight control in a straightforward way, considering its affine dependence on the glucose level, which is measured in real-time.	heart rate variability;hoc (programming language);mathematical model;mathematical optimization;personalization;real-time clock;simulation;whole earth 'lectronic link	Patricio Colmegna;Ricardo Salvador Sánchez Peña;Ravi Gondhalekar	2016	2016 IEEE Conference on Control Applications (CCA)	10.1109/CCA.2016.7587865	control engineering;engineering;control theory;diabetes mellitus	SE	55.544603761959486	-7.568342152659054	155284
90aee3fef39cd4dc67ca7709efa39ca74fcf18af	sampled-data output feedback control based on a new event-triggered control scheme		In this paper, a new event-triggered control (ETC) scheme is proposed to investigate the observer-based output feedback control problems. To reduce the usage of communication resources, the control input is designed as a specific time-varying signal between two consecutive event-triggering instants, which is different from the general ETC methods. For the continuous-time event detection case, it is shown that the obtained lower bound of the minimum inter-event interval is not smaller than the one using the existing method. In addition, a novel discrete-time event detection scheme and the corresponding ETC policy based on the sampling output is proposed. Employing the stability analysis method for the time-delay system, a sufficient condition on the existence of an observer-based controller is presented. Finally, the simulation results are given to show that the proposed ETC scheme is beneficial to further reduce the frequency of the communication between sensors and the control unit.	algorithm;block cipher mode of operation;broadcast delay;control unit;feedback;sampling (signal processing);scheme;sensor;simulation;zero-order hold	Quan-Yong Fan;Guang-Hong yang	2017	Inf.

A novel non-model-based optimal control design methodology is employed to iteratively update the control policy on-line by using directly the data of the system state and input. Both adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and robust ADP algorithms are developed, along with rigorous stability and convergence analysis. The effectiveness of the obtained methods is illustrated by an example arising from biological sensorimotor control.	algorithm;control theory;dynamic programming;multiplicative noise;online and offline;optimal control;stochastic process;usb on-the-go	Tao Bian;Yu Jiang;Zhong-Ping Jiang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2016.2550518	stochastic programming;control engineering;stochastic process;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;convergence;optimal control;stochastic control;adaptive control;computer science;adaptive system;control theory;mathematics;robustness	Robotics	62.251358988526924	-1.7704404214976501	155447

This paper presents conditions on input signals that characterize their probing richness for strongly consistent parameter estimation of linear systems with binary-valued output observations. Necessary and sufficient conditions on periodic signals are derived for sufficient richness. These conditions are further studied under different system configurations including open-loop and feedback systems, and different scenarios of noises including actuator noise, input measurement noise, and output measurement noise. In addition to system parameter estimation, essential properties of identifiability and input conditions are also derived when sensor thresholds or noise distribution functions are unknown. The findings of this paper provide a foundation to study identification of systems that either use binary-valued or quantized sensors or involve communication channels, which mandate quantization of signals.	binary data;essence;estimation theory;linear system;quantization (signal processing);sensor;system identification	Le Yi Wang;Gang George Yin;Yanlong Zhao;Ji-Feng Zhang	2008	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2008.920222	control engineering;electronic engineering;control theory;feedback;mathematics;linear system	Metrics	64.55469731526986	-0.2802661019729277	155500
