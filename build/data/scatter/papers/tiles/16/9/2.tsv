f755fe8e0a1f5a50bd3b45c8b4ebe5df245c550f	using hippocampal-striatal loops for spatial navigation and goal-directed decision-making		The hippocampus plays a central role in spatial representation, declarative and episodic memory. In this area, so-called place cells possess high spatial selectivity, firing preferentially when the individual is within a small area of the environment. Interestingly, it has been found in rats that these cells can be active also when the animal is outside the location or context of their corresponding place field producing so-called “forward sweeps”. These typically occur at decision points during task execution and seem to be utilized, among other things, for the evaluation of potential alternative paths. Anticipatory firing is also found in the ventral striatum, a brain area that is strongly interconnected with the hippocampus and is known to encode value and reward. In this paper, we describe a biologically based computational model of the hippocampal-ventral striatum circuit that implements a goal-directed mechanism of choice, with the hippocampus primarily involved in the mental simulation of possible navigation paths and the ventral striatum involved in the evaluation of the associated reward expectancies. The model is validated in a navigation task in which a rat is placed in a complex maze with multiple rewarding sites. We show that the rat mentally activates place cells to simulate paths, estimate their value, and make decisions, implementing two essential processes of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms of choice: look-ahead prediction and the evaluation of predicted states.	algorithm;computation;computational model;decision making;declarative programming;encode;machine learning;memory disorders;neostriatum;reinforcement learning;rewards;selectivity (electronic);simulation;spatial navigation;ventral striatum	Fabian Chersi;Giovanni Pezzulo	2012	Cognitive Processing	10.1007/s10339-012-0475-7	psychology;artificial intelligence;communication;social psychology	HCI	14.72272876345998	-73.21637030471591	49143

It allows classification of carotid plaques in high-risk and low-risk lesion types (I-VIII). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2) represents a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, but its specific influence on plaque vulnerability is not fully understood. This study investigates whether MRI-plaque imaging can reveal differences in carotid plaque features of diabetic patients compared to nondiabetics.   METHODS 191 patients with moderate to high-grade carotid artery stenosis were enrolled after written informed consent was obtained. Each patient underwent MRI-plaque imaging using a 1.5-T scanner with phased-array carotid coils. The carotid plaques were classified as lesion types I-VIII according to the MRI-modified AHA criteria. For 36 patients histology data was available.   RESULTS Eleven patients were excluded because of insufficient MR-image quality. DM 2 was diagnosed in 51 patients (28.3%). Concordance between histology and MRI-classification was 91.7% (33/36) and showed a Cohen's kappa value of 0.81 with a 95% CI of 0.98-1.15. MRI-defined high-risk lesion types were overrepresented in diabetic patients (n = 29; 56.8%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed association between DM 2 and MRI-defined high-risk lesion types (OR 2.59; 95% CI [1.15-5.81]), independent of the degree of stenosis.   CONCLUSION DM 2 seems to represent a predictor for the development of vulnerable carotid plaques irrespective of the degree of stenosis and other risk factors. MRI-plaque imaging represents a new tool for risk stratification of diabetic patients.	arterial stenosis;atherosclerosis;carotid stenosis;classification;concordance (publishing);diabetes mellitus;exclusion;image quality;informed consent;kerrison predictor;logistic regression;magnetic resonance imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);patients;phased array;pioneer plaque;risk assessment;scanning systems;senile plaques;stratification;acetohydroxamic acid	Lorena Esposito;T.

However, the relationships between memory consolidation and hippocampal EEG features remain unclear. Here, we assessed the effects of both procedural and declarative learning on qualitative and quantitative measures of sleep by recording stereo-EEG (SEEG) directly from the hippocampus and the neocortex in a group of epileptic patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluations. Following a baseline night, sleep was recorded after administration of a declarative (paired-associate word list learning task) and a procedural (sequential finger tapping) task. Patients were tested before going to bed (test) and after sleep in the following morning (retest). At retest, we found that patients recalled correctly more word pairs compared to the pre-sleep test (declarative task), and they were slightly faster in performing the motor task (procedural task). Standard polysomnography showed an increase in the amount of slow-wave sleep (SWS) only after procedural learning, paralleled by an increase of hippocampal SEEG power in the very low frequency range (VLF, 0.5-1 Hz) during the first NREM sleep cycle. Moreover, procedural performance enhancement and SEEG power increase in the hippocampal VLF were significantly correlated, indicating a link between procedural memory consolidation and slow hippocampal SEEG rhythms. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of synaptic homeostasis occurring during sleep, suggesting that hippocampal slow oscillations are associated with local processes of post-learning synaptic downscaling.	baseline (configuration management);cdisc sdtm respiratory test name terminology;declarative programming;downscaling;electroencephalography phase synchronization;epilepsy;evaluation;frequency band;hertz (hz);homeostasis;lung consolidation;memory disorders;neocortex;patients;polysomnography;procedural programming;semiconductor consolidation;sinewave synthesis;sleep apnea syndromes;synaptic package manager;proteasome storage granule	Fabio Moroni;Lino Nobili;Giuseppe Curcio;Fabrizio De Carli;Daniela Tempesta;Cristina Marzano;Luigi De Gennaro;Roberto Mai;Stefano Francione;Giorgio Lo Russo;Michele Ferrara	2008	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.05.027	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology;procedural memory	ML	16.668896720957985	-78.44135510605373	49249

As always in the empirical sciences, minimal, or parsimonious explanations are sought that make no unnecessary assumptions about the neural mechanisms or memory formats. One such memory format is the so-called homing vectorla vector pointing from the agent's current position back to the starting point of an excursion. The existence of more complex memory structures called cognitive maps is supported by experiments involving multiple places, routes, and goals.The paper introduces Virtual Reality as a method for studying human spatial cognition, describes two sample experiments, and sketches an overall theory of human spatial memory supported by empirical evidence.	cognition;cognitive map;experiment;multiple homing;occam's razor;virtual reality	Hanspeter A.

Nine healthy participants were required to identify each two-dimensional symbol by pushing the corresponding buttons on the keypad. The two orders of report were Order Color/Shape and Order Shape/Color. There was a task cue prior to each presentation of a symbol indicating the particular report order the participants should perform. The cue changed randomly. Results showed that order of report had a significant effect on response time for the first and second dimension. Analysis of behavioral data showed switch cost indicated by increase in response time was greater for Order Shape/Color, a less appropriate order of reporting dimensional values, than Order Color/Shape. It seemed plausible that participants needed more attention resource and showed more N2 inhibition for Order Shape/Color than for Order Color/Shape which fits the Chinese adjective-then-noun language habit.

d4ec77d6ccd0bdf5be2ee7994b4e18077e77aba4	spatiotemporal re-organization of large-scale neural assemblies underlies bimanual coordination		Bimanual coordination engages a distributed network of brain areas, the spatiotemporal organization of which has given rise to intense debates. Do bimanual movements require information processing in the same set of brain areas that are engaged by movements of the individual components (left and right hands)? Or is it necessary that other brain areas are recruited to help in the act of coordination? These two possibilities are often considered as mutually exclusive, with studies yielding support for one or the other depending on techniques and hypotheses. However, as yet there is no account of how the two views may work together dynamically. Using the method of Mode-Level Cognitive Subtraction (MLCS) on high density EEG recorded during unimanual and bimanual movements, we expose spatiotemporal reorganization of large-scale cortical networks during stable inphase and antiphase coordination and transitions between them. During execution of stable bimanual coordination patterns, neural dynamics were dominated by temporal modulation of unimanual networks. At instability and transition, there was evidence for recruitment of additional areas. Our study provides a framework to quantify large-scale network mechanisms underlying complex cognitive tasks often studied with macroscopic neurophysiological recordings.	brain implant;electroencephalography;information processing;instability;modulation;movement	Arpan Banerjee;Emmanuelle Tognoli;J.

Naming response times (RTs) are speeded (facilitation) by associatively-related and phonologically-related words when compared to unrelated words, while they are slowed down by categorically-related words (inhibition), given that distractor onsets occur at appropriate stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs). In the present study with healthy subjects, we for the first time integrated all four auditorily presented distractor types into a single paradigm at an SOA of -200 ms, in order to directly compare behavioral and neural interference effects between them. The behavioral study corroborated results of previous studies and revealed that associatively-related distractors speeded RTs even more than phonologically-related distractors, thereby becoming equally fast as naming without distractors. Distractors were assumed to specifically enhance activation of brain areas corresponding to processing stages as determined in a cognitive model of word production (Indefrey, P., Levelt, W.J.M., 2004. The spatial and temporal signatures of word production components. Cognition 92, 101-144.). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 T revealed activation of left superior temporal gyrus exclusively for phonologically-related distractors, and activation of left or right lingual gyrus exclusively for associatively-related and categorically-related distractors, respectively. Moreover, phonologically-related distractors elicited phonological-phonetic networks, and both semantic distractors evoked areas associated with mental imagery, semantics, and episodic memory retrieval and associations. While processes involved in distractor inhibition (e.g., conflict/competition monitoring) and high articulatory demands were observed for categorically-related distractors, priming of articulatory planning was revealed for associatively-related distractors. We conclude that activations of neural networks as obtained by the fMRI interference paradigm can be predicted from a cognitive model.

a097555148b4b1dccd8bfe24d3aa81cbe1e36753	mimicking human neuronal pathways in silico: an emergent model on the effective connectivity	electronique;theorie de l information;neurosciences;genetique humaine	We present a novel computational model that detects temporal configurations of a given human neuronal pathway and constructs its artificial replication. This poses a great challenge since direct recordings from individual neurons are impossible in the human central nervous system and therefore the underlying neuronal pathway has to be considered as a black box. For tackling this challenge, we used a branch of complex systems modeling called artificial self-organization in which large sets of software entities interacting locally give rise to bottom-up collective behaviors. The result is an emergent model where each software entity represents an integrate-and-fire neuron. We then applied the model to the reflex responses of single motor units obtained from conscious human subjects. Experimental results show that the model recovers functionality of real human neuronal pathways by comparing it to appropriate surrogate data. What makes the model promising is the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first realistic model to self-wire an artificial neuronal network by efficiently combining neuroscience with artificial self-organization. Although there is no evidence yet of the model’s connectivity mapping onto the human connectivity, we anticipate this model will help neuroscientists to learn much more about human neuronal networks, and could also be used for predicting hypotheses to lead future experiments.	artificial neural network;automated planning and scheduling;behavior;biological network;biological neuron model;black box;bottom-up parsing;cns disorder;causal filter;complex systems;computation;computational model;discharger;emergence;entity;experiment;gene regulatory network;generalization (psychology);generic drugs;interaction;large;mathematical optimization;motor neuron disease;motor unit;neural network simulation;neuroscience discipline;reflex action;self-organization;specification;surrogate data;systems modeling	Önder Gürcan;Kemal Sitki Türker;Jean-Pierre Mano;Carole Bernon;Oguz Dikenelli;Pierre Glize	2013	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-013-0467-3	psychology;neuroscience;artificial intelligence;communication	ML	19.428867616411793	-70.37679185682464	49656

Both neuronal groups were modeled as groups of 81 interconnected pacemaker neurons; the bursting cell model described by Butera and others [model 1 in Butera et al. (J Neurophysiol 81:382–397, 1999a)] were used to model the pacemaker neurons. We assumed (1) both pFRG and preBötC networks are rhythm generators, (2) preBötC receives excitatory inputs from pFRG, and pFRG receives inhibitory inputs from preBötC, and (3) persistent Na+ current conductance and synaptic current conductances are randomly distributed within each population. Our model could reproduce 1:1 coupling of bursting rhythms between pFRG and preBötC with the characteristic biphasic firing pattern of pFRG neurons, i.e., firings during pre-inspiratory and post-inspiratory phases. Compatible with experimental results, the model predicted the changes in firing pattern of pFRG neurons from biphasic expiratory to monophasic inspiratory, synchronous with preBötC neurons. Quantal slowing, a phenomena of prolonged respiratory period that jumps non-deterministically to integer multiples of the control period, was observed when the excitability of preBötC network decreased while strengths of synaptic connections between the two groups remained unchanged, suggesting that, in contrast to the earlier suggestions (Mellen et al., Neuron 37:821–826, 2003; Wittmeier et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105(46):18000–18005, 2008), quantal slowing could occur without suppressed or stochastic excitatory synaptic transmission. With a reduced excitability of preBötC network, the breakdown of synchronous bursting of preBötC neurons was predicted by simulation. We suggest that quantal slowing could result from a breakdown of synchronized bursting within the preBötC.	1:1 pixel mapping;artificial cardiac pacemaker;assumed;conductance (graph);disintegration (morphologic abnormality);dual;duane's hypothesis;expiration, function;inspiration function;interaction;neuron;oscillator device component;quantum;randomness;simulation;sodium;synaptic package manager;synaptic transmission;activated t cell autonomous cell death	Amit Lal;Yoshitaka Oku;Swen Hülsmann;Yasumasa Okada;Fumikazu Miwakeichi;Shigeharu Kawai;Yoshiyasu Tamura;Makio Ishiguro	2010		10.1007/s10827-010-0249-0	psychology;computer simulation;neuroscience;simulation;computer science;communication;oscillation;cellular respiration	ML	17.90673696335647	-71.44174496294656	49810

We investigated meditation with fMRI in order to identify and characterise both the “neural switch” mechanism used in the voluntary shift from normal consciousness to meditation and the “threshold regulation mechanism” sustaining the meditative state. Thirty-one individuals with 1.5–25 years experience in meditation were scanned using a blocked on–off design with 45 s alternating epochs during the onset of respectively meditation and normal relaxation. Additionally, 21 subjects were scanned during 14.5 min of sustained meditation. The data were analysed with SPM and ICA. During the onset of meditation, activations were found bilaterally in the putamen and the supplementary motor cortex, while deactivations were found predominately in the right hemisphere, the precuneus, the posterior cingulum and the parieto–temporal area. During sustained meditation, SPM analysis revealed activation in the head of nucleus caudatus. Extensive deactivations were observed in white matter in the right hemisphere, i.e. mainly in the posterior occipito–parieto–temporal area and in the frontal lobes. ICA identified 38 components including known baseline-resting state components, one of which not only overlaps with the activated area revealed in the SPM analysis but extends further into frontal, temporal, parietal and limbic areas, and might presumably constitute a combination of frontoparietal and cinguloopercular task control systems. The identified component processes display varying degrees of correlation. We hypothesise that a proper characterisation of brain processes during meditation will require an operational definition of brain dynamics matching a stable state of mind.	acclimatization;acoustic lobing;adaptation;antibody to islet cells of pancreas measurement;atomic resolution microscopy;baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);bernard greenberg;caudate nucleus structure;causality;cell nucleus;cerebellum;cognition;control system;dynamical system;epilepsy, temporal lobe;fmrib software library (fsl);guru meditation;independent computing architecture;insula of reil;interphase cell;intrinsic drive;lateral thinking;linear programming relaxation;maxima and minima;meditation therapy;memory disorders;mental concentration;mind;motor cortex;observable;onset (audio);operational definition;physical activity;process (computing);rest;resting state fmri;scanning probe microscopes (device);structure of precuneus;structure of putamen;super paper mario;thalamic structure;travis ci;wallace tree;white matter;dinoflagellate cingulum;establishment and maintenance of localization;frontal lobe	Klaus B.

The microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are constituted by a glass support in which a set of tungsten electrodes are inserted. The artificial neural network (ANN) paradigm was used by stimulating the neurons in parallel with digital patterns distributed on eight channels, then by analyzing a parallel multichannel output. In particular, the microelectrodes were connected following two different architectures, one inspired by the Kohonen's SOM, the other by the Hopfield network. The output signals have been analyzed in order to evaluate the possibility of organized reactions by the natural neurons.f The results show that the network of human neurons reacts selectively to the subministered digital signals, i.e., it produces similar output signals referred to identical or similar patterns, and clearly differentiates the outputs coming from different stimulations. Analyses performed with a special artificial neural network called ITSOM show the possibility to codify the neural responses to different patterns, thus to interpret the signals coming from the network of biological neurons, assigning a code to each output. It is straightforward to verify that identical codes are generated by the neural reactions to similar patterns. Further experiments are to be designed that improve the hybrid neural networks' capabilities and to test the possibility of utilizing the organized answers of the neurons in several ways.	architecture as topic;artificial neural network;crispr loci;clinical act of insertion;code;experiment;hopfield network;inspiration function;microelectrodes;multiple endocrine neoplasia;neuron;programming paradigm;stem cells;stimulation (motivation);teuvo kohonen;electrode;tungsten	R.

When stimuli are presented to both the filtered and unfiltered eye (i.e., binocularly), neural responses show little attenuation and no lag compared with their baseline counterpart. This suggests that binocular visual mechanisms must suppress the attenuated and delayed input from the filtered eye; however, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we used a Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) technique to measure neural responses to monocularly and binocularly presented stimuli while observers wore an ND filter in front of their dominant eye. These data were well-described by a binocular summation model, which received the sinusoidal contrast modulation of the stimulus as input. We incorporated the influence of the ND filter with an impulse response function, which adjusted the input magnitude and phase in a biophysically plausible manner. The model captured the increase in attenuation and lag of neural signals for stimuli presented to the filtered eye as a function of filter strength, while also generating the filter phase-invariant responses from binocular presentation for EEG and psychophysical data.

The model was used to investigate two frequently-proposed modes of SAN architecture: the gradient and mosaic hypotheses. In a simplified gradient arrangement, the peripheral SAN region acts as a transition zone between the central SAN and atrium and is required for spontaneous rhythmic initiation of APs from central SAN into the atria. Furthermore, the application of optimized single cell parameters to the realistic 2D rabbit geometry did not accurately replicate experimentally recorded APs. On the other hand, in an adapted mosaic geometry, peripheral SAN cells were not required to produce spontaneous regular excitation.	action potentials;action potential;artificial cardiac pacemaker;excitation;experiment;generic drugs;gradient;heart atrium;ionic;liver acinus zone 2;mosaic - computer software;muscle cells;peripheral;self-replicating machine;sinoatrial node;spontaneous order	Adrian D.

Animal studies suggest a substantial involvement of neurochemical alterations at such basal CNS levels in acute and chronic pain processing. Translating this animal based knowledge to humans is challenging. Human related examining of brainstem functions are challenged by MR related peculiarities as well as applicability aspects of experimentally standardized paradigms. Based on our experience with an MR compatible human orofacial pain model, the aims of the present study were twofold: 1) from a technical perspective, the evaluation of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T regarding measurement accuracy of neurochemical profiles in this small brainstem nuclear complex and 2) the examination of possible neurochemical alterations induced by an experimental orofacial pain model. Data from 13 healthy volunteers aged 19-46 years were analyzed and revealed high quality spectra with significant reductions in total N-acetylaspartate (N-acetylaspartate + N-acetylaspartylglutamate) (-3.7%, p = 0.009) and GABA (-10.88%, p = 0.041) during the pain condition. These results might reflect contributions of N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate in neuronal activity-dependent physiologic processes and/or excitatory neurotransmission, whereas changes in GABA might indicate towards a reduction in tonic GABAergic functioning during nociceptive signaling. Summarized, the present study indicates the applicability of 1H-MRS to obtain neurochemical dynamics within the human trigeminal brainstem sensory nuclear complex. Further developments are needed to pave the way towards bridging important animal based knowledge with human research to understand the neurochemistry of orofacial nociception and pain.	animal model;appendix;basal (phylogenetics);brain stem;bridging (networking);cns;chronic pain;complement system proteins;composition;display resolution;experiment;glutamate carboxypeptidase ii;magnetic resonance spectroscopy;manuscripts;melkersson-rosenthal syndrome;minimal recursion semantics;n-acetylaspartate;nociception;olga (technology);orofacial pain;protons;relay device component;science of neurochemistry;sensory neuroscience;synaptic transmission;gamma-aminobutyric acid;primary somatosensory cortex	Nuno M.

A hypothesis of such assemblies is presented, based on important details of neuronal architecture and physiology in different cortical laminae. Laminae II, III and VI, which are the origin and termination of most cortico-cortical projections, are regarded as the site of storage of most of the information encoded by assemblies – a neuronal ‘library’. Laminae II and III are the most sensitive coincidence detectors, and therefore probably initiate the process of assembly formation. However, these three laminae have very low levels of spontaneous activity in the waking state, and so active cell assemblies cannot base their functioning on these laminae alone. Lamina V pyramidal cells have a much higher level of spontaneous activity. Thus, indirect pathways between ‘library’ cells, via lamina V pyramidal cells, are likely to be more secure than direct ones. It is proposed that direct links between ‘library’ cells become stabilized by Hebbian strengthening, once the recipient ‘library’ cell has been ‘primed’ by neural activity transmitted indirectly via lamina V neurones. Thus lamina V neurones could catalyse the process of assembly formation. Given this proposal, lamina V cells, in their interaction with ‘library’ cells, would code information in terms of precisely timed individual impulses, but would employ a code based on slower frequency changes in their descending influences upon neural centres in the brainstem and spinal cord. Predictions for single unit and electrographic experiments are discussed.	assembly language;assumed;brain stem;catalysis;detectors;experiment;hebbian theory;interaction;internal pyramidal layer of cerebral cortex;neural oscillation;projection defense mechanism;pyramidal cells;spinal cord;spontaneous order;disease transmission;negative regulation of phosphorylation of rna polymerase ii c-terminal domain;physiological aspects	Robert Miller	1996	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s004220050292	neuroscience;engineering;communication	ML	17.281705693046895	-73.82523901054616	50898

Functionally equivalent feedforward networks may be formed by using limited fan-in nodes and additional layers. but this complicates procedures for determining weight magnitudes. No direct mapping of weights exists between fully and limited-interconnect nets. Low-level nonlinearities prevent the formation of internal representations of widely separated spatial features and the use of gradient descent methods to minimize output error is hampered by error magnitude dissipation.

As such, for normal children narrative skills develop well into the school years and, during this period, are particularly vulnerable in the face of brain injury or developmental disorder. For these reasons, we sought to determine the developmental trajectory of narrative processing using longitudinal fMRI scanning. 30 healthy children between the ages of 5 and 18 enrolled at ages 5, 6, or 7, were examined annually for up to 10 years. At each fMRI session, children were presented with a set of five, 30s-long, stories containing 9, 10, or 11 sentences designed to be understood by a 5 year old child. fMRI data analysis was conducted based on a hierarchical linear model (HLM) that was modified to investigate developmental changes while accounting for missing data and controlling for factors such as age, linguistic performance and IQ. Performance testing conducted after each scan indicated well above the chance (p<0.002) comprehension performance. There was a linear increase with increasing age in bilateral superior temporal cortical activation (BAs 21 and 22) linked to narrative processing. Conversely, age-related decreases in cortical activation were observed in bilateral occipital regions, cingulate and cuneus, possibly reflecting changes in the default mode networks. The dynamic changes observed in this longitudinal fMRI study support the increasing role of bilateral BAs 21 and 22 in narrative comprehension, involving non-domain-specific integration in order to achieve final story interpretation. The presence of a continued linear development of this area throughout childhood and teenage years with no apparent plateau, indicates that full maturation of narrative processing skills has not yet occurred and that it may be delayed to early adulthood.	adolescent (age group);bilateral filter;brain injuries;congenital abnormality;default;developmental disabilities;gyrus cinguli;linear model;linguistics;list comprehension;mandibular right first molar;missing data;multilevel model;occipital lobe;temporal lobe;fmri;hierarchical linear modeling;sentence	Jerzy P.

Previous research has shown that human observers are often relatively poor at detecting change, especially when the series are serially dependent (autocorrelated). We present two experiments in which participants were asked to judge the occurrence of changes in time series with varying levels of autocorrelation. Results show that autocorrelation increases the difficulty of discriminating change from no change, and that observers respond to this increased difficulty by biasing their decisions towards change. This results in increased false alarm rates, while leaving hit rates relatively intact. We present a rational (Bayesian) model of change detection and compare it to two heuristic models that ignore autocorrelation in the series. Participants appeared to rely on a simple heuristic, where they first visually match a change function to a series, and then determine whether the putative change exceeds the variability in the data.	autocorrelation;biasing;experiment;heuristic;sensor;spatial variability;time series	Maarten Speekenbrink;Matthew Twyman;Nigel Harvey	2012			interrupted time series analysis;statistics;false alarm;autocorrelation;autoregressive model;change detection;random variable;inference;bayesian probability;mathematics	HCI	12.038058946862563	-74.51888309601058	51067

The programs have been designed for investigating functionally derived gray matter networks and related structural white matter networks. The software comprises the Functional and Tractographic Connectivity Analysis Toolbox (FATCAT), now freely distributed with AFNI. This toolbox supports common file formats and has been designed to integrate as easily as possible with existing standard FMRI pipelines and diffusion software, such as AFNI, FSL, and TrackVis. The programs are efficient, run by commandline for facilitating group processing, and produce several visualizable outputs. Here, we present the programs and their underlying methods, and we also provide a test example of resting-state FMRI analysis combined with tractography. Tractography results are compared with existing methods, showing significantly reduced runtime and generally similar connectivity, but with important differences such as more circumscribed tract regions and more physiologically identifiable paths produced between several region-of-interest pairs. Currently, FATCAT uses only diffusion tensor-based tractography (one direction per voxel), but higher-order models will soon be included.	afni;circumscribe (action);command-line interface;fmrib software library (fsl);gray matter;pipeline (computing);resonance;rest;resting state fmri;tract (literature);voxel;white matter;wolff-parkinson-white syndrome;format	Paul A.

e3bf568363b7c1c6341075a5051d9872c8d29dd2	tracx2: a raam-like autoencoder modeling graded chunking in infant visual-sequence learning		"""Even newborn infants are able to extract structure from a stream of sensory inputs and yet, how this is achieved remains largely a mystery. We present a connectionist autoencoder model, TRACX2, that learns to extract sequence structure by gradually constructing chunks, storing these chunks in a distributed manner across its synaptic weights, and recognizing these chunks when they re-occur in the input stream. Chunks are graded rather than all-or-none in nature. As chunks are learned their component parts become more and more tightly bound together. TRACX2 successfully models the data from four experiments from the infant visual statistical-learning literature, including tasks involving lowsalience embedded chunk items, part-sequences, and illusory items. The model also captures performance differences across ages through the tuning of a single learning rate parameter. These results suggest that infant statistical learning is underpinned by the same domain general learning mechanism that operates in auditory statistical learning and, potentially, in adult artificial grammar learning. Introduction We live in a world in which events evolve over time. Consequently, our senses are bombarded with information that varies sequentially over time. One of the greatest challenges for cognition is to find structure within this stream of experiences. Even newborn infants are able to do this (Teinonen, et al. 2009; Bulf, Johnson & Valenza, 2011), and yet, how this is achieved remains largely a mystery. Two possibilities have been suggested (see Theissen, et al., 2013 for a detailed discussion). The first, characterised as statistical learning, involves using frequency and transition probabilities to construct an internal representation of the regularity boundaries among elements encountered. The second possibility suggests that elements that co-occur are recalled and simply grouped together – or chunked – into single units. Over time, these chunks can themselves be grouped into super-chunks or super-units. According to this view behaviour is determined by the recognition of these chunks stored in memory and associated with particular responses. What distinguishes these accounts 1 This article is an abridged, modified version of Mareschal, D. & French, R. M. (2017) TRACX2: a connectionist autoencoder using graded chunks to model infant visual statistical learning. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 2017 372 20160057; DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2016.0057. is that the former argues that it is the probabilistic structure of the input sequence that is represented and stored, whereas the later argues that specific cooccurring elements are stored, rather than the overarching statistical structure. Ample evidence in support of both of these views has been reported. We will argue that this is a false dichotomy: both transitional probability learning (statistical learning) and chunking co-exist in one system that smoothly transitions between these apparent modes of behaviour. The appearance of two modes of learning is an illusion because only a single mechanism underlies sequential learning; namely, Hebbian-style learning in a partially recurrent distributed neural network. Such a system encodes exemplars (typical of chunking mechanisms) while drawing on co-occurrence statistics (typical of statistical learning models). An important corollary of this approach is that chunks are graded in nature rather than all-or-none. Moreover, interference effects between chunks will follow a similarity gradient typical of other distributed neural network memory systems. Chunks are most frequently thought of as all-ornothing items. Who thinks of """"cups"""" and """"boards"""" when they see the word """"cupboard""""? Or """"foot"""" and """"ball"""" when they encounter the word """"football""""? Indeed, chunks like these have essentially the same status as """"primitive"""" words like """"boat"""" or """"tree"""", which are not made of component sub-words. But new chunks do not suddenly appear ex nihilo in language. Rather, they are generally formed gradually, their component words becoming more and more bound together with time and usage. For example, when we encounter the words """"smartphone"""", """"carwash"""", or """"petshop"""", we still clearly hear the component words. We hear them less in words like """"sunburn"""" and """"heartbeat"""". We hear them hardly at all in """"automobile."""" How long did it take for people to stop hearing """"auto"""" and """"mobile"""" when they heard or read the word """"automobile""""? Like """"automobile"""", it is likely that in a few years the current generation will no longer hear """"smart"""" and """"phone"""" when they hear the word """"smartphone"""". This simple observation involving the graded nature of chunks is at the heart of the chunking mechanism in TRACX2. These ideas were implicit in our initial presentation of the TRACX model (French et al., 2011). In TRACX we showed that a connectionist autoencoder, augmented with conditional recurrence, could extract chunks from a stream of sequentially presented symbols.

3620c8bb18d3aa6181c0a0e4627a6349219210ed	a feedback model of attention explains the diverse effects of attention on neural firing rates and receptive field structure	models neurological;inhibitions;convolution;attention;feedback sensory;neurons;computational biology;visual system;vision;visual cortex;neuronal tuning	Visual attention has many effects on neural responses, producing complex changes in firing rates, as well as modifying the structure and size of receptive fields, both in topological and feature space. Several existing models of attention suggest that these effects arise from selective modulation of neural inputs. However, anatomical and physiological observations suggest that attentional modulation targets higher levels of the visual system (such as V4 or MT) rather than input areas (such as V1). Here we propose a simple mechanism that explains how a top-down attentional modulation, falling on higher visual areas, can produce the observed effects of attention on neural responses. Our model requires only the existence of modulatory feedback connections between areas, and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. Feedback connections redistribute the top-down modulation to lower areas, which in turn alters the inputs of other higher-area cells, including those that did not receive the initial modulation. This produces firing rate modulations and receptive field shifts. Simultaneously, short-range lateral inhibition between neighboring cells produce competitive effects that are automatically scaled to receptive field size in any given area. Our model reproduces the observed attentional effects on response rates (response gain, input gain, biased competition automatically scaled to receptive field size) and receptive field structure (shifts and resizing of receptive fields both spatially and in complex feature space), without modifying model parameters. Our model also makes the novel prediction that attentional effects on response curves should shift from response gain to contrast gain as the spatial focus of attention drifts away from the studied cell.	accidental falls;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;feature vector;gain;hypothalamic area, lateral;lateral computing;lateral thinking;modulation;neural oscillation;top-down and bottom-up design	Thomas Miconi;Rufin van Rullen	2016		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004770	vision;computer vision;neuroscience;attention;visual system;convolution	ML	20.194438624500656	-68.79946651193544	51192

Although nonlinearity has been observed in the sensorimotor system, its nonlinear connectivity has not been widely investigated yet. This study investigates nonlinear connectivity during the human stretch reflex based on neuronal synchronization. Healthy participants generated isotonic wrist flexion while receiving a periodic mechanical perturbation to the wrist. Using a novel cross-frequency phase coupling metric, we estimate directional nonlinear connectivity, including time delay, from the perturbation to brain and to muscle, as well as from brain to muscle. Nonlinear phase coupling is significantly stronger from the perturbation to the muscle than to the brain, with a shorter time delay. The time delay from the perturbation to the muscle is 33 ms, similar to the reported latency of the spinal stretch reflex at the wrist. Source localization of nonlinear phase coupling from the brain to the muscle suggests activity originating from the motor cortex, although its effect on the stretch reflex is weak. As such nonlinear phase coupling between the perturbation and muscle activity is dominated by the spinal reflex loop. This study provides new evidence of nonlinear neuronal synchronization in the stretch reflex at the wrist joint with respect to spinal and transcortical loops.	broadcast delay;cerebral cortex;isotonic regression;muscle;neural oscillation;nonlinear system;population;pressoreceptors;reflex action;reflex, stretch;sensorimotor system;spinal reflex	Yuan Yang;Teodoro Solis-Escalante;Jun Yao;Frans C.

Functional neuroimaging studies, however, tend to provide information in the opposite direction by informing us how manipulation of behavior may affect neural activity. Although this may provide valuable insights into neuronal properties, one cannot use such evidence to make inferences about the behavioral significance of the observed activations; if A causes B, it does not necessarily follow that B causes A. In contrast, brain stimulation techniques enable us to directly modulate brain activity as the source of behavior and thus establish causal links.	brain–computer interface;causality;cognition disorders;cognitive science;deep brain stimulation;electroencephalography;functional gastrointestinal disorders;neuroimaging;neuroscience discipline;reporting	Juha Silvanto;Alvaro Pascual-Leone	2012	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00193	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;functional neuroimaging;cognitive neuroscience;social psychology	ML	18.051435836465533	-76.97767120859804	51768

Here, using the CPM framework, we compared the predictive power of three different measures of FC (Pearson's correlation, accordance, and discordance) and two different prediction algorithms (linear and partial least square [PLS] regression) for attention function. Accordance and discordance are recently proposed FC measures that respectively track in-phase synchronization and out-of-phase anti-correlation (Meskaldji et al., 2015). We defined connectome-based models using task-based or resting-state FC data, and tested the effects of (1) functional connectivity measure and (2) feature-selection/prediction algorithm on individualized attention predictions. Models were internally validated in a training dataset using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, and externally validated with three independent datasets. The training dataset included fMRI data collected while participants performed a sustained attention task and rested (N = 25; Rosenberg et al., 2016a). The validation datasets included: 1) data collected during performance of a stop-signal task and at rest (N = 83, including 19 participants who were administered methylphenidate prior to scanning; Farr et al., 2014a; Rosenberg et al., 2016b), 2) data collected during Attention Network Task performance and rest (N = 41, Rosenberg et al., in press), and 3) resting-state data and ADHD symptom severity from the ADHD-200 Consortium (N = 113; Rosenberg et al., 2016a). Models defined using all combinations of functional connectivity measure (Pearson's correlation, accordance, and discordance) and prediction algorithm (linear and PLS regression) predicted attentional abilities, with correlations between predicted and observed measures of attention as high as 0.9 for internal validation, and 0.6 for external validation (all p's < 0.05). Models trained on task data outperformed models trained on rest data. Pearson's correlation and accordance features generally showed a small numerical advantage over discordance features, while PLS regression models were usually better than linear regression models. Overall, in addition to correlation features combined with linear models (Rosenberg et al., 2016a), it is useful to consider accordance features and PLS regression for CPM.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;behavior;connectome;consortium;counts per minute;cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);feature selection;least-squares analysis;linear iga bullous dermatosis;linear model;methylphenidate;numerical analysis;papillon-lefevre disease;predictive modelling;rest;resting state fmri;rosenberg self-esteem scale;silo (dataset);trait;algorithm;recurrent childhood brain stem glioma	Kwangsun Yoo;Monica D.

The acquisition of spatial information by a neural network is investigated here. Given a spatial layout of several objects, networks are trained on a prediction task. Networks using temporal sequences with no direct spatial information are found to develop internal representations that show distances correlated with distances in the external layout. The influence of spatial information is analyzed by providing direct spatial information to the system during training that is either consistent with the layout or inconsistent with it.

The hippocampus is a complex structure composed of subfields that are functionally-distinct, and anterior-posterior divisions along the length of the hippocampal horizontal axis that may also differ by cognitive correlates. Although each of these aspects has been considered independently, here we evaluate their relative contributions as correlates of age-related improvement in memory. Volumes of hippocampal subfields (subiculum, CA1-2, CA3-dentate gyrus) and anterior-posterior divisions (hippocampal head, body, tail) were manually segmented from high-resolution images in a sample of healthy participants (age 8-25 years). Adults had smaller CA3-dentate gyrus volume as compared to children, which accounted for 67% of the indirect effect of age predicting better associative memory via hippocampal volumes. Whereas hippocampal body volume demonstrated non-linear age differences, larger hippocampal body volume was weakly related to better associative memory only when accounting for the mutual correlation with subfields measured within that region. Thus, typical development of associative memory was largely explained by age-related differences in CA3-dentate gyrus.	apache axis;autoassociative memory;axis vertebra;ca1 field;cognitive map;content-addressable memory;hippocampus (brain);image resolution;large;memory disorders;nonlinear system;small;structure of dentate gyrus;age differences	Ana M.

Through Hebbian based learning these groups can be strengthened to give rise to larger chains of spatiotemporal activity. Compared to other structures such as Synfire chains, they have demonstrated the potential of a much larger capacity for memory or computation within spiking neural networks. Polychronous groups are believed to relate to the input signals under which they emerge. Here we investigate the quantity of groups that emerge from increasing numbers of repeating input patterns, whilst also comparing the differences between two plasticity rules and two network connectivities. We find - perhaps counter-intuitively - that fewer groups are formed as the number of repeating input patterns increases. Furthermore, we find that a tri-phasic learning rule gives rise to fewer groups than the `classical' double decaying exponential STDP plasticity window. It is also found that a scale-free network structure produces a similar quantity, but generally smaller groups than a randomly connected Erdös-Rényi structure.	artificial neural network;computation;emergence;hebbian theory;learning rule;nonlinear system;randomness;spiking neural network;time complexity;triangular function;while	Joseph Chrol-Cannon;André Grüning;Yaochu Jin	2012	The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252828	hebbian theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;leabra;competitive learning;neurophysiology;artificial neural network	ML	18.00706219315951	-69.91095741868116	52195

This mechanism is based on the unique ability of D4 dopamine receptors (D4R) to carry out phospholipid methylation (PLM) that may affect the kinetics of ion channels. We show that by deceasing the inertia of the delayed rectifier potassium channel, a transition to 40 Hz oscillations can be achieved. Decreased potassium channel inertia shortens spike duration and decreases the interspike interval via its influence on the calcium-dependent potassium current. This mechanism leads to a transition to attention-related gamma oscillations in a pyramidal cell-interneuron network. The higher frequency and better synchronization is observed with PLM affecting pyramidal neurons only, and recurrent excitation between pyramidal neurons is important for synchronization. Thus dopamine-stimulated methylation of membrane phospholipids may be an important mechanism for modulating firing activity, while impaired methylation can contribute to disorders of attention.	antiphospholipid syndrome;bayesian tool for methylation analysis;calcium;cellular phone;dopamine receptor;dopaminergic neurons;excitation;gamma correction;interferon type ii;interneurons;ion channel;iontophoresis;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;membrane proteins;modulation;neural oscillation;phospholipids;pyramidal cells;rectifier device component;recurrent neural network;tissue membrane;delayed rectifier potassium channel	Anna Y.

5230c29f4906ffb165a1f31fe8cf380cd5055fd2	quantitative estimates of stimulation-induced perfusion response using two-photon fluorescence microscopy of cortical microvascular networks		Functional hyperemia, or the increase in focal perfusion elicited by neuronal activation, is one of the primary functions of the neurovascular unit and a hallmark of healthy brain functioning. While much is known about the hemodynamics on the millimeter to tenths of millimeter-scale accessible by MRI, there is a paucity of quantitative data on the micrometer-scale changes in perfusion in response to functional stimulation. We present a novel methodology for quantification of perfusion and intravascular flow across the 3D microvascular network in the rat somatosensory cortex using two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PFM). For approximately 96% of responding microvessels in the forelimb representation of the primary somatosensory cortex, brief (~2s) forepaw stimulation resulted in an increase of perfusion 20±4% (mean±sem). The perfusion levels associated with the remaining 4% of the responding microvessels decreased 10±9% upon stimulation. Vessels irrigating regions of lower vascular density were found to exhibit higher flow (p<0.02), supporting the notion that local vascular morphology and hemodynamics reflect the metabolic needs of the surrounding parenchyma. High dispersion (~77%) in perfusion levels suggests high spatial variation in tissue susceptibility to hypoxia. The current methodology enables quantification of absolute perfusion associated with individual vessels of the cortical microvascular bed and its changes in response to functional stimulation and thereby provides an important tool for studying the cellular mechanisms of functional hyperemia, the spatial specificity of perfusion response to functional stimulation, and, broadly, the micrometer-scale relationship between vascular morphology and function in health and disease.	blood vessel;cerebral cortex;deep brain stimulation;estimated;focal (programming language);galaxy morphological classification;hemodynamics;hyperemia;hypoxia;mathematical morphology;metabolic process, cellular;microcirculatory bed;micron;microscopy, fluorescence;microvessels;parenchyma;photons;quantitation;sensitivity and specificity;somatosensory cortex;millimeter	Lakshminarayan V.

We found that when oscillators under the influence of coupling form a cluster of the same time-average frequency, their phases start to correlate. An order parameter, which measures this correlation, starts to grow at this stage until it reaches maximum. This means that a time-average phase locked state is reached between the oscillators inside the cluster of the same time-average frequency. With this strength the cluster attracts individual oscillators or a cluster to join in. We also observe that clustering in averaged frequencies orders the phases of the oscillators. This behavior is found at all the transition points studied.	phase correlation	Hassan F. el-Nashar	2003	I. J.

ebb812bd75a2b7c85abd9e716b6fc421de4d047e	behavioral insights on influence of manual action on object size perception		Visual perception is one of the most advanced function of human brain. The study of different aspects of human perception currently contributes to machine vision applications. Humans estimate the size of objects to grasp them by perceptual mechanisms. However, the motor system is also able to influence the perception system. Here, we found modifications of object size perception after a reaching and a grasping action in different contextual information. This mechanism can be described by the Bayesian model where action provides the likelihood and this latter is integrated with the expected size (prior) derived from the stored object experience (Forward Dynamic Model). Beyond the action-modulation effect, the knowledge of subsequent action type modulates the perceptual responses shaping them according to relevant information required to recognize and interact with objects. Cognitive architectures can be improved on the basis of these processings in order to amplify relevant features of objects and allow to robot/agent an easy interaction with them.

Dermatoglyphic patterns, such as the degree of asymmetry of the fingerprints, have been hypothesized to be indirect measures for early abnormal developmental processes that can lead to later psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. However, previous results have been inconsistent in trying to establish the association between dermatoglyphics and schizophrenia. The goal of this work is to try to resolve this problem by borrowing well-developed techniques from the field of fingerprint matching. Two dermatoglyphic asymmetry measures are proposed that draw on the orientation field of homologous fingers. To test the capability of these measures, fingerprint images were acquired digitally from 40 schizophrenic patients and 51 normal individuals. Based on these images, no statistically significant association between conventional dermatoglyphic asymmetry measures and schizophrenia was found. In contrast, the sample means of the proposed measures consistently identified the patient group as having a higher degree of asymmetry than the control group. These results suggest that the proposed measures are promising for detecting the dermatoglyphic patterns that can differentiate the patient and control groups.	fingerprint;sensor	Jen-Feng Wang;Chen-Liang Lin;Chen-Wen Yen;Yung-Hsien Chang;Teng-Yi Chen;Mark L.

We therefore tested this assumption of linearity by comparing a linear factor analysis technique (principal components analysis) with a nonlinear neural network based method. It is first shown that the nonlinear technique can reliably identify a neuronally plausible nonlinearity in synthetic spike trains. However, when applied to the outputs from primary visual cortical neurons, this method shows no evidence for significant temporal nonlinearities. The implications of this are discussed.	action potential;artificial neural network;artificial neuron;factor analysis;linear function;low-pass filter;neural network simulation;neural oscillation;nonlinear system;principal component analysis;projections and predictions;spike glycoprotein, coronavirus;synthetic intelligence	David Fotheringhame;Roland Baddeley	1997	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s004220050389	psychology;econometrics;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;statistics;principal component analysis	ML	19.926398533231545	-69.80218949336842	53372

Towards this goal, we have incorporated coupling and internal feedback structures in a neuron-level population model from the literature. We study two forms of internal feedback--regulation of excitation, and compensation of excessive excitation with inhibition. We show that normal feedback actions quickly regulate/compensate an abnormally high coupling between the neural populations, whereas a pathology in these feedback actions can lead to abnormal synchronization and """"seizure""""-like high amplitude oscillations. We then develop an external control paradigm, termed feedback decoupling, as a robust synchronization control strategy. The external feedback decoupling controller acts to achieve the operational objective of maintaining normal-level synchronous behavior irrespective of the pathology in the internal feedback mechanisms. Results from such an analysis have an interesting physical interpretation and specific implications for the treatment of diseases such as epilepsy. The proposed remedy is consistent with a variety of recent observations in the human and animal epileptic brain, and with theories from nonlinear systems, adaptive systems, optimization, and neurophysiology."""

During a focal seizure, the abnormal synchronous activity starts in a specific brain region and rapidly propagates to neighboring regions. Intracranial ElectroEncephaloGraphy (IEEG) is the recording of brain activity at a high temporal resolution through electrodes placed within different brain regions. Intracranial electrodes are used to access structures deep within the brain and to reveal brain activity that cannot be observed with scalp EEG recordings. In order to identify the pattern of propagation across brain areas, a connectivity measure named the Adapted Directed Transfer Function (ADTF) has been developed. This measure reveals connections between different regions by exploiting statistical dependencies within multichannel recordings. The ADTF can be derived from the coefficients of a time-variant multivariate autoregressive (TVAR) model fitted to the data. In this paper the applicability to locate the epileptogenic focus by time-variant connectivity analysis of seizure onsets based on the ADTF is shown. Furthermore, different normalizations of the ADTF (the integrated ADTF, the masked ADTF and the full frequency ADTF) are compared to investigate whether one is more suitable to describe the spreading of epileptic activity during an epileptic seizure. We quantified the performance of different connectivity measures during simulations of an epileptic seizure onset. The full frequency ADTF outperforms the integrated ADTF and masked ADTF. Accordingly, we applied this full frequency ADTF to 4 seizure onset and 29 subclinical seizure IEEG recordings of a patient with refractory epilepsy. Hereby, we showed that connectivity patterns derived from IEEG recordings can provide useful information about seizure propagation and may improve the accuracy of the pre-surgical evaluation in patients with refractory epilepsy.	autoregressive model;blinded;coefficient;drug resistant epilepsy;electroencephalography;focal (programming language);name;neural oscillation;onset (audio);patients;resting state fmri;seizures;seizures, focal;sensitivity and specificity;simulation;software propagation;synchronization (computer science);tail value at risk;transfer function;electrode;nervous system disorder	Pieter van Mierlo;Evelien Carrette;Hans Hallez;Kristl Vonck;Dirk Van Roost;Paul Boon;Steven Staelens	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.009	psychology;granger causality;neuroscience;drug resistance;information flow;causality;electroencephalography;electrode;temporal resolution;magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;autoregressive model;multivariate analysis;communication;regression analysis;statistics	ML	21.28510653830746	-77.2788453557418	54111

Many studies of neuroscientific and neural prosthetic importance rely on a smoothed, denoised estimate of a spike train's underlying firing rate. Numerous methods for estimating neural firing rates have been developed in recent years, but to date no systematic comparison has been made between them. In this study, we review both classic and current firing rate estimation techniques. We compare the advantages and drawbacks of these methods. Then, in an effort to understand their relevance to the field of neural prostheses, we also apply these estimators to experimentally gathered neural data from a prosthetic arm-reaching paradigm. Using these estimates of firing rate, we apply standard prosthetic decoding algorithms to compare the performance of the different firing rate estimators, and, perhaps surprisingly, we find minimal differences. This study serves as a review of available spike train smoothers and a first quantitative comparison of their performance for brain-machine interfaces.	action potential;algorithm;brain–computer interface;estimated;experiment;neural oscillation;neuroprosthetics;programming paradigm;prosthesis;relevance;selaginella;smoothing (statistical technique);spike glycoprotein, coronavirus	John P.

There is, however, no general agreement on the computational role of this interaction. Here, we derive a learning rule for the release probability and the maximal synaptic conductance in a circuit model with combined recurrent and feedforward connections that allows learning to discriminate among natural inputs. Short-term synaptic plasticity thereby provides a nonlinear expansion of the input space of a linear classifier, whereas the random recurrent network serves to decorrelate the expanded input space. Computer simulations reveal that the twofold increase in the number of input dimensions through short-term synaptic plasticity improves the performance of a standard perceptron up to 100. The distributions of release probabilities and maximal synaptic conductances at the capacity limit strongly depend on the balance between excitation and inhibition. The model also suggests a new computational interpretation of spikes evoked by stimuli outside the classical receptive field. These neuronal activities may reflect decorrelation of the expanded stimulus space by intracortical synaptic connections.	conductance (graph);decorrelation;dimensions;dynamical system;excitation;feedforward neural network;learning rule;linear classifier;maximal set;modulation;neuronal plasticity;nonlinear system;perceptron;probability;recurrent neural network;synapse;synaptic package manager;synaptic transmission	Christian Leibold;Michael H.

Here we show that data mining techniques applied to a large database of neuroimaging results can be used to identify the conceptual structure of mental functions and their mapping to brain systems. This analysis confirms many current ideas regarding the neural organization of cognition, but also provides some new insights into the roles of particular brain systems in mental function. We further show that the same methods can be used to identify the relations between mental disorders. Finally, we show that these two approaches can be combined to empirically identify novel relations between mental disorders and mental functions via their common involvement of particular brain networks. This approach has the potential to discover novel endophenotypes for neuropsychiatric disorders and to better characterize the structure of these disorders and the relations between them.	cognition;data mining;mental association;mental disorders;neuroimaging;nervous system disorder	Russell A.

A principled framework for addressing this can be found in information theory. With this approach, one can determine whether a proposed code can account for the stimulus-response relationship. Specifically, one can compare the transmitted information between the stimulus and the hypothesized neural code with the transmitted information between the stimulus and the behavioral response. If the former is smaller than the latter (i.e., if the code cannot account for the behavior), the code can be ruled out.The information-theoretic index most widely used in this context is Shannon's mutual information. The Shannon test, however, is not ideal for this purpose: while the codes it will rule out are truly nonviable, there will be some nonviable codes that it will fail to rule out. Here we describe a wide range of alternative indices that can be used for ruling codes out. The range includes a continuum from Shannon information to measures of the performance of a Bayesian decoder.

It is well known as a mood regulating system, although it also contributes to many other functions. With resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) it is possible to investigate whole brain functional connectivity. We used this non-invasive neuroimaging technique to measure acute pharmacological effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline (75 mg) in 12 healthy volunteers. In this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, RS-fMRI scans were repeatedly acquired during both visits (at baseline and 3, 5, 7 and 9h after administering sertraline or placebo). Within-group comparisons of voxelwise functional connectivity with ten functional networks were examined (p<0.005, corrected) using a mixed effects model with cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, motion parameters, heart rate and respiration as covariates. Sertraline induced widespread effects on functional connectivity with multiple networks; the default mode network, the executive control network, visual networks, the sensorimotor network and the auditory network. A common factor among these networks was the involvement of the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex. Cognitive and subjective measures were taken as well, but yielded no significant treatment effects, emphasizing the sensitivity of RS-fMRI to pharmacological challenges. The results are consistent with the existence of an extensive serotonergic system relating to multiple brain functions with a possible key role for the precuneus and cingulate.	administration procedure;basal ganglia diseases;baseline (configuration management);cns disorder;cerebrospinal fluid;cingulate cortex;default;depressive disorder;double-blind method;interphase cell;machine perception;magnetic resonance imaging;nervous system structure;neuroimaging;pharmacology;physical activity;power (psychology);randomized algorithm;rest;resting state fmri;serotonin uptake inhibitors;sertraline;structure of precuneus;white matter	Bernadet L.

This affords the option to couple various cortical and subcortical nodes that differ in their form and dynamics. Moreover, it enables users to implement new neural mass models in a straightforward and standardized way. This generic framework hence supports flexibility and facilitates the exploration of increasingly plausible models. We illustrate this by coupling a basal ganglia-thalamus model to a (previously validated) cortical model developed specifically for motor cortex. The ensuing DCM is used to infer pathways that contribute to the suppression of beta oscillations induced by dopaminergic medication in patients with Parkinson's disease. Experimental recordings were obtained from deep brain stimulation electrodes (implanted in the subthalamic nucleus) and simultaneous magnetoencephalography. In line with previous studies, our results indicate a reduction of synaptic efficacy within the circuit between the subthalamic nucleus and external pallidum, as well as reduced efficacy in connections of the hyperdirect and indirect pathway leading to this circuit. This work forms the foundation for a range of modelling studies of the synaptic mechanisms (and pathophysiology) underlying event-related potentials and cross-spectral densities.	3',5'-dichloromethotrexate;basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;causal filter;cell nucleus;cerebral cortex;dicom;deep brain stimulation;dopamine hydrochloride;gene regulatory network;generic drugs;globus pallidus;implants;inference;magnetoencephalography;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;structure of subthalamic nucleus;synaptic package manager;thalamic structure;zero suppression;density;electrode	Bernadette C.

82b3d586b84274cbc1238c3738f6171ee19e9656	network receptive field modeling reveals extensive integration and multi-feature selectivity in auditory cortical neurons		Cortical sensory neurons are commonly characterized using the receptive field, the linear dependence of their response on the stimulus. In primary auditory cortex neurons can be characterized by their spectrotemporal receptive fields, the spectral and temporal features of a sound that linearly drive a neuron. However, receptive fields do not capture the fact that the response of a cortical neuron results from the complex nonlinear network in which it is embedded. By fitting a nonlinear feedforward network model (a network receptive field) to cortical responses to natural sounds, we reveal that primary auditory cortical neurons are sensitive over a substantially larger spectrotemporal domain than is seen in their standard spectrotemporal receptive fields. Furthermore, the network receptive field, a parsimonious network consisting of 1-7 sub-receptive fields that interact nonlinearly, consistently better predicts neural responses to auditory stimuli than the standard receptive fields. The network receptive field reveals separate excitatory and inhibitory sub-fields with different nonlinear properties, and interaction of the sub-fields gives rise to important operations such as gain control and conjunctive feature detection. The conjunctive effects, where neurons respond only if several specific features are present together, enable increased selectivity for particular complex spectrotemporal structures, and may constitute an important stage in sound recognition. In conclusion, we demonstrate that fitting auditory cortical neural responses with feedforward network models expands on simple linear receptive field models in a manner that yields substantially improved predictive power and reveals key nonlinear aspects of cortical processing, while remaining easy to interpret in a physiological context.	afferent neuron;auditory processing disorder;cerebral cortex;embedded system;embedding;feature detection (computer vision);feature detection (web development);feedforward neural network;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;large;network model;neurons;nonlinear system;occam's razor;selectivity (electronic);ugt1a7 wt allele	Nicol S.

Mossy fiber synapses appear to duplicate, in terms of the information they convey, what CA3 cells already receive from entorhinal cortex layer II cells, which project both to the dentate gyrus and to CA3. Computational models of episodic memory have hypothesized that the function of the mossy fibers is to enforce a new, well-separated pattern of activity onto CA3 cells, to represent a new memory, prevailing over the interference produced by the traces of older memories already stored on CA3 recurrent collateral connections. Can this hypothesis apply also to spatial representations, as described by recent neurophysiological recordings in rats? To address this issue quantitatively, we estimate the amount of information DG can impart on a new CA3 pattern of spatial activity, using both mathematical analysis and computer simulations of a simplified model. We confirm that, also in the spatial case, the observed sparse connectivity and level of activity are most appropriate for driving memory storage-and not to initiate retrieval. Surprisingly, the model also indicates that even when DG codes just for space, much of the information it passes on to CA3 acquires a non-spatial and episodic character, akin to that of a random number generator. It is suggested that further hippocampal processing is required to make full spatial use of DG inputs.	ca3 field;code;computation;computational model;computer simulation;discontinuous galerkin method;information;interference (communication);mammals;mathematics;memory, episodic;parahippocampal gyrus;projection defense mechanism;pyramidal cells;random number generation;sparse matrix;structure of dentate gyrus;structure of entorhinal cortex;synapses;tissue fiber;tracing (software);decigram;mossy fiber	Erika Cerasti;Alessandro Treves	2010		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000759	computer simulation;neuroplasticity;neuroscience;episodic memory;memory	ML	18.615282751502207	-74.45796123486642	55242
d498ccdd9239f1b966146cba30fd9bc61c682d6d	the functional sense of central oscillations in walking	oscillations;sensory feedback;side effect;central pattern generator	 Rhythmic motor output is generally assumed to be produced by central pattern generators or, more specific, central oscillators, the rhythmic output of which can be entrained and modulated by sensory input and descending control. In the case of locomotor systems, the output of the central system, i.e., the output obtained after deafferentation of sensory feedback, shows many of the temporal characteristics of real movements. Therefore the term fictive locomotion has been coined. This article concentrates on a specific locomotor behavior, namely walking; in particular walking in invertebrates. In contrast to the traditional view, an alternative hypothesis is formulated to interpret the functional sense of these central oscillations which have been found in many cases. It is argued that the basic function of the underlying circuit is to avoid cocontraction of antagonistic muscles. Such a system operates best with an inherent period just above the maximum period observed in real walking. The circuit discussed in this article (Fig. 2) shows several properties in common with results described as “fictive walking”. It furthermore could explain a number of properties observed in animals walking in different situations. According to this hypothesis, the oscillations found after deafferentation are side effects occurring in specific artificial situations. If, however, a parameter called central excitation is large enough, the system can act as a central oscillator that overrides the sensory input completely.	assumed;central pattern generators;central pattern generator;chris sawyer's locomotion;deafferentation procedure;electronic oscillator;excitation;invertebrates;method overriding;modulation;movement;muscle;oscillator device component;population parameter;rem sleep behavior disorder;sensory feedback	Holk Cruse	2002	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-001-0301-2	psychology;control engineering;central pattern generator;computer science;control theory;communication;oscillation;side effect	ML	16.10095922972945	-72.33664904961721	55319

To shed light on the brain representation of a multifaceted pain experience in humans, we combined multivariate analysis of subjective aspects of pain sensations with detailed, single-trial analysis of electrophysiological brain responses. Participants were asked to fully focus on any painful or non-painful sensations occurring in their left hand during an interval surrounding the onset of noxious laser heat stimuli, and to rate their sensations using a set of visual analogue scales. Statistical parametric mapping was used to compute a multivariate regression analysis of subjective responses and single-trial laser evoked potentials (LEPs) at subject and group levels. Standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography method was used to reconstruct sources of LEPs. Factor analysis of subjective responses yielded five factors. Factor 1, representing pain, mapped firstly as a negative potential at the vertex and a positive potential at the fronto-temporal region during the 208-260ms interval, and secondly as a strong negative potential in the right lateral frontal and prefrontal scalp regions during the 1292-1340ms interval. Three other factors, labelled """"anticipated pain"""", """"stimulus onset time"""", and """"body sensations"""", represented non-specific aspects of the pain experience, and explained portions of LEPs in the latency range from 200ms to 700ms. The subjective space of pain during noxious laser stimulation is represented by one large factor featuring pain intensity, and by other factors accounting for non-specific parts of the sensory experience. Pain is encoded in two separate latency components with different scalp and brain representations."""	acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;dysmenorrhea;enigma machine;esthesia;factor analysis;general linear model;laser-evoked potentials;lateral thinking;mechatronics;neuroscience discipline;onset (audio);pain perception;temporal lobe;vertex;visual analog pain scale;tomography	Andrej Stancak;Stephanie Cook;Hazel Wright;Nicholas Fallon	2016	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.10.028	psychology;neuroscience;social psychology;surgery	HCI	17.996622179494928	-78.29527246439497	55399

Two such control-based technologies are reviewed here. First, voltage-clamp methods revolutionized the study of excitable cells. In this family of techniques, membrane potential is controlled, allowing one to parameterize a powerful class of models that describe the voltage-current relationship of cell membranes simply, flexibly, and accurately. Second, dynamic-clamp methods allow the addition of new, “virtual” membrane mechanisms to living cells. Dynamic clamp allows researchers unprecedented ways of testing computationally based hypotheses in biological preparations.

17c0ade62888dcb063b8afd0af111cd1ca814bcf	abnormal cortical processing of pattern motion in amblyopia: evidence from fmri	amblyopia;plaid;motion;dorsal stream;mt	Converging evidence from human psychophysics and animal neurophysiology indicates that amblyopia is associated with abnormal function of area MT, a motion sensitive region of the extrastriate visual cortex. In this context, the recent finding that amblyopic eyes mediate normal perception of dynamic plaid stimuli was surprising, as neural processing and perception of plaids has been closely linked to MT function. One intriguing potential explanation for this discrepancy is that the amblyopic eye recruits alternative visual brain areas to support plaid perception. This is the hypothesis that we tested. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the response of the amblyopic visual cortex and thalamus to incoherent and coherent motion of plaid stimuli that were perceived normally by the amblyopic eye. We found a different pattern of responses within the visual cortex when plaids were viewed by amblyopic as opposed to non-amblyopic eyes. The non-amblyopic eyes of amblyopes and control eyes differentially activated the hMT+ complex when viewing incoherent vs. coherent plaid motion, consistent with the notion that this region is centrally involved in plaid perception. However, for amblyopic eye viewing, hMT+ activation did not vary reliably with motion type. In a sub-set of our participants with amblyopia we were able to localize MT and MST within the larger hMT+ complex and found a lack of plaid motion selectivity in both sub-regions. The response of the pulvinar and ventral V3 to plaid stimuli also differed under amblyopic vs. non-amblyopic eye viewing conditions, however the response of these areas did vary according to motion type. These results indicate that while the perception of the plaid stimuli was constant for both amblyopic and non-amblyopic viewing, the network of neural areas that supported this perception was different.	amblyopia;cerebral cortex;coherence (physics);convergence (action);discrepancy function;eye;familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome 3;large;magnetic resonance imaging;psychophysics;pulvinar structure;science of neurophysiology;selectivity (electronic);thalamic structure;visual cortex;fmri	B.

The algorithm is shown to have desirable stability properties; further, the algorithm can be parameterized to control the synaptic energy use by a neuron and to control the net information received by a neuron. In addition to the fundamental mathematics on which the algorithm is based, the interaction of parameter settings with characterized random inputs are described. Finally, specific extensions of the algorithm are suggested.	algorithm;feedforward neural network;neuron;stochastic process;synapse	William B. Levy;Harang Ju;Robert A. Baxter;Costa M.

Appearance of an object changes from 'Yellow' to 'Gold' with an increase in the specular reflectance, and understanding how we discriminate 'Gold' from 'Yellow' is tightly related to an important problem of how we perceive surface reflectance or gloss of objects. To understand neural processes underlying gloss perception, we conducted a series of experiments. When we compared neural activities evoked by objects with specular and matte surfaces using functional magnetic resonance imaging in monkeys, stronger activities to specular surface were observed in areas along the ventral pathway of the visual cortex including the inferior temporal (IT) cortex that plays an essential role in object discrimination. We also recorded single neuron activities from the IT cortex and found that there exist neurons that are selectively responding to specific gloss, and that as a population, these neurons systematically represented a variety of glosses. We speculate that visual features distinguishing surface glosses are detected in early visual areas and this information is integrated along the ventral visual pathway to form neural representation of a variety of glosses of object images in the IT cortex. Neural mechanisms underlying discrimination between 'Gold' and 'Yellow' should at least in part lie in this process.	gloss (annotation)	Hidehiko Komatsu;Akiko Nishio;Gouki Okazawa;Naokazu Goda	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-36700-7_1	gold;computer vision;gloss;optics	NLP	17.46488701854915	-74.80019801119839	56045

However, hippocampal involvement reported in some neuroimaging studies using """"classical"""" WM tasks may at least partly reflect incidental LTM encoding. To disentangle WM processing and LTM formation we administered a delayed-match-to-sample associative WM task in an event-related fMRI study design. Each trial of the WM task consisted of four pairs of faces and houses, which had to be maintained during a delay of 10 s. This was followed by a probe phase consisting of three consecutively presented pairs; for each pair participants were to indicate whether it matched one of the pairs of the encoding phase. After scanning, an unexpected recognition-memory (LTM) task was administered. Brain activity during encoding was analyzed based on WM and LTM performance. Hence, encoding-related activity predicting WM success in the absence of successful LTM formation could be isolated. Furthermore, regions critical for successful LTM formation for pairs previously correctly processed in WM were analyzed. Results showed that the left parahippocampal gyrus including the fusiform gyrus predicted subsequent accuracy on WM decisions. The right anterior hippocampus and left inferior frontal gyrus, in contrast, predicted successful LTM for pairs that were previously correctly classified in the WM task. Our results suggest that brain regions associated with higher-level visuo-perceptual processing are involved in successful associative WM encoding, whereas the anterior hippocampus and left inferior frontal gyrus are involved in successful LTM formation during incidental encoding."""	acoustic lobing;classification;consciousness;electroencephalography;face;frontal lobe gyrus;inferior frontal gyrus;lateral occipitotemporal gyrus;long-term synaptic depression;medial graph;memory disorders;memory, long-term;memory, short-term;neuroimaging;parahippocampal gyrus;temporal lobe;fmri	Heiko C.

09377cafd88badbaa51136d2dd3888dae6083307	modeling the adenosine system as a modulator of cognitive performance and sleep patterns during sleep restriction and recovery		Sleep loss causes profound cognitive impairments and increases the concentrations of adenosine and adenosine A1 receptors in specific regions of the brain. Time courses for performance impairment and recovery differ between acute and chronic sleep loss, but the physiological basis for these time courses is unknown. Adenosine has been implicated in pathways that generate sleepiness and cognitive impairments, but existing mathematical models of sleep and cognitive performance do not explicitly include adenosine. Here, we developed a novel receptor-ligand model of the adenosine system to test the hypothesis that changes in both adenosine and A1 receptor concentrations can capture changes in cognitive performance during acute sleep deprivation (one prolonged wake episode), chronic sleep restriction (multiple nights with insufficient sleep), and subsequent recovery. Parameter values were estimated using biochemical data and reaction time performance on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT). The model closely fit group-average PVT data during acute sleep deprivation, chronic sleep restriction, and recovery. We tested the model's ability to reproduce timing and duration of sleep in a separate experiment where individuals were permitted to sleep for up to 14 hours per day for 28 days. The model accurately reproduced these data, and also correctly predicted the possible emergence of a split sleep pattern (two distinct sleep episodes) under these experimental conditions. Our findings provide a physiologically plausible explanation for observed changes in cognitive performance and sleep during sleep loss and recovery, as well as a new approach for predicting sleep and cognitive performance under planned schedules.	adenosine a1 receptor;cognition disorders;emergence;impaired cognition;ligands;mathematical model;mathematics;modulation;modulator device component;population parameter;schedule (computer science);schedule (document type);sleep apnea syndromes;somnolence;per hour	Andrew J.

In planning of radiotherapy it has already a long tradition currently moving into new areas. In image guided surgery and intervention it is clearly moving forward. In other fields like e. g. cardiology it is still in an infant stage. The aim is to create mathematical models of the patient , including the individual geometry of the patient and his/her physiology and pathophysiology. So in addition to geometrical information that can be gained from imaging modalities like CT, MRI or Ultrasound (often called """" morphology """") we include functional and biochemical information. Here are some examples of functional and biochemical information of a patient, that can be integrated with his/her individual morphology: • Elastomechanics of bone and soft tissue, • Contraction of muscle and tension development in skeletal muscle and in the heart, • spread of electrophysiological depolarization in neu-rons, peripheral nerves and in heart tissue, • flow in blood vessels or in the heart, • hemodynamics and blood pressure control, • renal excretion and clearance of the kidney, • gas exchange in the lung, • metabolism in tumors and tumor growth. We, working in this field, see many applications of modelling and simulation that clearly can support the medical doctor and improve health care: • Improved prediction of how a disease will propagate: we can move from a judgement that is based on empirical statistics to solid knowledge about the individual patient and his/her specific problem. • Therapy planning will move from statistics based decision making like """" what was best for 80% of all patients """" , to individual quantitative optimization of clinical output. • Better optimization of medical technology will become possible, both during research and development of a medical system and during adaptation of a medical device to the individual patient. • Medical research on etiology, that is to find the first and original reason of a disease, can profit significantly, because research can move from observing symptoms to understanding pathophysiological processes. Modelling and simulation in medicine is an emerging field especially in the last decade, because only at that time the huge amount of experimental data, that is a prerequisite for any type of mathematical modelling in natural science, was available – even though it has to be admitted , that very often we just see the tip of the iceberg.

It has been suggested that the brain engages in Bayesian inference during perception but how such probabilistic representations are used to select actions has remained unclear. Here we propose a neural model of action selection and decision making based on the theory of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Actions are selected based not on a single """"optimal"""" estimate of state but on the posterior distribution over states (the """"belief"""" state). We show how such a model provides a unified framework for explaining experimental results in decision making that involve both information gathering and overt actions. The model utilizes temporal difference (TD) learning for maximizing expected reward. The resulting neural architecture posits an active role for the neocortex in belief computation while ascribing a role to the basal ganglia in belief representation, value computation, and action selection. When applied to the random dots motion discrimination task, model neurons representing belief exhibit responses similar to those of LIP neurons in primate neocortex. The appropriate threshold for switching from information gathering to overt actions emerges naturally during reward maximization. Additionally, the time course of reward prediction error in the model shares similarities with dopaminergic responses in the basal ganglia during the random dots task. For tasks with a deadline, the model learns a decision making strategy that changes with elapsed time, predicting a collapsing decision threshold consistent with some experimental studies. The model provides a new framework for understanding neural decision making and suggests an important role for interactions between the neocortex and the basal ganglia in learning the mapping between probabilistic sensory representations and actions that maximize rewards."""	action selection;basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;bayesian approaches to brain function;computation (action);decision making;dopamine hydrochloride;epilepsy, temporal lobe;expectation–maximization algorithm;inference;interaction;markov chain;neocortex;partial;partially observable markov decision process;primates;rewards;temporal difference learning;unified framework	Rajesh P.

The model cortex has distributions of spatial frequency selectivity and of preference that resemble experimental findings from the real V1.

But where individuals differ from one another is most certainly in terms of the different strategies that are adopted during this process. A previous study revealed differential brain activation patterns for the implementation of well established higher-order stimulus-response (S-R) rules depending on inter-individual strategy differences (Wolfensteller and von Cramon, 2010). This raises the question of how these strategies evolve or which neurocognitive mechanisms underlie these inter-individual strategy differences. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study revealed striking strategy-effects across regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex during the implementation of higher-order S-R rules at an early stage of learning. The left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex displayed a quantitative strategy-effect, such that activation during rule integration based on a mismatch was related to the degree to which participants continued to rely on rule integration. A quantitative strategy ceiling effect was observed for the left inferior frontal junction area. Conversely, the right inferior frontal gyrus displayed a qualitative strategy-effect such that participants who at a later point relied on an item-based strategy showed stronger activations in this region compared to those who continued with the rule integration strategy. Together, the present findings suggest that a certain amount of rule integration is mandatory when participants start to learn higher-order rules. The more efficient item-based strategy that evolves later appears to initially require the recruitment of additional cognitive resources in order to shield the currently relevant S-R association from interfering information.	entity name part qualifier - adopted;frontal lobe gyrus;ifng wt allele;inferior frontal gyrus;lateral thinking;limited stage (cancer stage);magnetic resonance imaging;mandatory - hl7definedroseproperty;mental association;prefrontal cortex;rule (guideline);shield device component;fmri;neurocognitive	Uta Wolfensteller;D.

If the interaction between individuals is based on rhythmic movements, synchronized and coordinated movements will emerge from the social synchrony. This paper proposes a plausible model of plastic neural controllers that allows the emergence of synchronized movements in physical and rhythmical interactions. The controller is designed with central pattern generators (CPG) based on rhythmic Rowat-Selverston neurons endowed with neuronal and synaptic Hebbian plasticity. To demonstrate the interest of the proposed model, the case of handshaking is considered because it is a very common, both physically and socially, but also, a very complex act in the point of view of robotics, neuroscience and psychology. Plastic CPGs controllers are implemented in the joints of a simulated robotic arm that has to learn the frequency and amplitude of an external force applied to its effector, thus reproducing the act of handshaking with a human. Results show that the neural and synaptic Hebbian plasticity are working together leading to a natural and autonomous synchronization between the arm and the external force even if the frequency is changing during the movement. Moreover, a power consumption analysis shows that, by offering emergence of synchronized and coordinated movements, the plasticity mechanisms lead to a significant decrease in the energy spend by the robot actuators thus generating a more adaptive and natural human/robot handshake.	articular system;autonomous robot;central pattern generators;central pattern generator;controllers;emergence;handshaking;hebbian theory;interaction;movement;neuroscience discipline;point of view (computer hardware company);robotic arm;robotics;synaptic package manager;unconscious personality factor;virtual synchrony	Melanie Jouaiti;Lancelot Caron;Patrick Henaff	2018		10.3389/fnbot.2018.00029	artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;computer science;synchronization;handshaking;hebbian theory;central pattern generator;control engineering;robotic arm;adaptive behavior;human–robot interaction	Robotics	15.739886775849678	-71.48434623311621	57468

The principle can be regarded as the postulation of a nonparametric reconstruction method as optimization criteria for learning the required functional connectivity that justifies and explains synchronous firing for binding of features as a mechanism for spatiotemporal coding. This can be expressed in an information-theoretic way by maximizing the discrimination ability between different sensory inputs in minimal time.	action potential;artificial neural network;biological neuron model;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;hebbian theory;information flow;information theory;mathematical optimization;mathematics;mutual information;neural network simulation;neural network software;point process;programming paradigm;resting state fmri;self-organization;spatiotemporal pattern;spiking neural network	Gustavo Deco;Bernd Schürmann	1999	Neural Computation	10.1162/089976699300016502	psychology;discrimination;neuroscience;information flow;first principle;computer science;artificial intelligence;architecture;reliability;mathematics;spike potential;coding;communication;artificial neural network;statistics;spiking neural network	ML	21.23591434369709	-70.75505814339131	57701

The present study investigated whether spatial working memory (SWM) contributes to visuomotor adaptation depending on the stage of learning. We tested the hypothesis that SWM would contribute early in the adaptation process by measuring (i) the correlation between SWM tasks and the rate of adaptation, and (ii) the overlap between the neural substrates of a SWM mental rotation task and visuomotor adaptation. Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests, a visuomotor adaptation task, and an SWM task involving mental rotation, with the latter two tasks performed in a 3.0-T MRI scanner. Performance on a neuropsychological test of SWM (two-dimensional mental rotation) correlated with the rate of early, but not late, visuomotor adaptation. During the early, but not late, adaptation period, participants showed overlapping brain activation with the SWM mental rotation task, in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral inferior parietal lobules. These findings suggest that the early, but not late, phase of visuomotor adaptation engages SWM processes.	acclimatization;bilateral filter;cerebral cortex;cognition;consciousness;lobule;memory disorders;motor neuron disease;neuropsychological tests;scanner device component	Joaquin A.

Motivation can increase intention retrieval success but little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether motivational incentives (monetary reward) modulate the processing of delayed intentions in the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), known to be crucial for intention processing. Using a mixed blocked and event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging design, we specifically tested whether reward affects intention processing in the aPFC in a transient or in a sustained manner and whether this is related to individual differences in retrieval success. We found a generalized effect of reward on both correct intention retrieval and ongoing task performance. Fronto-parietal regions including bilateral lateral aPFC showed sustained activity increases in rewarded compared to non-rewarded blocks as well as transient reward-related activity during the storage phase. Additionally, individual differences in reward-related performance benefits were related to the degree of transient signal increases in right lateral aPFC, specifically during intention encoding. This suggests that the ability to integrate motivational relevance into the encoding of future intentions is crucial for successful intention retrieval in addition to general increases in processing effort. Bilateral aPFC is central to these motivation-cognition interactions.	bilateral filter;bilateral sound;cerebral cortex;cognition;intention - mental process;interaction;interference (communication);lateral computing;lateral thinking;money;moral hazard;parietal lobe;prefrontal cortex;relevance;resonance;benefit	Jovita Bruening;Vera U.

Aberrant learning processes may underlie disorders such as anxiety, motivating the search for the neural mechanisms that underpin learning. Animal studies have shown that the neurotransmitter GABA is required for the computation of prediction errors, the mismatches between anticipated and experienced outcomes, which drive new learning. Given that evidence from human studies is lacking, we sought to determine whether these findings extend to humans. Here, in two samples of Caucasian individuals, we investigated whether genetically determined individual differences in GABA neurotransmission predict the P3 event-related potential, an EEG component known to reflect prediction error processing. Consistent with the results of animal studies, we show that a weighted genetic risk score computed from the number of GABRB2 rs1816072 A alleles (associated with increased expression of the GABAA receptor β2 subunit gene) and the number of ErbB4 rs7598440 T alleles (associated with increased GABA concentration) predicts optimal prediction error processing during aversive classical conditioning with both visual (Experiment 1, N = 90; p = .010) and auditory (Experiment 2; N = 92; p = .031) unconditioned stimuli. Our finding that optimal processing of aversive prediction errors is reduced in individuals genetically predisposed towards decreased GABA neurotransmission suggests a potential mechanism linking GABA and anxiety. Specifically, reduced GABA signalling via GABAA receptors could result in aberrant learning from aversive experiences and vulnerability to anxiety disorders.	alleles;anxiety disorders;computation;conditioning (psychology);conditioning, classical;electroencephalography;experience;gabrb2 gene;genetic polymorphism;neurotransmitters;receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbb-4, human;synaptic transmission;biological signaling;gamma-aminobutyric acid	Irina Baetu;Julia B.

4553944b10d05dd449a68a8c8c9d4419bb383e70	fast learning of simple perceptual discriminations reduces brain activation in working memory and in high-level auditory regions		Introducing simple stimulus regularities facilitates learning of both simple and complex tasks. This facilitation may reflect an implicit change in the strategies used to solve the task when successful predictions regarding incoming stimuli can be formed. We studied the modifications in brain activity associated with fast perceptual learning based on regularity detection. We administered a two-tone frequency discrimination task and measured brain activation (fMRI) under two conditions: with and without a repeated reference tone. Although participants could not explicitly tell the difference between these two conditions, the introduced regularity affected both performance and the pattern of brain activation. The “No-Reference” condition induced a larger activation in frontoparietal areas known to be part of the working memory network. However, only the condition with a reference showed fast learning, which was accompanied by a reduction of activity in two regions: the left intraparietal area, involved in stimulus retention, and the posterior superior-temporal area, involved in representing auditory regularities. We propose that this joint reduction reflects a reduction in the need for online storage of the compared tones. We further suggest that this change reflects an implicit strategic shift “backwards” from reliance mainly on working memory networks in the “No-Reference” condition to increased reliance on detected regularities stored in high-level auditory networks.	electroencephalography;high- and low-level;large;memory disorders;selective calling;fmri;facilitation	Luba Daikhin;Merav Ahissar	2015	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00786	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	ML	15.996538216594978	-77.2236231910674	58363
ac4e4ceea139b0688471c1f74a002fd6c96f455e	the hierarchical organization of semantic memory: executive function in the processing of superordinate concepts	semantic memory;feature sharedness;fmri;executive function;superordinate concepts;prefrontal cortex	Research on the processing of objects at different hierarchical levels has suggested that understanding superordinate concepts (e.g. fruit), relative to basic level concepts (e.g. apple), requires greater semantic control demands. Yet, it is unclear which factors underlie this difference in executive processing. We built on previous research showing that superordinate concepts have less shared features among their members and therefore may involve higher semantic control requirements. To test this hypothesis, we developed an fMRI study in which we orthogonally manipulated feature sharedness (more shared vs. less shared) and concept level (superordinate vs. basic) in a sentence verification task. Sentences involving less shared features, relative to more shared features, significantly engaged the L lateral PFC. Importantly, sentences that included superordinate concepts, relative to those with basic level concepts, also revealed a stronger response in L lateral PFC, along with posterior temporal gyrus activation. There was also a significant interaction between feature sharedness and concept level in several PFC regions and L posterior temporal areas. The results suggest that relative to basic level concepts, processing superordinate concepts requires extra semantic control in L lateral PFC to coordinate information that is less shared by other members of the category level. These findings demonstrate that feature sharedness impacts the neural basis of semantic knowledge, and is a critical dimension in the processing of superordinate concepts.	cfp gene;cfp wt allele;hypothalamic area, lateral;lateral thinking;physical object;powerbuilder foundation classes;requirement;verification of theories;apple allergenic extract;fmri;sentence	Ana Raposo;Mafalda Mendes;J.

Executive functioning which is considered a prerequisite for delivering prospective metacognitive judgments has been found to be correlated with HRV. This pilot study addresses the question, whether metacognitive awareness and resting vagally mediated HRV are positively associated. A sample of 20 healthy participants was analyzed that completed a typical Judgment of Learning task after an electrocardiogram had been recorded. The root-mean-squares of successive differences were used to calculate vagally mediated HRV. Metacognitive awareness was measured by comparing the judgments of learning with the actual memory performance, yielding a deviation score. HRV was found to be positively correlated with metacognitive awareness.

Two approaches are described. In the static approach, each stimulus is represented as a single multicomponent vector. Gradient images, which are intended to represent idealizations of physiological gradient maps in the auditory pathway, are constructed. The optimal auditory image and distance metric, with respect to the similarity rating data, are searched using the gradient method. In the dynamic approach, each input stimulus is represented by a set of spectral vectors.The response patterns are constructed through temporal integration. The onset portions of the stimuli are emphasized using a scaling procedure which operates qualitatively in the same way as lateral inhibition.	map;optimizing compiler	Petri Toiviainen	1996		10.1007/BFb0034124	speech recognition;auditory imagery	NLP	22.618808645395603	-68.72188213924184	58536

Here, we describe recordings using hybrid electrodes, containing both micro- and clinical macroelectrodes, to simultaneously sample both large-scale network oscillations and single neuron spiking activity in the medial temporal lobe structures of human subjects during a visual recognition memory task. We quantify and compare single neuron unit activity (SUA) with high-frequency macrofield oscillations (HFOs) for decoding visual images. Results: SUA and HFOs were recorded using hybrid electrodes containing both micro and macroelectrode contacts, implanted in patients with focal epilepsy. Decoding of image properties in different task trials was performed, analyzing SUA and HFO as point processes to capture the dynamics of neurons and their assemblies at different spatiotemporal scales, ranging from submillisecond discharges of single units to fast oscillations across large neuronal populations. Results highlight the limitations and potential complementary use of SUA and HFOs for decoding of general image properties. Conclusion: The dynamics of SUA and HFOs can be used to explore a wide range of neuronal assembly activities engaged in human memory processing. Significance: Hybrid electrodes provide a technological bridge for exploring multiscale activity, spanning individual neurons, their assemblies, and large-scale population activity reflected in local field potentials. Analysis of SUA and HFO dynamics as point processes provides a potentially useful signal processing method for exploring the neuronal correlates operating at different spatial scales.	acoustic lobing;body fluid discharge;epilepsies, partial;epilepsy;focal (programming language);file spanning;hybrid fibre-optic;implants;medial graph;memory disorders;neural oscillation;neuron;patients;population;signal processing;spatial scale;temporal lobe;action potential initiation;electrode	Michal T.

Extracting reliable and informative features from fMRI data that capture biologically meaningful inter-subject variation is critical for aligning and comparing functional networks across subjects, and connecting the properties of functional brain organization with variations in behavior, cognition and genetics. In this study, we derive two new measures, which we term functional density map and edge map, and demonstrate their usefulness in characterizing the function of individual brains. Specifically, using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we show that (1) both functional maps capture intrinsic properties of the functional connectivity pattern in individuals while exhibiting large variation across subjects; (2) functional maps derived from either resting-state or task-evoked fMRI can be used to accurately identify subjects from a population; and (3) cross-subject alignment using these functional maps considerably reduces functional variation and improves functional correspondence across subjects over state-of-the-art multimodal registration algorithms. Our results suggest that the proposed functional density and edge maps are promising features in characterizing the functional architecture in individuals and provide an alternative way to explore the functional variation across subjects.	alignment;brain;cognition;exhibits as topic;human connectome project;information;magnetic resonance imaging;map;multimodal interaction;rest;resting state fmri;algorithm;registration - actclass	Tong Tong;Iman Aganj;Tian Ge;Jonathan R.

Here, we investigate how these subthreshold behaviors affect the suprathreshold response. Both types of neurons are described by a resonate and fire model, with the stable fixpoint being either a focus or a node. Using analytic expression for a linear oscillator model with threshold and reset, we calculate the multimodal interspike interval densities. We show that a change in model parameters induces qualitative changes in the interspike interval densities.		T. Verechtchaguina;I. M.

In a previous report, a small cohort of SuperAgers was found to have higher cortical thickness on structural MRI than a group of age-matched but cognitively average peers. SuperAgers also displayed a patch of ACC where cortical thickness was higher than in 50- to 60-year-old younger cognitively healthy adults. In additional analyses, some SuperAgers had unusually low densities of age-related Alzheimer pathology and unusually high numbers of von Economo neurons in the anterior cingulate gyrus. SuperAgers were also found to have a lower frequency of the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E than the general population. These preliminary results show that above-average memory capacity can be encountered in advanced age. They also offer clues to potential biological factors that may promote resistance to age-related involutional changes in the structure and function of the brain.	apolipoprotein e;brain;eighty;gyrus cinguli;memory disorders;thickness (graph theory);density	Emily J.

35a4bcace1e2d47803dc14305abfeae4823e54f1	hierarchical models of the visual system.		Hierarchical models of the visual system are neural networks with a layered topology: In these networks, the receptive fields of units (i.e., the region of the visual space that units respond to) at one level of the hierarchy are constructed by combining inputs from units at a lower level. After a few processing stages, small receptive fields tuned to simple stimuli get combined to form larger receptive fields tuned to more complex stimuli. Such anatomical and functional hierarchical architecture is a hallmark of the organization of the visual system. Since the pioneering work of Hubel and Wiesel (1962), a variety of hierarchical models have been described from relatively small-scale models of the primary visual cortex to very large-scale (system-level) models of object and action recognition, which account for processing in large portions of the visual field and entire visual streams. The term ‘model of the visual system’ is generally reserved for architectures that are constrained in some way by the anatomy and the physiology of the visual system (with various degrees of realism). Convolutional networks are closely related connectionist networks with a similar architecture that have been used in multiple real-world machine learning problems including speech and music classification.	artificial neural network;bayesian network;connectionism;hierarchical database model;machine learning;statistical classification	Thomas Serre	2014		10.1007/978-1-4614-7320-6_345-1	computer science	ML	21.215279058579746	-66.51804392732896	59893

As a distinctive manifestation of agency, we review Spizzo's effect. This effect arises when agents coordinate their rhythmic movements with visual pulses. Once coordination is established, agents feel controlling the onset or the offset of the pulses through their movements. Spizzo's effect, therefore, constitutes a manifest case of extended agency, in which agents are aware of controlling, through movement, the pulses temporally concomitant with movement. We propose that sense of agency requires continuity of kinesthesia, which in turn requires the continuity of selfhood. The continuity of kinesthesia is necessarily deduced from the consistent kinematics observed in movements, whereas the continuity of selfhood may stem from the patterns of rhythmic coordination that humans encounter ever since intrauterine life. The primacy of these patterns in adults is in accordance with phenomena such as Spizzo's effect, which require coordination to be induced. We, therefore, propose coordination as the fundamental interaction from which selfhood, kinesthesia, and agency arise.

To explore how calcium spikes affect the neuronal output in-vivo, we emulate in-vivo like conditions by embedding the neuron model in a regime of low background fluctuations with occasional large synchronous inputs. In such a regime, a full calcium spike is only triggered by the synchronous events in a threshold like manner and has a stereotypical waveform. Hence, in such a regime, we are able to replace the calcium dynamics with a simpler threshold triggered current of fixed waveform, which is amenable to analytical treatment. We obtain analytically the mean somatic membrane potential excursion due to a calcium spike being triggered while in the fluctuating regime. Our analytical form that accounts for the covariance between conductances and the membrane potential shows a better agreement with simulation results than a naive first order approximation.	action potentials;action potential;anatomical compartments;biological neuron model;calcium spikes;diploid cell;embedding;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;membrane potentials;multi-compartment model;order of approximation;pyramidal cells;quantum fluctuation;simulation;video-in video-out;waveform	Yansong Chua;Moritz Helias;Abigail Morrison	2015		10.3389/fncom.2015.00091	text mining;medical research;simulation;computer science;bioinformatics;communication	ML	17.28245422772754	-71.75112297959514	60117

Interactions among these networks contribute to normal variations in cognitive functioning and to the aberrant affective profiles present in certain clinical conditions, such as major depression. Nevertheless, their links to non-clinical variations in affective functioning are still poorly understood. To address this issue, we used fMRI to measure the intrinsic functional interactions among these networks in a sample of predominantly younger women (N=162) from the Human Connectome Project. Consistent with the previously documented dichotomous motivational orientations (i.e., withdrawal versus approach) associated with sadness versus anger, we hypothesized that greater sadness would predict greater DMN (rather than DAN) functional dominance, whereas greater anger would predict the opposite. Overall, there was evidence of greater DAN (rather than DMN) functional dominance, but this pattern was modulated by current experience of specific negative emotions, as well as subclinical depressive and anxiety symptoms. Thus, greater levels of currently experienced sadness and subclinical depression independently predicted weaker DAN functional dominance (i.e., weaker DAN-FPC functional connectivity), likely reflecting reduced goal-directed attention towards the external perceptual environment. Complementarily, greater levels of currently experienced anger and subclinical anxiety predicted greater DAN functional dominance (i.e., greater DAN-FPC functional connectivity and, for anxiety only, also weaker DMN-FPC coupling). Our findings suggest that distinct affective states and subclinical mood symptoms have dissociable neural signatures, reflective of the symbiotic relationship between cognitive processes and emotional states.	anger;antivirus software;anxiety disorders;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;cognition;decision model and notation;default;document completion status - documented;emotions;human connectome project;interaction;major depressive disorder;mental orientation;modulation;resting state fmri;sadness	Raluca Petrican;Cristina Saverino;R.

To this end, we performed large-scale mining across the BrainMap database of coordinate-based activation locations from over 10,000 task-based experiments. Meta-analytic coactivation networks were identified by jointly applying independent component analysis (ICA) and meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) across a wide range of model orders (i.e., d=20-300). We then iteratively computed pairwise correlation coefficients for consecutive model orders to compare spatial network topologies, ultimately yielding fractionation profiles delineating how """"parent"""" functional brain systems decompose into constituent """"child"""" sub-networks. Fractionation profiles differed dramatically across canonical networks: some exhibited complex and extensive fractionation into a large number of sub-networks across the full range of model orders, whereas others exhibited little to no decomposition as model order increased. Hierarchical clustering was applied to evaluate this heterogeneity, yielding three distinct groups of network fractionation profiles: high, moderate, and low fractionation. BrainMap-based functional decoding of resultant coactivation networks revealed a multi-domain association regardless of fractionation complexity. Rather than emphasize a cognitive-motor-perceptual gradient, these outcomes suggest the importance of inter-lobar connectivity in functional brain organization. We conclude that high fractionation networks are complex and comprised of many constituent sub-networks reflecting long-range, inter-lobar connectivity, particularly in fronto-parietal regions. In contrast, low fractionation networks may reflect persistent and stable networks that are more internally coherent and exhibit reduced inter-lobar communication."""	3-iodobenzylguanidine;cluster analysis;coefficient;cognition disorders;coherence (physics);computation;experiment;gradient;heterogeneous system architecture;hierarchical clustering;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;network topology;neuroimaging;numerous;parietal lobe;resultant;spatial network;orders - hl7publishingdomain;statistical cluster	Angela R.

The difference in the concentration of both K+ and Na+ across the neuron cell membrane, as regulated by respective ion channels, plays a critical role in the propagation of action potentials, the spike-like signals neurons communicate with, as shown in Fig. 17.5.1 (top, left and middle). Due to their significant role in neuronal signaling, K+ channel malfunctions are linked to over 100 neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, spreading depression, and epilepsy. Selective real-time sensing of K+ concentration (denoted as [K+]) is therefore critical for the advancement of many neurological therapies.	action potential;antenna analyzer;characteristic impedance;neuron;operational amplifier;real-time clock;software propagation;the spike (1997)	Maged El Ansary;Nima Soltani;Hossein Kassiri;Ruben Machado;Suzie Dufour;Peter L.

In the present study, magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to examine the top-down centrifugal regulation of neural responses in the human SI and SII to a task-relevant somatosensory signal triggering a voluntary movement. Nine healthy adults participated in the study. A visual warning signal was followed 2 s later by a somatosensory imperative signal delivered to the right median nerve at the wrist. Three kinds of warning signal informed the participants of the reaction which should be executed on presentation of the imperative signal (rest or extension of the right index finger, extension of the left index finger). The somatosensory stimulation was used to both generate neural responses and trigger voluntary movement and therefore was regarded as a task-relevant signal. The responses were recorded using a whole-head MEG system. The P35m response around the SI was reduced in magnitude without alteration of the primary SI response, N20m, when the signal triggered a voluntary movement compared to the control condition, whereas bilateral SII responses peaking at 70-100 ms were enhanced and the peak latency was shortened. The peak latency of the responses in the SI and SII preceded the onset of the earliest voluntary muscle activation in each subject. Later bilateral perisylvian responses were also enhanced with movement. In conclusion, neural activities in the SI and SII evoked by task-relevant somatosensory signals are regulated differently by motor-related neural activities before the afferent inputs. The present findings indicate a difference in function between the SI and SII in somatosensory-motor regulation.	abducens nerve diseases;bilateral filter;bilateral sound;centrifugal governor;execution;imperative programming;index finger;international system of units;magnetoencephalography;modulation;onset (audio);pmel gene;primates;relevance;sacral nerve stimulation;silicon;skeletal muscle structure;tcea1 gene;top-down and bottom-up design	Tetsuo Kida;Toshiaki Wasaka;Koji Inui;Kosuke Akatsuka;Hiroki Nakata;Ryusuke Kakigi	2006	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.05.015	psychology;neuroscience;somatosensory evoked potential;developmental psychology;attention;magnetic field;gating;top-down and bottom-up design;communication;magnetoencephalography	HCI	17.262011732922367	-78.68019661459427	61151

Understanding the statistical structure of these patterns can help resolve fundamental questions about neural computation and neural dynamics. Spatiotemporal conditional inference (STCI) is introduced here as a semiparametric statistical framework for investigating the nature of precise spiking patterns from collections of neurons that is robust to arbitrarily complex and nonstationary coarse spiking dynamics. The main idea is to focus statistical modeling and inference not on the full distribution of the data, but rather on families of conditional distributions of precise spiking given different types of coarse spiking. The framework is then used to develop families of hypothesis tests for probing the spatiotemporal precision of spiking patterns. Relationships among different conditional distributions are used to improve multiple hypothesis-testing adjustments and design novel Monte Carlo spike resampling algorithms. Of special note are algorithms that can locally jitter spike times while still preserving the instantaneous peristimulus time histogram or the instantaneous total spike count from a group of recorded neurons. The framework can also be used to test whether first-order maximum entropy models with possibly random and time-varying parameters can account for observed patterns of spiking. STCI provides a detailed example of the generic principle of conditional inference, which may be applicable to other areas of neurostatistical analysis.	action potential;algorithm;artificial neural network;collections (publication);computation;first-order predicate;generic drugs;histogram;inference;monte carlo method;neural ensemble;principle of maximum entropy;semiparametric model;statistical model;wavelet analysis	Matthew T.

We recently reported that one night of sleep deprivation increased dopamine in striatum (measured with [(11)C]raclopride, a PET radiotracer that competes with endogenous dopamine for binding to D2 receptors) and that these increases were associated with impaired performance in a visual attention task. To better understand this association here we evaluate the relationship between changes in striatal dopamine (measured as changes in D2 receptor availability using PET and [(11)C]raclopride) and changes in brain activation to a visual attention task (measured with BOLD and fMRI) when performed during sleep deprivation versus during rested wakefulness. We find that sleep induced changes in striatal dopamine were associated with changes in cortical brain regions modulated by dopamine (attenuated deactivation of anterior cingulate gyrus and insula) but also in regions that are not recognized targets of dopaminergic modulation (attenuated activation of inferior occipital cortex and cerebellum). Moreover, the increases in striatal dopamine as well as its associated regional activation and deactivation patterns correlated negatively with performance accuracy. These findings therefore suggest that hyperstimulation of D2 receptors in striatum may contribute to the impairment in visual attention during sleep deprivation. Thus, while dopamine increases in prefrontal regions (including stimulation of D1 receptors) may facilitate attention our findings suggest that hyperstimulation of D2 receptors in striatum may impair it. Alternatively, these associations may reflect a compensatory striatal dopamine response (to maintain arousal) that is superimposed on a larger response to sleep deprivation.	arousal;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;cerebellum;cerebral cortex;cognition disorders;dopamine d2 receptor;dopamine hydrochloride;gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor;gyrus cinguli;impaired cognition;insula of reil;large;mental association;modulation;neostriatum;polyethylene terephthalate;receptors, serotonin, 5-ht2;rest;wakefulness;fmri;radiotracer	Nora D.

We present our architecture along with a case study where a real robotic system is to manage and harmonize conflicting tasks. This research focuses on attentional mechanisms for regulating the frequencies of sensor readings and action activations in a behavior-based robotic system. Such mechanisms are to direct sensors toward the most salient sources of information and filter the available sensory data to prevent unnecessary information processing.	adaptive filter;control system;information processing;instruction cycle;modulation;performance;robot;sensor	Ernesto Burattini;Silvia Rossi;Alberto Finzi;Mariacarla Staffa	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-15193-4_27	behavior-based robotics;computer vision;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence	Robotics	13.954487349195542	-72.40649447345018	61681

A failure of this ability can lead to social exclusion and is a feature of disorders such as psychopathy and disruptive behavior disorder. We investigated the neural basis of this ability using a customized video game played by 12 healthy participants in an fMRI scanner. Two conditions involved extreme examples of context-appropriate action: shooting an aggressive humanoid assailant or healing a passive wounded person. Two control conditions involved carefully matched stimuli paired with inappropriate actions: shooting the person or healing the assailant. Surprisingly, the same circuit, including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, was activated when participants acted in a context-appropriate manner, whether being compassionate towards an injured conspecific or aggressive towards a violent assailant. The findings indicate a common system that guides behavioral expression appropriate to social or societal context irrespective of its aggressive or compassionate nature.	amygdaloid structure;antisocial personality disorder;behavior disorders;customize;disruptive behavior disorder;exclusion;humanoid robot;humans;inappropriate adh syndrome;prefrontal cortex;rem sleep behavior disorder;scanner device component;video games;fmri	John Andrew King;R.

In contrast to the spatially local convolutions done in traditional image-based CNNs, our BrainNetCNN is composed of novel edge-to-edge, edge-to-node and node-to-graph convolutional filters that leverage the topological locality of structural brain networks. We apply the BrainNetCNN framework to predict cognitive and motor developmental outcome scores from structural brain networks of infants born preterm. Diffusion tensor images (DTI) of preterm infants, acquired between 27 and 46 weeks gestational age, were used to construct a dataset of structural brain connectivity networks. We first demonstrate the predictive capabilities of BrainNetCNN on synthetic phantom networks with simulated injury patterns and added noise. BrainNetCNN outperforms a fully connected neural-network with the same number of model parameters on both phantoms with focal and diffuse injury patterns. We then apply our method to the task of joint prediction of Bayley-III cognitive and motor scores, assessed at 18 months of age, adjusted for prematurity. We show that our BrainNetCNN framework outperforms a variety of other methods on the same data. Furthermore, BrainNetCNN is able to identify an infant's postmenstrual age to within about 2 weeks. Finally, we explore the high-level features learned by BrainNetCNN by visualizing the importance of each connection in the brain with respect to predicting the outcome scores. These findings are then discussed in the context of the anatomy and function of the developing preterm infant brain.	anatomic structures;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;cognition disorders;connectome;convolution;convolutional neural network;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;diffusion tensor imaging;focal (programming language);graph - visual representation;ground truth;high- and low-level;infant, newborn;locality of reference;natural science disciplines;neural network simulation;neuroscience discipline;node - plant part;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;preterm infant;renal dysplasia and retinal aplasia (disorder);silo (dataset);synthetic intelligence;neurodevelopment;positive regulation of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (nad(p)h) activity;primary motor cortex	Jeremy Kawahara;Colin J.

One of most valuable ways to test these theories consists in collecting the electrophysiological activity of cell assembles under several experimental conditions. The sequences of cell discharges—the spike trains—form time series whose dynamics is strongly related to the information processing carried out in the brain areas under study. Our purpose is to provide a user-friendly framework of a ‘Virtual Laboratory’ where computational neuroscience analyses and display of results can be distributed over a computer network, like Internet.	hebbian theory	Alessandro E.

To understand the dynamic nature of memory retrieval and its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, we develop a biologically plausible spiking neural circuit model, and demonstrate that free memory retrieval of sequences of events naturally arises from the model under the condition of excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. Using the mean-field model of the spiking circuit, we gain further theoretical insights into how such memory retrieval emerges. We show that the spiking neural circuit model quantitatively reproduces several salient features of free memory retrieval, including its semantic proximity effect and log-normal distributions of inter-retrieval intervals. In addition, we demonstrate that our model can serve as a platform to examine memory retrieval deficits observed in neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Furthermore, our model allows us to make novel and experimentally testable predictions, such as the prediction that there are long-range correlations in the sequences of retrieved items.	alzheimer's disease;cognition disorders;excitation;experiment;immune system diseases;parkinsonian disorders;semantic similarity;spiking neural network;tree network;memory retrieval	Yifan Gu;Pulin Gong	2016	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-016-0595-7	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication	ML	18.413212732105915	-70.37750429977557	61910

We define the fast system as the adaptive system to minimize error and the slow system as the meta-adaptation that modulates the meta-parameters that might influence the property of the adaptation. Specifically, we considered that a shape of the basis function of the adaptive system that influences abilities of motor adaptation is essential meta-parameter. Here, we hypothesised that the human brain modulated this meta-parameter during motor adaptation depending on the environment and discussed a method to detect this adaptability of the basis function.	adaptive system;basis function;modulation	Daichi Sasaki;Jun Izawa;Masahiko Morita	2015	2015 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science (MHS)	10.1109/MHS.2015.7438244	control engineering;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Arch	18.460035964463128	-67.31676221098262	61982

Cognitive models of SRC propose that automatic response activation can be strategically suppressed if the automatic response is likely to interfere with behavior; in particular, suppression is thought to occur in preparation for incompatible responses and when the required stimulus-response mapping is unknown before stimulus presentation. We test this preparatory suppression hypothesis in the context of imitation, a special form of SRC particularly relevant to human social behavior. Using TMS, we measured muscle-specific corticospinal excitability during action observation (motor resonance) while human participants prepared to perform imitative and counterimitative responses to action videos. Motor resonance was suppressed during preparation to counterimitate and for unknown mappings, compared to preparation to imitate and a baseline measure of motor resonance. These results provide novel neurophysiological evidence that automatic activation of stimulus-compatible responses can be strategically suppressed when the automatic response is likely to interfere with task goals. Insofar as motor resonance measures mirror neuron system activity, these results also suggest that preparatory control of automatic imitative tendencies occurs through modulation of mirror neuron system activity.	baseline (configuration management);cognitive model;medical device incompatibility problem;mirror neurons;modulation;muscle;neuron;resonance;sample rate conversion;stimulus–response compatibility;transcranial magnetic stimulation;zero suppression	Katy A.

We demonstrate that Multi-AGREL can learn non-linear mappings from inputs to multi-dimensional outputs, given only scalar reward feedback. We further show that in Multi-AGREL, the changes in the connection weights follow the gradient that minimizes global prediction error, and that all information required for synaptic plasticity is locally present.	artificial neural network;brain implant;gradient;layer (electronics);network model;neural network software;nonlinear system;reinforcement learning;synaptic package manager	Jaldert O.

It shows a dual operation, extruding or introducing Ca/sup ++/ through the cell membrane, depending on the electrochemical gradients, which in turn applies a membrane potential and ionic concentrations both inside and outside of the cell. We are interested on the dependence of calcium movement through the cell as well as the reversible behaviour of the exchanger. With the aid of a Ca/sup ++/ regulation simulator for spherical-type cells, where we can apply the stimuli at the membrane level, we have been able to verify the presence of inward-outward exchanging currents. Our model includes the diffusion process as a function of time in the cell, and the presence of a Ca/sup ++/ buffer (parvalbumin), both collaborating with the Na/sup +/-Ca/sup ++/ exchanger. This is only a part of the complete model that we have developed, because we were interested only in verifying the role of the exchanger during the presence of different Na/sup +/ and Ca/sup ++/ concentrations.

To establish a functional relationship between prefrontal memory fields and saccade target selection, we trained three macaque monkeys to make saccades to the remembered location of a visual cue in a delayed spatial match-to-sample saccade task. We electrically stimulated sites in the prefrontal cortex with subthreshold currents during the delay epoch while monkeys performed this task. Our results show that the artificially injected signal interacts with the neural activity responsible for target selection, biasing saccade choices either towards the receptive/movement field (RF/MF) or away from the RF/MF, depending on the stimulation site. These findings might reflect a functional link between prefrontal signals responsible for the selection bias by modulating the balance between excitation and inhibition in the competitive interactions underlying behavioral selection.	area striata structure;biasing;cerebral cortex;electricity;epoch (reference date);excitation;genetic selection;interaction;macaca;monkeys;prefrontal cortex;primates;radio frequency;saccades;selection bias	Ioan Opris;Andrei Barborica;Vincent P.

Most of these studies were performed with different cortical scales leading to cortical networks with different levels of small-world organization. The present study investigates how resolution of thickness-based cortical scales impacts on topological properties of human anatomical cortical networks. To this end, we designed a novel approach aimed at determining the best trade-off between small-world attributes of anatomical cortical networks and the number of cortical regions included in the scale. Results revealed that schemes comprising 540-599 regions (surface areas spanning between 250 and 275 mm(2)) at sparsities below 10% showed a superior balance between small-world organization and the size of the cortical scale employed. Furthermore, we found that the cortical scale representing the best trade-off (599 regions) was more resilient to targeted attacks than atlas-based schemes (Desikan-Killiany atlas, 66 regions) and, most importantly, it did not differ that much from the finest cortical scale tested in the present study (1494 regions). In summary, our study confirms that topological organization of anatomical cortical networks varies with both sparsity and resolution of cortical scale, and it further provides a novel methodological framework aimed at identifying cortical schemes that maximize small-worldness with the lowest scale resolution possible.	anatomy, regional;cervical atlas;connected_to relation;file spanning;graph - visual representation;neocortex;neuroimaging;optical fiber;population;small-world experiment;sparse matrix;thickness (graph theory);tissue fiber;square millimeter (qualifier value)	Rafael Romero-Garcia;Mercedes Atienza;Line Harder Clemmensen;Jose Luis Cantero	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.086	neuroscience;developmental psychology;artificial intelligence	ML	21.873673270391297	-78.63184426048691	62575
e55c0e66f4826d916c78dc9d8380644034166535	distinct pathways of neural coupling for different basic emotions	emotions;effective connectivity;fmri;amygdala;dcm	Emotions are complex events recruiting distributed cortical and subcortical cerebral structures, where the functional integration dynamics within the involved neural circuits in relation to the nature of the different emotions are still unknown. Using fMRI, we measured the neural responses elicited by films representing basic emotions (fear, disgust, sadness, happiness). The amygdala and the associative cortex were conjointly activated by all basic emotions. Furthermore, distinct arrays of cortical and subcortical brain regions were additionally activated by each emotion, with the exception of sadness. Such findings informed the definition of three effective connectivity models, testing for the functional integration of visual cortex and amygdala, as regions processing all emotions, with domain-specific regions, namely: i) for fear, the frontoparietal system involved in preparing adaptive motor responses; ii) for disgust, the somatosensory system, reflecting protective responses against contaminating stimuli; iii) for happiness: medial prefrontal and temporoparietal cortices involved in understanding joyful interactions. Consistently with these domain-specific models, the results of the effective connectivity analysis indicate that the amygdala is involved in distinct functional integration effects with cortical networks processing sensorimotor, somatosensory, or cognitive aspects of basic emotions. The resulting effective connectivity networks may serve to regulate motor and cognitive behavior based on the quality of the induced emotional experience.	amygdaloid structure;appendix;cerebral cortex;cognition disorders;community-acquired infections;emotions;functional integration;happiness;interaction;medial graph;modulation;neural oscillation;numerous;preparation;sadness;streptococcal infections;fmri	Marco Tettamanti;Elena Rognoni;Riccardo Cafiero;Tommaso Costa;Dario Galati;Daniela Perani	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.08.018	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;emotion;social psychology	ML	17.96002273722971	-77.15455315925267	62606

The simplest description of STDP only takes into account pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, with potentiation of the synapse when a presynaptic spike precedes a postsynaptic spike and depression otherwise. In light of experiments that explored a variety of spike patterns, the pair-based STDP model has been augmented to account for multiple pre- and postsynaptic spike interactions. As a result, a number of different """"multi-spike"""" STDP models have been proposed based on different experimental observations. The behavior of these models at the population level is crucial for understanding mechanisms of learning and memory. The challenging balance between the stability of a population of synapses and their competitive modification is well studied for pair-based models, but it has not yet been fully analyzed for multi-spike models. Here, we address this issue through numerical simulations of an integrate-and-fire model neuron with excitatory synapses subject to STDP described by three different proposed multi-spike models. We also analytically calculate average synaptic changes and fluctuations about these averages. Our results indicate that the different multi-spike models behave quite differently at the population level. Although each model can produce synaptic competition in certain parameter regions, none of them induces synaptic competition with its originally fitted parameters. The dichotomy between synaptic stability and Hebbian competition, which is well characterized for pair-based STDP models, persists in multi-spike models. However, anti-Hebbian competition can coexist with synaptic stability in some models. We propose that the collective behavior of synaptic plasticity models at the population level should be used as an additional guideline in applying phenomenological models based on observations of single synapses."""	biological neuron model;cns disorder;coexist (image);depressive disorder;experiment;hebbian theory;interaction;neuronal plasticity;numerical analysis;numerous;population parameter;seizures;simulation;synapse;synapses;chemosensitization/potentiation;negative regulation of nuclear-transcribed mrna catabolic process, deadenylation-dependent decay	Baktash Babadi;L.

The high volume and decentralized storage of such data poses new challenges for analysis. Here we develop for the first time a distributed optimization algorithm based on the point process likelihood for dynamic networks of interacting Hawkes processes.

1c4448b2703b19bd9a954a307f5ae5d87f75a7a6	recognizing task-specific dynamic structure of the brain function from eeg		In this paper, we propose a novel framework aimed at identifying the spatio-temporal characteristics of the brain's functional networks specific to the task, from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Our analysis begins with segmenting the EEG data, from each trial, into intervals during which functional networks sustain their connectivity and spatial distribution in the cortex (the source space). The EEG data is then transformed into the source space for retrieving the spatial location of the cortical functional networks. Functional networks that are most recurrent across all segments and trials are then detected, and located by employing Boolean matrix factorization (BMF). Back-tracing the identified functional networks also reveals their dynamics that are specific to the task. Results for a visual odd-ball task are presented.	ball project;electroencephalography	Ali Haddad;Laleh Najafizadeh	2018	2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018)	10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363673	logical matrix;spatial distribution;dynamic functional connectivity;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;electroencephalography;factorization;computer science	Visualization	21.068411953126063	-76.9951613420957	62749

Our approach is based on exploiting the stochastic nature of synaptic conductances and membrane voltage. Starting with the assumption that the variances of the conductances are known, we use a stochastic differential equation to model dynamics of membrane potential and derive equations for first and second moments that can be solved to find conductances. We successfully apply the new reconstruction method to simulated data. We also explore the robustness of the method as the assumptions of the underlying model are relaxed. We vary the noise levels, the reversal potentials, the number of stimulus repetitions, and the accuracy of conductance variance estimation to quantify the robustness of reconstruction. These studies pave the way for the application of the method to experimental data.	action potential;conductance (graph);estimated;lagrangian relaxation;membrane potentials;perseveration;sample variance;synapse;synaptic package manager;synaptic weight;tissue membrane;voltage	Stephen E.

The experiments were carried out by utilizing the GVNS, i.e. Generalized Venn-network Simulator. The data-set utilized in all simulations consisted of digital representations of finger positions of a piano player when performing a Mozart sonata.

d4af0eca6c0c29db9519fe95faf5ddc43e918c47	simulations support the simple hypothesis that persistent coupling of electrochemical activity in recurrent network neurons is an objective signature of visual object unity		Existing evidence supports the proposal that visual object unity can be identified with an epsilon-ball of recurrent synaptic conductance vectors (subsequently referred to as a connected open set). Simulations of a small retina and recurrent network demonstrate that such connected open sets persist despite temporal fluctuations in participating neurons, mimic the visual phenomena of grouping by proximity and object constancy over changes of image size and orientation, and behave similarly to human fMRI data from primary visual cortex during real and apparent motion. Simulations also demonstrate the nonlinear phenomenon of hysteresis in the appearance and disappearance of connected open sets, and human participants were subsequently found to demonstrate hysteresis in the perception of visual object unity. This report provides a physical foundation for these phenomena in the persistent coupling of differential equations that describe the behavior of electrochemical quantities in neurons. It also extends earlier work by improving temporal resolution, by employing clusters of neurons to promote redundancy, and by demonstrating that information on object unity is present in the frequencies of action potentials that can be transmitted to other networks by adjacent recurrent network neurons. Implications for the identification of objective signatures of aspects of experience in formal neural network models and applications to visual-cortical prostheses are discussed.	action potential;antivirus software;computer simulation;conductance (graph);hysteresis;image resolution;neuron;nonlinear system;recurrent neural network;synaptic package manager	Raymond Pavloski;Charles Lamb	2017	2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7965917	artificial intelligence;redundancy (engineering);machine learning;visualization;perception;open set;artificial neural network;pattern recognition;computer science;temporal resolution;nonlinear system;visual cortex	ML	17.711423159716936	-73.49926206737557	63214
aaa91ff91acfc9d03d7674bb5415fb8197a35856	characterizing neurons in the primary auditory cortex of the awake primate using reverse correlation	primary auditory cortex;reverse correlation	While the understanding of the functional role of different classes of neurons in the awake primary visual cortex has been extensively studied since the time of Hubel and Wiesel (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962), our understanding of the feature selectivity and functional role of neurons in the primary auditory cortex is much farther from complete. Moving bars have long been recognized as an optimal stimulus for many visual cortical neurons, and this finding has recently been confirmed and extended in detail using reverse correlation methods (Jones and Palmer, 1987; Reid and Alonso, 1995; Reid et al., 1991; llingach et al., 1997). In this study, we recorded from neurons in the primary auditory cortex of the awake primate, and used a novel reverse correlation technique to compute receptive fields (or preferred stimuli), encompassing both multiple frequency components and ongoing time. These spectrotemporal receptive fields make clear that neurons in the primary auditory cortex, as in the primary visual cortex, typically show considerable structure in their feature processing properties, often including multiple excitatory and inhibitory regions in their receptive fields. These neurons can be sensitive to stimulus edges in frequency composition or in time, and sensitive to stimulus transitions such as changes in frequency. These neurons also show strong responses and selectivity to continuous frequency modulated stimuli analogous to visual drifting gratings.	jones calculus;modulation;neuron;selectivity (electronic);spike-triggered average	R.

The model was implemented using LabVIEW 10.0, in order to assign to each of these operations, an execution block (Virtual Instrument). The results of its implementation showed a very similar behavior to that exhibited by real neurons. Furthermore, due to its simplicity and low computational requirements, it is expected that the Neuroid can be used to create several software models of biological neural systems, either for research or teaching purposes.	computation;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;labview;modulation;neuron;requirement;virtual instrumentation	Eric Arguello;R.

It exemplifies the general processes of sensory reception and transmission of sensory information in the form of trains of nerve impulses. The experimental basis of the defining linear transfer function is presented. This transfer function is composed of a second order lag and a transport delay. The ventral nerve cord conduction time does not contribute to the transport delay.

c9af093c9b52ff673a4d601c4a61d974735151b7	handedness and effective connectivity of the motor system	juser;websearch;publications database	Handedness denotes the individual predisposition to consistently use the left or right hand for most types of skilled movements. A putative neurobiological mechanism for handedness consists in hemisphere-specific differences in network dynamics that govern unimanual movements. We, therefore, used functional magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal modeling to investigate effective connectivity between key motor areas during fist closures of the dominant or non-dominant hand performed by 18 right- and 18 left-handers. Handedness was assessed employing the Edinburgh-Handedness-Inventory (EHI). The network of interest consisted of key motor regions in both hemispheres including the primary motor cortex (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), ventral premotor cortex (PMv), motor putamen (Put) and motor cerebellum (Cb). The connectivity analysis revealed that in right-handed subjects movements of the dominant hand were associated with significantly stronger coupling of contralateral (left, i.e., dominant) SMA with ipsilateral SMA, ipsilateral PMv, contralateral motor putamen and contralateral M1 compared to equivalent connections in left-handers. The degree of handedness as indexed by the individual EHI scores also correlated with coupling parameters of these connections. In contrast, we found no differences between right- and left-handers when testing for the effect of movement speed on effective connectivity. In conclusion, the data show that handedness is associated with differences in effective connectivity within the human motor network with a prominent role of SMA in right-handers. Left-handers featured less asymmetry in effective connectivity implying different hemispheric mechanisms underlying hand motor control compared to right-handers.	causal filter;cerebellum;dominant hand;hmn (hereditary motor neuropathy) proximal type i;handedness;index;magnetic resonance imaging;movement;predispositioning theory;structure of putamen;fmri;mesial premotor cortex;primary motor cortex	Eva-Maria Pool;Anne K.

Identification of functional brain regions is important in surgical planning, such as for resections of epileptic foci or brain tumors. The mapping procedure is done using electrocorticography (ECoG), an invasive technique in which electrical brain signals are acquired from the cortical surface. Two epilepsy patients with implanted electrode grids participated in the study. Data were collected during a vibrotactile finger stimulation paradigm and showed significant cortical activation (p <; 0.001) in the high-gamma range over the contralateral somatosensory cortex. The results are consistent with previous studies that used fMRI in test subjects without implanted electrodes. Therefore, the results suggest that localizing the cortical representations of the fingers in clinical practice using ECoG is feasible, even without the patient's active participation.	brain neoplasms;cerebral cortex;electrocorticography;electrodes, implanted;epilepsy;finger tree;implants;patients;programming paradigm;somatosensory cortex;electrode;fmri	Robert Prueckl;Christoph Kapeller;K.

Whereas previous studies have mostly examined hand actions related to grasping, hand-object interactions, or local finger movements, here we were interested in reaching only (i.e. the transport phase of the hand to a particular location in space), without grasping. We hypothesized that mirror neuron areas specific to reaching-related representations would be active in all three conditions. An overlap between executed, observed, and imagined reaching activations was found in dorsal premotor cortex as well as in the superior parietal lobe and the intraparietal sulcus, in accord with our hypothesis. Activations for observed reaching were more dorsal than activations typically reported in the literature for observation of hand-object interactions (grasping). Our results suggest that the mirror neuron system is specific to the type of hand action performed, and that these fronto-parietal activations are a putative human homologue of the neural circuits underlying reaching in macaques. The parietal activations reported here for executed, imagined, and observed reaching are also consistent with previous functional imaging studies on planned reaching and delayed pointing movements, and extend the proposed localization of human reach-related brain areas to observation as well as imagery of reaching.	acoustic lobing;execution;finger injuries;functional imaging;groove;guided imagery;homologous gene;interaction;macaca;magnetic resonance imaging;medical imaging;mirror neurons;motor neurons, gamma;movement;neuron;parietal lobe;reaching;structure of intraparietal sulcus;fmri	Flavia Filimon;Jonathan D.

Learning and reproducing temporal sequences are closely associated with our ability to perceive and generate body movements, speech and language, music, etc. A considerable body of neural network literature is devoted to temporal pattern generation (see Wang, 2001, for a recent review). These models generally treat a temporal pattern as a sequence of discrete patterns, called a temporal sequence. Most of the models are based on either multilayer perceptrons with backpropagation training or the Hopfield model of associative recall. The basic idea for the former class of models is to view a temporal sequence as a set of associations between consecutive components, and learn these associations as input-output transformations (Jordan, 1986; Elman, 1990; Mozer, 1993). To deal with temporal dependencies beyond consecutive components, part of the input layer is used to keep a trace of history, behaving as short-term memory (STM). Similarly, for temporal recall based on the Hopfield associative memory, a temporal sequence is viewed as associations between consecutive components. These associations are stored in extended versions of the Hopfield model that includes some time delays (Sompolinsky u0026 Kanter, 1986; Buhmann u0026 Schulten, 1987; Heskes u0026 Gielen, 1992). To deal with longer temporal dependencies, high-order networks have been proposed (Guyon et al., 1988).

Unfortunately, none of the current ambitious collaborative neuroscience projects pay enough attention to this topic and are thus unable to completely relate the microlevel properties of the system to its emergent macrolevel behaviors. In this review article, the problem of effective connectivity at the synaptic level in humans is explained, existing and possible computational approaches to fill explanatory gaps are reviewed, and the requisite characteristics of these approaches are considered.	cns disorder;computation;emergence;illness behavior;neuroscience discipline;synapse;synaptic package manager;explanation	Önder Gürcan	2014	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-014-0619-1	psychology;neuroscience;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication	ML	15.123865465859506	-72.54016025525333	65694

Here, we asked whether these areas respond to two first-order aspects of the face argued to be important for face perception, face parts (eyes, nose, and mouth), and the T-shaped spatial configuration of these parts. Specifically, we measured the magnitude of response in these areas to stimuli that (i) either contained real face parts, or did not, and (ii) either had veridical face configurations, or did not. The OFA and the fSTS were sensitive only to the presence of real face parts, not to the correct configuration of those parts, whereas the FFA was sensitive to both face parts and face configuration. Further, only in the FFA was the response to configuration and part information correlated across voxels, suggesting that the FFA contains a unified representation that includes both kinds of information. In combination with prior results from fMRI, TMS, MEG, and patient studies, our data illuminate the functional division of labor in the OFA, FFA, and fSTS.	contain (action);eye;face perception;first-order predicate;hypothalamic area, lateral;magnetoencephalography;nonesterified fatty acids;oral cavity;patients;structure of superior temporal sulcus;vertex configuration;visual cortex;voxel;dinoflagellate sulcus;fmri	Jia Liu;Alison Harris;Nancy Kanwisher	2010	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2009.21203	psychology;face;face perception;fusiform face area;neuroscience;division of labour;developmental psychology;young adult;visual perception;magnetic resonance imaging;first-order logic;brain mapping;communication	AI	17.12302768793226	-76.53234629023542	65697

This means that learning models based on discrete dynamics have more chances to provide a ground basis for modelling the underlying mechanisms associated with plasticity processes in the brain. In this paper we shall present the physical implementation of a learning model for Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) that is based on discrete learning variables. After optimizing the model to facilitate its hardware realization it is physically mapped on the POEtic tissue, a flexible hardware platform for the implementation of bio-inspired models. The implementation estimates obtained show that is possible to conceive a large-scale implementation of the model able to handle real-time visual recognition tasks.	artificial neural network;spiking neural network	Juan Manuel Moreno;Jan Eriksson;Javier Iglesias;Alessandro E.

Neuron as time coherence discriminator. Biol. Cybern. 74, 539-544], as well as by the leaky integrate-and-fire model [Segundo, J.P., Perkel, D., Wyman, H., Hegstad, H., Moore, G.P., 1968. Input-output relations in computer-simulated nerve cell. Kybernetic 4, 157-171]. In the binding neuron, the trace of an input is remembered for a fixed period of time after which it disappears completely. This is in contrast with the above two models, where the postsynaptic potentials decay exponentially and can be forgotten only after triggering. As usual, the binding neuron fires when the number of input impulses stored in it attains a definite threshold. The finiteness of memory in the binding neuron allows one to construct fast recurrent networks for computer modelling [Vidybida, A.K., 2003. Computer simulation of inhibition-dependent binding in a neural network. BioSystems 71, 205-212]. In this paper, the finiteness is utilized for exact mathematical description of the output stochastic process, if the binding neuron is driven with the poissonian input stream. For threshold 2 the output non-poissonian stream is characterized in terms of probability density distribution of interspike intervals, for threshold 3 the transmission function is obtained.	artificial neural network;binding neuron;biosystems;biological neuron model;computer simulation;discriminator;hodgkin disease;huxley: the dystopia;input/output;inspiration function;mathematics;neural network simulation;probability density;recurrent neural network;stochastic process;stream (computing);transfer function	Alexander K.

Here, we propose an integrated dynamical motion model (IDM), which is sufficiently general to handle diverse moving stimuli, yet sufficiently precise to account for a wide-ranging set of empirical observations made on a family of random dot kinematograms. In particular, we constructed models of the cortical areas involved in motion detection, motion integration and perceptual decision. We analyzed their parameters through dynamical simulations and numerical continuation to constrain their proper ranges. Then, empirical data from a family of random dot kinematograms experiments with systematically varying direction distribution, presentation duration and stimulus size, were used to evaluate our model and estimate corresponding model parameters. The resulting model provides an excellent account of a demanding set of parametrically varied behavioral effects on motion perception, providing both quantitative and qualitative elements of evaluation.

But how is this feat achieved? The virtue of such a descriptive model is contingent on a mechanistic understanding of how motor execution is altered in specific circumstances. In this report, we provide evidence that the well-known phenomenon of slowed RTs following mistakes (post-error slowing) is directly influenced by the degree of subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity. The STN is proposed to act as a brake on motor execution following conflict or errors, buying time so a more cautious response can be made on the next trial. STN local field potentials from nine Parkinson disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery were recorded while they performed a response conflict task. In a 2.5- to 5-Hz frequency range previously associated with conflict and error processing, the degree phase consistency preceding the response was associated with increasingly slower RTs specifically following errors. These findings provide compelling evidence that post-error slowing is in part mediated by a corticosubthalamic “hyperdirect” pathway for increased response caution.	cfp gene;cell nucleus;contingency (philosophy);deep brain stimulation;description;frequency band;gene regulatory network;hertz (hz);nucleus rtos;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;structure of subthalamic nucleus;super-twisted nematic display;whole earth 'lectronic link;dorsal raphe nucleus	James F.

This paper describes an algorithm which finds a sparse code for sequences of images that preserves information about the input. This algorithm when trained on natural video sequences develops bases representing the movement in particular directions with particular speeds, similar to the receptive fields of the movement-sensitive cells observed in cortical visual areas. Furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches to learning direction selectivity, the timing of neuronal activity encodes the phase of the movement, so the precise timing of spikes is crucially important to the information encoding.	algorithm;code;emergence;neural coding;selectivity (electronic);sparse matrix	Rafal Bogacz;Malcolm W.

We develop a new model based on the proposal that there is a maximum distance to which action potentials can propagate in the uterine wall. This establishes """"regions"""", where one action potential burst can rapidly recruit all the tissue. Regions are recruited into an organ-level contraction via a stretch-initiated contraction mechanism (myometrial myogenic response). Each uterine contraction begins with a regional contraction, which slightly increases intrauterine pressure. Higher pressure raises tension throughout the uterine wall, which initiates contractions of more regions and further increases pressure. The positive feedback synchronizes regional contractions into an organ-level contraction. Cellular automaton (CA) simulations are performed with Mathematica. Each """"cell"""" is a region that is assigned an action potential threshold. An anatomy sensitivity factor converts intrauterine pressure to regional tension through the Law of Laplace. A regional contraction occurs when regional tension exceeds regional threshold. Other input variables are: starting and minimum pressure, burst and refractory period durations, enhanced contractile activity during an electrical burst, and reduced activity during the refractory period. Complex patterns of pressure development are seen that mimic the contraction patterns observed in laboring women. Emergent behavior is observed, including global synchronization, multiple pace making regions, and system memory of prior conditions. The complex effects of nifedipine and oxytocin exposure are simulated. The force produced can vary as a nonlinear function of the number of regions. The simulation directly links tissue-level physiology to human labor. The concept of a uterine pacemaker is re-evaluated because pace making activity may occur well before expression of a contraction. We propose a new classification system for biological CAs that parallels the 4-class system of Wolfram. However, instead of classifying the rules, biological CAs should classify the set of input values for the rules that describe the relevant biology."""	action potentials;action potential;anatomic structures;artificial cardiac pacemaker;body tissue;cellular automaton;classification;emergence;ibm 7030 stretch;intrauterine;nifedipine;nonlinear system;oxytocin;parallels desktop for mac;personnameuse - assigned;positive feedback;rem sleep behavior disorder;rule (guideline);simulation;tcp global synchronization;tension;uterine contraction;uterine diseases;uterus;wolfram mathematica;myometrial;physiological aspects;tungsten	Roger C.

b78edffeb8091aa2e09e141c778cbb2f5634f65b	a loop-based neural architecture for structured behavior encoding and decoding	artificial intelligence;basal ganglia;functional integration;gating;neural networks	We present a new type of artificial neural network that generalizes on anatomical and dynamical aspects of the mammal brain. Its main novelty lies in its topological structure which is built as an array of interacting elementary motifs shaped like loops. These loops come in various types and can implement functions such as gating, inhibitory or executive control, or encoding of task elements to name a few. Each loop features two sets of neurons and a control region, linked together by non-recurrent projections. The two neural sets do the bulk of the loop's computations while the control unit specifies the timing and the conditions under which the computations implemented by the loop are to be performed. By functionally linking many such loops together, a neural network is obtained that may perform complex cognitive computations. To demonstrate the potential offered by such a system, we present two neural network simulations. The first illustrates the structure and dynamics of a single loop implementing a simple gating mechanism. The second simulation shows how connecting four loops in series can produce neural activity patterns that are sufficient to pass a simplified delayed-response task. We also show that this network reproduces electrophysiological measurements gathered in various regions of the brain of monkeys performing similar tasks. We also demonstrate connections between this type of neural network and recurrent or long short-term memory network models, and suggest ways to generalize them for future artificial intelligence research.

0f703c28e5c516713eaf7d213f488753da2b7b47	a specialized face-processing network consistent with the representational geometry of monkey face patches		1 Abstract Ample evidence suggests that face processing in human and non-human primates is performed differently compared with other objects. Converging reports, both physiologically and psychophysically, indicate that faces are processed in specialized neural networks in the brain – i.e. face patches in monkeys and the fusiform face area (FFA) in humans. We are all expert face-processing agents, and able to identify very subtle differences within the category of faces, despite substantial visual and featural similarities. Identification is performed rapidly and accurately after viewing a whole face, while significantly drops if some of the face configurations (e.g. inversion, misalignment) are manipulated or if partial views of faces are shown due to occlusion. This refers to a hotly-debated, yet highly-supported concept, known as holistic face processing. We built a hierarchical computational model of face-processing based on evidence from recent neuronal and behavioural studies on faces processing in primates. Representational geometries of the last three layers of the model have characteristics similar to those observed in monkey face patches (posterior, middle and anterior patches). Furthermore, several face-processing-related phenomena reported in the literature automatically emerge as properties of this model. The representations are evolved through several computational layers, using biologically plausible learning rules. The model satisfies face inversion effect, composite face effect, other race effect, view and identity selectivity, and canonical face views. To our knowledge, no models have so far been proposed with this performance and agreement with biological data.	artificial neural network;computation;computational model;holism;selectivity (electronic)	Amirhossein Farzmahdi;Karim Rajaei;Masoud Ghodrati;Reza Ebrahimpour;Seyed-Mahdi Khaligh-Razavi	2015	CoRR		psychology;computer vision;artificial intelligence;communication	Vision	16.48171602608485	-74.86528654214156	67255

This disruptive rTMS effect is highly valuable for revealing a causal relationship between brain and behavior. However, its influence on remote interconnected areas and, more importantly, the duration of the induced neurophysiological effects, remain unknown. These aspects are critical for a study design in the context of cognitive neuroscience. In order to investigate these issues, 12 healthy male subjects underwent 8 H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) scans after application of long-train low-frequency rTMS to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Immediately after the stimulation train, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increases were present under the stimulation site as well as in other prefrontal cortical areas, including the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) ipsilateral to the stimulation site. The mean increases in rCBF returned to baseline within 9 min. The duration of this unilateral prefrontal rTMS effect on rCBF is of particular interest to those who aim to influence behavior in cognitive paradigms that use an """"off-line"""" approach."""	baseline (configuration management);causality;cerebrovascular circulation;cognition disorders;cognitive science;cognitive tutor;dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;maxima and minima;neuroscience discipline;online and offline;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;positrons;transcranial magnetic stimulation;ventrolateral prefrontal cortex;x-ray computed tomography	C.

Some of the instabilities correspond to clinical conditions, whereas others are inherent in the normal saccadic system. How can these instabilities arise within the mechanism of normal saccadic eye movements? A physiologically-based model of the saccadic system predicts that horizontal saccadic oscillations will occur with excessive mutual inhibition between the left and right burst cells and with underaction of the pause cells. The amplitudes and frequencies of the oscillations had ranges of 0–6° and 6–20 cycles per second, respectively. Application of stability analysis techniques to the model reveals that development of the oscillations can be explained by the Hopf bifurcation mechanism. Future development of this approach will involve classifying pathological instabilities of the saccadic system according to the bifurcation involved in their generation.	anatomic bifurcation;bifurcation theory;classification;eye movements;hopf bifurcation;instability;movement;saccades	Dmitry Laptev;Ozgur E.

Previous work focused on attentional biases towards threat-related, fearful faces, although healthy participants tend to avoid mild threat. Growing evidence suggests that neuronal gamma (>30Hz) and alpha-band activity (8-12Hz) play an important role in attentional selection, but it is unknown if such oscillatory activity is involved in the guidance of attention through facial expressions. Thus, in this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study we investigated whether attention is shifted towards or away from fearful faces and characterized the underlying neuronal activity in these frequency ranges in forty-four healthy volunteers. We employed a covert spatial attention task using neutral and fearful faces as task-irrelevant distractors and emotionally neutral Gabor patches as targets. Participants had to indicate the tilt direction of the target. Analysis of the neuronal data was restricted to the responses to target Gabor patches. We performed statistical analysis at the sensor level and used subsequent source reconstruction to localize the observed effects. Spatially selective attention effects in the alpha and gamma band were revealed in parieto-occipital regions. We observed an attentional cost of processing the face distractors, as reflected in lower task performance on targets with short stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA <150ms) between faces and targets. On the neuronal level, attentional orienting to face distractors led to enhanced gamma band activity in bilateral occipital and parietal regions, when fearful faces were presented in the same hemifield as targets, but only in short SOA trials. Our findings provide evidence that both top-down and bottom-up attentional biases are reflected in parieto-occipital gamma-band activity.	asynchrony (computer programming);bilateral filter;blue (queue management algorithm);bottom-up proteomics;data acquisition;face;fear (mental process);gabor atom;javaserver faces;magnetoencephalography;neuroscience discipline;occipital lobe;onset (audio);parietal lobe;relevance;schmidt decomposition;threat (computer);top-down and bottom-up design;distractors;physical hard work;protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 4	Kathrin Müsch;Markus Siegel;Andreas K.

Our aim was to systematically characterize FC of underlying neural network involved in swallowing, and to evaluate its reproducibility and modulation during rest or task performance.   METHODS Activated seed regions within known areas of the cortical swallowing network (CSN) were independently identified in 16 healthy volunteers. Subjects swallowed using a paradigm driven protocol, and the data analyzed using an event-related technique. Then, in the same 16 volunteers, resting and active state data were obtained for 540 s in three conditions: 1) swallowing task; 2) control visual task; and 3) resting state; all scans were performed twice. Data was preprocessed according to standard FC pipeline. We determined the correlation coefficient values of member regions of the CSN across the three aforementioned conditions and compared between two sessions using linear regression. Average FC matrices across conditions were then compared.   RESULTS Swallow activated twenty-two positive BOLD and eighteen negative BOLD regions distributed bilaterally within cingulate, insula, sensorimotor cortex, prefrontal and parietal cortices. We found that: 1) Positive BOLD regions were highly connected to each other during all test conditions while negative BOLD regions were tightly connected among themselves; 2) Positive and negative BOLD regions were anti-correlated at rest and during task performance; 3) Across all three test conditions, FC among the regions was reproducible (r>0.96, p<10(-5)); and 4) The FC of sensorimotor region to other regions of the CSN increased during swallowing scan.   CONCLUSIONS 1) Swallow activated cortical substrates maintain a consistent pattern of functional connectivity; 2) FC of sensorimotor region is significantly higher during swallow scan than that observed during a non-swallow visual task or at rest."""	artificial neural network;biological neural networks;cop9 signalosome;cell respiration;cell signaling;cerebral cortex;coefficient;coherent;data pre-processing;eighteen;insula of reil;modulation;parietal lobe;prefrontal cortex;programming paradigm;random seed;rest;resting state fmri;twenty two;blood oxygen level dependent	Arash Babaei;B.

Nevertheless, the cerebral imbalance for bi-dimensional stimuli is still controversial, and the aim of the present study is to investigate this issue. Healthy participants and a split-brain patient (D.D.C.) were tested in a divided visual field paradigm, in which a square shape was presented either in the left or right visual field and they were asked to judge whether a dot was placed exactly in the center of the square or off-center, by using the left/right hand in two separate sessions. The performance of healthy participants was better when the stimuli presented in the left visual field (LVF) were on-center rather than off-center. The performance of D.D.C. was higher than chance only when on-center stimuli were presented in the LVF in the left hand session. Only in this condition did his accuracy not differ with respect to that of the control group, whereas in all of the other conditions, it was lower than the controls’ accuracy. We conclude that the right-hemispheric advantage already shown for mono-dimensional stimuli can be extended also to bi-dimensional configurations, confirming the right-hemispheric superiority for spatial symmetry perception.	programming paradigm	Giulia Prete;Mara Fabri;Nicoletta Foschi;Luca Tommasi	2017	Symmetry	10.3390/sym9050076	split-brain;artificial intelligence	HCI	13.067326638553531	-78.57609148415686	67889
cfc5ac8a76d98395102bedca096a3c9eb544b5f1	the role of cortical sensorimotor oscillations in action anticipation	independent component analysis;mu rhythm;human mirror neuron system;action observation;expertise	The human mirror neuron system is believed to play an important role in facilitating the ability of athletes to anticipate the actions of an opponent. This system is often assessed with EEG by measuring event-related changes in mu (8-13Hz) sensorimotor oscillations. However, traditional channel-based analyses of this measure are flawed in that due to volume conduction effects mu and non-mu alpha activity can become mixed. This flaw means it is unclear the extent to which mu activity indexes the mirror system, as opposed to other processes such as attentional demand. As a solution to this problem, we use independent component analysis to separate out the underlying brain processes during a tennis-related action observation and anticipation task. We investigated expertise-related differences in independent component activity. Experienced tennis players (N=18) were significantly more accurate than unexperienced novices (N=21) on the anticipation task. EEG results found significant group differences in both the mu and beta (15-25Hz) frequency bands in sensorimotor components, with earlier and greater desynchronisation in the experienced tennis players. In particular, only experienced players showed desynchronisation in the high mu (11-13Hz) band. No group differences were found in posterior alpha components. These results show for the first time that expertise differences during action observation and anticipation are unique to sensorimotor sources, and that no expertise-related differences exist in attention modulated, posterior alpha sources. As such, this paper provides a much cleaner measure of the human mirror system during action observation, and its modulation by motor expertise, than has been possible in previous work.	bands;electroencephalography;flaw hypothesis methodology;frequency band;independent component analysis;index;mirror neurons;modulation;neuron	Dan Denis;Richard Rowe;A.

Motivated by recent findings that cortical neurons have a resonant peak in their impedance magnitude function, we present a frequency-spatial transformation scheme that is schematically described as follows: An external input signal, applied to a small input subset of the neurons, spreads along the network. Due to a stochastic component in the dynamics of the neurons, the frequency of the spreading signal decreases as it propagates through the network. Depending on the input signal frequency, different neural assemblies will hence fire at their specific resonance frequency. We show analytically that the resulting frequency-spatial transformation is well-formed; an injective, fixed, mapping is obtained. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that a homogeneous, well-formed transformation may also be obtained in neural networks with cortical-like """"Mexican-hat"""" connectivity.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a tool capable of measuring the dynamics of the brain's neural networks, and is thus an important means in analysis and understanding of aMCI. In this proof-of-concept study, we compared the brain activation patterns of ten aMCI subjects with those of four healthy subjects during sleep by employing a 64-channel EEG data collection system. The power spectrum was analyzed to identify sleep stages, while spectral topography and source imaging techniques were employed to study the fluctuating patterns of the brain. Results of this study show an increase in activation power across all sleep stages in the delta and theta frequency bands alongside a decrease in alpha band activity for aMCI subjects. Source imaging analysis of the resting EEG identified default mode network, which becomes decoupled as sleep stages deepen. In the proof-of-concept study, our exploratory analysis demonstrated the feasibility of imaging dynamic network organization using EEG in aMCI.	alzheimer's disease;artificial neural network;assistive technology;bands;cognition disorders;cognitive science;dec alpha;data collection;default;electroencephalography phase synchronization;frequency band;imaging techniques;network governance;neural network simulation;rest;sleep apnea syndromes;sleep stages;spectral density;stellar classification;topography	Johnny O'Keeffe;Barbara Carlson;Lisa DeStefano;Michael Wenger;Melissa Craft;Linda Hershey;Jeremy Hughes;Dee Wu;Lei Ding;Han Yuan	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037639	neuroscience;default mode network;electroencephalography;sleep stages;cognition;theta rhythm;data collection system;eeg-fmri;psychology	SE	20.108748682213978	-77.57880576594161	68265

Dual tasking activates a network of brain regions including pFC. We therefore hypothesized that facilitation of prefrontal cortical activity via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would reduce dual-task costs in older adults. Thirty-seven healthy older adults completed two visits during which dual tasking was assessed before and after 20 min of real or sham tDCS targeting the left pFC. Trials of single-task standing, walking, and verbalized serial subtractions were completed, along with dual-task trials of standing or walking while performing serial subtractions. Dual-task costs were calculated as the percent change in markers of gait and postural control and serial subtraction performance, from single to dual tasking. Significant dual-task costs to standing, walking, and serial subtraction performance were observed before tDCS (p < .01). These dual-task costs were less after real tDCS as compared with sham tDCS as well as compared with either pre-tDCS condition (p < .03). Further analyses indicated that tDCS did not alter single task performance but instead improved performance solely within dual-task conditions (p < .02). These results demonstrate that dual tasking can be improved by modulating prefrontal activity, thus indicating that dual-task decrements are modifiable and may not necessarily reflect an obligatory consequence of aging. Moreover, tDCS may ultimately serve as a novel approach to preserving dual-task capacity into senescence.	cfp gene;dual;elder extract;financial cost;kohn–sham equations;maxima and minima;modulation;relative change and difference;transcranial direct current stimulation;cellular targeting;facilitation	Brad Manor;Junhong Zhou;Azizah Jor'dan;Jue Zhang;Jing Fang;Alvaro Pascual-Leone	2016	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00897	psychology;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;communication	HCI	16.70164613614969	-79.86595112493664	68336

Assessment of the functional qualities of resting state networks has been limited by the task-independent state, which results in an inability to relate these networks to specific mental functions. However, it was recently demonstrated that similar brain networks can be extracted from resting state data and data extracted from thousands of task-based neuroimaging experiments archived in the BrainMap database. Here, we present a full functional explication of these intrinsic connectivity networks at a standard low order decomposition using a neuroinformatics approach based on the BrainMap behavioral taxonomy as well as a stratified, data-driven ordering of cognitive processes. Our results serve as a resource for functional interpretations of brain networks in resting state studies and future investigations into mental operations and the tasks that drive them.	apollonian network;archive;experiment;extraction;finite-state machine;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;interpretation process;mental operations;neuroimaging;neuroinformatics;rest;resting state fmri;taxonomy	Angela R.

The procedure applies the FSL option """"probabilistic tracking with classification targets"""" in a bidirectional and iterative manner. To assess the utility of BIP, we applied the procedure to the problem of parcellating a limited set of well-established gray matter seed regions associated with the dorsal (arcuate fasciculus/superior longitudinal fasciculus) and ventral (extreme capsule fiber system) white matter tracts in the language networks of 97 participants. These left hemisphere seed regions and the two white matter tracts, along with their right hemisphere homologues, provided an excellent test case for BIP because the resulting parcellations overlap and their connectivity via the arcuate fasciculi and extreme capsule fiber systems are well studied. The procedure yielded both confirmatory and novel findings. Specifically, BIP confirmed that each tract connects within the seed regions in unique, but expected ways. Novel findings included increasingly left-lateralized parcellations associated with the arcuate fasciculus/superior longitudinal fasciculus as a function of age and education. These results demonstrate that BIP is an easily implemented technique that successfully confirmed cortical connectivity patterns predicted in the literature, and has the potential to provide new insights regarding the architecture of the brain."""	anatomic structures;cerebral association nerve fasciculus;computational anatomy;diffusion weighted imaging;fmrib software library (fsl);fascicle - nerve fibers;frontal lobe gyrus;gray matter;handedness;hemi-fontan procedure;inferior frontal gyrus;iterative method;linear programming;sensitivity and specificity;structure of extreme capsule;structure of superior longitudinal fasciculus;test case;tissue fiber;tract (literature);white matter;wolff-parkinson-white syndrome	Dianne K.

Specifically, we assess a range of data on gestural communication of great apes as the basis for developing an account of the interactions of two primates engaged in ontogenetic ritualization, a proposed learning mechanism through which a functional action may become a communicative gesture over repeated interactions between two individuals (the ‘dyad’). The integration of behavioral, neural, and computational data in dyadic (or, more generally, social) brain modeling has broad application to comparative and evolutionary questions, particularly for the evolutionary origins of cognition and language in the human lineage. We relate this work to the neuroinformatics challenges of integrating and sharing data to support collaboration between primatologists, neuroscientists and modelers that will help speed the emergence of what may be called comparative neuro-primatology.	brain;cognition;computation;computer simulation;dyadic transformation;electronic circuit;emergence;interaction;lineage (evolution);macaca;national origin;neuroinformatics;pongidae;primates	Brad Gasser;Erica A.

6c5a3a701650ae0fdfada8f3d3b5e6aeee29d895	how infants' reaches reveal principles of sensorimotor decision making		ABSTRACTIn Piagetu0027s classical A-not-B-task, infants repeatedly make a sensorimotor decision to reach to one of two cued targets. Perseverative errors are induced by switching the cue from A to B, while spontaneous errors are unsolicited reaches to B when only A is cued. We argue that theoretical accounts of sensorimotor decision-making fail to address how motor decisions leave a memory trace that may impact future sensorimotor decisions. Instead, in extant neural models, perseveration is caused solely by the history of stimulation. We present a neural dynamic model of sensorimotor decision-making within the framework of Dynamic Field Theory, in which a dynamic instability amplifies fluctuations in neural activation into macroscopic, stable neural activation states that leave memory traces. The model predicts perseveration, but also a tendency to repeat spontaneous errors. To test the account, we pool data from several A-not-B experiments.

However, these gradients can temporarily nearly vanish in neurological diseases, such as migraine and stroke, and in traumatic brain injury from concussions to severe injuries. We study biophysical neuron models based on the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) formalism extended to include time-dependent ion concentrations inside and outside the cell and metabolic energy-driven pumps. We reveal the basic mechanism of a state of free energy-starvation (FES) with bifurcation analyses showing that ion dynamics is for a large range of pump rates bistable without contact to an ion bath. This is interpreted as a threshold reduction of a new fundamental mechanism of ionic excitability that causes a long-lasting but transient FES as observed in pathological states. We can in particular conclude that a coupling of extracellular ion concentrations to a large glial-vascular bath can take a role as an inhibitory mechanism crucial in ion homeostasis, while the Na⁺/K⁺ pumps alone are insufficient to recover from FES. Our results provide the missing link between the HH formalism and activator-inhibitor models that have been successfully used for modeling migraine phenotypes, and therefore will allow us to validate the hypothesis that migraine symptoms are explained by disturbed function in ion channel subunits, Na⁺/K⁺ pumps, and other proteins that regulate ion homeostasis.	action potentials;action potential;bifurcation theory;brain concussion;brain injuries;cerebrovascular accident;excited state;gradient;hodgkin disease;hodgkin–huxley model;huxley: the dystopia;ion channel;ionic;ions;list of code lyoko episodes;metabolic process, cellular;migraine disorders;neuroglia;neuron;phenotype;requirement;reservoir device component;semantics (computer science);shin megami tensei: persona 3;traumatic brain injury;free energy;ion homeostasis;nervous system disorder;pump (device)	Niklas Hübel;Eckehard Schöll;Markus A.

The PFC is thought to implement the cognitive processes underling such rule-based behavior, but the specific contributions of the several cytoarchitecturally distinct subfields of PFC remain poorly understood. Here, we used bilateral cryogenic deactivation to investigate the relative contributions of two regions of the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC)—the inferior dlPFC (idlPFC) area, consisting of the cortex lining the caudal principal sulcus, and the dorsally adjacent superior dlPFC (sdlPFC)—to different aspects of rule-based behavior. Macaque monkeys performed two variants of a task that required them to alternate unpredictably between eye movements toward (prosaccade) or away from (antisaccade) a visual stimulus. In one version of the task, the current rule was overtly cued. In the second, the task rule was uncued, and successful performance required the animals to detect rule changes on the basis of reward outcome and subsequently maintain the current task rule within working memory. Deactivation of the idlPFC impaired the monkeys' ability to perform pro- and antisaccades in the uncued task only. In contrast, deactivation of the sdlPFC had no effect on performance in either task. Combined deactivation of idlPFC and sdlPFC impaired performance on antisaccade, but not prosaccade, trials in both task variants. These results suggest that the idlPFC is required for mnemonic processes involved in maintenance of task rules, whereas both idlPFC and sdlPFC together are necessary for the deployment of the cognitive control required to perform antisaccades. Together, these data support the concept of a functional specialization of subregions within the dlPFC for rule-guided behavior.	area striata structure;bilateral filter;cfp gene;cfp wt allele;caudal;cerebral cortex;deploy;dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;eye movements;groove;logic programming;macaca;memory disorders;monkeys;movement;partial template specialization;rule (guideline);rule 184	Sabeeha Hussein;Kevin D.

We have previously characterized pathways transmitting information to the brain about visceral pain. Visceral pain arises from second order neurons in lamina X surrounding the spinal cord central canal. Some of the brain regions of interest receiving axonal terminations directly from lamina X were examined in the present study using enhanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and one week after induction of a rat pancreatitis model with persistent inflammation and behavioral signs of increased nociception. Analysis of imaging data demonstrates an increase in MRI signal for all the regions of interest selected including the rostral ventromedial medulla, dorsal raphe, periaqueductal grey, medial thalamus, and central amygdala as predicted by the anatomical data, as well as increases in the lateral thalamus, cingulate/retrosplenial and parietal cortex. Occipital cortex was not activated above threshold in any condition and served as a negative control. Morphine attenuated the MRI signal, and the morphine effect was antagonized by naloxone in lower brainstem sites. These data confirm activation of these specific regions of interest known as integration sites for nociceptive information important in behavioral, affective, emotional and autonomic responses to ongoing noxious visceral activation.	abdominal pain;amygdaloid structure;autonomic computing;brain stem;cns disorder;cerebral cortex;decussation;gene regulatory network;inflammation;larva migrans, visceral;lateral thinking;medial graph;morphine;naloxone;nociception;opioid receptor;pancreatitis;patients;region of interest;relevance;resonance;spinal cord;thalamic structure;transmitter;visceral pain;central amygdalar nucleus;dorsal raphe nucleus;fmri	Karin N.

Our approach to theory development began with a broad description of the computations that depend on the hippocampal region in classical conditioning (Gluck and Myers, 1993 and Gluck and Myers, 2001). In this initial model, the hippocampal region was treated as an Information-processing system that transformed stimulus representations, compressing (making more similar) representations of inputs that co-occur or are otherwise redundant, while differentiating (or making less similar) representations of inputs that predict different future events. This model led to novel predictions for the behavioral consequences of hippocampal-region lesions in rodents and of brain damage in humans who have amnesia or are in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. Many of these predictions have, since been confirmed by our lab and others. Functional brain imaging studies have provided further supporting evidence. In more recent computational modeling, we have shown how some aspects of this proposed information-processing function could emerge from known anatomical and physiological characteristics of the hippocampal region, including the entorhinal cortex and the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system. The modeling to date lays the groundwork for future directions that increase the depth of detail of the biological modeling, as well as the breadth of behavioral phenomena addressed. In particular, we are working now to reconcile these kinds of incremental associative learning models with other models of the hippocampal region that account for the rapid formation of declarative memories.	alzheimer's disease;amnesia;brain injuries;brain implant;computation;computation (action);computational model;conditioning (psychology);conditioning, classical;execution unit;hippocampus proper;increment;information processing;information processor;learning disorders;medical imaging;memory, episodic;psychological theory;rodent;structure of entorhinal cortex;top-down and bottom-up design	Mark A.

Although people with antisocial tendencies show atypical brain activation in some emotion and reward paradigms, how the brain reward systems of heavy drinkers (HD) are influenced by antisocial traits remains unclear. We used subjects' preferred alcohol drink odors (AO), appetitive (ApCO) and non-appetitive (NApO) control odors in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine if reward system responses varied as a function of antisocial trait density (ASD). In this retrospective analysis, we examined 30 HD who had participated in imaging twice: once while exposed to clamped intravenous alcohol infusion targeted to 50mg%, and once during placebo saline infusion. Under placebo, there were positive correlations between ASD and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation in the [AO>ApCO] contrast in the left dorsal putamen, while negative correlations were present in medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the bilateral amygdala. A similar pattern was observed in the correlation with the [AO>NApO] contrast. This inverse relationship between ASD and activation in OFC and amygdala was specific to AO. However, negative correlations between ASD and the [ApCO>NApO] contrast were also present in the insula, putamen, and medial frontal cortex. These data suggest that frontal and limbic reward circuits of those with significant ASD are less responsive to reward cues in general, and particularly to alcohol cues in medial OFC and amygdala. These findings are broadly consistent with the reward deficiency syndrome hypothesis, although positive correlation in the striatum suggests regional variability.	ambient occlusion;amygdaloid structure;angular defect;antisocial personality disorder;antisocial behavior;bilateral filter;bilateral sound;cell respiration;drinking the kool-aid;ethanol;insula of reil;medial graph;napo <leafhopper>;neostriatum;orofacial cleft 1;odors;orbitofrontal cortex;resonance;salineos;spatial variability;structure of putamen;subtype (attribute);trait;blood oxygen level dependent;fmri;frontal lobe	Brandon G.

This work is aimed at developing a better understanding of alterations in neuronal connectivity underlying Electroencephalogram (EEG) changes in AD. Specif cally, connectivity changes in the dorso-lateral geniculo-cortical pathway are studied using a neural mass computational model. Connectivity parameters in the model are informed by the most recent experimental data on mammalian Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (dorsal). A slowing of the mean power spectra of the model output is observed with increase in both excitatory and inhibitory parameters in the intra-thalamic and thalamocortical pathways and a decrease of sensory pathway synaptic connectivity.

Theories and modeling studies based on standard Integrate-and-Fire models implicitly assume that, in response to increasingly strong inputs, neurons modify their coding strategy by progressively reducing their selective sensitivity to rapid input fluctuations. Combining mathematical modeling with in vitro experiments, we demonstrate that, in L5 pyramidal neurons, the firing threshold dynamics adaptively adjust the effective timescale of somatic integration in order to preserve sensitivity to rapid signals over a broad range of input statistics. For that, a new Generalized Integrate-and-Fire model featuring nonlinear firing threshold dynamics and conductance-based adaptation is introduced that outperforms state-of-the-art neuron models in predicting the spiking activity of neurons responding to a variety of in vivo-like fluctuating currents. Our model allows for efficient parameter extraction and can be analytically mapped to a Generalized Linear Model in which both the input filter--describing somatic integration--and the spike-history filter--accounting for spike-frequency adaptation--dynamically adapt to the input statistics, as experimentally observed. Overall, our results provide new insights on the computational role of different biophysical processes known to underlie adaptive coding in single neurons and support previous theoretical findings indicating that the nonlinear dynamics of the firing threshold due to Na+-channel inactivation regulate the sensitivity to rapid input fluctuations.	acclimatization;action potential;adaptive coding;biological neuron model;conductance (graph);diploid cell;experiment;external pyramidal layer of neocortex;generalized linear model;in vitro [publication type];linear network coding;mathematical model;mathematics;neurons;nonlinear system;pathologic processes;population parameter;pyramidal cells;the spike (1997);video-in video-out;mapped	Skander Mensi;Olivier Hagens;Wulfram Gerstner;Christian Pozzorini	2016		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004761	biology;neuroscience;membrane potential;nonlinear system;forecasting;artificial intelligence;machine learning;action potential	ML	18.775202622148903	-72.12921637778626	69740

In other populations, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating the neural networks associated with this bias consistently implicate the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during emotion regulation. In the present study, twenty-eight older adults were categorized into three groups based on grief severity: Complicated Grief (n=8), Non-Complicated Grief (n=9), and Nonbereaved, married controls (n=11). Using a block design, all participants completed 8 blocks (20 stimuli per block) of the ecStroop task during fMRI data acquisition. Differences in neural activity during grief-related (as opposed to neutral) stimuli across groups were examined. Those with Complicated Grief showed an absence of increased rostral ACC (rACC) and fronto-cortical recruitment relative to Nonbereaved controls. Activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (x=6, y=54, z=-10) was significantly elevated in the Non-Complicated Grief group when compared to Nonbereaved controls. Post hoc analysis evidenced activity in the dorsal ACC in the Complicated Grief and Nonbereaved groups late in the task. These findings, supported by behavioral data, suggest a relative inability to recruit the regions necessary for successful completion of this emotional task in those with Complicated Grief. This deficit was not observed in recruitment of the orbitofrontal cortex and the rACC during processing of idiographic semantic stimuli in Non-Complicated Grief.	acc (programming language);acclimatization;artificial neural network;auditory recruitment;categorization;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;data acquisition;hoc (programming language);loss, grief, and bereavement;magnetic resonance imaging;midbrain raphe nuclei;neural network simulation;population;sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);fmri	Brian Arizmendi;Alfred W.

Previously, we have formulated a neural network model for the development of receptive fields in the mammal visual cortex prior to coherent visual experience. This model is based on self-organization rules, such as Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning, spread of neural signal among neighbouring neurons, and limitation of the synaptic growth. Here we present how the same model is able to simulate plasticity after birth just tunning the conditions of the simulation to those of a retinal lesion. Thus, our model accounts for the experimentally described long-term plasticity as well as for the short-term one. The significance of the experimental results are discussed in the context of the neural self-organization theory.	network model	Federico Morán;Miguel A.

37d4dfde54c0868267b26bf5273833cddf38985b	principal components analysis of reward prediction errors in a reinforcement learning task		"""Models of reinforcement learning represent reward and punishment in terms of reward prediction errors (RPEs), quantitative signed terms describing the degree to which outcomes are better than expected (positive RPEs) or worse (negative RPEs). An electrophysiological component known as feedback related negativity (FRN) occurs at frontocentral sites 240-340ms after feedback on whether a reward or punishment is obtained, and has been claimed to neurally encode an RPE. An outstanding question however, is whether the FRN is sensitive to the size of both positive RPEs and negative RPEs. Previous attempts to answer this question have examined the simple effects of RPE size for positive RPEs and negative RPEs separately. However, this methodology can be compromised by overlap from components coding for unsigned prediction error size, or """"salience"""", which are sensitive to the absolute size of a prediction error but not its valence. In our study, positive and negative RPEs were parametrically modulated using both reward likelihood and magnitude, with principal components analysis used to separate out overlying components. This revealed a single RPE encoding component responsive to the size of positive RPEs, peaking at ~330ms, and occupying the delta frequency band.

Our goal is to discover if a similar pattern of activation can be observed in 5-months-old infants, or whether the development of this cortical specialization results from extensive postnatal experience. Over two studies we used functional-Near-InfraRed-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to compare social touch (a human caress) to non-social touch (a caress performed with a spoon in study1 -n=22or with an electric toothbrush in study2 -n=17-). In study1 we found similar patterns of activation to the social and non-social stimulus. In study2 we report broad responses to the non-social stimulus, but, to our surprise, we found no activations to the human caress. In light of these results we conclude that it is possible that at this age discrimination between social and non-social touch in the posterior temporal lobe is still undergoing specialization.	acoustic lobing;partial template specialization	Laura Pirazzoli;Sarah Lloyd-Fox;Mark H.

It is found that the excitatory center of this smallest channel has a diameter of 1 min 22 s. The procedure is based on two factors: the maximum spatial frequency of 60 cycles/° for human visual sensitivity, and the assumption of equal (spatial bandwidth × spatial interval) product.	extrapolation;maxima and minima	D.

Comparisons across primate species show that both brain volume and gyrification (the degree of folding in the cerebral cortex) have progressively increased during primate evolution and there is a strong positive correlation between these two traits across primate species. The human brain is exceptional among primates in both total volume and gyrification, and therefore understanding the genetic mechanisms influencing variation in these traits will improve our understanding of a landmark feature of our species. Here we show that individual variation in gyrification is significantly heritable in both humans and an Old World monkey (baboons, Papio hamadryas). Furthermore, contrary to expectations based on the positive phenotypic correlation across species, the genetic correlation between cerebral volume and gyrification within both humans and baboons is estimated as negative. These results suggest that the positive relationship between cerebral volume and cortical folding across species cannot be explained by one set of selective pressures or genetic changes. Our data suggest that one set of selective pressures favored the progressive increase in brain volume documented in the primate fossil record, and that a second independent selective process, possibly related to parturition and neonatal brain size, may have favored brains with progressively greater cortical folding. Without a second separate selective pressure, natural selection favoring increased brain volume would be expected to produce less folded, more lissencephalic brains. These results provide initial evidence for the heritability of gyrification, and possibly a new perspective on the evolutionary mechanisms underlying long-term changes in the nonhuman primate and human brain.	brain implant;cerebral cortex;document completion status - documented;fossil;natural selection;neuroscience discipline;papio anubis;primates;trait;volume	Jeffrey Rogers;Peter V.

In a situation of sensorimotor learning and of adaptation to tool-use, we perform a computer simulation of a 4 degrees of freedom robot.

Babies develop early this feeling by perceiving the contingency between afferent (sensor) and efferent (motor) information. A comparator model is hypothesized to be associated with many brain regions to monitor and simulate the concordance between self-produced actions and their consequences. In this paper, we propose that the biological mechanism of spike timing-dependent plasticity, that synchronizes the neural dynamics almost everywhere in the central nervous system, constitutes the perfect algorithm to detect contingency in sensorimotor networks. The coherence or the dissonance in the sensorimotor information flow imparts then the agency level. In a head-neck-eyes robot, we replicate three developmental experiments illustrating how particular perceptual experiences can modulate the overall level of agency inside the system; i.e., (1) by adding a delay between proprioceptive and visual feedback information, (2) by facing a mirror, and (3) a person. We show that the system learns to discriminate animated objects (self-image and other persons) from other type of stimuli. This suggests a basic stage representing the self in relation to others from low-level sensorimotor processes. We discuss then the relevance of our findings with neurobiological evidences and development psychological observations for developmental robots.	algorithm;comparator;concordance (publishing);experiment;high- and low-level;neural networks;process (computing);relevance;robot;self-replicating machine;simulation;spiking neural network	Alex Pitti;Hiroki Mori;Shingo Kouzuma;Yasuo Kuniyoshi	2009	IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development	10.1109/TAMD.2009.2021506	psychology;biomimetics;sense of agency;homology modeling;neuroscience;information flow;visual perception;computer science;artificial intelligence;central nervous system;machine learning;spike-timing-dependent plasticity;communication;artificial neural network;biosensor;spiking neural network	Robotics	17.43228167165228	-75.05881019902432	71994

One application involves seeding MSCs in biomaterial scaffolds to promote osteogenesis in the repair of bone defects following implantation. However, predicting in vivo survival and differentiation of MSCs in biomaterials is challenging. Rapid and stable vascularization of scaffolds is required to supply nutrients and oxygen that MSCs need to survive as well as to go through osteogenic differentiation. The objective of this study is to develop an agent-based model and simulator that can be used to investigate the effects of using gradient growth factors on survival and differentiation of MSCs seeded in scaffolds. An agent-based model is developed to simulate the MSC behavior. The effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) on both survival and osteogenic differentiation is studied. Results showed that the survival ratio of MSCs can be enhanced by increasing VEGF concentration. BMP-2 caused a slight increase on survival ratio. Osteogenesis strongly depends on the VEGF concentration as well because of its effect on vascularization. BMP-2 increased the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.	adipocytes;agent-based model;biomaterials;body tissue;bone marrow diseases;bone scintigraphy;cell differentiation process;cell survival;chondrocyte;endothelial growth factors;gradient;growth factor;ion implantation;mesenchymal stem cells;microsoft cluster server;nutrients;osteocytes;oxygen;pathologic neovascularization;seeding;simulation;simulators;tissue engineering;video-in video-out;tissue regeneration	Elif S.

Clinical experience shows that abnormal or diseases of the respiratory system often occur at some bifurcated segments of the bronchial tree. Therefore, for better diagnosis and treatment of such diseases, it is necessary to investigate morphology structure of human bronchial tree and its internal airflow dynamics. In this paper, approaches for the modeling of bronchial tree are outlined based on the morphology structure data obtained from the two sources, i.e. anatomical experiments and CT/MRI. In addition, the simulation of airflow in bifurcating airways is summarized from the aspect of simulation methods and CFD. Finally, possible future research is suggested to develop: (1) a universal dynamic model of the airflow in the bronchial tree; and (2) a user-friendly software package for modeling and simulation.	simulation	Yijuan Di;Minrui Fei;Xin Sun;T.

In particular, the genesis of sharp waves and of some rhythmic activities, such as theta and gamma rhythms, of the hippocampal CA3 field, behaviorally important for their links to learning and memory, has been analyzed with more details. To this aim, the modeling-computational framework previously devised for the study of activities in large neural fields, has been enhanced in such a way that a greater number of biological features, extended dendritic trees–in particular, could be taken into account. By using that methodology, a twodimensional model of the entire CA3 field has been described and its activity, as it results from the several external inputs impinging on it, has been simulated. As a consequence of these investigations, some hypotheses have been elaborated about the possible function of global oscillatory activities of neural populations of Hippocampus in engram formation.	artificial neural network;attack tree;computation;genesis;population;sharp mz	Francesco Ventriglia	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-87559-8_36	kinetic theory;artificial intelligence;oscillation	ML	17.883560013191374	-70.63835147879517	72451

Two categories of spike activity are selected. The first category consists of high-amplitude, well defined spikes produced by the single leading cell of the system. The second category consists of spike activity well below the amplitude of the leading cell, but above the noise of the system. This category reflects the mass activity of neurons within the vicinity of the leading cell. Auto-correlation and cross-correlation are calculated between and within the two levels of spiking. Only nonredundant, statistically significant interspike intervals are selected for analysis. The intervals are then attributed to pairs of spikes in the original record in order to assemble a network of real neuronal interactions. Using this method, networks have been modeled from the following brain areas: the visual cortex of the cat, the nucleus raphe magnus of the rat, and the medial geniculate body of the rat		S.

Two different medical procedures are investigated in order to test the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm: a congestive heart failure and the unclamping of an aortic vessel.

It has yet to be seen whether object identity can be inferred from this activity. We present fMRI data measuring responses in human extrastriate cortex to a set of 12 distinct object images. We use a simple winner-take-all classifier, using half the data from each recording session as a training set, to evaluate encoding of object identity across fMRI voxels. Since this approach is sensitive to the inclusion of noisy voxels, we describe two methods for identifying subsets of voxels in the data which optimally distinguish object identity. One method characterizes the reliability of each voxel within subsets of the data, while another estimates the mutual information of each voxel with the stimulus set. We find that both metrics can identify subsets of the data which reliably encode object identity, even when noisy measurements are artificially added to the data. The mutual information metric is less efficient at this task, likely due to constraints in fMRI data.	distributed object;encode;mutual information;test set;voxel	Rory Sayres;David Ress;Kalanit Grill-Spector	2005			winner-take-all;computer vision;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;distributed object;mutual information;statistics	ML	17.897123382289166	-74.96461528230114	72770

Similarly, in human neuroimaging studies, aspects of emotion regulation have been associated with increased activity in dorsolateral, dorsomedial, orbital and ventromedial prefrontal regions, as well as concomitant decreases in amygdalar activity. These findings indicate the presence of two countervailing systems in the human brain that are reciprocally related: a dorsally-situated cognitive control network, and a ventrally-situated limbic network. We investigated the extent to which this functional reciprocity between limbic and dorsal neocortical regions is recapitulated from a purely structural standpoint. Specifically, we hypothesized that amygdalar volume would be related to cerebral cortical thickness in cortical regions implicated in aspects of emotion regulation. In 297 typically developing youths (162 females, 135 males; 572 MRIs), the relationship between cortical thickness and amygdalar volume was characterized. Amygdalar volume was found to be inversely associated with thickness in bilateral dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal, inferior parietal, as well as bilateral orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Our findings are in line with previous work demonstrating that a predominantly dorsally-centered neocortical network is reciprocally related to core limbic structures such as the amygdalae. Future research may benefit from investigating the extent to which such cortical-limbic morphometric relations are qualified by the presence of mood and anxiety psychopathology.	anxiety disorders;bilateral filter;cortical implant;molecular orbital;morphometrics;neuroimaging;psychopathology;rest;resting state fmri;situated;thickness (graph theory);youth	Matthew D.

These results challenge the conventional understanding of Hebb's rule and raise intriguing questions regarding the fundamental processes of cellular signaling. In this article, I review these new findings that lead to formulation of a new set of cellular rules. Emphasis is on evaluating potential molecular and cellular mechanisms that may underlie the spike-timing window of STDP and different patterns of heterosynaptic modifications. I also highlight several unresolved issues, and suggest future lines of research.	cell signaling;neuronal plasticity;rule (guideline);rule 90;sensitivity and specificity;synaptic package manager;the spike (1997);window function	Guo-Qiang Bi	2002	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-002-0349-7	psychology;synaptic plasticity;homosynaptic plasticity;neuroscience;developmental psychology;metaplasticity;communication;synaptic scaling	ML	18.281602880966368	-72.76380342567883	73053

Nevertheless, our understanding of their underlying catecholamine mechanisms, particularly regarding dopamine, is limited. Here, we used the dopamine D2 agonist cabergoline to study its ability to improve inhibitory control and modulate awareness of performance errors. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design with a single dose of cabergoline (1.25 mg) and placebo (dextrose) was employed in 25 healthy participants. They each performed the stop-signal task, a well-validated measure of action cancellation, and the Error Awareness Task, a go/no-go measure of action restraint and error awareness, under each drug condition. Cabergoline was able to selectively reduce stop-signal RT, compared with placebo, indicative of enhanced action cancellation (p < .05). This enhancement occurred without concomitant changes in overall response speed or RT variability and was not seen for errors of commission on the Error Awareness Task. Awareness of performance errors on the go/no-go task was, however, significantly improved by cabergoline compared with placebo (p < .05). Our results contribute to growing evidence for the dopaminergic control of distinct aspects of human executive ability, namely, action cancellation and error awareness. The findings may aid the development of new, or the repurposing of existing, pharmacotherapy that targets the cognitive dysfunction of psychiatric and neurological disorders. They also provide further evidence that specific cognitive paradigms have correspondingly specific neurochemical bases.	action potential;base;blood coagulation disorders;catecholamines;cognition disorders;disease;dopamine d2 receptor;dopamine hydrochloride;g-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway involved in defense response to gram-negative bacterium;glucose;heart rate variability;impaired cognition;inhibitory nerve control;mental disorders;modulation;physical restraint equipment (device);programming paradigm;randomized algorithm;relevance;usb on-the-go;cabergoline;nervous system disorder	L.

59b107e76f1b9ca3cbeba465570ae570cecf13af	importance of the window function choice for the predictive modelling of memristors		Window functions are widely employed in memristor models to restrict the changes of the internal state variables to specified intervals. Here we show that the actual choice of window function is of significant importance for the predictive modelling of memristors. Using a recently formulated theory of memristor attractors, we demonstrate that whether attractor points exist depends on the type of window function used in the model. Our main findings are formulated in terms of two memristor attractor theorems, which apply to broad classes of memristor models. As an example of our findings, we predict the existence of attractor states in Biolek window function memristors and their absence in memristors described by the Joglekar window function, when such memristors are driven by periodic alternating polarity pulses. It is anticipated that the results of this study will contribute toward the development of more sophisticated models of memristive devices and systems.	memristor;predictive modelling;window function	V.

For example, given AB (“if A then B”), people frequently but fallaciously infer the inverse, BA. This mode of inference, called symmetry, is logically invalid because, although it may be true, it is not necessarily true. Given pairs of conditional relations, such as AB and BC, humans reflexively perform two additional modes of inference: transitivity, whereby one (validly) infers AC; and equivalence, whereby one (invalidly) infers CA. In sharp contrast, nonhuman animals can handle transitivity but can rarely be made to acquire symmetry or equivalence. In the present study, human subjects performed logical and illogical inferences about the relations between abstract, visually presented figures while their brain activation was monitored with fMRI. The prefrontal, medial frontal, and intraparietal cortices were activated during all modes of inference. Additional activation in the precuneus and posterior parietal cortex was observed during transitivity and equivalence, which may reflect the need to retrieve the intermediate stimulus (B) from memory. Surprisingly, the patterns of brain activation in illogical and logical inference were very similar. We conclude that the observed inference-related fronto-parietal network is adapted for processing categorical, but not logical, structures of association among stimuli. Humans might prefer categorization over the memorization of logical structures in order to minimize the cognitive working memory load when processing large volumes of information.	business architecture;categorization;cognition disorders;consciousness;hippocampus (brain);humans;inferential programming;medial graph;memory disorders;parietal lobe;structure of precuneus;turing completeness;type inference;vertex-transitive graph;fmri	Akitoshi Ogawa;Yumiko Yamazaki;Kenichi Ueno;Kang Cheng;Atsushi Iriki	2010	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2009.21330	psychology;cognitive psychology;cognitive bias;logical reasoning;neuroscience;developmental psychology;biological classification;bias;working memory;short-term memory;memorization;posterior parietal cortex;communication;social psychology	AI	16.279309242259266	-75.24211529671103	73416

Such feedback often follows when the movement is already over. We investigated the time-course of post-movement cortical motor processing by high-resolution analysis of lateralized post-movement potentials in forewarned and simple reaction time tasks. In both paradigms we could separate a post-movement component (motor postimperative negative variation-mPINV) peaking about 500 ms after the button press (confirmed by electromyogram and accelerometer). mPINV could not be sufficiently explained by motor cortex activity related to EMG output and/or by sensory feedback. mPINV was enhanced by long intertrial intervals and its lateralization changed with response movement side. Its scalp potential distribution resembled (pre-)motor cortex activity during preceding movement stages and differed from the frontal motor potential peak (proprioceptive and somatosensory reafferent feedback); suggesting post-movement activation of pre-/primary motor cortex. Dipole source analysis yielded a single radial source near premotor cortex which explained lateralized mPINV almost completely. mPINV was present in simple reaction time tasks, indicating that mPINV is an independent component and does not represent delayed resolution of pre-movement negativity. An equivalent of """"classical"""" PINV (cPINV) occurred later over prefrontal and anterior temporal sites in simple and forewarned reaction time tasks.

Based on stimulation protocols of two synaptically connected neurons, we infer an algorithm which explains the data by modifying the probability of neurotransmitter discharge as a function of the preand postsynaptic spike delays. The characteristics of this algorithm is its asymmetry with respect to the delays: if the postsynaptic spike arrives after the presynaptic spike, the probability of discharge is up-regulated while it is down-regulated if the postsynaptic spike arrives before the presynaptic spike. The algorithm allows to predict stimulation protocols which induce maximal upand down-regulation of the discharge probability.	action potential;algorithm;discharger;maximal set;synapse;synaptic package manager	Walter Senn;Misha Tsodyks;Henry Markram	1997		10.1007/BFb0020143	artificial intelligence;neurophysiology;action potential;artificial neural network;neurotransmission	ML	20.42694106107962	-70.95909314835032	73622

In addition to the simulation of the models which helps to anticipate cognitive processes, embodiment of these models is essential. Such embodiment would provide the setting to explain neural functioning ongoing in real environments under oncoming sensory information besides giving opportunity of implementation of intelligent systems. Even studies pursued in neuroscience seem far from achieving all these aims in intelligent systems, the pre-results using cognitive models are faster than animal experiments in leading further the understanding of cognitive processes and designing related experiments. In this study, a computational model of basal ganglia, thalamus and cortex for action selection is extended with the point neuron approach to obtain a more realistic method to investigate the model in real time task on humanoid robot platform, Darwin-Op. The spiking neural network model of cortex consists of channels for each action to be elected and plastic alI-to-alI connections from the sensory stimuli to the basal ganglia structures which are modulated with reward. In the task, the sensory inputs, namely colors, are presented to the humanoid robot and it is expected that these sensory inputs would be associated with the predefined actions by modulating the connections. Furthermore, the rearrangement of these associations with reward is performed after learning is accomplished. In this way, the embodiment of computational-model provided more information on the evolution of connections through reward based learning in the action selection circuit.	action selection;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;basal (phylogenetics);block truncation coding;cognitive model;color;computation;computational model;darwin;dynamical system;experiment;ganglia;humanoid robot;job control (unix);modulation;network model;neuron;real-time computing;simulation;spiking neural network	Emec Ercelik;Neslihan Serap Sengör	2015	2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280750	artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	19.106493406396424	-67.57444883819059	73650

Thus understanding neuronal geometry is clearly important for determining connectivity within the network and how this shapes neuronal function. One of the difficulties in uncovering relationships between neuronal shape and its function is the problem of quantifying complex neuronal geometry. Even by using multiple measures such as: dendritic length, distribution of segments, direction of branches, etc, a description of three dimensional neuronal embedding remains incomplete. To help alleviate this problem, here we propose a new measure, a shape diffusiveness index (SDI), to quantify spatial relations between branches at the local and global scale.

By measuring """"how easy"""" it is to reproduce the analyzed shape by using the DLA algorithm it can be measured how """"diffusive"""" is that shape.

Compared with chemical synapses, electrical synapses are more efficient in modulating the concerted activity of neurons. Based on the experimental data, we propose a phenomenological model for short-term facilitation of electrical synapses. The model satisfactorily reproduces the phenomenon that the neuronal correlation increases although the neuronal firing rates attenuate during the luminance adaptation. We explore how the stimulus information is encoded in parallel by firing rates and correlated activity of neurons, and find that dynamical electrical synapses mediate a transition from the firing rate code to the correlation one during the luminance adaptation. The latter encodes the stimulus information by using the concerted, but lower neuronal firing rate, and hence is economically more efficient.	acclimatization;action potential;chemical synapse;cognitive information processing;dynamical system;electrical synapses;neural coding;phenomenological model;facilitation	Lei Xiao;Danke Zhang;Yuanqing Li;Pei-Ji Liang;Si Wu	2013		10.3389/fncom.2013.00036	neuroscience;information processing;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;dynamical system;machine learning;communication;adaptation	ML	18.855775158689507	-70.96044167930383	73981
c4c022b59237e5ec68b4d25b74fa2cb3c6826cae	time and space in neuronal networks - the effects of spatial organisation on network behaviour		Complex networks in nature are often characterised by nontrivial spatial organisation. In such networks, the topology and spatial organisation are often tightly coupled to the activity on the network. In particular, spatial topologies frequently influence time delays through the network. In many real world networks, from transport systems to brains, increased distance (or wiring length) increases time delays in physical or information flow. Here we investigate this role of space on neural network dynamics. Time delays are well recognised to influence dynamics in neural networks. It would not be surprising, therefore, if neural networks exploited spatial organisation to tune their time delays and obtain desired patterns of activity. However when we model such networks, either to study or to apply their properties to engineering problems, it is important to distinguish between two cases: either the effects of spatial organisation in the network are merely temporal, in which case the complex and computationally expensive spatial organisation can be succinctly abstracted out, or — more interestingly — spatial organisation may lead to behaviour that cannot be captured solely by temporal effects. We investigated this question in biologically constrained spiking neural networks operating close to a critical bifurcation between stationary behaviour and population-wide oscillatory behaviour. In particular, we used a network of leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons and conductance based synapses with alpha-function kernels, operating in the so-called balanced regime, where each neuron receives similar excitatory and inhibitory drive. Specifically, we compare the transition from stationary to oscillatory network behaviour as a function of spatial organisation. The two modes of behaviour are found in biological neuronal networks and are important for qualitatively different information coding schemes (e.g. rate coding in the stationary regime and phase or temporal coding in the oscillatory regime). First, we demonstrate that time delays play an important role in this type of network. We found that the region of parameter space for which stationary behaviour is found increases with shorter time delays. We compared this performance to that of an otherwise identical network but with explicit spatial organisation. In our networks, spatial organisation was implemented by clustering inhibitory cells in the midst of a homogeneous population of excitatory cells, in keeping with dendritic length scales of inhibitory cells in some cortical areas. In addition to introducing a spatial patterning, the central clustering of inhibitory cells also reduces the mean inhibitory-to-excitatory time delays in the network. Thus, a purely temporal effect of clustering would yield similar results to shortening the time delays in the system. In fact, with this spatial network model we found a robust reversal of the network behaviour compared to that of the non-spatial network: the shorter the time delays, the more oscillatory the network becomes. This counter-intuitive result may suggest that the gradient in time delays imposed by spatial organisation may dominate the effect of reducing mean time delays in these networks. In fact, the role of space could be further enhanced (or suppressed) by introducing spatially graded connection probabilities (e.g. with closer cells more likely to be connected). In conclusion, we have described a novel spatial effect. While the spatial organisation described is plausible, it and the corresponding effect on network dynamics would be interesting predictions to test in cortical networks.	analysis of algorithms;artificial neural network;bifurcation theory;biological neuron model;cluster analysis;complex system;conductance (graph);gradient;network model;neural coding;propagation delay;spatial network;spatial reference system;spiking neural network;stationary process;wiring	Stephen P.

The method consists of identifying regions in parameter space that lead to the same neural response, and it is also applicable to other stimulus domains. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

941dc781f6b181654961fcaa1c319225dc6564a7	a nirs–fmri study of resting state network	resting state network;simultaneous nirs fmri recording;resting state;spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuation;functional connectivity;default mode network	Resting state functional connectivity, which is defined as temporal correlation of spontaneous activity between diverse brain regions, has been reported to form resting state networks (RSNs), consisting of a specific set of brain regions, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Recently, studies using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) reported that NIRS signals also show temporal correlation between different brain regions. The local relationship between NIRS and fMRI signals has been examined by simultaneously recording these signals when participants perform tasks or respond to stimuli. However, the NIRS-fMRI signal relationship during the resting state has been reported only between NIRS signals obtained within limited regions and whole brain fMRI signals. Therefore, it remains unclear whether NIRS signals obtained at diverse regions correlate with regional fMRI signals close to the NIRS measurement channels, especially in relation to the RSNs. In this study, we tested whether the signals measured by these different modalities during the resting state have the consistent characteristics of the RSNs. Specifically, NIRS signals during the resting state were acquired over the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices while whole brain fMRI data was simultaneously recorded. First, by projecting the NIRS channel positions over the cerebral cortical surface, we identified the most likely anatomical locations of all NIRS channels used in the study. Next, to investigate the regional signal relationship between NIRS and fMRI, we calculated the cross-correlation between NIRS signals and fMRI signals in the brain regions adjacent to each NIRS channel. For each NIRS channel, we observed the local maxima of correlation coefficients between NIRS and fMRI signals within a radius of 2 voxels from the projection point. Furthermore, we also found that highly correlated voxels with the NIRS signal were mainly localized within brain tissues for all NIRS channels, with the exception of 2 frontal channels. Finally, by calculating the correlation between NIRS signals at a channel and whole brain fMRI signals, we observed that NIRS signals correlate with fMRI signals not only within brain regions adjacent to NIRS channels but also within distant brain regions constituting RSNs, such as the dorsal attention, fronto-parietal control, and default mode networks. These results support the idea that NIRS signals obtained at several cortical regions during the resting state mainly reflect regional spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations that originate from spontaneous cortical activity, and include information that characterizes the RSNs. Because NIRS is relatively easy to use and a less physically demanding neuroimaging technique, our findings should facilitate a broad application of this technique to examine RSNs, especially for clinical populations and conditions unsuitable for fMRI.	coefficient;cross-correlation;default;hemodynamics;magnetic resonance imaging;maxima and minima;neural oscillation;neuroimaging;population;rest;resting potentials;resting state fmri;signal processing;spectroscopy, near-infrared;spontaneous order;voxel	Shuntaro Sasai;Fumitaka Homae;Hama Watanabe;Akihiro T.

4cc115c9e5c99e0c6aca1a08ebc46deece482dea	an architecture of self-organizing map for temporal signal processing and its application to a braille recognition task	feedback loop;signal processing	A self-organizing map (SOM) performs a mapping of an object preserving its topological relations between input and output spaces, and also can be seen as a coordinate transformer that preserves adjacency relations. Since the standard SOM cannot deal with temporal data intrinsically, in this paper we provide new feedback pathways around the competitive layer to refer to context information of the past history. An extra output layer is added next to the competitive layer to represent secondary candidates and a quantitative measure of confidence. From the viewpoint of its structural similarities, we refer to this architecture as an Elman-type feedback SOM. In order to clarify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we then adopt a temporal signal processing task of Braille recognition. Braille is a character set for visually impaired people made up of 6 dots on a 3 by 2 grid. When Braille is read by running the fingertip over the characters, the vertical axis can be seen as providing spatial information and the horizontal axis as providing temporal information. As a result of computer simulations with partially common four city names, we confirm that the proposed model can recognize them appropriately. In addition, we find that this approach is robust to both the temporal elasticity and spatial displacement. Moreover, when we conduct an analysis with the neuro-bar model, we find that the Braille recognition task is executed based on a series of state transition along a type of pathway that has been developed during training. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An eye tracking experiment consists of displaying different images with social stimuli (containing human faces) to the child and the eye tracker captured and tracked the child's eye gaze movements, then analyzed to identify where specifically in the stimulus is the child looking at. The finding indicates a significant difference was found between the two groups viewing patterns and behavior when were presented with a scene included material with human and social interaction content. The study also reveals that large percentage of Autistic participants expressed minimum interest and time looking at face area, evident by significant time spent fixations on non-face regions, linking to lack of interest in socially relevant information, especially the two small Areas of Interests (AOIs) eyes and mouth regions comparing to the normal developing children. The results can be used to improve the life style of other children who have a risk to develop Autism as well as discover earlier signs of ASD.

When the latter condition is violated, a formal application of the phase return map may yield phase values outside of its definition domain; in particular, strong synaptic inhibition may result in negative values of phase. The effect of a second perturbation arriving close to the first one is undetermined in this case. However, here we show that for a Morris–Lecar model of a spiking cell with strong time scale separation, extending the phase response function definition domain to an additional negative value branch allows to retain the accuracy of the phase response approach in the face of such strong inhibitory coupling. We use the resulting extended phase response function to accurately describe the response of a Morris–Lecar oscillator to consecutive non-weak synaptic inputs. This method is particularly useful when analyzing the dynamics of three or more non-weakly coupled cells, whereby more than one synaptic perturbation arrives per oscillation cycle into each cell. The method of perturbation prediction based on the negative-phase extension of the phase response function may be applicable to other excitable cell models characterized by slow voltage dynamics at hyperpolarized potentials.	excitable medium;frequency response;greater than;limit cycle;morris–lecar model;oscillator device component;perturbation function;phase response;poincaré plot;spiking neural network;synaptic package manager	Myongkeun Oh;Victor Matveev	2010	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-010-0292-x	psychology;phase response curve;neuroscience;artificial intelligence;control theory;mathematics;limit cycle;oscillation;physics	ML	17.4939931279717	-70.95143644074989	74689

The neural mechanism underlying this apparent motion (AM) is thought to be increased activation of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons tuned to locations along the AM path, although evidence remains inconclusive. AM masking, which refers to the reduced detectability of stimuli along the AM path, has been taken as evidence for AM-related V1 activation. AM-induced neural responses are thought to interfere with responses to physical stimuli along the path and as such impair the perception of these stimuli. However, AM masking can also be explained by predictive coding models, predicting that responses to stimuli presented on the AM path are suppressed when they match the spatio-temporal prediction of a stimulus moving along the path. In the present study, we find that AM has a distinct effect on the detection of target gratings, limiting the maximum performance at high contrast levels. This masking is strongest when the target orientation is identical to the orientation of the inducers. We developed a V1-like population code model of early visual processing, based on a standard contrast normalization model. We find that AM-related activation in early visual cortex is too small to either cause masking or to be perceived as motion. Our model instead predicts strong suppression of early sensory responses during AM, consistent with the theoretical framework of predictive coding.	am broadcasting;cerebral cortex;cumulative trauma disorders;neural coding;neural oscillation;unsharp masking;zero suppression	Nathalie Van Humbeeck;Tom Putzeys;Johan Wagemans	2016		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005155	vision;computer vision;psychophysics;eye movement	ML	16.477993106628745	-75.39677865348813	74705

666b255a003fc7a969afb526d55b45cb32162e92	encoding of predictable and unpredictable stimuli by inferior temporal cortical neurons		Animals and humans learn statistical regularities that are embedded in sequences of stimuli. The neural mechanisms of such statistical learning are still poorly understood. Previous work in macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex demonstrated suppressed spiking activity to visual images of a sequence in which the stimulus order was defined by transitional probabilities (labeled as “standard” sequence), compared with a sequence in which the stimulus order was random (“random” sequence). Here, we asked whether IT neurons encode the images of the standard sequence more accurately compared with images of the random sequence. Previous human fMRI studies in different sensory modalities also found a suppressed response to expected relative to unexpected stimuli but obtained various results regarding the effect of expectation on encoding, with one study reporting an improved classification accuracy of expected stimuli despite the reduced activation level. We employed a linear classifier to decode image identity from the spiking responses of the recorded IT neurons. We found a greater decoding accuracy for images of the standard compared with the random sequence during the early part of the stimulus presentation, but further analyses suggested that this reflected the sustained, stimulus-selective activity from the previous stimulus of the sequence, which is typical for IT neurons. However, the peak decoding accuracy was lower for the standard compared with the random sequence, in line with the reduced response to the former compared with the latter images. These data suggest that macaque IT neurons represent less accurately predictable compared with unpredictable images.	action potential;encode;embedded system;embedding;epilepsy, temporal lobe;linear classifier;macaca;machine learning;neuron;probability;tracer;fmri	Susheel Kumar;Péter Kaposvári;Rufin Vogels	2017	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_01135	psychology;communication	ML	17.713613656767	-74.96888388974462	74972

Subjects grasped a weighted flexible ruler and balanced it in an unstable equilibrium position as an archetype of grasping an object with complex dynamics. This was contrasted with squeezing a soft foam ball as an archetype of grasping an object with simple dynamics. We hypothesized that changes in activity in primary motor cortex (MI) would be similar under the two conditions, since muscle activation was matched, which was confirmed. We hypothesized further that the cerebellum would be selectively activated when manipulating the flexible ruler because the ability to make the adjustments necessary to balance the ruler would require an internal dynamics model, represented in the cerebellum. As predicted, the ipsilateral cerebellum was strongly activated when balancing the weighted ruler whereas only moderate activation was found when squeezing the foam ball. We also found evidence for selective activation of areas, previously implicated in tactile object recognition, when holding the flexible ruler. We speculate that these areas, which include secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), Brodmann area 40 and insula, integrate tactile and proprioceptive information in the context of controlling the orientation of the flexible ruler and provide appropriate feedback to MI. We speculate that the failure to find activation of these areas when squeezing the ball was due to the fact that tactile stimulation was entirely self-produced, resulting in the attenuation of cortical sensory activity (Blakemore, S.-J., Wolpert, D.M., Frith, C.D., 1998. Central cancellation of self-produced tickle sensation. Nat. Neurosci. 1, 635-640, Blakemore, S.-J., Frith, C.D., Wolpert, D.M., 2001.

Angry and fearful faces represent qualitatively different forms of threat. Fearful faces are thought to signal the presence of a significant, yet undetermined source of danger within the environment, referred to as 'ambiguous threat'. In contrast, angry faces represent a more direct form of threat, often used in face-to-face encounters to exert dominance. Given the inherent differences between anger and fear, we hypothesised that anxiety would modulate the amygdala response to angry faces to a greater extent when attended. Following previous research, we expected anxiety to show a stronger relationship with the amygdala response to unattended fearful faces. In an event-related fMRI study, we presented images of two houses and two faces (consisting of fearful, angry or neutral expressions) in horizontal and vertical pairs around a central fixation cross, with participants instructed to attend to either the face or house stimuli. The results showed that higher anxiety levels produced an increased right amygdala response to viewer directed angry facial expressions (versus neutral or fearful faces) only when attended. By contrast, increased anxiety was associated with a greater left amygdala response to fearful faces (versus neutral or angry faces) in the unattended condition, with only borderline evidence for attended fear (relative to neutral). Our findings demonstrate the striking effects of personality in a non-clinical population, and show how this can distinguish the neural coding of anger and fear faces.	amygdaloid structure;anxiety disorders;face;fear (mental process);modulation;neural coding;threat (computer);fmri;physical hard work	Michael P.

In contrast, the mammalian visual system performs this task virtually effortlessly. How can we exploit our knowledge on the biological system to improve artificial systems? Our understanding of the mammalian early visual system has been augmented by the discovery that general coding principles could explain many aspects of neuronal response properties. How can such schemes be transferred to system level performance? In the present study we train cells on a particular variant of the general principle of temporal coherence, the “stability” objective. These cells are trained on unlabeled real-world images without a teaching signal. We show that after training, the cells form a representation that is largely independent of the viewpoint from which the stimulus is looked at. This finding includes generalization to previously unseen viewpoints. The achieved representation is better suited for view-point invariant object classification than the cells’ input patterns. This property to facilitate view-point invariant classification is maintained even if training and classification take place in the presence of an – also unlabeled – distractor object. In summary, here we show that unsupervised learning using a general coding principle facilitates the classification of real-world objects, that are not segmented from the background and undergo complex, non-isomorphic, transformations.	artificial intelligence;biological system;coherence (physics);computer performance;generalization (psychology);machine vision;mammals;occur (action);outline of object recognition;published comment;unsupervised learning;cell transformation	Wolfgang Einhäuser;Jörg F.

Evidence for that view comes from fMRI studies that have reported differential BOLD contrast in dorsal visual stream regions when participants view manipulable objects compared with a range of baseline categories. An alternative interpretation is that processes internal to the ventral visual pathway are sufficient to support the visual identification of manipulable objects and that the retrieval of object-associated use information is contingent on analysis of the visual input by the ventral stream. Here, we sought to distinguish these two perspectives by exploiting the fact that the dorsal stream is largely driven by magnocellular input, which is biased toward low spatial frequency visual information. Thus, any tool-selective responses in parietal cortex that are driven by high spatial frequencies would be indicative of inputs from the ventral visual pathway. Participants viewed images of tools and animals containing only low, or only high, spatial frequencies during fMRI. We find an internal parcellation of left parietal “tool-preferring” voxels: Inferior aspects of left parietal cortex are driven by high spatial frequency information and have privileged connectivity with ventral stream regions that show similar category preferences, whereas superior regions are driven by low spatial frequency information. Our findings suggest that the automatic activation of complex object-associated manipulation knowledge is contingent on analysis of the visual input by the ventral visual pathway.	baseline (configuration management);categories;contingency (philosophy);gene regulatory network;interaction;parietal lobe;physical object;simulation;spatial frequency;visual pathways;voxel;fmri	Bradford Z.

Our study sought to compare how these two factors foster the spread of activation within the semantic network. In a lexical decision task, prime words were varied depending on the valence (pleasant or unpleasant) or on the level of emotional arousal (high or low). Target words were carefully selected to avoid semantic priming effects, as well as to avoid arousing specific emotions (neutral). Three SOA durations (220, 420 and 720 ms) were applied across three independent groups. Results indicate that at 220 ms, the effect of arousal is significantly higher than the effect of valence in facilitating spreading activation while at 420 ms, the effect of valence is significantly higher than the effect of arousal in facilitating spreading activation. These findings suggest that affect is a sequential process involving the successive intervention of arousal and valence.	arousal;emotions;priming exercise;semantic network;spreading activation;wakefulness	Sandra Jhean-Larose;Nicolas Leveau;Guy Denhière	2014	Cognitive Processing	10.1007/s10339-014-0613-5	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;cognition;emotion;analysis of variance;memory;communication;social psychology;cognitive science	HCI	14.854768269443207	-78.0826631163497	75463

However, as the images are analysed in a common voxel-based framework, it is possible to directly assess the spatial relationships of abnormalities detected by each technique. We utilize this approach in well-characterized patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). TLE is associated with potentially widespread volume and T2 signal abnormalities in MRI images but the relationship between these two aspects of tissue abnormality is not well understood. Here we use a novel approach of combined univariate and multivariate voxel-wise analysis to investigate the spatial relationship of these abnormalities. We studied 19 TLE patients and compared them to 115 control subjects. Grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume changes were assessed with voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and changes in T2 relaxation times were evaluated with voxel-based relaxometry (VBR). The volume and T2 changes obtained using the combined univariate approach were found in an extensive area, prominently in the ipsilateral hippocampus and amygdala (overlap of GM-VBM and VBR), and in the remaining temporal lobe (overlap of WM-VBR and VBR). Other cortical and subcortical areas showed isolated volume or T2 changes. The multivariate analysis based on the Hotelling T(2) statistic, indicated a similar pattern of distributed changes across the brain but with a greater degree of statistical significance in certain areas. The composite analyses appear to identify a network of affected areas not as easily appreciated by the individual analysis of volume or T2 changes.	acoustic lobing;amygdaloid structure;congenital abnormality;epilepsy;epilepsy, temporal lobe;gray matter;hippocampal sclerosis;hippocampus (brain);linear programming relaxation;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;p-value;patients;sarcoma;volume boot record;voxel;white matter	Gaby S.

3fca45b59874aafa1084ce629c02b57c725f1ef5	perception and recognition of faces - human capacities of possible relevance for artificial systems		Faces are one of the most frequently looked at objects in our environment. Our eyes scan faces for myriad reasons, to assess identity, health, moods, intentions, imminent actions, to name a few. As such, it should not be surprising that face processing is a well developed function in the human brain with the likelihood of dedicated hardware. We take as a working hypothesis that the processing of faces is unique, that it is qualitatively different from the processing of other objects. We have examined this idea using a variety of methods, including fMRI, magnetoencephalography as well testing visual capacities using psychological and psychophysical methods. We have concentrated on two different groups, normal observers and those suffering from prosopagnosia. This latter group is of great interest because of their selective deficiency in face recognition. We document this by showing that these individuals are very poor at remembering faces but that they can recognize other objects normally. A fraction of these individuals show abnormal neural responses to faces. We also show that in normal observers, the human face recognition system is selectively sensitive to small facial features, approximately on a scale of 0.5 centimeters on the face, that the processing of upright faces is holistic whereas upside down faces and all other objects are encoded in a piecemeal fashion. These findings reinforce the idea that the recognition of faces is qualitatively different from that of objects. We also show that face recognition is not easily degraded by affine image transformations, suggesting that for purposes of recognition, faces can be regarded as flat two dimensional objects.	angular defect;face (geometry);facial recognition system;holism;magnetoencephalography;prosopagnosia;relevance	Ken Nakayama	2004			artificial intelligence;computer vision;computer science;perception	Vision	14.830134537507089	-75.91710955035914	75600

Mathematical models have been widely used to investigate the effects of K+ channels on cardiac functions. However, the model of K+ channel involves parametric uncertainties, which can be induced by fitting the model's parameters that best capture experimental data. Since the prediction of cardiac functions are highly parameter-dependent, it is critical to quantify the influence of parametric uncertainty on the model responses to provide the more reliable predictions. This paper presents a new method to efficiently propagate the uncertainty on the model's parameters of K+ channel to the gating variables as well as the current density. In this way, we can estimate the model predictions and their corresponding confidence intervals simultaneously. A generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion approximating the parametric uncertainty is used in combination with the physical models to quantify and propagate the parametric uncertainties onto the modeled predictions of steady state activation and steady state inactivation of the K+ channel. Using Galerkin projection, the variation (i.e., confidence interval) of the gating variables resulting from the uncertainty of model parameters can then be estimated in a computationally efficient fashion. As compared with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, the proposed methodology shows it's advantageous in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, thus demonstrating the potential for dealing with more complicated cardiac models.	algorithmic efficiency;approximation algorithm;channel (communications);chaos <amoebidae>;computation;confidence intervals;epilepsy, generalized;galerkin method;mathematical model;monte carlo method;muscle cells;polynomial;population parameter;potassium;simulation;software propagation;steady state;ventricular fibrillation	Yuncheng Du;Dongping Du	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591993	stochastic process;data modeling;econometrics;mathematical optimization;uncertainty;computer science;mathematical model;mathematics;predictive modelling;computational model;statistics;ion	Robotics	10.39517288349687	-69.00472741868379	75733

Participants viewed videos of their interaction history and judged their emotions at theoretically relevant points in the problem solving session (after new problem is displayed, in the midst of problem solving, after feedback is received). We explore excitatory and inhibitory relationships between the affective states and problem solving outcomes (i.e. success or failure, and associated positive or negative feedback). We isolate affective states that are consequences of outcomes and associated feedback as well as affective states that are antecedents of positive or negative outcomes. Follow-up analyses focused on cyclical patterns that incorporate complex relationships between the affective states and problem solving outcomes.

Unlike reports that capture plasticity across days or weeks, this articles studies long-term plasticity in functional connectivity that occurs over years of professional task practice. Optical neuroimaging data are acquired from professional surgeons of varying experience on a complex bimanual coordination task with the aim of investigating learning-related disparity in frontal lobe functional connectivity that arises as a consequence of motor skill level. The results suggest that prefrontal and premotor seed connectivity is more critical during naïve versus expert performance. Given learning-related differences in connectivity, a least-squares support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel is employed to evaluate skill level using connectivity data. The results demonstrate discrimination of operator skill level with accuracy ≥0.82 and Multiclass Matthew's Correlation Coefficient ≥0.70. Furthermore, these indices are improved when local (i.e., within-region) rather than inter-regional (i.e., between-region) frontal connectivity is considered (p = 0.002). The results suggest that it is possible to classify operator skill level with good accuracy from functional connectivity data, upon which objective assessment and neurofeedback may be used to improve operator performance during technical skill training.

Studies with young adults generally show that bilingualism is associated with a strengthening of white matter, but there is conflicting evidence for how bilingualism affects white matter in older age. Given that bilingualism has been shown to help stave off the symptoms of dementia by up to four years, it is crucial that we clarify the mechanism underlying this reserve. The current study uses diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to compare monolinguals and bilinguals while carefully controlling for potential confounds (e.g., I.Q., MMSE, and demographic variables). We show that group differences in Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Radial Diffusivity (RD) arise from multivariable interactions not adequately controlled for by sequential bivariate testing. After matching and statistically controlling for confounds, bilinguals still had greater axial diffusivity (AD) in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus than monolingual peers, supporting a neural reserve account for healthy older bilinguals.	bivariate data;ct scan;cognitive reserve;conflict (psychology);dementia;diffusion tensor imaging;fascicle - nerve fibers;fractional anisotropy;interaction;onset (audio);radial basis function;ruby document format;white matter;young adult	John A.

05a556020509750844bdb454f672d76a45633570	an analytical study of prostate-specific antigen dynamics		The purpose of this research is to carry out a quantitative study of prostate-specific antigen dynamics for patients with prostatic diseases, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and localized prostate cancer (LPC). The proposed PSA mathematical model was implemented using clinical data of 218 Japanese patients with histological proven BPH and 147 Japanese patients with LPC (stages T2a and T2b). For prostatic diseases (BPH and LPC) a nonlinear equation was obtained and solved in a close form to predict PSA progression with patients' age. The general solution describes PSA dynamics for patients with both diseases LPC and BPH. Particular solutions allow studying PSA dynamics for patients with BPH or LPC. Analytical solutions have been obtained and solved in a close form to develop nomograms for a better understanding of PSA dynamics in patients with BPH and LPC. This study may be useful to improve the diagnostic and prognosis of prostatic diseases.	benign prostatic hyperplasia;color gradient;forecast of outcome;mathematical model;mathematics;nomogram;nomograms;nonlinear system;pcsk7 gene;patients;polar surface area;prostate;prostatic diseases;prostatic neoplasms;scientific publication;solutions;interest;pediatric intracranial germ cell brain tumor	Ernesto P.

The structural topology of the grains, or fabric, can be usefully represented as a complex (contact) network whereby network nodes correspond to individual grains and network links correspond to grain contacts. Properties of each node (e.g, degree) can be calculated and throughout deformation this results in time series akin to sensor measurements for each grain in the assembly. These signals can be processed and collated into a particle property network with a corresponding community structure summarizing the relationship between each signal. Different properties give rise to different networks each with their own community structures, i.e, each network possesses the same set of nodes but a different link structure. The overlapping structure of these property network communities is of interest. We describe how the overlapping communities within networks constructed from properties related to grain behaviour with respect to multiscale cyclic structures is consistent with a power law description. Furthermore this behaviour is exhibited across a suite of computer simulations of compression tests which hints at possible universal features in the mechanical response of granular materials.	computer simulation;image scaling;predictive modelling;sensor;time series	David M.

While conventional magnetic resonance imaging underestimates the extent of pathology following closed head injury, diffusion-weighted imaging has been shown to more accurately delineate the extent of cerebral damage. There have only been a few case studies of DTI in chronic head injury survivors. This study used DTI to investigate changes in anisotropy and diffusivity in survivors of head injury at least 6 months after their injury. The relationship between cognition and diffusion abnormality was also investigated. The voxel-based analysis revealed significant bilateral decreases in anisotropy, in major white matter tracts and association fibers in the temporal, frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. Statistically significant increases in diffusivity were also found in widespread areas of the cortex. A significant positive correlation was found between diffusivity and impairment of learning and memory in the left posterior cingulate, left hippocampal formation and left temporal, frontal and occipital cortex. The common pattern of abnormality despite heterogeneous injury mechanism and lesion location in the group suggests that these cellular changes reflect secondary insults. The importance of diffusion abnormalities in head injury outcome is emphasized by the significant correlation between a learning and memory index and diffusivity in areas known to subserve this cognitive function.	anisotropy;bilateral filter;brain injuries;closed head injuries;cognition disorders;congenital abnormality;craniocerebral trauma;diffusion tensor imaging;genetic heterogeneity;hippocampus (brain);magnetic resonance imaging;occipital lobe;survivors;voxel;white matter	Claire Helen Salmond;David K.

0b7631e7f18008cfd555e77e186d377126d0510f	tuning out security warnings: a longitudinal examination of habituation through fmri, eye tracking, and field experiments		Research in the fields of information systems and human-computer interaction has shown that habituation— decreased response to repeated stimulation—is a serious threat to the effectiveness of security warnings. Although habituation is a neurobiological phenomenon that develops over time, past studies have only examined this problem cross-sectionally. Further, past studies have not examined how habituation influences actual security warning adherence in the field. For these reasons, the full extent of the problem of habituation is unknown.	experiment;eye tracking;human–computer interaction;information system	Anthony Vance;Jeffrey L.

e5c0b067ff8da6fef12248dd2652f5ef19dd917c	on the spatial organization of epileptiform activity	brain;complexity;synchronization;spatial organization;epilepsy	The generation and progression of epileptiform activity, especially that associated with ictal paroxysmal neuronal discharges (seizures), is usually studied in terms of its temporal evolution rather than its spatial organization. The characterization of the spatio-temporal dynamics of epileptiform activity represents a major challenge in neuroscience, due to the very intricate nature of brain structure and function. Our study is an initial attempt to reveal the structure hidden under the spatial organization of the synchronization patterns in neuronal activity associated with epilepsy. Analysis of the phase synchronization patterns from magnetoencephalographic recordings in an epileptic patient revealed a decrease in complexity during seizures. Distinct patterns of synchronized activity were observed during interictal and ictal (seizure) activity, and new tools to quantify and visualize the information contained in a synchrony pattern are proposed. The results reported here support previous observations on the high local synchronization in seizures.	spatial organization	Luis García Domínguez;Ramón Guevara Erra;Richard Wennberg;José Luis Pérez Velazquez	2008	I.

Our aim is to investigate how affective touch (slow gentle caressing) affects arousal states in young infants. Previous work showed that slow-touch decreases heart rate in 9-month-old infants. We tested two groups of 6-months-old (n=26) and 9-months-old infants (n=23). We measured heart rate and saccadic reaction time while infants performed a visual orienting task, where speed of re-orienting from a central fixation to a peripheral target was measured. During the experiment, infants received either slow or fast-touch on their back in blocked trials. We found no effects of touch on heart rate in either age-group, and only marginal effects of slow-touch on reaction times in 9-month-old infants. We are currently testing 2 months-old infants to investigate if these effects are observed earlier in life; these new results will be discussed.	cognitive science;marginal model;peripheral	Laura Pirazzoli;Emily Jones;Teodora Gliga;Mark H.

Intermanual learning transfer (ILT) tasks have shown that both reaching movements adapt to distorted spaces rather rapidly and the adaptation generalizes to the behavior of other limbs. In this paper, we present an ILT experiment and replicate it with feedforward neural network (NN) architectures. We show that the NN architecture is the key to successfully replicating the experiments. Moreover, we show that dependent on the architecture and the initial training schedule applied, an internal space representation emerges that enables ILT. The results confirm that internal body spaces, identified in neuroscience and cognitive psychological research, can emerge solely due to an interdependence between different limb movements and the right neural architecture. We hypothesize that, in order to develop internal spatial representations observed in animals and humans, it might be sufficient to enforce the integration of multiple correlated sensory and motor information into one compact internal representation.	artificial neural network;emergent;experiment;feedforward neural network;humans;interdependence;neural network software;self-replication;spaces	Martin V.

We conducted multi-modal neuroimaging scans of the rat olfactory bulb, both with and without odor, to examine interaction between spontaneous and evoked activities. Independent component analysis of spontaneous fluctuations revealed resting-state networks, and odor-evoked changes revealed activation maps. We constructed simulated activation maps using resting-state networks that were highly correlated to evoked activation maps. Simulated activation maps derived by intrinsic optical signal (IOS), which covers the dorsal portion of the glomerular sheet, significantly differentiated one odor's evoked activation map from the other two. To test the hypothesis that spontaneous activity of the entire glomerular sheet is relevant for representing odor-evoked activations, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the entire glomerular sheet. In contrast to the IOS results, the fMRI-derived simulated activation maps significantly differentiated all three odors' evoked activation maps. Importantly, no evoked activation maps could be significantly differentiated using simulated activation maps produced using phase-randomized resting-state networks. Given that some highly organized resting-state networks did not correlate with any odors' evoked activation maps, we posit that these resting-state networks may characterize evoked activation maps associated with odors not studied. These results emphasize that fluctuations in spontaneous activity form a foundation for active processing, signifying the relevance of resting-state mapping to functional neuroimaging.	finite-state machine;functional gastrointestinal disorders;impulse oscillometry;independent component analysis;interphase cell;magnetic resonance imaging;map;modal logic;neural oscillation;neuroimaging;numerous;odors;randomized algorithm;relevance;rest;spontaneous order;structure of olfactory bulb;fmri	Garth Thompson;Basavaraju G.

The present study examines whether brain areas involved in biological motion perception are among these areas-particularly with respect to selective attention towards human movement goals. Fifteen participants completed a point-light biological motion study following a two-by-two factorial design, with one factor representing an exogenous manipulation of human movement goals (goal-directed versus random movement), and the other an endogenous manipulation (a goal identification task versus an ancillary color-change task). Both manipulations yielded increased activation in the human homologue of motion-sensitive area MT+ (hMT+) as well as the extrastriate body area (EBA). The endogenous manipulation was associated with increased right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) activation, whereas the exogenous manipulation was associated with increased activation in left posterior STS. Selective attention towards goals activated a portion of left hMT+/EBA only during the perception of purposeful movement-consistent with emerging theories associating this area with the matching of visual motion input to known goal-directed actions. The overall pattern of results indicates that attention towards the goals of human movement activates biological motion areas. Ultimately, selective attention may explain why some studies examining biological motion show activation in hMT+ and EBA, even when using control stimuli with comparable motion properties.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;body dysmorphic disorders;cerebral cortex;cumulative trauma disorders;epidermolysis bullosa acquisita;homologous gene;matching;modulation;pascal/mt+;responsiveness;structure of superior temporal sulcus;theory;time and motion study;top-down and bottom-up design;dinoflagellate sulcus	John D.

Treating the molecule as a quantum rotator, the probability of the ‘‘hidden-crossing’’ transitions between rotational states, induced by the external periodic electric field, is analyzed. It is found that this probability depends on frequency only, i.e. the external signal causes the information transfer rather than the energy. Using the data of the typical sources of electric signals in brain cells and the criterium of maximization of the information entropy, the relevant number of water molecules (rotators) per cell is estimated. The results appear to be close to the actual number of water molecules per cortical neuron. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

39aba1e70eb6e4817d943a0267ca8a85c4b42896	depth-dependent flow and pressure characteristics in cortical microvascular networks		A better knowledge of the flow and pressure distribution in realistic microvascular networks is needed for improving our understanding of neurovascular coupling mechanisms and the related measurement techniques. Here, numerical simulations with discrete tracking of red blood cells (RBCs) are performed in three realistic microvascular networks from the mouse cerebral cortex. Our analysis is based on trajectories of individual RBCs and focuses on layer-specific flow phenomena until a cortical depth of 1 mm. The individual RBC trajectories reveal that in the capillary bed RBCs preferentially move in plane. Hence, the capillary flow field shows laminar patterns and a layer-specific analysis is valid. We demonstrate that for RBCs entering the capillary bed close to the cortical surface (< 400 μm) the largest pressure drop takes place in the capillaries (37%), while for deeper regions arterioles are responsible for 61% of the total pressure drop. Further flow characteristics, such as capillary transit time or RBC velocity, also vary significantly over cortical depth. Comparison of purely topological characteristics with flow-based ones shows that a combined interpretation of topology and flow is indispensable. Our results provide evidence that it is crucial to consider layer-specific differences for all investigations related to the flow and pressure distribution in the cortical vasculature. These findings support the hypothesis that for an efficient oxygen up-regulation at least two regulation mechanisms must be playing hand in hand, namely cerebral blood flow increase and microvascular flow homogenization. However, the contribution of both regulation mechanisms to oxygen up-regulation likely varies over depth.	anatomy, regional;blood cells;blood capillaries;blood supply aspects;capillary beds;capillary vessel;cerebral cortex;cerebrovascular circulation;erythrocytes;largest;numerical analysis;oxygen;role-based collaboration;simulation;structure of arteriole;transcriptional activation;velocity (software development);plasma membrane proton-transporting atp synthase complex location, coupling factor f(o)	Franca Schmid;Philbert S.

But the assumptions underling the nature of identified sources limits this tool. By creating local one-dimensional approximations, Local Sparse Component Analysis (LSCA) can separate contiguous sources on the basis of their sparse representation into smoothness spaces via the 3D wavelet transformation. In this paper we systematically compare Probabilistic ICA (PICA) and LSCA for analyzing resting state fMRI across healthy participants. We show that the PICA sources usually representing biologically plausible components can in fact be decomposed into several LSCA sources that are not necessarily independent from each other. In addition, we show that LSCA identifies sources that approximate much better the local variations of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal than PICA sources.	approximation algorithm;cell respiration;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;interphase cell;pica disease;probabilistic automaton;resonance;rest;resting state fmri;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;spatial variability;voxel;wavelet transform	Gilson Vieira;Edson Amaro Júnior;João Ricardo Sato;Luiz A.

Statistical characterizations of these networks aim to quantify global and local properties of brain activity with a small number of network measures. Important functional network measures include measures of modularity (measures of the goodness with which a network is optimally partitioned into functional subgroups) and measures of centrality (measures of the functional influence of individual brain regions). Characterizations of functional networks are increasing in popularity, but are associated with several important methodological problems. These problems include the inability to characterize densely connected and weighted functional networks, the neglect of degenerate topologically distinct high-modularity partitions of these networks, and the absence of a network null model for testing hypotheses of association between observed nontrivial network properties and simple weighted connectivity properties. In this study we describe a set of methods to overcome these problems. Specifically, we generalize measures of modularity and centrality to fully connected and weighted complex networks, describe the detection of degenerate high-modularity partitions of these networks, and introduce a weighted-connectivity null model of these networks. We illustrate our methods by demonstrating degenerate high-modularity partitions and strong correlations between two complementary measures of centrality in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) networks from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, an open-access repository of resting-state functional MRI datasets. Our methods may allow more sound and reliable characterizations and comparisons of functional brain networks across conditions and subjects.	abnormal degeneration;centrality;complex network;connectome;electroencephalography;magnetic resonance imaging;null value;null model;rest;statistical learning theory;fmri	Mikail Rubinov;Olaf Sporns	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.03.069	combinatorics;discrete mathematics;machine learning;mathematics;complex network;statistics	ML	22.808298919454334	-78.19401332694657	77862

Saccades differentially modulate human LGN and V1 responses in the presence and absence of visual stimulation. Curr. Biol. 15, 37-41]. Here, we explored this differential modulation further using graded changes in the strength of visual stimulation by changing the mean luminance of a flickering visual stimulus. We replicate the finding of differential modulation of activity in human LGN and V1, and show that this relationship also holds in retinotopic areas V2 and V3. Suppression of visually evoked activity during saccades was detectable during strong visual stimulation, but not during weaker stimulation. This suggests that the activation of visual cortex by saccades in darkness represents a signal that persists irrespective of the state of visual stimulation, masking suppressive effects of saccades when visual stimulation is weak. Such a signal may represent a motor signal in a sensory area. We discuss the possible role of oculomotor corollary discharge in changes in visual perception that occur peri-saccadically, which contribute to the successful negation of the disruptive effects of saccades on our seamless visual experience of the world.	area striata structure;cerebral cortex;discharger;enhanced biochemical activity;gareth rees (software developer);modulation;peri-implant endosseous healing;photic stimulation;photopsia;saccades;seamless3d;self-replicating machine;zero suppression	Richard Sylvester;Geraint Rees	2006	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.09.014	psychology;computer vision;neuroscience;visual perception;communication	ML	17.55379133338966	-77.16142747193176	77928
15aadab48dcd507006f11bf5663eea410dffb53d	integrating space, time, and orientation in spiking neural networks: a case study on multimodal brain data modeling		Recent progress in a noninvasive brain data sampling technology has facilitated simultaneous sampling of multiple modalities of brain data, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, diffusion tensor imaging, and so on. In spite of the potential benefits from integrating predictive modeling of multiple modality brain data, this area of research remains mostly unexplored due to a lack of methodological advancements. The difficulty in fusing multiple modalities of brain data within a single model lies in the heterogeneous temporal and spatial characteristics of the data sources. Recent advances in spiking neural network systems, however, provide the flexibility to incorporate multidimensional information within the model. This paper proposes a novel, unsupervised learning algorithm for fusing temporal, spatial, and orientation information in a spiking neural network architecture that could potentially be used to understand and perform predictive modeling using multimodal data. The proposed algorithm is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using synthetically generated data to characterize its behavior and its ability to utilize spatial, temporal, and orientation information within the model. This leads to improved pattern recognition capabilities and performance along with robust interpretability of the brain data. Furthermore, a case study is presented, which aims to build a computational model that discriminates between people with schizophrenia who respond or do not respond to monotherapy with the antipsychotic clozapine.	algorithm;biological neural networks;clozapine;computational model;data modeling;diffusion tensor imaging;electroencephalography;genetic heterogeneity;magnetic resonance imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;network architecture;pattern recognition;predictive modelling;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;schizophrenia;spiking neural network;unsupervised learning;benefit	Neelava Sengupta;Christian G Alonso;Nikola K.

In recent years, various approaches for liver biopsies analysis have been highlighted, such as elastography techniques and serum markers, due to their properties of non-invasiveness. The aim of this study is to determine the best biomarkers or their combination by comparing multimodal biomarkers (ultrasound elastography parameters, biochemical hematologic parameters, and clinical parameters) for fibrosis assessment in chronic hepatitis B using a support vector machine combined with recursive feature elimination (RFE-SVM) approach. Results revealed that biomarkers from ultrasound elastography techniques achieved better prediction performance than others in the assessment of significant fibrosis (≥ F2) and cirrhosis (F4), and the best prediction performance were (1) ≥ F2: AUC = 0.902, ACC = 86.697%; (2) F4: AUC = 0.976, ACC = 90.364%. The findings are useful in guiding biomarkers selection and features optimization and in simplifying the prediction system for evaluation of liver fibrosis stage.	antiviral agents;area under curve;biological markers;biopsy;brain–computer interface;chronic electrode implant;computers in human behavior;elastography;excretory function;fibrosis;fibrosis, liver;hematology (discipline);hepatitis b;hepatitis b, chronic;hepatitis, chronic;international unit;mathematical optimization;multimodal interaction;patients;recursion;support vector machine;tellurium;test engineer;algorithm	Yanru Bai;Xin Chen;Changfeng Dong;Yingxia Liu;Zhiguo Zhang	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591225	support vector machine;medicine;pathology;computer science;machine learning;biological engineering;biomarker;surgery	SE	10.046214080427928	-80.08391393052743	78118

Stationary dischargesphase locked, quasiperiodic, or chaoticwere induced in a simulated neuron by presenting pacemaker presynaptic spike trains across a model of a prototypical inhibitory synapse. Reduced timing precision was modeled by jittering presynaptic spike times. Aftereffects of errorsin this communication, missed presynaptic spikeswere determined by comparing postsynaptic spike times between simulations identical except for the presence or absence of errors. Results show that the effects of an error vary greatly depending on the ongoing dynamical behavior. In the case of phase lockings, a high degree of presynaptic spike timing precision can provide significantly faster error recovery. For nonlocked behaviors, isolated missed spikes can have little or no discernible aftereffects (or even serve to paradoxically reduce uncertainty in postsynaptic spike timing), regardless of presynaptic imprecision. This suggests two possible categories of error correction: high-precision locking with rapid recovery and low-precision nonlocked with error immunity.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;categories;correction of hearing impairment;illness behavior;lock (computer science);neuron;neurons;quasiperiodicity;sequela of disorder;simulation;stationary process;synapse;error correction	Michael Stiber	2005	Neural Computation	10.1162/0899766053723069	neuroscience;simulation;uncertainty;computer science;synapse;artificial intelligence;mathematics;artificial neural network;evolutionary computation;behavior	ML	20.79933603067952	-71.19836553068123	78161

State-or-the-art machine learning techniques have been increasingly employed to take on this diagnostic task. In this study, we employed Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ) classifiers to discriminate patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) from healthy controls based on their cognitive skills. Further, we adopted a """"Learning with privileged information"""" approach to combine cognitive and fMRI data for the classification task. The resulting classifier operates solely on the cognitive data while it incorporates the fMRI data as privileged information (PI) during training. This novel classifier is of practical use as the collection of brain imaging data is not always possible with patients and older participants. MCI patients and healthy age-matched controls were trained to extract structure from temporal sequences. We ask whether machine learning classifiers can be used to discriminate patients from controls and whether differences between these groups relate to individual cognitive profiles. To this end, we tested participants in four cognitive tasks: working memory, cognitive inhibition, divided attention, and selective attention. We also collected fMRI data before and after training on a probabilistic sequence learning task and extracted fMRI responses and connectivity as features for machine learning classifiers. Our results show that the PI guided GMLVQ classifiers outperform the baseline classifier that only used the cognitive data. In addition, we found that for the baseline classifier, divided attention is the only relevant cognitive feature. When PI was incorporated, divided attention remained the most relevant feature while cognitive inhibition became also relevant for the task. Interestingly, this analysis for the fMRI GMLVQ classifier suggests that (1) when overall fMRI signal is used as inputs to the classifier, the post-training session is most relevant; and (2) when the graph feature reflecting underlying spatiotemporal fMRI pattern is used, the pre-training session is most relevant.

Its simplified format, neural oscillator, is wildly adopted in engineering application. This paper explores the CPG from an integral view that combines biology and engineering together. Biological CPG and simplified CPG are both studied. Computer simulation reveals the mechanism of CPG. Some properties, such as effect of tonic input and sensory feedback, stable oscillation, robustness, entrainment etc., are further studied. The promising results provide foundation for the potential engineering application in future.

Typical classification pipeline includes taking the time series, extracting features from them, and using them to classify a set of patients and healthy controls. The most informative features are then presented as novel biomarkers. In this paper, we compared the results of single and double cross validation schemes on a cohort of 170 subjects with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects. We used graph theoretic measures as our features, comparing the use of functional and anatomical atlases to define nodes and the effect of prewhitening to remove autocorrelation trends. We found that double cross validation resulted in a 20% decrease in classification performance compared to single cross validation. The anatomical atlas resulted in higher classification results. Prewhitening resulted in a 10% boost in classification performance. Overall, a classification performance of 80% was obtained with a double-cross validation scheme using prewhitened time series and an anatomical brain atlas. However, reproducibility of classification within subjects across scans was surprisingly low and comparable to across subject classification rates, indicating that subject state during the short scan significantly influences the estimated features and classification performance.	atlases;autocorrelation;biological markers;brain diseases;brain atlas;capability maturity model integration;classification;cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);data validation;declaration (computer programming);graph - visual representation;ibm notes;information;informed consent;interaction;machine ethics;manuscripts;patients;rest;resting state fmri;review board;scanning;schizophrenia;theory;time series;twisted nematic field effect;united states national institutes of health;algorithm;antineoplaston a10;fmri;funding grant;triangulation	Pantea Moghimi;Kelvin O.

We propose a simple mechanism by which the narrow dynamical range observed experimentally in isolated sensory neurons translates into a wide dynamical range as a result of excitable waves and synchronization phenomena which provides self-limited amplification. The mechanism is illustrated by means of different models in which excitable elements are coupled by lateral electrical connections. The models are based on recent experimental findings that gap junctions are present in the olfactory sensory periphery. r 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated this issue by recording the intracranial field potentials of the amygdala in participants undergoing preneurosurgical assessment (n = 6). Participants observed faces, mosaics, and houses in upright and inverted orientations using a dummy target detection task. Time–frequency statistical parametric mapping analyses revealed that the amygdala showed greater gamma-band activity in response to faces than to mosaics at 200–300 msec, with a peak at 255 msec. Gamma-band activation with a similar temporal profile was also found in response to faces versus houses. Activation patterns did not differ between upright and inverted presentations of stimuli. These results suggest that the human amygdala is involved in the early stages of face processing, including the modulation of subjective perception of faces.	amygdaloid structure;dummy variable (statistics);entity handling - upright;face;gamma correction;mental orientation;modulation;neuroimaging	Wataru Sato;Takanori Kochiyama;Shota Uono;Kazumi Matsuda;Keiko Usui;Yushi Inoue;Motomi Toichi	2012	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00142	psychology;local field potential;neuroscience;time–frequency analysis;participant observation;communication;social psychology	HCI	16.90282516925718	-77.2976431531442	79037

In the study of these brain potentials, it is important to characterize both the spatial and temporal morphologies of the responses for a better understanding of both the physiology and function of the brain. This paper presents a method for visualizing the characteristic spatio-temporal brain activity associated with two distinct conditions. This method, called Independent Spatio-Temporal Patterns (ISTPs), extends Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) for spatio-temporal pattern visualization by adding temporal features. Independent component analysis (ICA) is then applied to extract independent spatio-temporal patterns corresponding to each condition. The results indicate that the inclusion of temporal features can provide useful insight regarding the spatio-temporal characteristics of sensorimotor rhythms.	electroencephalography;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;spatiotemporal pattern	Dean J.

Heightened response to fear faces is thought to reflect the amygdala's adaptive function as an early warning mechanism. Although culture shapes several facets of emotional and social experience, including how fear is perceived and expressed to others, very little is known about how culture influences neural responses to fear stimuli. Here we show that the bilateral amygdala response to fear faces is modulated by culture. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure amygdala response to fear and nonfear faces in two distinct cultures. Native Japanese in Japan and Caucasians in the United States showed greater amygdala activation to fear expressed by members of their own cultural group. This finding provides novel and surprising evidence of cultural tuning in an automatic neural response.	activation function;amygdaloid structure;bilateral filter;bilateral sound;database tuning;face;fear (mental process);magnetic resonance imaging;modulation;sensitivity and specificity;fmri	Joan Y.

This article presents an active binocular vision system with saccade and vergence capabilities to simulate fundamental human vision. A saccade generation model based on image segmentation and color attention was developed to provide simple behaviors of bottom-up attentive saccade. A vergence control model utilizing the retinocortical log polar mapping in the primate visual cortex was developed to effectively control the vergence of two cameras in a cluttered environment. The combination of these two mechanisms provides the system a way to explore and reconstruct positional information of attended objects in the environment.	attentive user interface;binocular disparity;binocular vision;bottom-up parsing;ccir system a;gene regulatory network;image segmentation;information;simulation;vergence	Xuejie Zhang;Alex Leng Phuan Tay	2011	Cybernetics and Systems	10.1080/01969722.2010.532643	binocular vision;computer vision;computer science;top-down and bottom-up design;image segmentation	Robotics	22.163494835708857	-67.55522312775142	79311

The model is in the form of a multilayered architecture consisting of integrate and fire neurons and synapses that employ spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rule to enable the learning of such transformations. We developed a simple 2-degree-of-freedom robot-based reaching task which involves the learning of a nonlinear function. Computer simulations demonstrate the capability of such a model for learning the forward and inverse kinematics for such a task and hence to learn spatio-motor transformations. The interesting aspect of the model is its capacity to be tolerant to partial absence of sensory or motor inputs at various stages of learning. We believe that such a model lays the foundation for learning other complex functions and transformations in real-world scenarios.	biological neuron model;exhibits as topic;fault tolerance;interaction;inverse kinematics;learning rule;nonlinear system;robotic arm;simulation;synapses;synaptic package manager;cell transformation	Narayan Srinivasa;Youngkwan Cho	2012	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2207738	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;robot kinematics	ML	18.563108189447593	-67.41310334704656	79329

This paper presents a theory for achieving basic invariance properties already at the level of receptive fields. Specifically, the presented framework comprises (i) local scaling transformations caused by objects of different size and at different distances to the observer, (ii) locally linearized image deformations caused by variations in the viewing direction in relation to the object, (iii) locally linearized relative motions between the object and the observer and (iv) local multiplicative intensity transformations caused by illumination variations. The receptive field model can be derived by necessity from symmetry properties of the environment and leads to predictions about receptive field profiles in good agreement with receptive field profiles measured by cell recordings in mammalian vision. Indeed, the receptive field profiles in the retina, LGN and V1 are close to ideal to what is motivated by the idealized requirements. By complementing receptive field measurements with selection mechanisms over the parameters in the receptive field families, it is shown how true invariance of receptive field responses can be obtained under scaling transformations, affine transformations and Galilean transformations. Thereby, the framework provides a mathematically well-founded and biologically plausible model for how basic invariance properties can be achieved already at the level of receptive fields and support invariant recognition of objects and events under variations in viewpoint, retinal size, object motion and illumination. The theory can explain the different shapes of receptive field profiles found in biological vision, which are tuned to different sizes and orientations in the image domain as well as to different image velocities in spacetime, from a requirement that the visual system should be invariant to the natural types of image transformations that occur in its environment.

We recorded behavioral responses and neural activity during a delayed recognition task with a cue presented during the delay period. A specific cue (“Face” or “Scene”) was used to indicate which one of the two initially viewed pictures of a face and a scene would be tested at the end of a trial, whereas a nonspecific cue (“Both”) was used as control. As expected, the specific cues facilitated behavioral performance (faster response times) compared to the nonspecific cue. A postexperiment memory test showed that the items cued to remember were better recognized than those not cued. The fMRI results showed largely overlapped activations across the three cue conditions in dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, posterior parietal cortex, ventral occipito-temporal cortex, dorsal striatum, and pulvinar nucleus. Among those regions, dorsomedial PFC and inferior occipital gyrus remained active during the entire postcue delay period. Differential activity was mainly found in the association cortices. In particular, the parahippocampal area and posterior superior parietal lobe showed significantly enhanced activity during the postcue period of the scene condition relative to the Face and Both conditions. No regions showed differentially greater responses to the face cue. Our findings suggest that a better representation of visual information in working memory may depend on enhancing the more specialized visual association areas or their interaction with PFC.	acoustic lobing;bacterial vaginosis;cardiac conduction defect, nonspecific (disorder);cfp wt allele;cell nucleus;enhanced biochemical activity;entity name part qualifier - adopted;futures studies;ifng wt allele;image;information processing;job control (unix);left gluteus medius;medial dorsal nucleus;memory disorders;memory tester;neostriatum;optic nerve glioma, childhood;paper with delayed recognition;parietal lobe;powerbuilder foundation classes;prefrontal cortex;pulvinar structure;spironolactone;substrate (electronics);temporal lobe;fmri	Hwamee Oh;Hoi-Chung Leung	2010	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2009.21250	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;information processing;science education;working memory;task analysis;short-term memory;posterior parietal cortex;communication;recognition memory	ML	17.506795327402006	-77.4786900292851	79571
6c08a720f06b8d58369b210df3e25ff8acbe3eb6	dynamic visual noise reduces confidence in short-term memory for visual information		Previous research has shown effects of the visual interference technique, dynamic visual noise (DVN), on visual imagery, but not on visual short-term memory, unless retention of precise visual detail is required. This study tested the prediction that DVN does also affect retention of gross visual information, specifically by reducing confidence. Participants performed a matrix pattern memory task with three retention interval interference conditions (DVN, static visual noise and no interference control) that varied from trial to trial. At recall, participants indicated whether or not they were sure of their responses. As in previous research, DVN did not impair recall accuracy or latency on the task, but it did reduce recall confidence relative to static visual noise and no interference. We conclude that DVN does distort visual representations in short-term memory, but standard coarse-grained recall measures are insensitive to these distortions.	area striata structure;distortion;guided imagery;image noise;interference (communication);long short-term memory;memory disorders;optic nerve glioma, childhood;recurrent childhood visual pathway glioma	Eva Kemps;Jackie Andrade	2011	Cognitive Processing	10.1007/s10339-011-0429-5	computer vision;computer science;communication;social psychology	Visualization	15.197224893630917	-76.52350546195464	79656
596d9ca8f531f9e4fc967587f6323a39c790166b	frontal monitoring and parietal evidence: mechanisms of error correction		When we respond to a stimulus, our decisions are based not only on external stimuli but also on our ongoing performance. If the response deviates from our goals, monitoring and decision-making brain areas interact so that future behavior may change. By taking advantage of natural variation in error salience, as measured by the RT taken to correct an error (RTEC), here we argue that an evidence accumulation framework provides a potential underlying mechanism for this variable process of error identification and correction, as evidenced by covariation of frontal monitoring and parietal decision-making processes. We study two early EEG signals linked to monitoring within medial PFC—the error-related negativity (ERN) and frontocentral theta activity—and a third EEG signal, the error positivity (Pe), that is thought to share the same parietal substrates as a signal (the P3b) proposed to reflect evidence accumulation. As predicted, our data show that on slow RTEC trials, frontal monitoring resources are less strongly employed, and the latency of the Pe is longer. Critically, the speed of the RTEC also covaries with the magnitude of subsequent neural (intertrial alpha power) and behavioral (post-error slowing) adjustments following the correction. These results are synthesized to describe a timing diagram for adaptive decision-making after errors and support a potential evidence accumulation mechanism in which error signaling is followed by rapid behavioral adjustments.	cfp wt allele;correction of hearing impairment;decision making;digital timing diagram;electroencephalography;error detection and correction;error message;index;medial graph;negativity (quantum mechanics);penk wt allele;participatory monitoring;patients;population;post-hartree–fock;powerbuilder foundation classes;qr code;timing diagram (unified modeling language);tree accumulation;error correction	Ana Navarro-Cebrian;Robert T.

For instance, a social Simon effect has been observed when two individuals perform a Go/No-Go response to one of two stimuli in the presence of each other, but not when they perform the same task alone. Such effects are argued to provide evidence that individuals co-represent the task goals and the to-be-performed actions of a co-actor. Motivated by the complex-systems approach, the present study was designed to investigate an alternative hypothesis--that such joint-action effects are due to a dynamical (time-evolving) interpersonal coupling that operates to perturb the behavior of socially situated actors. To investigate this possibility, participants performed a standard Go/No-Go Simon task in joint and individual conditions. The dynamic structure of recorded reaction times was examined using fractal statistics and instantaneous cross-correlation. Consistent with our hypothesis that participants responding in a shared space would become behaviorally coupled, the analyses revealed that reaction times in the joint condition displayed decreased fractal structure (indicative of interpersonal perturbation processes modulating ongoing participant behavior) compared to the individual condition, and were more correlated across a range of time-scales compared to the reaction times of pseudo-pair controls. Collectively, the findings imply that dynamic processes might underlie social stimulus-response compatibility effects and shape joint cognitive processes in general.	complex systems;cross-correlation;fractal;medical device incompatibility problem;perturbation theory;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;situated;social characteristics;stimulus–response compatibility	MaryLauren Malone;Ramon D.

In this study, we investigate the potential of diffusion MRI to probe the microstructure of cortical gray matter and its region-specific heterogeneity across cortical areas in the fixed human brain. High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data at an isotropic resolution of 92-μm and 30 diffusion-encoding directions were acquired using a 3D diffusion-weighted gradient-and-spin-echo sequence, from prefrontal (Brodmann area 9), primary motor (area 4), primary somatosensory (area 3b), and primary visual (area 17) cortical specimens (n=3 each) from three human subjects. Further, the diffusion MR findings in these cortical areas were compared with histological silver impregnation of the same specimens, in order to investigate the underlying architectonic features that constitute the microstructural basis of diffusion-driven contrasts in cortical gray matter. Our data reveal distinct and region-specific diffusion MR contrasts across the studied areas, allowing delineation of intracortical bands of tangential fibers in specific layers-layer I, layer VI, and the inner and outer bands of Baillarger.

9150b46808695ffaceffc2796a95bf14895a0fb8	wavelet-based visual analysis of dynamic networks		Dynamic networks naturally appear in a multitude of applications from different fields. Analyzing and exploring dynamic networks in order to understand and detect patterns and phenomena is challenging, fostering the development of new methodologies, particularly in the field of visual analytics. In this work, we propose a novel visual analytics methodology for dynamic networks, which relies on the spectral graph wavelet theory. We enable the automatic analysis of a signal defined on the nodes of the network, making viable the robust detection of network properties. Specifically, we use a fast approximation of a graph wavelet transform to derive a set of wavelet coefficients, which are then used to identify activity patterns on large networks, including their temporal recurrence. The coefficients naturally encode the spatial and temporal variations of the signal, leading to an efficient and meaningful representation. This methodology allows for the exploration of the structural evolution of the network and their patterns over time. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using usage scenarios and comparisons involving real dynamic networks.	algorithmic efficiency;analyzer, device;anatomic node;approximation;class;coefficient;computation;encode;experiment;gastrointestinal stromal tumors;gist;graph - visual representation;packet analyzer;preemption (computing);social network;visual analytics;wavelet transform	Alcebiades Dal Col;Paola Valdivia;Fabiano Petronetto;Fabio Dias;Cláudio T.

However, direct analysis by the eye is hopeless for a network of millions of vertices. The theory of wavelets provides a powerful microscopy to look at large complex networks to answer specific questions about their structure. Wavelet multiresolution representations of networks provide a coarse-to-fine strategy for characterizing and classifying networks by processing the minimum amount of information. In particular, we show that the small-world property of a class of networks can easily be derived from its coarse description in the lowest resolution subspace of the wavelet decomposition.	wavelet	Jin Fan;Xiao Fan Wang	2005	IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCSII.2005.846304	computer vision;image resolution;computer science;microscopy;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;small-world network;complex network;wavelet transform	EDA	23.340375728790523	-78.05164287260385	79971

In homogeneous (HOM) and heterogeneous (HEM) models, the location of the excitatory and inhibitory synapses was randomly selected for each bin of dendritic length. In the HOM, each compartment was forced to contain only one synapse as long as other compartments did not have at least one synapse. In the HEM, no restriction was made for synaptic distribution within a bin. EPSP amplitude in the HOM was enhanced by 28% and inhibition of EPSP peak (upon activation of inhibition) was increased by 66%, compared to the HEM. These results indicate that synaptic efficacy is greater in the HOM, both for excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Thus, it is suggested that homogeneously distributed postsynaptic inhibition may serve as the powerful inhibition of the monosynaptic reflex in realistic α-motoneurons.	computer simulation;numerical weather prediction;synaptic package manager	Gideon Gradwohl;R.

For multivariate data, there is often the need to examine causal relations between two blocks of time series, where each block could represent a brain region of interest. Two alternative methods are available. In the pairwise method, bivariate autoregressive models are fit to all pairwise combinations involving one time series from the first block and one from the second. The total Granger causality between the two blocks is then derived by summing pairwise causality values from each of these models. This approach is intuitive but computationally cumbersome. Theoretically, a more concise method can be derived, which we term the blockwise Granger causality method. In this method, a single multivariate model is fit to all the time series, and the causality between the two blocks is then computed from this model. We compare these two methods by applying them to cortical local field potential recordings from monkeys performing a sensorimotor task. The obtained results demonstrate consistency between the two methods and point to the significance potential of utilizing Granger causality analysis in understanding coupled neural systems.	autoregressive model;bivariate data;causal filter;causality;interdependence;monkeys;region of interest;time series	Xue Wang;Yonghong Chen;Steven L.

We study the hypothesis that cortical synaptic plasticity does not associate individual spikes, but rather whole firing episodes, and depends only on when these episodes start and how long they last, but as little as possible on the timing of individual spikes. Here we present the mathematical background for such a study. Standard methods from hidden Markov models are used to define what “firing episodes” are. Estimating the probability of being in such an episode requires not only the knowledge of past spikes, but also of future spikes. We show how to construct a causal learning rule, which depends only on past spikes, but associates preand postsynaptic firing episodes as if it also knew future spikes. We also show that this learning rule agrees with some features of synaptic plasticity in superficial layers of rat visual cortex (Froemke and Dan, Nature 416:433, 2002).	causality;hidden markov model;learning rule;markov chain;nonlinear system;printed circuit board;synaptic package manager;the superficial;tracing (software);xfig	Michael Eisele;Kenneth D.

In particular, from a biological point of view, considerable attention has been recently devoted to the study of the human brain as a network of different cortical regions that show coherent activity during resting-state. In literature, there can be found different large-scale models of resting-state dynamics in health and disease. In this context, the Kuramoto model, a classical model apt to describe oscillators' dynamics, has been extended to capture the spatial displacement and the communication conditions in such brain network. Starting from a previous work in this field [1], we analyze this modified model and compare it with other existing large-scale models. In doing so, our aim is to promote a set of mathematical tools useful to better understand real experimental data in neuroscience and estimate brain dynamics.	coherence (physics);complex dynamics;complex network;displacement mapping;electroencephalography;emergence;gaussian blur;kuramoto model;mathematical model;microsoft sync framework;synthetic intelligence	Chiara Favaretto;Angelo Cenedese	2016	2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2016.7798905	simulation;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;mathematical model;mathematics;coupling;oscillation	ML	20.84993929810185	-75.70312300261975	80119

These oscillations are thought to reflect the excitability of sensory and motor systems that can be modulated according to the actual behavioral demands. However, so far, evidence for an association between oscillatory activity and excitability has been inconsistent. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to reinvestigate the relationship between oscillatory activity and excitability in the somatosensory system on a single trial basis. Brief painful stimuli were applied to relate pain-induced suppressions of oscillatory activity to pain-induced increases in excitability. The analysis reveals a significant negative correlation between sensorimotor oscillatory activity, particularly in the alpha-band, and excitability of somatosensory cortices. Oscillatory activity outside the somatosensory system did not correlate with somatosensory excitability. These findings demonstrate that modulations of sensorimotor oscillatory activity specifically reflect modulations in excitability of the somatosensory system and thus provide direct evidence for the basic tenet of an association between oscillatory activity and cortical excitability.	cerebral cortex;excited state;magnetoencephalography;modulation;motor cortex;neural oscillation;pain;rest;spontaneous order;primary somatosensory cortex	Markus Ploner;Joachim Gross;Lars Timmermann;Bettina Pollok;Alfons Schnitzler	2006	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.06.004	psychology;neuroscience;somatosensory evoked potential;developmental psychology;motor system;communication;oscillation;premovement neuronal activity;somatosensory system;magnetoencephalography	ML	16.810649089522126	-77.33713875336255	80311

These spikes can be thought of as discrete events that constitute, in essence, a binary, time-varying spatial pattern over the entire network. A general hypothesis in neuroscience is that these patterns encode information, thus enabling function. Consequently, an emerging research direction in experimental neuroscience involves the use of neurostimulation technologies to artificially induce such patterns in a spatiotemporally precise manner - the so-called neurocontrol problem. In this work, we discuss the neurocontrol problem by means of statistical models, which, in contrast to more traditional dynamical-systems models, describe only the probability of spiking as a function of time. Thus, such models aggregate nonlinearity and uncertainty into a more tractable mathematical description. While statistical models are frequently used to describe experimental data, their use as tools for input construction is not as well explored. Here, we formulate an optimal control problem for spiking patterns via a weighted maximum likelihood approach and develop its solution. We demonstrate the design approach for a model network consisting of coupled stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons. Finally, we suggest how this overall framework can be used to develop a class of control analyses for point process models.	action potential;aggregate data;aggregate function;biological neuron model;cobham's thesis;control engineering;convex optimization;dynamical system;encode;generalized linear model;mathematical optimization;neural oscillation;neurostimulation;nonlinear system;optimal control;point process;powerset construction;software deployment;spatiotemporal pattern;statistical model;synaptic package manager;underactuation;video-in video-out	Anirban Nandi;Mohammadmehdi Kafashan;ShiNung Ching	2016	2016 American Control Conference (ACC)	10.1109/ACC.2016.7526575	mathematical optimization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;control theory;statistics	ML	21.845035191769753	-74.17044439439371	80399

Learning and decision-making do not rely on a unitary system, but instead require the coordination of different cognitive processes that can be mathematically formalised as dissociable computational modules. Here, we aimed to trace the developmental time-course of the computational modules responsible for learning from reward or punishment, and learning from counterfactual feedback. Adolescents and adults carried out a novel reinforcement learning paradigm in which participants learned the association between cues and probabilistic outcomes, where the outcomes differed in valence (reward versus punishment) and feedback was either partial or complete (either the outcome of the chosen option only, or the outcomes of both the chosen and unchosen option, were displayed). Computational strategies changed during development: whereas adolescents' behaviour was better explained by a basic reinforcement learning algorithm, adults' behaviour integrated increasingly complex computational features, namely a counterfactual learning module (enabling enhanced performance in the presence of complete feedback) and a value contextualisation module (enabling symmetrical reward and punishment learning). Unlike adults, adolescent performance did not benefit from counterfactual (complete) feedback. In addition, while adults learned symmetrically from both reward and punishment, adolescents learned from reward but were less likely to learn from punishment. This tendency to rely on rewards and not to consider alternative consequences of actions might contribute to our understanding of decision-making in adolescence.	adolescent (age group);algorithm;computation;counterfactual conditional;decision making;programming paradigm;reinforcement learning;rewards	Stefano Palminteri;Emma J.

The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity or STDP. We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron’s variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron’s output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an entropy-minimization objective function and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic efficacy increases. We compare our account to other efforts to derive STDP from computational principles, and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of cortical adaptation.	action potential;experiment;heart rate variability;loss function;modulation;neuron;optimization problem;simulation;synaptic package manager;the spike (1997)	Renaud Jolivet;Timothy J.

These recurrent e ects can be analyzed by expanding a spike probability function about the membrane potential in the absence of connections. This expansion can be written as a series of loops representing the recurrent signal transmission. Conditions for convergence of the series reveal the number of loops that are signi.cant for the system’s dynamics. This method is applied to a pair of mutually coupled spiking neurons to show how the membrane potential and cross-correlation function is changed by recurrence. c © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

7422f20dbe495124732c218f13e80fe0639a3941	motor imagery and higher-level cognition: four hurdles before research can sprint forward		Traditionally, higher-level cognition has been described as including processes such as attention, memory, language, and decision-making. However, motor processing and motor imagery are important aspects of cognition that have typically been considered outside of the traditional view. Recent research has demonstrated that there may be a critical functional relationship between motor imagery and other higher-level cognitive processes. Here we present a review of the extant literature on motor imagery and cognition, as well as outline four hurdles that must be addressed before the field investigating the influence of motor-based processes on higher-level cognition can be moved forward. These hurdles include problems distinguishing between visual and motor processes, addressing the differences in tasks and stimuli used to evoke motor imagery, accounting for individual differences in motor imagery ability, and identifying the appropriate neural correlates. It is important that these hurdles are addressed in future research so we can sprint forward and further our knowledge about this interesting relationship.	area striata structure;consciousness;decision making;design of experiments;embodied cognition;first-person (video games);futures studies;guided imagery;interaction;memory disorders;neuritis, autoimmune, experimental;neuroimaging;physical object;relocation of home or business;scrum (software development);sensitivity and specificity;sprint (software development);word lists by frequency	Christopher R.

Investigation of time delays can be cumbersome if the activity of a large number of neurons is recorded simultaneously and neuronal synchronization is measured in a pairwise manner (such as the cross-correlation histograms) because the number of pairwise measurements increases quadratically. Here, a non-parametric statistical test is proposed with which one can investigate (i) the consistency of the delays across a large number of pairwise measurements and (ii) the consistency of the changes in the time delays as a function of experimental conditions. The test can be classified as non-parametric because it takes into account only the directions of the delays and thus, does not make assumptions about the distributions and the variances of the measurement errors.	classification;cross-correlation;neural oscillation;propagation delay;synchronization (computer science)	Danko Nikolic	2006	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-006-9441-7	nonparametric statistics;econometrics;real-time computing;cross-correlation;mathematics;statistics;observational error	ML	21.062609333856237	-73.62596940979603	81972

Gender differences are often evident in the comprehension of social signals, but the underlying neurobiological basis for these differences is unclear. Combining visual psychophysics with an analysis of neuromagnetic activity, we assessed gender effects on the induced oscillatory response to visual social interaction revealed by motion. A robust difference in the induced gamma response was found between females and males over the left prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in perceptual decision making. The induced gamma neuromagnetic response peaked earlier in females than in males. Moreover, it appears that females anticipate social interaction predicting others' actions ahead of their realization, whereas males require accumulation of more sensory evidence for proper social decisions. The findings reflect gender-dependent modes in cortical processing of visually acquired social information. Contrary to popular wisdom, the outcome of this study indicates that gender effects are not evident in the neural circuitry underpinning visual social perception, but in the regions engaged in perceptual decision making.	adaptive behavior;area striata structure;artificial neural network;decision making;electronic circuit;interferon type ii;nonverbal communication;psychophysics;social perception;tree accumulation	Marina A Pavlova;Michele Guerreschi;Werner Lutzenberger;Alexander N.

To a first approximation, maintained discharges derive their variability from a noise source that is linearly added to the signal setting the mean firing rate. On the other hand, the variability of responses to abrupt changes in lighting seems to result from a nonlinear interaction between signal and noise. In both the cat and the goldfish retinae, the variance of rate is a fractional power function of the mean response amplitude (impulses/s). The exponent of that power function depends on the duration of the period in which the response is sampled after each transition in luminance; longer durations have a larger exponent. These results are difficult to explain with any simple model. The variability of the maintained discharges also deviates from the predictions of simple additivity. We propose a model for the variability of responses to abrupt changes in lighting that incorporates variability of the form observed for maintained discharges. The parameters of our model that provide the best fits to the variability of responses also provide a reasonable fit to the variability of maintained discharges. Thus, a single explanation can account for the variability of maintained discharges and responses of ganglion cells.	body fluid discharge;fits;ganglion cell;heart rate variability;large;noise generator;nonlinear system;order of approximation;retina;retinal ganglion cells;sample variance;sampling - surgical action;spatial variability;von hippel-lindau syndrome	Michael W.

fd85c68e87f53222e198fce9fdb6527afb93bd4b	functional architecture of the human brain		This special issue on the Functional Architecture of the Brain brings together some of the latest directions in research into the organization of functional brain networks and connectivity. The issue comprises 13 high-quality review articles from leaders in the field, providing state-of-the-art coverage of selected topics including multiscale brain networks, functional connectivity dynamics, computational network modeling, network effects of TMS, and functional brain organization across development and during sleep. One theme that cuts across most of the papers in this issue is the rich multiscale structure of brain network dynamics, from the gradual maturational and degenerative changes evident across the lifespan, to the rapid and transitory network reconfigurations seen in response to new contextual demands. New approaches to integrate across these different scales are a promising avenue for better understanding how the brain functions. The first three papers in the issue address how networks change over the relatively slow time scales of development and aging. Keunen et al. explain the developmental changes that occur from the embryonic stage through early infancy and situate the development of functional brain networks within this framework. Prenatal and perinatal influences can affect the trajectory of network development, with lifelong consequences. The developmental trajectory is then picked up by Grayson and Fair, who discuss changes in both the structure and function of brain networks during the period from birth to adulthood. At the far end of the trajectory, Damoiseaux describes how aging impacts functional networks. There is evidence that the subtle but pervasive disruption of information flow through the brain that occurs over time is tied to alterations in the structural and functional connectivity in brain networks. In addition to the slow changes in functional connectivity that occur over a lifetime, more rapid processes can give rise to changes in connectivity over the course of a single scan. Preti et al. focus specifically on the temporal dynamics of functional networks elucidated with sliding window correlations and other time-resolved methods. Their manuscript addresses the proliferation of techniques used for dynamic analysis and helps researchers to make informed choices given both the promise and the challenges involved in this area. Characterizing the nature of functional connectivity dynamics is an intense research area and debate continues about whether these dynamics are neural in origin or attributable in some part to intrascan headmotion or physiological confounds. Lastly, Tagliazucchi and van Someren consider the dynamics of functional connectivity and functional networks during sleep and how this brings us further to understand the role of functional networks in arousal and conscious awareness. Functional brain connectivity is organized coherently across multiple spatial scales, ranging from the microscopic scale of synapses to the macroscopic networks commonly examined with noninvasive neuroimaging methodologies. At the macroscopic scale, taking a global view of functional connectivity, Liu et al. show that the global signal may provide functional information about the brain that is potentially different from the more localized information present in particular networks. Betzel and Bassett then review the organization of brain networks across different spatial, temporal, and topological levels, with topological scale here referring to the hierarchical subnetworks, modules and clubs into which a brain network can be decomposed using graph-theoretic models. Most current studies focus on a single scale; the relationship between scales remains at the frontier of neuroimaging research. One of the tools available to help neuroscientists understand how networks function at multiple scales is computational modeling.

Analytical techniques from optimal control theory can identify such stimuli; however, solutions to the optimization problem using indirect variational approaches can be elusive in models that describe neuronal behavior. Here we develop and apply a direct gradient-based optimization algorithm to find stimulus waveforms that elicit a change in neuronal state while minimizing energy usage. We analyze standard models of neuronal behavior, the Hodgkin-Huxley and FitzHugh-Nagumo models, to show that the gradient-based algorithm: 1) enables automated exploration of a wide solution space, using stochastically generated initial waveforms that converge to multiple locally optimal solutions; and 2) finds optimal stimulus waveforms that achieve a physiological outcome condition, without a priori knowledge of the optimal terminal condition of all state variables. Analysis of biological systems using stochastically-seeded gradient methods can reveal salient dynamical mechanisms underlying the optimal control of system behavior. The gradient algorithm may also have practical applications in future work, for example, finding energy optimal waveforms for therapeutic neural stimulation that minimizes power usage and diminishes off-target effects and damage to neighboring tissue.	abnormal behavior;algorithm;biological system;cns disorder;control theory;converge;dynamical system;feasible region;gradient;hodgkin disease;huxley: the dystopia;local optimum;mathematical optimization;neuroscience discipline;optimal control;optimization problem;solutions;variational principle	Joshua Chang;David Paydarfar	2014	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-014-0525-5	computer simulation;mathematical optimization;neuroscience;membrane potential;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;computational model;statistics	ML	16.054897223430626	-71.48093831198095	82586

Participants responded to a lateralized target with the ipsilateral (compatible) or contralateral (incompatible) hand. Cue-target modality and cue-target order were manipulated. The cue preceded the target in half of the trials, and the target preceded the cue in the other half. For half of the participants, a visual cue signalled the response rule to an auditory target, while in other half, an auditory cue signalled the response rule to a visual target. Behavioural results showed a significant cue facilitation effect with response times faster for trials when the cue preceded the target, regardless of cue-target modality. The overall fastest response times were obtained in auditory cue-visual target trials. We performed groupwise independent component analysis of the cortical potentials and identified two modality-independent spatiotemporal patterns related to experimental effects. The first pattern, which resembled the early part of a contingent-negative waveform, was associated with response rule processing, regardless of cue-target presentation order and modality. The second pattern showed amplitude modulations that were dependent on stimulus modality. However, this pattern also correlated with faster response times only when the cue preceded the target and regardless of cue-target modality. Source analysis suggested that the response rule processing pattern originated from the posterior parietal, motor and cingulate regions. The pattern associated with the cue-first facilitation effect originated from cingulate and medial frontal regions. The effects carried by both patterns showed temporal overlap in the interval between the first and second stimulus presentation, but with differences in their relation to response rule processing and behavioural facilitation.	area striata structure;contingency (philosophy);fastest;gyrus cinguli;independent component analysis;medial graph;medical device incompatibility problem;modality (human–computer interaction);programming paradigm;spatiotemporal pattern;stimulus–response compatibility;waveform;facilitation;frontal lobe	Andreea Oliviana Diaconescu;Natasa Kovacevic;Anthony Randal McIntosh	2008	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.05.024	psychology;independent component analysis;speech recognition;sensory cue;communication;social psychology	ML	16.435895776212195	-77.34316966629997	82607
540d61a3b583043de5353a34a36ebcd9e15c205f	self-organizing maps as a tool to analyze movement variability.		Self-Organizing Maps possess unique properties that remove redundancies in a high-dimensional input space and map that input space to a low dimensional output space, thereby showing non-linear relationships in the input data. This ability makes Self-Organizing Maps attractive for measuring inter-limb coordination patterns. The current study takes previously published data (Bartlett, Bussey, & Flyger, 2006) used to compare the reliability of different operators digitizing gait patterns with and without anatomical markers. The trained network was simulated and analyzed qualitatively using the trajectory of activated nodes for each input vector, similar to Barton, Lees, Lisboa, & Attfield (2006). Qualitative differences in map trajectories were seen between Marker and No-Marker conditions and supported the results of the original publication that, when using 2-D videography, manually digitized markers allowed accurate estimation of movement variability, whereas the No-Marker condition did not. This finding is shown by the No-Marker trajectory travelling further from the center of the network cluster than the Marker condition. Additionally, the map trajectories revealed that changes in coordination at different phases of the movement can be identified. For most trials the Marker trajectory travels closer to the centre of the map than the No-Marker condition which, as is explained by the neighbourhood function, indicates less variability. The consistency between conventional biomechanical analysis techniques and the qualitative assessment of Self-Organizing Map outputs adds to the validity of the Self-Organizing Map as an accurate measurement tool for coordination. The ability to identify changes in coordination using the map trajectories illustrates the potential for the SelfOrganizing Map to show novel information about the coordination pattern.

22da1c75978d381eaca2624a2640b34ccafda44b	attention and working memory in elderly: the influence of a distracting environment		The present work investigated the effect of a distracting environment in the performance of attentional and working memory (WM) tasks in elderly participants. To this end, forty elderly performed two attentional tasks (simple reaction time and go/no-go tasks), and three WM tasks (arithmetic, memory for digits and sequences of letters and numbers). Each participant performed the tasks in a distracting and a non-distracting environment, with an interval of 14–21 days between sessions. The results revealed better performance in the attentional tasks when these were done in the non-distracting environment, as compared to when they were done in the distracting environment. Specifically, participants provided more accurate responses, fewer false alarms and omissions when responding in the non-distracting environment than when responding in the distracting environment. Participants were also faster at providing correct responses in the go/no-go task when it was performed in the non-distracting environment. As for the memory tasks, the effect of type of environment was significant only in the memory for digits in a forward direction task. Our data suggest the need to consider the potential damaging consequences of distracting environments when the elderly have to perform tasks that demand their attention. Specific examples of such situations are presented in the discussion (e.g., distracting effect of environment on medical and on psychological evaluations).	digit structure;evaluation;memory disorders;memory, short-term	Pedro F.

Using electrolocation of weakly electric fish as a model system, we study how the spatiotemporal features of electric field modulated depending on the distance and size of an object are encoded into the spatial distribution and time interval between burst spikes of neuron population. We showed that the information about distance and size of object are represented as a function of the spatial area of and time interval between the synchronous firing of neuron population in a higher nucleus.	neural coding;sensor	Kazuhisa Fujita;Yoshiki Kashimori;Takeshi Kambara	2005	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2004.10.013	sensory system;computer vision;electroreception;electric field;machine learning;neural coding;electric fish	ML	18.340373961036324	-70.78814017800107	82853
ad98046b4a0720f0085c060154d6d230da63be18	dissociating landmark stability from orienting value using functional magnetic resonance imaging		Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a role in using environmental landmarks to help orientate oneself in space. It has also been consistently implicated in processing landmarks that remain fixed in a permanent location. However, it is not clear whether the RSC represents the permanent landmarks themselves or instead the orienting relevance of these landmarks. In previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, these features have been conflated—stable landmarks were always useful for orienting. Here, we dissociated these two key landmark attributes to investigate which one best reflects the function of the RSC. Before scanning, participants learned the features of novel landmarks about which they had no prior knowledge. During fMRI scanning, we found that the RSC was more engaged when people viewed permanent compared with transient landmarks and was not responsive to the orienting relevance of landmarks. Activity in RSC was also related to the amount of landmark permanence information a person had acquired and, as knowledge increased, the more the RSC drove responses in the anterior thalamus while viewing permanent landmarks. In contrast, the angular gyrus and the hippocampus were engaged by the orienting relevance of landmarks, but not their permanence, with the hippocampus also sensitive to the distance between relevant landmarks and target locations. We conclude that the coding of permanent landmarks in RSC may drive processing in regions like anterior thalamus, with possible implications for the efficacy of functions such as navigation.	angularjs;anterior nuclear group;convolutional code;magnetic resonance imaging;relevance;remodels the structure of chromatin;structure of angular gyrus;thalamic structure;fmri;retrosplenial cortex	Stephen D.

The classical long-term synaptic plasticity between parallel fibers (PFs) and Purkinje cells (PCs), which is driven by the inferior olive (IO), can only account for limited aspects of learning. Recently, the role of additional forms of plasticity in the granular layer, molecular layer and deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) has been considered. In particular, learning at DCN synapses allows for generalization, but convergence to a stable state requires hundreds of repetitions. In this paper we have explored the putative role of the IO-DCN connection by endowing it with adaptable weights and exploring its implications in a closed-loop robotic manipulation task. Our results show that IO-DCN plasticity accelerates convergence of learning by up to two orders of magnitude without conflicting with the generalization properties conferred by DCN plasticity. Thus, this model suggests that multiple distributed learning mechanisms provide a key for explaining the complex properties of procedural learning and open up new experimental questions for synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar network.	acclimatization;cerebellar nuclei;cerebellar cortex structure;conflict (psychology);control theory;controllers;convergence (action);cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;dcn gene;dynamic circuit network;elegant degradation;embedded system;embedding;gene regulatory network;generalization (psychology);granular computing;inferior olivary nucleus;learning disorders;lung consolidation;merrf syndrome;neuronal plasticity;perseveration;purkinje cells;robot;semiconductor consolidation;simulation;synapses;synaptic package manager;telephone switchboard;tissue fiber;while;word lists by frequency;x11 color names;orders - hl7publishingdomain	Niceto R.

Here we present a synaptic plasticity rule which is controlled by the properties of the pre- and postsynaptic signals. Using recorded membrane traces of back-propagating and dendritic spikes we demonstrate that LTP and LTD will depend specifically on the shape of the postsynaptic depolarization at a given dendritic site. We find that asymmetrical spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can be replaced by temporally symmetrical plasticity within physiologically relevant time windows if the postsynaptic depolarization rises shallow. Presynaptically the rule depends on the NMDA channel characteristic, and the model predicts that an increase in Mg2+ will attenuate the STDP curve without changing its shape. Furthermore, the model suggests that the profile of LTD should be governed by the postsynaptic signal while that of LTP mainly depends on the presynaptic signal shape.	dendrites;dendritic spine;dependent ml;linux test project (ltp);long-term potentiation;long-term synaptic depression;microsoft windows;n-methylaspartate;neuron;neuronal plasticity;rule (guideline);synaptic package manager;tissue membrane;tracing (software)	Ausra Saudargiene;Bernd Porr;Florentin Wörgötter	2004	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-004-0525-z	synaptic fatigue;psychology;synaptic plasticity;post-tetanic potentiation;homosynaptic plasticity;neuroscience;postsynaptic potential;synaptic augmentation;developmental psychology;inhibitory postsynaptic potential;anti-hebbian learning;homeostatic plasticity;metaplasticity;magnesium;nonsynaptic plasticity;spike-timing-dependent plasticity;communication;dendritic spike;synaptic scaling	ML	18.132115609374964	-72.31287192481095	83219

DLPFC responses were monitored with fNIRs while 8 participants (4 with high practice, 4 novices) completed a quasirealistic computerized Warship Commander Task with various levels of difficulty. The results show that greater expertise was associated with relatively lower oxygenation (less neural activity) at low to moderate levels of taskload, but higher oxygenation and better performance at high levels of taskload. For novices, oxygenation was higher at moderate levels of taskload, but dropped precipitously at higher levels of taskload, along with performance, consistent with disengaging from the task.

Most previous studies have examined the global aspects of biological motion perception, but local motion processing has received much less attention. Here we provide direct psychophysical and electrophysiological evidence that human observers are intrinsically tuned to the characteristics of local biological motion cues independent of global configuration. Using a modified central cueing paradigm, we show that observers involuntarily orient their attention towards the walking direction of feet motion sequences, which triggers an early directing attention negativity (EDAN) in the occipito-parietal region 100-160ms after the stimulus onset. Notably, such effects are sensitive to the orientation of the local cues and are independent of whether the observers are aware of the biological nature of the motion. Our findings unambiguously demonstrate the automatic processing of local biological motion without explicit recognition. More importantly, with the discovery that local biological motion signals modulate attention, we highlight the functional importance of such processing in the brain.	body dysmorphic disorders;body position;cumulative trauma disorders;entity;foot;humans;interaction;negativity (quantum mechanics);onset (audio);poor posture;precipitating factors;programming paradigm;vertebrates;observers	Li Wang;Xiaoying Yang;Jinfu Shi;Yi Jiang	2014	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.08.041	psychology;computer vision;biological motion;communication;social psychology	ML	17.124329265123688	-75.97555220931564	83407

Our reduced model segregates the fast currents for sodium spiking into a proximal, soma-like, compartment and the slower calcium and calcium-mediated currents into a dendrite-like compartment. In each model periodic bursting gives way to repetitive soma spiking as somatic injected current increases. Steady dendritic stimulation can produce periodic bursting of significantly higher frequency (8–20 Hz) than can steady somatic input (<8 Hz). Bursting in our model occurs only for an intermediate range of electronic coupling conductance. It depends on the segregation of channel types and on the coupling current that flows back-and-forth between compartments. When the soma and dendrite are tightly coupled electrically, our model reduces to a single compartment and does not burst. Network simulations with our model using excitatory AMPA and NMDA synapses (without inhibition) give results similar to those obtained with the complex cable model [Traub et al, 1991; Traub et al, 1992]. Brief stimulation of a single cell in a resting network produces multiple synchronized population bursts, with fast AMPA synapses providing the dominant synchronizing mechanism. The number of bursts increases with the level of maximal NMDA conductance. For high enough maximal NMDA conductance synchronized bursting repeats indefinitely. We find that two factors can cause the cells to desynchronize when AMPA synapses are blocked: heterogeneity of properties amongst cells and intrinsically chaotic burst dynamics. But even when cells are identical, they may synchronize only approximately rather than exactly. Since our model has a limited number of parameters and variables, we have studied its cellular and network dynamics computationally with relative ease and over wide parameter ranges. Thereby, we identify some qualitative features that parallel or are distinguished from those of other neuronal systems; e.g., we discuss how bursting here differs from that in some classical models.

4144b8ccc8a85f6fdcc0b2aa87f1de72bff192a5	a review of network inference techniques for neural activation time series		Studying neural connectivity is considered one of the most promising and challenging areas of modern neuroscience. The underpinnings of cognition are hidden in the way neurons interact with each other. However, our experimental methods of studying real neural connections at a microscopic level are still arduous and costly. An efficient alternative is to infer connectivity based on the neuronal activations using computational methods. A reliable method for network inference, would not only facilitate research of neural circuits without the need of laborious experiments but also reveal insights on the underlying mechanisms of the brain. In this work, we perform a review of methods for neural circuit inference given the activation time series of the neural population. Approaching it from machine learning perspective, we divide the methodologies into unsupervised and supervised learning. The methods are based on correlation metrics, probabilistic point processes, and neural networks. Furthermore, we add a data mining methodology inspired by influence estimation in social networks as a new supervised learning approach. For comparison, we use the small version of the Chalearn Connectomics competition, that is accompanied with ground truth connections between neurons. The experiments indicate that unsupervised learning methods perform better, however, supervised methods could surpass them given enough data and resources.	artificial neural network;cognition;connectomics;data mining;experiment;ground truth;machine learning;neural ensemble;neural oscillation;social network;supervised learning;time series;unsupervised learning	George Panagopoulos	2018	CoRR		machine learning;mathematics;supervised learning;artificial intelligence;probabilistic logic;artificial neural network;unsupervised learning;connectomics;biological neural network;inference;population	ML	22.198541686895712	-74.55093392815141	83862
2be2ed3e158dcd0ba5372df96b23ebdda8398789	polarity-dependent effects of biparietal transcranial direct current stimulation on the interplay between target location and distractor saliency in visual attention		Visual attention allows the allocation of limited neural processing resources to stimuli based on their behavioral priorities. The selection of task-relevant visual targets entails the processing of multiple competing stimuli and the suppression of distractors that may be either perceptually salient or perceptually similar to targets. The posterior parietal cortex controls the interaction between top–down (task-driven) and bottom–up (stimulus-driven) processes competing for attentional selection, as well as spatial distribution of attention. Here, we examined whether biparietal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would modulate the interaction between top–down and bottom–up processes in visual attention. Visual attention function was assessed with a visual discrimination task, in which a lateralized target was presented alone or together with a contralateral, similar or salient, distractor. The accuracy and RTs were measured before and during three stimulation sessions (sham, right anodal/left cathodal, left anodal/right cathodal). The analyses demonstrated (i) polarity-dependent effects of tDCS on the accuracy of target discrimination, but only when the target was presented with a similar distractor; (ii) the tDCS-triggered effects on the accuracy of discriminating targets, accompanied by a similar distractor, varied according to the target location; and (iii) overall detrimental effects of tDCS on RTs were observed, regardless of target location, distractor type, and polarity of the stimulation. We conclude that the observed polarity, distractor type, and target location-dependent effects of biparietal tDCS on the accuracy of target detection resulted from both a modulation of the interaction between top–down and bottom–up attentional processes and the interhemispheric competition mechanisms guiding attentional selection and spatial deployment of attention.	area striata structure;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;deploy;kohn–sham equations;modulation;parietal lobe;transcranial direct current stimulation;ultrasonography, doppler, transcranial;zero suppression;polarity	Magdalena Chechlacz;Peter C.

Younger and older adults practiced serial reaction time tasks that were arranged in a repeated or an interleaved order on 2 successive days. Retention was tested on Day 5. For both groups, reaction times in the interleaved condition were slower than the repetitive condition during practice, but the reverse was true during retention on Day 5. After interleaved practice, changes in M1 excitability measured by paired-pulse TMS were greater than after repetitive practice, and this effect was more pronounced in older adults. Moreover, the increased M1 excitability correlated with the benefit of interleaved practice. BOLD signal was also increased for interleaved compared to repetitive practice in both groups. However, the pattern of correlations between increased BOLD during practice and subsequent benefit of the interleaved condition differed by group. In younger adults, dorsolateral-prefrontal activity during practice was related to this benefit, while in older adults, activation in sensorimotor regions and rostral prefrontal cortex during practice correlated with the benefit of interleaving on retention. Older adults may engage compensatory mechanisms during interleaved practice such as increasing sensorimotor recruitment which in turn benefits learning.	auditory recruitment;causal filter;cerebral cortex;estradiol;forward error correction;hemodynamics;interference (communication);lung consolidation;motor skills;neuronal plasticity;prefrontal cortex;programming paradigm;semiconductor consolidation;benefit	Chien-Ho Lin;Ming-Chang Chiang;Allan D.

However, it is unknown whether any regional and/or hemispheric specificity exists regarding its involvement in the different memory stages, such as encoding and retrieval. We directly addressed this issue by conducting an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study of memory for faces with different emotional expressions, in which both encoding and recognition were scanned. We found significant amygdala activation associated with both successful encoding and retrieval of fearful faces. Critically, a direct comparison between both stages revealed that whereas the right amygdala was involved in emotional memory formation, the retrieval of those memories relied on the left amygdala. Thus, this study demonstrates a hemispheric dissociation of amygdala involvement in different stages of emotional memory in humans.	amygdaloid structure;behavior;convergence (action);face;fear (mental process);magnetic resonance imaging;memory disorders;scanning;sensitivity and specificity;fmri	Karine Sergerie;Martin Lepage;Jorge L.

In an identical MEG/fMRI paradigm, 10 participants viewed reversing square wave gratings at 2 spatial frequencies [0.5 and 3 cycles per degree (cpd)] reversing at 5 temporal frequencies (0, 1 6, 10, 15 Hz). Three-dimensional images of MEG source power were generated with synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) and showed a high degree of spatial correspondence with BOLD responses in primary visual cortex with a mean spatial separation of 6.5 mm, but the two modalities showed different tuning characteristics. The gamma rhythm showed a clear increase in induced power for the high spatial frequency stimulus while BOLD showed no difference in activity for the two spatial frequencies used. Both imaging modalities showed a general increase of activity with temporal frequency, however, BOLD plateaued around 6-10 Hz while the MEG generally increased with a dip exhibited at 6 Hz. These results demonstrate that the two modalities may show activation in similar spatial locations but that the functional pattern of these activations may differ in a complex manner, suggesting that they may be tuned to different aspects of neuronal activity.	aperture (software);area striata structure;cerebral cortex;gamma rhythm;hearing loss, high-frequency;hertz (hz);magnetoencephalography;programming paradigm;propylene glycol;reversing: secrets of reverse engineering;snuff tobacco;synthetic intelligence;fmri	Suresh D.

6c2cf5cdd986689b926397c8bb7e0337652c7580	novel biomarker for evaluating ischemic stress using an electrogram derived phase space		The underlying pathophysiology of ischemia is poorly understood, resulting in unreliable clinical diagnosis of this disease. This limited knowledge of underlying mechanisms suggested a data driven approach, which seeks to identify patterns in the ECG data that can be linked statistically to underlying behavior and conditions of ischemic tissue. Previous studies have suggested that an approach known as Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) can identify trajectories, or manifolds, that are sensitive to different spatiotemporal consequences of ischemic stress, and thus serve as potential clinically relevant biomarkers. We applied the LE approach to measured transmural potentials in several canine preparations, recorded during control and ischemic conditions, and discovered regions on an approximated QRS-derived manifold that were sensitive to ischemia. By identifying a vector pointing to ischemia-associated changes to the manifold and measuring the shift in trajectories along that vector during ischemia, which we denote as Mshift, it was possible to also pull that vector back into signal space and determine which electrodes were responsible for driving the observed changes in the manifold. We refer to the signal space change as the manifold differential (Mdiff). Both the Mdiff and Mshift metrics show a similar degree ofsensitivity to ischemic changes as standard metrics applied during the ST segment in detecting ischemic regions. The new metrics also were able to distinguish between sub-types of ischemia. Thus our results indicate that it may be possible to use the Mshift and Mdiff metrics along with ST derived metrics to determine whether tissue within the myocardium is ischemic or not.	action potential;approximation algorithm;biological markers;differential diagnosis;ischemia;laplacian matrix;myocardium;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;sensor;electrode;manifold	Wilson Good;Burak Erem;Jaume Coll-Font;Dana H.

In feedforward pathways we mainly observe stages of feature detection and integration. The computational role of the descending pathways at different stages of processing remains mainly unknown. Based on empirical findings we suggest that the top-down feedback pathways subserve a context-dependent gain control mechanism. We propose a new computational model for recurrent contour processing in which normalized activities of orientation selective contrast cells are fed forward to the next processing stage. There, the arrangement of input activation is matched against local patterns of contour shape. The resulting activities are subsequently fed back to the previous stage to locally enhance those initial measurements that are consistent with the top-down generated responses. In all, we suggest a computational theory for recurrent processing in the visual cortex in which the significance of local measurements is evaluated on the basis of a broader visual context that is represented in terms of contour code patterns. The model serves as a framework to link physiological with perceptual data gathered in psychophysical experiments. It handles a variety of perceptual phenomena, such as the local grouping of fragmented shape outline, texture surround and density effects, and the interpolation of illusory contours.	cerebral cortex;circumference;clinical use template;computational model;context-sensitive language;cross-interleaved reed–solomon coding;experiment;feature detection (computer vision);feature detection (web development);feedforward neural network;hemihyperplasia, isolated;ih ab:prthr:pt:ser/plas:ord;inhaler dosing unit;inspiration function;interpolation imputation technique;population parameter;projections and predictions;theory of computation;tissue fiber;top-down and bottom-up design;weight function;ribosome-associated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process	Heiko Neumann;Wolfgang Sepp	1999	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s004220050573	psychology;computer simulation;computer vision;automatic gain control;computability theory;visual perception;computer science;machine learning;context-dependent memory;top-down and bottom-up design;feature detection;communication;data collection	ML	17.936963576390966	-74.4540202316268	84907
d3ff37a70a3625c410dd9cf9827a57dcc2334b0f	impaired bottom-up effective connectivity between amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in unmedicated adolescents with major depression: results from a dynamic causal modeling analysis	dynamic causal modeling;effective connectivity;adolescent;functional connectivity;emotion;depression	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a significant contributor to lifetime disability and frequently emerges in adolescence, yet little is known about the neural mechanisms of MDD in adolescents. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis is an innovative tool that can shed light on neural network abnormalities. A DCM analysis was conducted to test several frontolimbic effective connectivity models in 27 adolescents with MDD and 21 healthy adolescents. The best neural model for each person was identified using Bayesian model selection. The findings revealed that the two adolescent groups fit similar optimal neural models. The best across-groups model was then used to infer upon both within-group and between-group tests of intrinsic and modulation parameters of the network connections. First, for model validation, within-group tests revealed robust evidence for bottom-up connectivity, but less evidence for strong top-down connectivity in both groups. Second, we tested for differences between groups on the validated parameters of the best model. This revealed that adolescents with MDD had significantly weaker bottom-up connectivity in one pathway, from amygdala to sgACC (p=0.008), than healthy controls. This study provides the first examination of effective connectivity using DCM within neural circuitry implicated in emotion processing in adolescents with MDD. These findings aid in advancing understanding the neurobiology of early-onset MDD during adolescence and have implications for future research investigating how effective connectivity changes across contexts, with development, over the course of the disease, and after intervention.	adolescent (age group);amygdaloid structure;artificial neural network;bayes factor;bayesian network;best practice;biological neural networks;bottom-up parsing;bottom-up proteomics;causal filter;causality;cerebral cortex;congenital abnormality;dicom;disease progression;electronic circuit;emergence;emotions;gene regulatory network;human placental lactogen;illness (finding);inference;large;major depressive disorder;model selection;modulation;neurobiology;onset (audio);top-down and bottom-up design;veterans disability claims	Donald R.

However, how rates and synchrony comodulate and which aspects of inputs are effectively encoded, particularly in the presence of dynamical inputs, are unanswered questions. We examine theoretically how mixed information in dynamic mean input and noise input is represented by dynamic population firing rates and synchrony. In a subthreshold regime, amplitudes of spatially uncorrelated noise are encoded up to a fairly high input frequency, but this requires both rate and synchrony output channels. In a suprathreshold regime, means and common noise amplitudes can be simultaneously and separately encoded by rates and synchrony, respectively, but the input frequency for which this is possible has a lower limit.	body dysmorphic disorders;dynamical system;population;white noise	Naoki Masuda	2006	Neural Computation	10.1162/089976606774841521	telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;frequency;mathematics;population dynamics;communication;code;synchronous learning;artificial neural network;models of neural computation	ML	20.810524898793272	-70.78532168144397	85070

1ce276d9117d0f0bfb4444d563e3b37ae4a6bfe4	parsing sequentially presented commands in a large-scale biologically realistic brain model		We present a neural mechanism for interpreting and executing visually presented commands. These are simple verb-noun commands (such as WRITE THREE) and can also include conditionals ([if] SEE SEVEN, [then] WRITE THREE). We apply this to a simplified version of our large-scale functional brain model “Spaun”, where input is a 28x28 pixel visual stimulus, with a different pattern for each word. Output controls a simulated arm, giving hand-written answers. Cortical areas for categorizing, storing, and interpreting information are controlled by the basal ganglia (action selection) and thalamus (routing). The final model has ~100,000 LIF spiking neurons. We show that the model is extremely robust to neural damage (40% of neurons can be destroyed before performance drops significantly). Performance also drops for visual display times less than 250ms. Importantly, the system also scales to large vocabularies (~100,000 nouns and verbs) without requiring an exponentially large number of neurons.	action selection;basal (phylogenetics);categorization;ganglia;low insertion force;parsing;pixel;routing;spiking neural network;vocabulary	Terrence C.

676ff354c49b76fe5df2aa25a7b740b465a49937	temporaltracks: visual analytics for exploration of 4d fmri time-series coactivation		Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a 4D medical imaging modality that depicts a proxy of neuronal activity in a series of temporal scans. Statistical processing of the modality shows promise in uncovering insights about the functioning of the brain, such as the default mode network, and characteristics of mental disorders. Current statistical processing generally summarises the temporal signals between brain regions into a single data point to represent the 'coactivation' of the regions. That is, how similar are their temporal patterns over the scans. However, the potential of such processing is limited by issues of possible data misrepresentation due to uncertainties, e.g. noise in the data. Moreover, it has been shown that brain signals are characterised by brief traces of coactivation, which are lost in the single value representations. To alleviate the issues, alternate statistical processes have been used, however creating effective techniques has proven difficult due to problems, e.g. issues with noise, which often require user input to uncover. Visual analytics, therefore, through its ability to interactively exploit human expertise, presents itself as an interesting approach of benefit to the domain. In this work, we present the conceptual design behind TemporalTracks, our visual analytics system for exploration of 4D fMRI time-series coactivation data, utilising a visual metaphor to effectively present coactivation data for easier understanding. We describe our design with a case study visually analysing Human Connectome Project data, demonstrating that TemporalTracks can uncover temporal events that would otherwise be hidden in standard analysis.	data point;data quality;human connectome project;interactivity;medical imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);resonance;time series;tracing (software);visual analytics;voxel	Michael de Ridder;Karsten Klein;Jinman Kim	2017		10.1145/3095140.3095153	coactivation;computer science;artificial intelligence;human connectome project;computer vision;conceptual design;default mode network;visual analytics;exploit;functional magnetic resonance imaging;medical imaging	ML	22.56136351980002	-76.56908346712204	85349
f7485cccf85382d552235a5cfa04915a315ef0bd	a depression network of functionally connected regions discovered via multi-attribute canonical correlation graphs		To establish brain network properties associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) data, we develop a multi-attribute graph model to construct a region-level functional connectivity network that uses all voxel level information. For each region pair, we define the strength of the connectivity as the kernel canonical correlation coefficient between voxels in the two regions; and we develop a permutation test to assess the statistical significance. We also construct a network based classifier for making predictions on the risk of MDD. We apply our method to Rs-fMRI data from 20 MDD patients and 20 healthy control subjects in the Predictors of Remission in Depression to Individual and Combined Treatments (PReDICT) study. Using this method, MDD patients can be distinguished from healthy control subjects based on significant differences in the strength of regional connectivity. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed method using simulationstudies.		Jian Kang;F. DuBois Bowman;Helen S.

Different groups have extended Hodgkin-Huxley equations into stochastic differential equations to capture the effects of ion channel noise analytically (Fox & Lu, 1994; Linaro, Storace, & Giugliano, 2011; Güler, 2013). Studies have shown that the accuracy of spiking statistics by Fox and Lu's model does not match well with the corresponding statistics from the exact microscopic simulations. The models of both Linaro et al. and Güler, however, were found to produce highly accurate statistics. Here we extend the examination of these models to the case in which the rate functions for the opening and closing of gates are under the influence of noise. For that purpose, the usual rate functions are accompanied additively by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck–type stochastic angular variables. Moreover, we argue that the existence of such noise in the rate functions is a plausible physiological phenomenon for finite-size membranes. It is observed that the presence of noise in the rates is not effective on the degree of inaccuracies within the Fox and Lu model. Güler model's accuracy is found to remain high as in the case of noise free rates. But the performance of Linaro et al.’s model is seen to degrade seriously with the increasing strength of the introduced rate function noise. We attribute this failure of Linaro et al.’s model to the use of the covariance function of open channels at the steady state, in its derivation.	angularjs;approximation algorithm;closing (morphology);excitable medium;experiment;hodgkin–huxley model;huxley: the dystopia;ion channel;ions;iontophoresis;lu decomposition;mental suffering;noise (electronics);numerical analysis;physiological phenomena;severo ornstein;simulation;specification;steady state;stochastic process;tissue membrane;visual foxpro	Marifi Güler	2013	Neural Computation	10.1162/NECO_a_00487	econometrics;simulation;mathematics;statistics	AI	11.106354205834363	-68.51983491920339	85706

The usual approach proceeds by normalizing brain volumes to a common three-dimensional template. However, a large part of the data acquired in fMRI aims at localizing cortical activity, and methods working on the cortical surface may provide better inter-subject registration than the standard procedures that process the data in the volume. Nevertheless, few assessments of the performance of surface-based (2D) versus volume-based (3D) procedures have been shown so far, mostly because inter-subject cortical surface maps are not easily obtained. In this paper we present a systematic comparison of 2D versus 3D group-level inference procedures, by using cluster-level and voxel-level statistics assessed by permutation, in random effects (RFX) and mixed-effects analyses (MFX). We consider different schemes to perform meaningful comparisons between thresholded statistical maps in the volume and on the cortical surface. We find that surface-based multi-subject statistical analyses are generally more sensitive than their volume-based counterpart, in the sense that they detect slightly denser networks of regions when performing peak-level detection; this effect is less clear for cluster-level inference and is reduced by smoothing. Surface-based inference also increases the reliability of the activation maps.	clinical use template;cognition disorders;evaluation procedure;inference;map;neuroimaging;numerous;outline of brain mapping;random effects model;smoothing (statistical technique);standard operating procedure;voxel;fmri	Alan Tucholka;Virgile Fritsch;Jean-Baptiste Poline;Bertrand Thirion	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.06.019	econometrics;statistical inference;computer science;data mining;statistics	ML	24.13309531810528	-79.58841016116145	86078

However, errors accumulate rapidly when velocity inputs are integrated in existing models of grid cell activity. To produce grid-cell-like responses, these models would require frequent resets triggered by external sensory cues. Such inadequacies, shared by various models, cast doubt on the dead-reckoning potential of the grid cell system. Here we focus on the question of accurate path integration, specifically in continuous attractor models of grid cell activity. We show, in contrast to previous models, that continuous attractor models can generate regular triangular grid responses, based on inputs that encode only the rat's velocity and heading direction. We consider the role of the network boundary in the integration performance of the network and show that both periodic and aperiodic networks are capable of accurate path integration, despite important differences in their attractor manifolds. We quantify the rate at which errors in the velocity integration accumulate as a function of network size and intrinsic noise within the network. With a plausible range of parameters and the inclusion of spike variability, our model networks can accurately integrate velocity inputs over a maximum of approximately 10-100 meters and approximately 1-10 minutes. These findings form a proof-of-concept that continuous attractor dynamics may underlie velocity integration in the dorsolateral medial entorhinal cortex. The simulations also generate pertinent upper bounds on the accuracy of integration that may be achieved by continuous attractor dynamics in the grid cell network. We suggest experiments to test the continuous attractor model and differentiate it from models in which single cells establish their responses independently of each other.	course (navigation);dna integration;dead reckoning;encode;experiment;grid cells;medial graph;relevance;simulation;spatial variability;structure of entorhinal cortex;velocity (software development)	Yoram Burak;Ila R.

An ongoing challenge is to create noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques that offer sufficient resolution, tissue contrast, accuracy and precision to allow for characterization of cortical architecture over an entire living human brain. One exciting development is the advent of fast, high-resolution quantitative mapping of basic MR parameters that reflect cortical myeloarchitecture. Here, we outline some of the theoretical and technical advances underlying this technique, particularly in terms of measuring and correcting for transmit and receive radio frequency field inhomogeneities. We also discuss new directions in analytic techniques, including higher resolution reconstructions of the cortical surface. We then discuss two recent applications of this technique. The first compares individual and group myelin maps to functional retinotopic maps in the same individuals, demonstrating a close relationship between functionally and myeloarchitectonically defined areal boundaries (as well as revealing an interesting disparity in a highly studied visual area). The second combines tonotopic and myeloarchitectonic mapping to localize primary auditory areas in individual healthy adults, using a similar strategy as combined electrophysiological and post-mortem myeloarchitectonic studies in non-human primates.	autopsy;binocular disparity;cerebral cortex;color gradient;fertilization;hearing problem;image resolution;imaging techniques;large;map;myelin;neuroscience discipline;population parameter;progressive disease;radio frequency;resonance;sample variance;silver stain method;staining method;video-in video-out;word lists by frequency;myelination;quantitative	Antoine Lutti;Frederic Dick;Martin I.

Since the information exchanged is encoded in brain waves and measurable by electroencephalography (EEG) it is reasonable to assume that it can be extracted with an appropriate method. In our study we made an attempt to extract the information using an artificial neural network (ANN), which can be considered as a stimulus-response model with a state observer. The EEG was recorded from three subjects while they performed a modified Sternberg task that required them to respond to each task with the answer """"true"""" or """"false"""". The study revealed that a stimulus-response model can successfully be identified by observing phase-demodulated theta-band EEG signals 1 s prior to a subject's answer. The results also showed that it was possible to predict the answers from the EEG signals with an average reliability of 75% for all the subjects. From this we concluded that it is possible to observe the system states and thus predict the correct answer using the EEG signals as inputs."""	adaptive system;anion exchange protein 1, erythrocyte;artificial neural network;brain waves;complex system;electroencephalography phase synchronization;estimated;extraction;information exchange;memory disorders;physical activity;tracing (software)	Vito Logar;Ales Belic;Blaž Koritnik;Simon Brezan;Janez Zidar;Rihard Karba;Drago Matko	2008	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2008.03.012	systems modeling;cognition;information exchange;prediction;electroencephalography;computer science;artificial intelligence;central nervous system;machine learning;working memory;reliability;state observer;cerebro;observer;artificial neural network	ML	20.871871475010295	-71.04227610627315	86458

The main advantage of the EEG is its high temporal resolution, in the scale of milliseconds, while the main advantage of fMRI is the detection of functional activity with good spatial resolution. The advantages of each modality seem to complement each other, providing better insight in the neuronal activity of the brain. The main goal of combining information from both modalities is to increase the spatial and the temporal localization of the underlying neuronal activity captured by each modality. This paper presents a novel technique based on the combination of these two modalities (EEG, fMRI) that allow a better representation and understanding of brain activities in time. EEG is modeled as a sequence of topographies, based on the notion of microstates. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used to model the temporal evolution of the topography of the average Event Related Potential (ERP). For each model the Fisher score of the sequence is calculated by taking the gradient of the trained model parameters. The Fisher score describes how this sequence deviates from the learned HMM. Canonical Partial Least Squares (CPLS) were used to decompose the two datasets and fuse the EEG and fMRI features. In order to test the effectiveness of this method, the results of this methodology were compared with the results of CPLS using the average ERP signal of a single channel. The presented methodology was able to derive components that co-vary between EEG and fMRI and present significant differences between the two tasks.	bridging (networking);classification;complement system proteins;cross-covariance;description;dimensionality reduction;erp;electroencephalography phase synchronization;epilepsies, partial;feature vector;fisher information;fuse device component;fusion procedure;gradient;hidden markov model;markov chain;modality (human–computer interaction);multimodal interaction;partial least squares regression;population parameter;potentials, event-related;principal component analysis;resonance;sample variance;score bug;spatial variability;synapomorphy;topography;fmri	Kostas Michalopoulos;Nikolaos G.

Forward and backward probes of PAL are nearly perfectly correlated; for probed recall of a learned serial list, the correlation is moderate. We suggest that SL and PAL are ends of a continuum within a single theoretical framework. A single parameter controls the degree to which pairs of list items are isolated from the rest of the list. This Isolation Principle may be 6exibly implemented into many models, and we demonstrate, in simulations, how Isolation can account for the distinction between memory for pairs and triples. c © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Unsupervised clustering and independent component analysis (ICA) have been used to identify such spatio-temporal networks. While these approaches have been useful for estimating these networks at the subject-level, comparisons over groups or experimental conditions require further methodological development. In this paper, we tackle this problem by showing how self-organizing maps (SOMs) can be compared within a Frechean inferential framework. Here, we summarize the mean SOM in each group as a Frechet mean with respect to a metric on the space of SOMs. The advantage of this approach is twofold. Firstly, it allows the visualization of the mean SOM in each experimental condition. Secondly, this Frechean approach permits one to draw inference on group differences, using permutation of the group labels. We consider the use of different distance functions, and introduce one extension of the classical sum of minimum distance (SMD) between two SOMs, which take into account the spatial pattern of the fMRI data. The validity of these methods is illustrated on synthetic data. Through these simulations, we show that the two distance functions of interest behave as expected, in the sense that the ones capturing temporal and spatial aspects of the SOMs are more likely to reach significance under simulated scenarios characterized by temporal, spatial [and spatio-temporal] differences, respectively. In addition, a re-analysis of a classical experiment on visually-triggered emotions demonstrates the usefulness of this methodology. In this study, the multivariate functional patterns typical of the subjects exposed to pleasant and unpleasant stimuli are found to be more similar than the ones of the subjects exposed to emotionally neutral stimuli. In this re-analysis, the group-level SOM output units with the smallest sample Jaccard indices were compared with standard GLM group-specific z-score maps, and provided considerable levels of agreement. Taken together, these results indicate that our proposed methods can cast new light on existing data by adopting a global analytical perspective on functional MRI paradigms.	cluster analysis;computation (action);estimated;generalized linear model;imagery;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;inference;inferential programming;inferential theory of learning;jaccard index;license;neuroimaging;organizing (structure);programming paradigm;self-organization;self-organizing map;service mapping description;simulation;small;spatiotemporal pattern;specification;statistical test;storage module device;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;temporal lobe;unsupervised learning;fmri;statistical cluster;z-score	Arnaud P.

0e0d9eae5872f3f408f89c60194fd0fdfd6f2753	a novel framework for analyzing cortical folding patterns based on sulcal baselines and gyral crestlines		One of the most important morphometric features of cerebral cortex is its convex (gyri) and concave (sulci) folding pattern. Previous studies have shown that sulci and gyri have different anatomical and connectivity patterns. However, most cortical morphometric studies do not differentiate them and few studies have focused on the convolution folding pattern of gyri and sulci separately. In this paper, we developed a novel computational framework to study the morphometric patterns of gyral crestline and sulcal baseline in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Specifically, the crestlines of eight major gyri and the baseline of two major sulci have been measured on each hemisphere. Our results showed dominantly decreased cortical thickness and increased curvature to the tangential direction of cortical sphere in the brain regions of ASD. Moreover, by using curvature along the lines as its shape feature vector, k-means clustering was performed to cluster the lines with similar shape patterns. Both ASD dominant clusters with more curved patterns and healthy control dominant clusters with less curved patterns were identified. These results coincide with the findings in brain developmental studies that thinner cortex will be more curved and our study may add new insights to the developing mechanism of the cause of ASD.	baseline (configuration management);cluster analysis;concave function;convolution;feature vector;k-means clustering;morphometrics;thickness (graph theory)	Fangfei Ge;Hanbo Chen;Tuo Zhang;Xianqiao Wang;Lin Yuan;Xintao Hu;Lei Guo;Tianming Liu	2018	2018 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018)	10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363750	computer vision;autism;computer science;pattern recognition;feature vector;artificial intelligence;autism spectrum disorder;cerebral cortex;curvature;cluster analysis	Vision	22.81440724687435	-78.14755846859205	86727

The model uses synchronous oscillations in order to bind an item and its corresponding context into one representation, while asynchronous oscillations are used to separate the representations. Due to the bindings, the model can ascribe proper meanings to items, as demonstrated by the replication of the effective rejection of distractors. The model predicts the inherent limitation of WM capacity in range of 1 to around six items that arises from the trade-off between the number and stability of separate oscillations. This trade-off depends on the strength of lateral inhibition exerted. The systematic variation in inhibition led to the exact replication of capacity distribution observed in a large sample, as well as to the prediction of a few novel capacity-related experimental effects. Finally, we showed that the differences in capacity can underlie the differences in a more complex ability of detecting relations governing a pattern of stimuli, called relational integration, which is known to be strongly related to the effectiveness of higher-order cognitive processing. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

5c853c521f96a652c9bf55567343a48a12788abe	the impact of preprocessing pipeline choice in univariate and multivariate analyses of pet data		It has long been recognized that the data preprocessing chain is a critical part of a neuroimaging experiment. In this work we evaluate the impact of preprocessing choices in univariate and multivariate analyses of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data. Thirty healthy participants were scanned twice in a High-Resolution Research Tomography PET scanner with the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) radioligand [11 C]DASB. Binding potentials (BPND) from 14 brain regions are quantified with 384 different preprocessing choices. A univariate paired t-test is applied to each region and for each preprocessing choice, and corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR within each pipeline. Additionally, a multivariate Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model is used to discriminate test and retest BPND, and the model performance is evaluated using a repeated cross-validation framework with permutations. The univariate analysis revealed several significant differences in 5-HTT BPND across brain regions, depending on the preprocessing choice. The classification accuracy of the multivariate LDA model varied from 37% to 70% depending on the choice of preprocessing, and could reasonably be modeled with a normal distribution centered at 51% accuracy. In spite of correcting for multiple comparisons, the univariate model with varying preprocessing choices is more likely to generate false-positive results compared to a simple multivariate analysis model evaluated with cross-validation and permutations.	cross-validation (statistics);data pre-processing;linear discriminant analysis;polyethylene terephthalate;preprocessor;tomography	Martin Norgaard;Douglas N.

819d30fecf7a577df75bf1388cc8b354e0757462	role of the parietal cortex in predicting incoming actions	premotor cortex;mirror neurons;action observation;motor prediction;inferior parietal lobe	"""Animal and human studies have shown that the parietal and the ventral premotor cortices constitute the neural substrate of the so-called mirror system. The word """"mirror"""" originally referred to the discovery of neurons in non-human primates whose visual response echoes their motor response. This account proposes that action understanding and imitation depend on a mechanism which activates directly our own motor system as we observe the actions of other agents (Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2010). Single unit recording experiments have also demonstrated that parietal neurons have predictive activity and discharge well ahead of a planned movement. Interestingly, patients with parietal damage can show impairments in their ability to imitate or understand an observed action, but they have also difficulties in monitoring early phases of their own movement planning, be it simple reaching movements or more complex object-directed actions. The fact that both deficits may co-occur after a parietal lesion raises the question whether this reflects the impairment of a common mechanism. To address this question we examined EEG activity in patients with selective lesions in the inferior parietal lobe (N=6) who were requested to watch passively a video showing an actor grasping a colored object. The object's color cued the subject that the actor was about to move. We recorded the Readiness Potential (RP), a marker of motor preparation which also arises when preparing to observe an action (Kilner et al., 2004). Parietal patients' performance was compared to that of neurologically normal subjects (n=9) and patients with a ventral premotor cortex lesion (N=4). We show that neurologically normal subjects and premotor patients exhibit a significant RP prior to the observed action, whereas no such RP is observed in parietal patients. Our results indicate that parietal cortex injury alters the ability to monitor the early planning phases not only of one's own actions but those of other agents as well. We speculate that parietal activity during action observation does not only or essentially reflect a mirroring process, as recently proposed by mirror neurons' account, but involve instead an anticipatory process which arises through prior learning and predictive mechanisms."""	acoustic lobing;ambiguous name resolution;amprenavir;bereitschaftspotential;cerebral cortex;check digit;cidofovir;color;discharger;disk mirroring;electroencephalography;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;epilepsy, temporal lobe;experiment;mirror neurons;movement;parietal lobe;patients;preparation;primates;rp (complexity);request - action;winsock;anthocyanidin reductase activity;executing - querystatuscode	A.

350fc4af9d355f61401f84f059778b3451b73832	cortical theta wanes for language		The role of low frequency oscillations in language areas is not yet understood. Using ECoG in six human subjects, we studied whether different language regions show prominent power changes in a specific rhythm, in similar manner as the alpha rhythm shows the most prominent power changes in visual areas. Broca's area and temporal language areas were localized in individual subjects using fMRI. In these areas, the theta rhythm showed the most pronounced power changes and theta power decreased significantly during verb generation. To better understand the role of this language-related theta decrease, we then studied the interaction between low frequencies and local neuronal activity reflected in high frequencies. Amplitude-amplitude correlations showed that theta power correlated negatively with high frequency activity, specifically across verb generation trials. Phase-amplitude coupling showed that during control trials, high frequency power was coupled to theta phase, but this coupling decreased significantly during verb generation trials. These results suggest a dynamic interaction between the neuronal mechanisms underlying the theta rhythm and local neuronal activity in language areas. As visual areas show a pronounced alpha rhythm that may reflect pulsed inhibition, language regions show a pronounced theta rhythm with highly similar features.	alpha rhythm;broca aphasia;cerebral cortex;electrocorticogram;electrocorticography;theta rhythm;fmri	Dora Hermes;Kai J.

However, it remains unclear how these structures are involved in encoding and retrieval processes as a function of recollection and familiarity. To better elucidate MTL organization of these two processes, we implemented an fMRI protocol in which both encoding and retrieval of words were scanned in 21 healthy adults. During encoding, subjects were requested to bind each word to an emotional context (pleasant or unpleasant). Retrieval consisted of a Remember/Know procedure in two stages: first, subjects had to recognize the word, followed by the retrieval of the associated emotional context. fMRI data were reported in eight manually delineated MTL regions of interest (in the head, body and tail of the hippocampus, the entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices, the amygdala and the temporopolar cortex). Results obtained in 19 subjects showed four MTL patterns of activity consisting in activations of parahippocampal cortex and hippocampus in episodic encoding and retrieval and perirhinal cortex involvement in familiarity. These results are in line with the Binding of Item and Context (BIC) model predictions. Additionally, some new findings specified the familiarity MTL neural substrate by showing precise entorhinal activations during retrieval of familiar words, as well as hippocampal and amygdala deactivations in encoding of these words. Finally, we emphasize that among all four memory processes, episodic retrieval (recollection effect) was the only one eliciting strong bilateral activations in all MTL structures. These results should be considered for future studies on MTL dysfunction in patients with temporal lobe damage.	acoustic lobing;amygdaloid structure;bayesian information criterion;bilateral filter;brodmann area 35;computer memory;epilepsy, temporal lobe;futures studies;ibm tivoli storage productivity center;l-epicatechin;mathematical model;medial graph;memory disorders;memory, episodic;mental recall;modulation;patients;petroleum hydrocarbon compound;region of interest;request - action;scanning;temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome;fmri	Aimée de Vanssay-Maigne;Marion Noulhiane;Anne-Dominique Devauchelle;Sebastian Rodrigo;Sonia Baudoin-Chial;Jean F.

The ultimate goal of the experiments planned is to explore whether natural and artificial scenes of varied fidelity for training or for therapeutic purposes engage common perceptual or neuroscientific mechanisms. Such input is non-obtrusive and is derived at the same time as the experience occurs. The first experiment briefly summarized is exploring brain empathic responses of users participating in an interactive economic game developed to be displayed in a fMRI scanner. The second experiment presents an interactive lighting system also to be displayed in an fMRI scanner. Its scope is to enable the monitoring of neural activation patterns in response to lighting manipulations ranging from daylight and artificial light of the normal population initially and potentially of groups of patients suffering from the depersonalization syndrome. A broader aim of this work is to assess whether such powerful social-psychological studies could be usefully carried out within Virtual Environments advancing both cognitive neuroscience and computer graphics research.	computer graphics;daylight;experiment;game theory;resonance;simulation;synthetic intelligence	Katerina Mania;Nick Medford;Giannis Christodoulou;Phil L.

813fd06226e07c0523c01d1df9b0a003f46f42bc	computer modelling integrated with micro-ct and material testing provides additional insight to evaluate bone treatments: application to a beta-glycan derived whey protein mice model	nanoindentation;murine bone;micro fe;computer modelling;micro ct	The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of a whey protein diet on computationally predicted mechanical strength of murine bones in both trabecular and cortical regions of the femur. There was no significant influence on mechanical strength in cortical bone observed with increasing whey protein treatment, consistent with cortical tissue mineral density (TMD) and bone volume changes observed. Trabecular bone showed a significant decline in strength with increasing whey protein treatment when nanoindentation derived Young׳s moduli were used in the model. When microindentation, micro-CT phantom density or normalised Young׳s moduli were included in the model a non-significant decline in strength was exhibited. These results for trabecular bone were consistent with both trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) and micro-CT indices obtained independently. The secondary aim of this study was to characterise the influence of different sources of Young׳s moduli on computational prediction. This study aimed to quantify the predicted mechanical strength in 3D from these sources and evaluate if trends and conclusions remained consistent. For cortical bone, predicted mechanical strength behaviour was consistent across all sources of Young׳s moduli. There was no difference in treatment trend observed when Young׳s moduli were normalised. In contrast, trabecular strength due to whey protein treatment significantly reduced when material properties from nanoindentation were introduced. Other material property sources were not significant but emphasised the strength trend over normalised material properties. This shows strength at the trabecular level was attributed to both changes in bone architecture and material properties.	bone density;bone marrow diseases;bone tissue;cancellous bone;compact bone;computer simulation;estimated;euler;euler–bernoulli beam theory;feedback;phantom reference;phantoms, imaging;polysaccharides;skeletal bone;tgf beta type iii receptor;tip-magnetic driving;whey proteins;biomedical engineering field;interest;research grants	D.

Experimental results revealed that inhibitory synapses can become depolarizing as the intracellular concentration of Cl 1 of the postsynaptic cells increases. In this work the dynamical behaviour of a network of pyramidal cells coupled to inhibitory fast-spiking interneurons was studied by simulations. In particular, in agreement to the experimental data, it was found that the biophysical properties of the inhibitory/excitatory synapses strongly impact the network dynamics and the transition to seizure. & 2012 Elsevier B.V.

d38cf1c641c0d4f3afb49719524eb1bba00c1367	generalization of integrator models to foraging: a robot study using the dac9 model		Experimental research on decision making has been mainly focused on binary perceptual tasks. The generally accepted models describing the decision process in these tasks are the integrator models. These models suggest that perceptual evidence is accumulated over time until a decision is made. Therefore, the final decision is based solely on recent perceptual information. In behaviorally more relevant tasks such as foraging, it is however probable, that the current choice also depends on previous experience. To understand the implications of considering previous experience in an integrator model we investigate it using a cognitive architecture (DAC9) with a robot performing foraging tasks. Compared to an instantaneous decision making model we show that an integrator model improves performance and robustness to task complexity. Further we show that it compresses the information stored in memory. This result suggests a change in the way actions are retrieved from memory leading to self-generated actions.	cognitive architecture;experiment;robot	Encarni Marcos;Armin Duff;Martí Sánchez-Fibla;Paul F.

This study tests the hypothesis that LTM deficits in schizophrenia may result from impaired control of relational processing in WM due to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) dysfunction. fMRI was performed on 19 healthy controls and 20 patients with schizophrenia during WM tasks emphasizing relational (reorder trials) versus item-specific (rehearse trials) processing. WM activity was also examined with respect to LTM recognition on a task administered outside the scanner. Receiver operator characteristic analysis assessed familiarity and recollection components of LTM. Patients showed a disproportionate familiarity deficit for reorder versus rehearse trials against a background of generalized LTM impairments. Relational processing during WM led to DLPFC activation in both groups. However, this activation was less focal in patients than in controls, and patients with more severe negative symptoms showed less of a DLPFC increase. fMRI analysis of subsequent recognition performance revealed a group by condition interaction. High LTM for reorder versus rehearse trials was associated with bilateral DLPFC activation in controls, but not in patients who activated the left middle temporal and inferior occipital gyrus. Results indicate that although patients can activate the DLPFC on a structured relational WM task, this activation is less focal and does not translate to high retrieval success, suggesting a disruption in the interaction between WM and LTM processes in schizophrenia.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;bilateral filter;cognition disorders;consciousness;denial-of-service attack;dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;focal (programming language);memory disorders;memory, long-term;memory, short-term;mental recall;patients;receiver operating characteristic;sql;scanner device component;schizophrenia;fmri	John Daniel Ragland;Robert S.

Automating this process saves valuable resources of time, money, and manpower. Current methods for automatic fish monitoring rely on a human expert to design features necessary for classifying fish into a taxonomy. This paper describes a method using Evolution-COnstructed (ECO) features to automatically find features that can be used to classify fish into a taxonomy. ECO features provide features automatically and thus can quickly be adapted to new environments and fauna. The effectiveness of ECO features is shown on a dataset of four fish species where using five fold cross validation an average classification rate of 99.4% is achieved.		Kirt D.

Although the functional role and mechanisms involved are not entirely understood, the concept of interdependent neural oscillations drives an active field of research to comprehend the ubiquitous polyrhythmic activity of the brain, beyond empirical observations. Phase-amplitude coupling, a particular form of cross-frequency coupling between bursts of high-frequency oscillations and the phase of lower frequency rhythms, has recently received considerable attention. However, the measurement methods have relatively poor sensitivity and require long segments of experimental data. This obliterates the resolution of fast changes in coupling related to behavior, and more generally, to the non-stationary dynamics of brain electrophysiology. We propose a new measure of phase-amplitude coupling that can resolve up to one, optimally two, cycles of the underlying slow frequency component. The method also provides a measure of the coupling strength, for augmented insight into the mechanisms involved. We demonstrate the technique with synthesized data and compare its performances with existing methods. We also show that the method reveals rapid changes in coupling parameters in data from the entorhinal cortex of a free-behaving rat. The time-resolved changes revealed are compatible with behavior and complement observed modulations of oscillatory power. We anticipate that this new measure of dynamic phase-amplitude coupling will contribute to accelerate research into the dynamics of inter-dependent oscillatory components related to brain functions and dysfunctions.	bloch sulzberger syndrome;cerebral cortex;complement system proteins;coupling constant;electroencephalography;electrophysiology (science);estimated;interdependence;intrinsic drive;magnetoencephalography;neural oscillation;neuroimaging;performance;source data;spatial scale;stationary process	Soheila Samiee;Sylvain Baillet	2017	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.07.051	experimental data;electrophysiology;coupling;psychology;cognitive psychology;entorhinal cortex;control theory;communication;amplitude;oscillation;phenomenon	ML	19.51615605614301	-76.47320085744687	87976

A modified version of the Windkessel model by incorporating compliance has been used with a balloon model to generate cerebellar granular layer and visual cortex blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses. Spike raster patterns were adapted from a biophysical granular layer model as input. The model fits volume changes in blood flow to predict the BOLD responses in the cerebellum granular layer and in visual cortex. As a comparison, we tested the balloon model and the modified Windkessel model with the mathematically reconstructed BOLD response under the same input condition. Delayed compliance contributed to BOLD signal and reconstructed signals were compared to experimental measurements indicating the usability of the approach. The current study allows to correlate dynamic changes of flow and oxygenation during brain activation which connects single neuron and network activity to clinical measurements.	computation;dilation (morphology);fits;frequency response;hemodynamics;multi-compartment model;neural ensemble;neuron;resonance;usability	Chaitanya Nutakki;Ahalya Nair;Chaitanya Medini;Manjusha Nair;Bipin Nair;Shyam Diwakar	2016	2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)	10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732162	computational neuroscience	ML	20.109395292522148	-74.1188635702455	88416

It does not mean, however, that volume conduction is irrelevant when true interactions are present. Here, we analyze in detail the possibilities to construct measures of true brain interactions which are strictly invariant to linear spatial transformations of the sensor data. Specifically, such measures can be constructed from maximization of imaginary coherency in virtual channels, bivariate measures as a corrected variate of imaginary coherence, and global measures indicating the total interaction contained within a space or between two spaces. A complete theoretic framework on this question is provided for second order statistical moments. Relations to existing linear and nonlinear approaches are presented. We applied the methods to resting state EEG data, showing clear interactions at all bands, and to a combined measurement of EEG and MEG during rest condition and a finger tapping task. We found that MEG was capable of observing brain interactions which were not observable in the EEG data.	bands;bivariate data;contain (action);electroencephalography;estimated;expectation–maximization algorithm;imaginary time;interaction;magnetoencephalography;morphologic artifacts;nonlinear system;observable;relevance;rest;resting state fmri;sensor;theory;cell transformation	Arne Ewald;Laura Marzetti;Filippo Zappasodi;Frank C.

24630bc0f4819ec345263d71dce0b2f06851a308	brain state regulation during normal development: intrinsic activity fluctuations in simultaneous eeg–fmri		Brain maturation in adolescence is mirrored by the EEG as a pronounced decrease in low frequency activity. This EEG power attenuation parallels reductions of structural and metabolic markers of neuronal maturation (i.e., gray matter loss and decrease of absolute cerebral glucose utilization). However, it is largely unknown what causes these electrophysiological changes, and how this functional reorganization relates to other functional measures such as the fMRI BOLD signal. In this study, we used simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI to localize hemodynamic correlates of fluctuating EEG oscillations and to study the development of this EEG-BOLD coupling. Furthermore, the maturational EEG power attenuation was directly compared to BOLD signal power maturation. Both analyses were novel in their developmental perspective and aimed at providing a functional lead to EEG maturation. Data from 19 children, 18 adolescents and 18 young adults were acquired in 10 min eyes-open/eyes-closed resting states. Our results revealed that both EEG and BOLD amplitudes strongly decrease between childhood and adulthood, but their functional coupling remains largely unchanged. The global reduction of absolute amplitude of spontaneous slow BOLD signal fluctuation is a novel marker for brain maturation, and parallels the globally decreasing trajectories of EEG amplitudes, gray matter and glucose metabolism during adolescence. Further, the absence of thalamocortical EEG-BOLD coupling in children together with age-related normalized thalamic BOLD power increase indicated maturational changes in brain state regulation.	adolescent (age group);anatomical maturation;biologic development;brain implant;electroencephalography;eye;gray matter;hemodynamics;maxima and minima;metabolic process, cellular;parallels desktop for mac;quantum fluctuation;rest;spontaneous order;thalamic structure;fmri;glucose metabolism;hearing impairment	Rafael Lüchinger;Lars Michels;Ernst Martin;Daniel Brandeis	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.01.031	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;communication	HCI	20.11759238796682	-78.47867384259078	88717

To interpret the outputs of dimensionality reduction, it is important to first understand its outputs for brain areas for which the relationship between the stimulus and neural response is well characterized. Here, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to trial-averaged neural responses in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) to study two fundamental, population-level questions. First, we characterized how neural complexity relates to stimulus complexity, where complexity is measured using relative comparisons of dimensionality. Second, we assessed the extent to which responses to different stimuli occupy similar dimensions of the population activity space using a novel statistical method. For comparison, we performed the same dimensionality reduction analyses on the activity of a recently-proposed V1 receptive field model and a deep convolutional neural network. Our results show that the dimensionality of the population response changes systematically with alterations in the properties and complexity of the visual stimulus.	area striata structure;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;cerebral cortex;convolutional neural network;dimensionality reduction;dimensions;macaca;population;principal component analysis	Benjamin R.

109b2e1173040eacae857aec91637074d5c75cc0	sleep depth enhancement through ambient temperature manipulation in mice		The restorative properties of deep sleep and its central role in learning and memory are well-recognized but still in the process of being elucidated with the help of animal models. Currently available approaches for deep sleep enhancement are mainly pharmacological and may have undesirable side effects on physiology and behavior. Here, we propose a simple strategy for sleep depth enhancement that involves manipulation of ambient temperature (Ta) using a closed-loop control system. Even mild shifts in Ta are known to evoke thermoregulatory responses that alter sleep-wake dynamics. In our experiments, mice evinced greater proportions of deep NREM sleep as well as REM sleep under the dynamic sleep depth modulation protocol compared to a reference baseline in which Ta was left unchanged. The active manipulation approach taken in this study could be used as a more natural means for enhancing deep sleep in patients with disorders like epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s, in which poor quality sleep is common and associated with adverse outcomes.	alzheimer's disease;animal model;baseline (configuration management);childhood absence epilepsy;control system;control theory;experiment;modulation;parkinsonian disorders;patients;pharmacology;sleep apnea syndromes;sleep, slow-wave;physiological aspects	Asmaa Ajwad;Dillon M.

Motivated by the highly interconnected structure of the brain, in this study, we propose a computational model to estimate the relationships among voxels and employ them as features for cognitive state classification. We represent the sequence of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) measurements recorded during a cognitive stimulus by a set of local meshes. Then, we represent the corresponding cognitive state by the edge weights of these meshes each of which is estimated assuming a regularized linear relationship among voxel time series in a predefined locality. The estimated mesh edge weights provide a better representation of information in the brain for cognitive state or task classification. We examine the representative power of our mesh edge weights on visual recognition and emotional memory retrieval experiments by training a support vector machine classifier. Also, we use mesh edge weights as feature vectors of inter-subject classification on Human Connectome Project task fMRI dataset, and test their performance. We observe that mesh edge weights perform better than the popular fMRI features, such as, raw voxel intensity values, pairwise correlations, features extracted using PCA and ICA, for classifying the cognitive states.	computational model;experiment;human connectome project;independent computing architecture;locality of reference;principal component analysis;resonance;support vector machine;synaptic package manager;time series;voxel	Itir Onal;Mete Ozay;Eda Mizrak;Ilke Oztekin;Fatoş T.

Together with lesion data, the IFO has thus been proposed to be crucial in processing disgust-related stimuli. Here, we examined IFO involvement in the processing of other people's gustatory emotions more generally by exposing participants to food-related disgusted, pleased and neutral facial expressions during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We then exposed participants to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral tastants for the purpose of mapping their gustatory IFO. Finally, we associated participants' self reported empathy (measured using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, IRI) with their IFO activation during the witnessing of others' gustatory emotions. We show that participants' empathy scores were predictive of their gustatory IFO activation while witnessing both the pleased and disgusted facial expression of others. While the IFO has been implicated in the processing of negative emotions of others and empathy for negative experiences like pain, our finding extends this concept to empathy for intense positive feelings, and provides empirical support for the view that the IFO contributes to empathy by mapping the bodily feelings of others onto the internal bodily states of the observer, in agreement with the putative interoceptive function of the IFO.	activation function;emotions;empathy;experience;ifosfamide;insula of reil;odorants;pain;patient self-report;regular expression;resonance;fmri	Mbemba Jabbi;Marte Swart;Christian Keysers	2007	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.10.032	psychology;cognitive psychology;communication;social psychology;facial expression	HCI	17.706518631585528	-78.25887276681094	89515
cc3bc277cbd83828e4f9e9ac14ffc961c0c48602	oscillatory responses to semantic and syntactic violations		EEG studies employing time–frequency analysis have revealed changes in theta and alpha power in a variety of language and memory tasks. Semantic and syntactic violations embedded in sentences evoke well-known ERPs, but little is known about the oscillatory responses to these violations. We investigated oscillatory responses to both kinds of violations, while monolingual and bilingual participants performed an acceptability judgment task. Both violations elicited power decreases (event-related desynchronization, ERD) in the 8–30 Hz frequency range, but with different scalp topographies. In addition, semantic anomalies elicited power increases (event-related synchronization, ERS) in the 1–5 Hz frequency band. The 1–5 Hz ERS was strongly phase-locked to stimulus onset and highly correlated with time domain averages, whereas the 8–30 Hz ERD response varied independently of these. In addition, the results showed that language expertise modulated 8–30 Hz ERD for syntactic violations as a function of the executive demands of the task. When the executive function demands were increased using a grammaticality judgment task, bilinguals but not monolinguals demonstrated reduced 8–30 Hz ERD for syntactic violations.

4cb486195120f2ceacf64187723190844a8e3457	meg source reconstruction based on identification of directed source interactions on whole-brain anatomical networks	meg source reconstruction;effective connectivity;variational bayes;prior knowledge;anatomical connectivity;multivariate autoregressive model	We present an MEG source reconstruction method that simultaneously reconstructs source amplitudes and identifies source interactions across the whole brain. In the proposed method, a full multivariate autoregressive (MAR) model formulates directed interactions (i.e., effective connectivity) between sources. The MAR coefficients (the entries of the MAR matrix) are constrained by the prior knowledge of whole-brain anatomical networks inferred from diffusion MRI. Moreover, to increase the accuracy and robustness of our method, we apply an fMRI prior on the spatial activity patterns and a sparse prior on the MAR coefficients. The observation process of MEG data, the source dynamics, and a series of the priors are combined into a Bayesian framework using a state-space representation. The parameters, such as the source amplitudes and the MAR coefficients, are jointly estimated from a variational Bayesian learning algorithm. By formulating the source dynamics in the context of MEG source reconstruction, and unifying the estimations of source amplitudes and interactions, we can identify the effective connectivity without requiring the selection of regions of interest. Our method is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on simulated and experimental data, respectively. Compared with non-dynamic methods, in which the interactions are estimated after source reconstruction with no dynamic constraints, the proposed dynamic method improves most of the performance measures in simulations, and provides better physiological interpretation and inter-subject consistency in real data applications.	algorithm;autoregressive model;calculus of variations;coefficient;inference;interaction;magnetoencephalography;multivariate analysis;region of interest;simulation;sparse matrix;state-space representation;fmri	Makoto Fukushima;Okito Yamashita;Thomas R.

We propose a shift in network synchrony due to changes in cellular response. Here we use phase-response curves (PRC) from Morris-Lecar (M-L) model neurons with synaptic depression and gradually decrease input current to cells within a network simulation. This method effectively decreases firing rates resulting in a shift to greater network synchrony illustrating a possible mechanism of the transition phenomenon. PRCs are measured from the M-L conductance based model cell with a range of input currents within the limit cycle. A large network of 3000 excitatory neurons is simulated with a network topology generated from second-order statistics which allows a range of population synchrony. The population synchrony of the oscillating cells is measured with the Kuramoto order parameter, which reveals a transition from tonic to clonic phase exhibited by our model network. The cellular response shift mechanism for the tonic-clonic seizure transition reproduces the population behavior closely when compared to EEG data.	anatomy, regional;bifurcation theory;coherence (physics);conductance (graph);depressive disorder;dynamical system;electroencephalography;excitation;kuramoto model;limit cycle;morris–lecar model;network topology;neuron;neurons;phase response;population parameter;population dynamics;seizures, clonic;simulation;synapses;synaptic package manager;synaptic weight;tonic - clonic seizures;tonic-clonic epilepsy;virtual synchrony	Bryce Beverlin;James Kakalios;Duane Q.

While the phenomenon seems too obvious to demand further investigation, pathological conditions such as delusions of control suggest the requirement of further investigation into the phenomenon of sense of agency. The traditional view point regarding the role of intention in sense of agency is complemented by computational models of motor control. Accordingly, we hypothesized and tested the role of error monitoring mechanisms in the sense of agency by manipulating the feedback given independent of the responses of the participant while performing a Flanker task. The results point out the potential role of error monitoring mechanisms by modulating the forward model predictions to experience a sense of agency for unintended actions.	computational model	Neeraj Kumar;Jaison A.

Advances in noninvasive neuroimaging target two capabilities: 1) increased spatial and temporal resolution of measured neural activity; and 2) innovative methodologies to extract brain-behavior relationships from evolving neuroimaging technology. We target the second. Our novel methodology integrated three neuroimaging methodologies and elucidated expertise-dependent differences in functional (fused EEG-fMRI) and structural (dMRI) brain networks for a perception-action coupling task. A set of baseball players and controls performed a Go/No-Go task designed to mimic the situation of hitting a baseball. In the functional analysis, our novel fusion methodology identifies 50-ms windows with predictive EEG neural correlates of expertise and fuses these temporal windows with fMRI activity in a whole-brain 2-mm voxel analysis, revealing time-localized correlations of expertise at a spatial scale of millimeters. The spatiotemporal cascade of brain activity reflecting expertise differences begins as early as 200 ms after the pitch starts and lasts up to 700 ms afterwards. Network differences are spatially localized to include motor and visual processing areas, providing evidence for differences in perception-action coupling between the groups. Furthermore, an analysis of structural connectivity reveals that the players have significantly more connections between cerebellar and left frontal/motor regions, and many of the functional activation differences between the groups are located within structurally defined network modules that differentiate expertise. In short, our novel method illustrates how multimodal neuroimaging can provide specific macroscale insights into the functional and structural correlates of expertise development.	cascade device component;cerebellum;cognition;consciousness;electroencephalography;machine perception;microsoft windows;multimodal interaction;neuroimaging;spatial scale;voxel;fmri;millimeter	Jordan Muraskin;Jason Sherwin;Gregory Lieberman;Javier O.

Sophisticated data search capabilities, advanced signal processing techniques, statistical methods, complex network and graph mining algorithms to unfold and discover hidden patterns in the functional brain network supported with efficient visualization techniques are essential for making potential inferences of the results obtained. Visualization of change in activity during cognitive function is useful to discover and get insights into the hidden, novel and complex neuronal patterns and trends during the normal and cognitive load conditions from the graph/temporal representation of the functional brain network. This paper explores novel methods to detect and track the dynamics and complexity of the brain function. It also uses a new tool called Functional Brain Network Analysis and Visualization (FBNAV) tool to visualize the outcomes of various computational analyses to enable us to identify and study the changing neuronal patterns during various states of the brain activity using augmented/customised Topoplots and Headplots. The change detection algorithm tracks and visualizes the cognitive load induced changes across the scalp regions. These techniques may also be helpful to locate and identify patterns in certain abnormal mental states resulting due to some mental disorders such as stress.	algorithm;cognition;complex network;complexity;computational neuroscience;electroencephalography;interaction;mental state;signal processing;structure mining	Ramasamy Vijayalakshmi;Naga Dasari;Nanda Nandagopal;R.

1221046a6b09a1564c0c2380339db8e17da5eaf3	modelling non-stationary and non-separable spatio-temporal changes in neurodegeneration via gaussian process convolution		Modelling longitudinal changes in organs is fundamental for the understanding of biological and pathological processes. Most of the previous works on spatio-temporal modelling of image time series relies on the assumption of stationarity of the local spatial correlation, and on the separability between spatial and temporal processes. These assumptions are often made in order to lead to computationally tractable approaches to longitudinal modelling, but inevitably lead to an oversimplification of the complex spatial and temporal dynamics underlying the biological processes. In this work we propose a novel spatio-temporal generative model of time series of images based on kernel convolutions of a white noise Gaussian process. The proposed model is parameterised by a sparse set of control points independently identified by specific spatial and temporal parameters. This formulation is highly flexible and can naturally account for spatially and temporally varying dynamics of changes. We demonstrate a preliminary application of our non-parametric method on the modelling of within-subject structural changes in the context of longitudinal analysis in Alzheimer’s disease. In particular we show that our method provides an accurate description of the pathological evolution of the brain, while showing high flexibility in modelling and predicting region-specific non-linearity due to accelerated structural decline in dementia.	algorithmic efficiency;cobham's thesis;convolution;gaussian process;generative model;inferential theory of learning;kernel (operating system);linear separability;nonlinear system;sparse language;sparse matrix;stationary process;temporal logic;time series;white noise	Marco Lorenzi;Gabriel Ziegler;Daniel C.

Here, we examine changes to an internal model of the motor system under changes in the variance structure of movement errors lacking an overall bias. We introduced a horizontal visuomotor perturbation to change the statistical distribution of movement errors anisotropically, while monetary gains/losses were awarded based on movement outcomes. We derive predictions for simulated movement planners, each differing in its internal model of the motor system. We find that humans optimally respond to the overall change in error magnitude, but ignore the anisotropy of the error distribution. Through comparison with simulated movement planners, we found that aimpoints corresponded quantitatively to an ideal movement planner that updates a strictly isotropic (circular) internal model of the error distribution. Aimpoints were planned in a manner that ignored the direction-dependence of error magnitudes, despite the continuous availability of unambiguous information regarding the anisotropic distribution of actual motor errors.	acclimatization;anisotropy;awards;force field (chemistry);money;movement;perturbation function;sample variance;statistical distributions	Todd E.

Each CPG controls a pair of antagonistic MN pools. Furthermore, specific sensory feedback signals play an important role in the control of single leg movement and in the generation of inter-leg coordination or the interplay between both tasks. Currently, however, no mathematical model exists that provides a theoretical approach to understanding the generation of coordinated locomotion in such a multi-legged locomotor system. In the present study, I created such a theoretical model for the stick insect walking system, which describes the MN activity of a single forward stepping middle leg and helps to explain the neuronal mechanisms underlying coordinating information transfer between ipsilateral legs. In this model, CPGs that belong to the same leg, as well as those belonging to different legs, are connected by specific sensory feedback pathways that convey information about movements and forces generated during locomotion. The model emphasizes the importance of sensory feedback, which is used by the central nervous system to enhance weak excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections from front to rear between the three thorax-coxa-joint CPGs. Thereby the sensory feedback activates caudal pattern generation networks and helps to coordinate leg movements by generating in-phase and out-of-phase thoracic MN activity.	cns disorder;caudal;central pattern generators;central pattern generator;chest;congenital neurologic anomalies;hip structure;mathematical model;mathematics;motor neurons;movement;numerous;restless legs syndrome;sensory feedback;stepping level;synaptic package manager;theory;downregulation of ferrisuperoxide dismutase activity	Silvia Daun-Gruhn	2010	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-010-0254-3	psychology;central pattern generator;neuroscience;simulation;information transfer;central nervous system;mathematical model;mathematics;communication;oscillation;statistics	Robotics	17.718146836741248	-71.79117535178237	90245

We particularly focus on a Bayesian network with multinomial variables that can represent discrete feature spaces similar to hypercolumns combining minicolumns, enforce sparsity of activation to learn efficient representations, and explain divisive normalization. We demonstrate that maximal-likelihood learning using sampling-based Bayesian inference gives rise to classical receptive field properties similar to V1 simple cells and V2 cells, while inference performed on the trained network yields nonclassical context-dependent response properties such as cross-orientation suppression and filling in. Comparison with known physiological properties reveals some qualitative and quantitative similarities.	bayesian network;cerebral cortex;context-sensitive language;inference;maximal set;multinomial logistic regression;sampling (signal processing);sparse matrix;zero suppression	Haruo Hosoya	2012	Neural Computation	10.1162/NECO_a_00310	computer vision;variable-order bayesian network;machine vision;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics;bayesian inference;statistics	ML	21.364794872087646	-67.76088343910105	90350

The configuration of the agent defined by one angle (degree of freedom), is determined by the activation state of the neural network. This is done by contracting a muscle with many muscular fibers, whose contraction state needs to be coordinated to generate high amplitude link displacements. In networks without homeostasic (self-regulatory) mechanism the neural state dynamics and the configuration state dynamics converges to a fixed point. Introduction of random noise, shows that fixed points are metastable. When neural units are endowed with homeostasic mechanisms in the form of threshold adjustment, the dynamics of the configuration angle and neural state becomes aperiodic. Learning mechanisms foster functional and structural cluster formation, and modifies the distribution of the kinetic energy of the network. We also present a meta-model of embodied neural agents, that identifies self-perturbation as a mechanism for neural development without a teacher.	aperiodic graph;artificial neural network;fixed point (mathematics);homeostasis;metamodeling;neural networks;noise (electronics);recurrent neural network	Jorge Simão	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-74695-9_95	stochastic neural network;metamodeling;neural development;simulation;random neural network;computer science;artificial intelligence;recurrent neural network;machine learning;kinetic energy;mathematics;fixed point;degrees of freedom;artificial neural network	ML	18.499299573914705	-67.58699881345402	90365

Here, we created a simple illusion of feeling an elongated arm by using the dominance of the visual domain over the tactile sense: employing an artificial hand and arm, which were connected to the body, subjects were given the visual impression that they had an extended arm. Since it is known from animal studies that tactile illusions alter early sensory processing in SI, we expected a modulation of the topography in SI corresponding to this illusion. Behavioral results showed that during the illusion the participants felt that their arm was elongated. Neuromagnetic source imaging of the functional organization in SI revealed that the cortical distance between first (D1) and fifth digit (D5) decreased when subjects felt the arm elongated. Since this modulation was significantly positively correlated with the illusionary feeling of an extended arm, the results suggest an involvement of SI during perceived changes in the size of body parts. We discuss the results as possible top-down modulations of SI by higher order somatosensory areas.	body part;digit structure;illusions;international system of units;lewy body disease;modulation;morphing;ovarian fetiform teratoma;peripheral;sensory process;somatosensory cortex;top-down and bottom-up design;topography;touch sensation	Michael Schaefer;Herta Flor;Hans-Jochen Heinze;Michael Rotte	2007	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.03.046	psychology;computer vision;neuroscience;communication;animal studies;somatosensory system	HCI	16.286258296984684	-77.151995598655	90592

The recording of neonatal myocyte electrophysiology in real time has still not been ideally optimised, however. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of using different substrates in culture (MEA) chambers on the surviving and functional electrophysiological activity of the myocytes after the first five days after isolation. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from two day-old neonatal rats and plated on 12×12 ITO microelectrode chambers (Multi-Channel Systems) and cultured for five days. Four coating methods were used. The PDL + fibronectin treatment displayed the highest cardiomyocyte adhesion to the electrodes (20% of total cells in chamber after seeding) and developed contractible cells during the five days of pre-cultivation with a measurable electrical response. Nevertheless, the cells adhered to all surface-treated MEA chambers, creating typical cell morphology, but with different success rates.	galaxy morphological classification;indium tin oxide;plating	Ondrej Svoboda;Josef Skopalik;Larisa Baiazitova;Eva Gabrielova;Vratislav Cmiel;Ivo Provazník;Zdenka Fohlerova;Jaromir Hubalek	2016	2016 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)		materials science;biological engineering;anatomy;surgery	SE	12.669020547817544	-67.17478797444322	91053

This article investigates physical limits on brain wiring and corresponding changes in brain temperature that are imposed by thermodynamics of heat balance determined mainly by Na+/K+-ATPase, cerebral blood flow, and heat conduction. It is found that even moderate firing rates cause significant intracellular Na+ build-up, and the ATP consumption rate associated with pumping out these ions grows nonlinearly with frequency. Surprisingly, the power dissipated by the Na+/K+ pump depends biphasically on frequency, which can lead to the biphasic dependence of brain temperature on frequency as well. Both the total power of sodium pumps and brain temperature diverge for very small fiber diameters, indicating that too thin fibers are not beneficial for thermal balance. For very small brains blood flow is not a sufficient cooling mechanism deep in the brain. The theoretical lower bound on fiber diameter above which brain temperature is in the operational regime is strongly frequency dependent but finite due to synaptic depression. For normal neurophysiological conditions this bound is at least an order of magnitude smaller than average values of empirical fiber diameters, suggesting that neuroanatomy of the mammalian brains operates in the thermodynamically safe regime. Analytical formulas presented can be used to estimate average firing rates in mammals, and relate their changes to changes in brain temperature, which can have important practical applications. In general, activity in larger brains is found to be slower than in smaller brains.	analytical engine;automated theorem proving;brain;cerebrovascular circulation;computer cooling;cool - action;depressive disorder;diameter (qualifier value);dimensions;ions;large;mammals;metabolic process, cellular;neuroanatomy;nonlinear system;potassium;pumping (computer systems);small;sodium;synaptic package manager;thermodynamics;thin-film transistor;tissue fiber;wiring;pump (device)	Jan Karbowski	2009	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-009-0153-7	cerebral blood flow;neuroscience;temperature;blood flow;dissipation;limit;nanotechnology;upper and lower bounds;brain size;thermodynamics;thermal conduction;metabolism;physics	HPC	13.883658394585153	-69.90793632424317	91060

Although eventdriven methods have been recently proposed to simulate these networks, they still present some drawbacks. To obtain the advantages of an eventdriven simulation method and a traditional time-driven method, we present a hybrid method. This method efficiently simulates neural networks composed of several neural models: highly active neurons or neurons defined by very-complex model are simulated using a time-driven method whereas other neurons are simulated using an event-driven method based in lookup tables. To perform a comparative study of this hybrid method in terms of speed and accuracy, a model of the cerebellar granular layer has been simulated. The performance results showed that a hybrid simulation can provide considerable advantages when the network is composed of neurons with different characteristics.	neural networks;simulation;spiking neural network	Jesús Alberto Garrido;Richard R.

A very exciting idea to parcellate the cortex and thus to constructthe human connectome is to suppose that all structural elements of the cortex share similar connectivity patterns: this process de nes a connectivity-based parcellation. We address the problem of the connectivity-based parcel-lation without anatomical priors using the highly ecient normalized cut algorithm to classify, in a reproducibleway, a large data set of connectivity patterns. The idea was to model the seeds topology as a graph in whicheach node represents a seed, the edges between two nodes represent the local neighbourhood relationships of theseed, and weights of the edges represent the similarity of the two connectional ngerprints of the correspondingseeds. This connectivity-based parcellation was applied both on a phantom and on the left postcentral gyrusof four di erent subjects. For the real data set, the structural connectivity pattern of each seed, located onthe surface of the grey/white interface of the left postcentral gyrus, was reconstructed from di usion magneticresonance imaging data. These connectivity patterns were characterised using a probabilistic tractography basedon a model of di usion which could take into account up to two bers in each voxel. Finally, the left postcentralgyrus of each subject was parcellated in twelve parcels.Keywords: Connectome, parcellation, tractography, di usion, spectral clustering, posctentral gyrus, brainconnectivity, High-Angular-Resolution Di usion Imaging (HARDI).

d5bd2f7c63633a5e337e8a2855aa93ff7f2391a7	different cognitive abilities displayed by action video gamers and non-gamers		Abstract Playing action video games requires players to develop a cognitive profile that allows them to rapidly monitor and react to fast moving visual and auditory stimuli, and to inhibit erroneous actions. This study investigated whether experience with action videogames is associated with an advantage on standardized cognitive tasks. Specifically, we investigated whether individuals who played action video games demonstrated enhanced cognitive processing speed, task-switching and inhibitive abilities. First person shooter (FPS) and Massive online battle arena (MOBA) experienced video game players (AVGPs) and individuals with little to no videogame experience (NVGPs) performed both a Stroop test and a Trail-Making test (TMT Au0026B). Results showed that on the Stroop test, AVGPs responded significantly faster than NVGPs but made significantly more errors. Alternatively, on the TMT test AVGPs displayed faster reaction times while error rates did not differ compared to NVGPs. Our findings suggest that while AVGPs may possess enhanced processing speed and task-switching ability, AVGPs adopt a strategy that favours speed over accuracy on a task evaluating cognitive inhibition ability. Our data corroborate and bolster previous findings demonstrating a different cognitive profile for individuals that specifically play action video games.	cognition	Magdalena Kowal;Adam J.

Yet, it is a long-standing question whether word reading in central vision is possible without information transfer between the left and right hemispheres (LH/RH). Here we show that such communication is required by comparing word naming latencies and eye movement data of people with LH language dominance and a unique sample of healthy RH dominant people. The results reveal that individuals with LH speech dominance name words faster when they are allowed to fixate at the word beginning, whereas RH dominants are faster for fixations toward the end. In text reading, the eyes of LH dominants land more to the left than the eyes of RH dominants, making more information directly available to the dominant hemisphere. We conclude that the traditional view of bilateral projections in central vision is incorrect. In contrast, interhemispheric communication is needed in central vision, and eye movements are adjusted to optimize information uptake. Our findings therefore call into question the explanation of macular sparing in hemianopia based on a bilaterally projecting fovea. In addition, these results are in line with the increase of white matter in the splenium of the corpus callosum when people learn to read.	bilateral filter;body of uterus;corpus callosum;eye abnormalities;eye movements;hemianopsia;lh (complexity);microsoft word for mac;movement;projection defense mechanism;white matter	Lise Van der Haegen;Qing Cai;Michaël A.

This study aimed to analyze changes in CFFT before and after the incremental cycle ergometer test as a means to assess the fatigue of the CNS. CFFT ascending and descending, the subjective criterion and sensory sensitivity were analyzed in 8 professional male cyclists (72.1±5.59 kg, 180.3±6.43 cm, 17.4±0.7 years) before and after a maximum incremental cycle ergometer test (start 50w increases 50w each 5 minutes). In this incremental test, the induced fatigue was probably more a peripheral phenomenon than one due to central nervous system fatigue, because sensory sensitivity did not significantly decrease. In conclusion, an incremental cycle ergometer test increased the cortical arousal and does not affect negatively the CNS of professional cyclists.	cns;flicker (screen);peripheral	Vicente Javier Clemente-Suárez;Montaña Diaz-Manzano	2018		10.1145/3284179.3284258		ML	16.858786141941135	-80.02695572813617	91625
71a6c2b8211b20155164252fda1a4f9d0af8390b	neurophysiological correlates of sleepiness: a combined tms and eeg study	sleepiness;eeg tms;cortical excitability;prefrontal cortex;motor cortex;sleep deprivation;paired pulse tms;eeg power maps;inter stimulus interval;motor threshold	Changes of cortical and corticospinal excitability as a function of sleep deprivation have been studied, using EEG power maps and several TMS measures in 33 normal subjects before and after a 40-h sleep deprivation (SD). The effects of SD were independently assessed by subjective and EEG measures of sleepiness, the latter being represented in terms of cortical maps for different frequency bands. Short intracortical facilitation (SICF) and inhibition (SICI) were measured by the paired-pulse TMS technique with different inter-stimulus intervals. Besides standardized motor threshold (MT), lower threshold (LT) and upper threshold (UT) were also determined. Subjective sleepiness severely increased as a consequence of SD, paralleled by a drastic decrease of alertness. EEG topography showed large increases in delta and theta activity, mainly evident at fronto-central areas. Standard MTs, as well as LTs and UTs, all increased as a consequence of SD. SICF also showed a significant increase as compared to pre-deprivation values, but only in females. The increase of theta activity was strongly associated in the left frontal and prefrontal cortex to a smaller decrease of corticospinal excitability, expressed by MTs, and a larger increase of intracortical facilitation, expressed by SICF. TMS and EEG measures converge in indicating that SD has severe effects on both cortical and corticospinal excitability, as shown respectively by the increases of slow-frequency EEG power and MTs. The SICF enhancement in females and the results of the combined topographical analysis of EEG and TMS changes are coherent with the hypothesis that cortical TMS-evoked responses are higher as a consequence of a longer wakefulness. However, the lack of an increase in cortical excitability after prolonged wakefulness in males suggests some caution in the generalization of these effects, that deserve further investigation.	bands;cerebral cortex;coherence (physics);converge;electroencephalography;frequency band;generalization (psychology);large;map;sleep apnea syndromes;small;somnolence;structure of ventral corticospinal tract;theta model;topography;wake-sleep algorithm;wakefulness;alertness;facilitation	Luigi De Gennaro;Cristina Marzano;Domenica Veniero;Fabio Moroni;Fabiana Fratello;Giuseppe Curcio;Michele Ferrara;Fabio Ferlazzo;Luana Novelli;Maria Concetta Pellicciari;Mario Bertini;Paolo Maria Rossini	2007	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.04.013	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance;communication	ML	17.492761390623194	-79.0551428585511	91656

This walking pattern is generated in Lateral Accessory Lobe (LAL) and the ventral protocerebrum (VPC) domain which controls physical exercise. Therefore, in this study, we elucidate the process of this behavior by constructing a neural network model of the LAL domain. Concretely, we build a model that treats some numbers of neurons as one neuron and estimate strength of each connection between 10 neuron representatives of neuron groups with Genetic Algorithm. The estimated network is verified and consided from engineering and biology.	acoustic lobing;artificial neural network;genetic algorithm;lateral computing;lateral thinking;network model;neuron;virtual private cloud	Ryosuke Chiba;Sunao Hashimoto;Tomoki Kazawa;Ryohei Kanzaki;Jun Ota	2010	2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	10.1109/IROS.2010.5652262	genetic algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network	Robotics	15.333410237413913	-68.3664855994812	92264
dc9a8d17ce9f5cd0ac08f0bc8f44ff89937144ac	visual–motor deficits relate to altered gray and white matter in young adults born preterm with very low birth weight		Individuals born preterm and at very low birth weight (birth weight ≤ 1500 g) are at an increased risk of perinatal brain injury and neurodevelopmental deficits over the long term. This study examined whether this clinical group has more problems with visual-motor integration, motor coordination, and visual perception compared to term-born controls, and related these findings to cortical surface area and thickness and white matter fractional anisotropy. Forty-seven preterm-born very low birth weight individuals and 56 term-born controls were examined at 18-22 years of age with a combined cognitive, morphometric MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging evaluation in Trondheim, Norway. Visual-motor skills were evaluated with the Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration-V (VMI) copying test and its supplemental tests of motor coordination and visual perception. 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE images and diffusion tensor imaging were done at 1.5 T. Cortical reconstruction generated in FreeSurfer and voxelwise maps of fractional anisotropy calculated with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics were used to explore the relationship between MRI findings and cognitive results. Very low birth weight individuals had significantly lower scores on the copying and motor coordination tests compared with controls. In the very low birth weight group, VMI scores showed significant positive relationships with cortical surface area in widespread regions, with reductions of the superior temporal gyrus, insula, and medial occipital lobe in conjunction with the posterior ventral temporal lobe. Visual perception scores also showed positive relationships with cortical thickness in the very low birth weight group, primarily in the lateral occipito-temporo-parietal junction, the superior temporal gyrus, insula, and superior parietal regions. In the very low birth weight group, visual-motor performance correlated positively with fractional anisotropy especially in the corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus bilaterally, and anterior thalamic radiation bilaterally, driven primarily by an increase in radial diffusivity. VMI scores did not demonstrate a significant relationship to cortical surface area, cortical thickness, or diffusion measures in the control group. Our results indicate that visual-motor integration problems persist into adulthood for very low birth weight individuals, which may be due to structural alterations in several specific gray-white matter networks. Visual-motor deficits appear related to reduced surface area of motor and visual cortices and disturbed connectivity in long association tracts containing visual and motor information. We conjecture that these outcomes may be due to perinatal brain injury or aberrant cortical development secondary to injury or due to very preterm birth.	acoustic lobing;birth injuries;body of uterus;brain injuries;cerebral cortex;cognition disorders;corpus callosum;diffusion tensor imaging;epilepsy, temporal lobe;fascicle - nerve fibers;fractional anisotropy;freesurfer;insula of reil;lateral computing;lateral thinking;low birth weight infant;magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo mri;map;medial graph;morphometrics;motor neuron disease;parietal lobe;perinatal brain injury;radial (radio);radial basis function;radiation of thalamus;spatial analysis;superior temporal gyrus;thalamic structure;thickness (graph theory);tract (literature);very low birth weight;vision;white matter;primary motor cortex	Kam Sripada;Gro C.

23c03aeeed11c7650afeb146b58eb6586dbb5439	synchronization in dynamic neural networks		This thesis is concerned with the function and implementation of synchronization in networks of oscillators. Evidence for the existence of synchronization in cortex is reviewed and a suitable architecture for exhibiting synchronization is defined. A number of factors which affect the performance of synchronization in networks of laterally coupled oscillators are investigated. It is shown that altering the strength of the lateral connections between nodes and altering the connective scope of a network can be used to improve synchronization performance. It is also shown that complete connective scope is not required for global synchrony to occur. The effects of noise on synchronization performance are also investigated and it is shown that where an oscillator network is able to synchronize effectively, it will also be robust to a moderate level of noise in the lateral connections. Where a particular oscillator model shows poor synchronization performance, it is shown that noise in the lateral connections is capable of improving synchronization performance. A number of applications of synchronizing oscillator networks are investigated. The use of synchronized oscillations to encode global binding information is investigated and the relationship between the form of grouping obtained and connective scope is discussed. The potential for using learning in synchronizing oscillator networks is illustrated and an investigation is made into the possibility of maintaining multiple phases in a network of synchronizing oscillators. It is concluded from these investigations that it is difficult to maintain multiple phases in the network architecture used throughout this thesis and a modified architecture capable of producing the required behaviour is demonstrated.	artificial neural network;encode;global serializability;lateral thinking;logical connective;network architecture;oscillator (cellular automaton)	David E.

Here, we investigate a model for the activity dependent development of ocular dominance maps which allows to vary the degree of lateral competition. For weak competition, it resembles a correlation-based learning model and for strong competition, it becomes a self-organizing map. Thus, in the regime of weak competition the receptive fields are shaped by the second order statistics of the input patterns, whereas in the regime of strong competition, the higher moments and """"features"""" of the individual patterns become important. When correlated localized stimuli from two eyes drive the cortical development we find (i) that a topographic map and binocular, localized receptive fields emerge when the degree of competition exceeds a critical value and (ii) that receptive fields exhibit eye dominance beyond a second critical value. For anti-correlated activity between the eyes, the second order statistics drive the system to develop ocular dominance even for weak competition, but no topography emerges.

0f4b4639455ae3ead34b0d192fffa7765cf2e17f	pace yourself: intraindividual variability in context use revealed by self-paced event-related brain potentials		Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) have revealed multiple mechanisms by which contextual constraints impact language processing. At the same time, little work has examined the trial-to-trial dynamics of context use in the brain. In the current study, we probed intraindividual variability in behavioral and neural indices of context processing during reading. In a concurrent self-paced reading and ERP paradigm, participants read sentences that were either strongly or weakly constraining completed with an expected or unexpected target word. Our findings revealed substantial within-subject variability in behavioral and neural responses to contextual constraints. First, context-based amplitude reductions of the N400, a component linked to semantic memory access, were largest among trials eliciting the slowest RTs. Second, the RT distribution of unexpected words in strongly constraining contexts was positively skewed, reflecting an increased proportion of very slow RTs to trials that violated semantic predictions. Among those prediction-violating trials eliciting faster RTs, a late sustained anterior positivity was observed. However, among trials producing the differentially slowed RTs to prediction violations, we observed a markedly earlier effect of constraint in the form of an anterior N2, a component linked to conflict resolution and the cognitive control of behavior. The current study provides the first neurophysiological evidence for the direct role of cognitive control functions in the volitional control of reading. Collectively, our findings suggest that context use varies substantially within individual participants and that coregistering behavioral and neural indices of online sentence processing offers a window into these single-item dynamics.	control function (econometrics);erp;heart rate variability;largest;programming paradigm;sentence	Brennan R.

Despite the tremendous effort of neuroscientists, the exact nature of the neuronal code remains elusive. Various experimental and theoretical techniques have been used to resolve the question in recent decades, with methods of signal estimation and detection theory playing an important part. In this paper we review the particular approach which relies on the concepts of Fisher information and Cramér-Rao bound. These concepts essentially investigate the neuronal coding problem by addressing the theoretical limits on the decoding precision, be it in single neurons or in their populations. Despite the success of this approach in many instances, the underlying mathematical theory is not free of certain restrictive assumptions which might complicate the inference in some cases of interest. We recapitulate the assumptions and examine the practical extent of their validity.

Both task-constrained meta-analytic co activation mapping and task-free resting-state connectivity analysis independently identified two distinct clusters within RTPJ, subsequently characterized by network mapping and functional forward/reverse inference. The anterior cluster increased activity concomitantly with a midcingulate-motor-insular network, functionally associated with attention, and decreased activity with a parietal network, functionally associated with social cognition and introspection. The posterior cluster showed the exactly opposite association pattern. Our data thus suggest that RTPJ links two antagonistic brain networks processing external versus internal information.	introspection;modal logic;network mapping;social cognition	Danilo Bzdok;Robert Langner;Simon B.

e2fb56f6aa098ec82319b084db98fbd8f3b5c59c	investigating the bold spectral power of the intrinsic connectivity networks in fibromyalgia patients: a resting-state fmri study		Recent advances in multivariate statistical analysis of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have provided novel insights into the network organization of the human brain. Here, we applied group independent component analysis, a well-established approach for detecting brain intrinsic connectivity networks, to examine the spontaneous BOLD fluctuations in patients with fibromyalgia and healthy controls before and after exposure to a stressor. The BOLD spectral power characteristics of component time courses were calculated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, and group comparison was performed at six frequency bins between 0 and 0.24 Hz at 0.04 Hz intervals. Relative to controls, patients with fibromyalgia displayed significant BOLD spectral power differences in the default-mode, salience, and subcortical networks at the baseline level (PBon ferroni-corrected < 0.05). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) further revealed significant effects of the cold water temperature, and pain rating on the spectral power of the sensorimotor, salience, and prefrontal networks, while the diagnosis of fibromyalgia influenced the BOLD spectral power of the salience and subcortical networks (PFDR-corrected < 0.05). Since the BOLD spectral power reflects the degree of fluctuations within a network, future studies of the correlation between BOLD spectral power and pain processing can cast additional light on the nature of the central nervous system dysfunction in patients with chronic pain syndromes.	baseline dental cement;baseline (configuration management);cns disorder;default;fast fourier transform;fibromyalgia;futures studies;hertz (hz);independent component analysis;magnetic resonance imaging;nervous system structure;network governance;patients;rest;resting state fmri;sensor;spontaneous order;algorithm;blood oxygen level dependent;chronic pain syndrome	Behnaz Jarrahi;Katherine T.

In this work we extend a recent spiking actor-critic network model of the basal ganglia, aiming to create a minimal realistic model of learning from both positive and negative rewards. We hypothesize and implement in the model segregation of not only the dorsal striatum, but also of the ventral striatum into populations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that carry either D1 or D2 dopamine (DA) receptor type. This segregation allows explicit representation of both positive and negative expected reward within respective population. In line with recent experiments, we further assume that D1 and D2 MSN populations have distinct, opposing DA-modulated bidirectional synaptic plasticity. We implement the spiking network model in the simulator NEST and conduct experiments involving application of delayed rewards in a grid world setting, where a moving agent has to reach a goal state while maximizing the total obtained reward. We demonstrate that the network can learn not only to approach the positive rewards, but also to consequently avoid punishments as opposed to the original model. The spiking network model highlights thus functional role of D1-D2 MSN segregation within striatum and explains necessity for reversed direction of DA-dependent plasticity found at synapses converging on different types of striatal MSNs.	ap computer science a;actor model;artificial neural network;basal (phylogenetics);dopamine;experiment;ganglia;modulation;nest (neural simulation tool);network model;population;reinforcement learning;spiking neural network;synaptic package manager	Jenia Jitsev;Abigail Morrison;Marc Tittgemeyer	2012	The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252834	computer science;machine learning;reward system;neurophysiology;artificial neural network;spiking neural network	ML	18.510547404322875	-70.35693427583567	93337

We applied a feedback-based learning task with two learning conditions. In the positive learning condition, participants could learn to choose responses that lead to monetary gains, whereas in the negative learning condition, they could learn to avoid responses that lead to monetary losses. To test the stability of learning preferences, the task involved a reversal phase in which stimulus–response assignments were inverted. Negative learners were defined as individuals that performed better in the negative than in the positive learning condition (and vice versa for positive learners). The behavioral data showed strong individual differences in learning from positive and negative outcomes that persisted throughout the reversal phase and were more pronounced for older than younger adults. Older negative learners showed a stronger tendency to avoid negative outcomes than younger negative learners. However, contrary to younger adults, this negative learning bias was not associated with a larger ERN, suggesting that avoidance learning in older negative learners might be decoupled from error processing. Furthermore, older adults showed learning impairments compared to younger adults. The ERP analyses suggest that these impairments reflect deficits in the ability to build up relational representations of ambiguous outcomes.	choice behavior;cognition disorders;erp;inductive bias;large;learning disorders;money;negative feedback;negativity (quantum mechanics)	Ben Eppinger;Jutta Kray	2011	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2009.21364	psychology;error-related negativity;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology;negative feedback	HCI	15.810972128993058	-78.923401835745	93833

These distributed neuroanatomical systems provide a sensitive window on brain function and its disruption in a variety of neuropathological conditions. The study of macroscale intrinsic connectivity networks in preclinical species, where genetic and environmental conditions can be controlled and manipulated with high specificity, offers the opportunity to elucidate the biological determinants of these alterations. While rsfMRI methods are now widely used in human connectivity research, these approaches have only relatively recently been back-translated into laboratory animals. Here we review recent progress in the study of functional connectivity in rodent species, emphasising the ability of this approach to resolve large-scale brain networks that recapitulate neuroanatomical features of known functional systems in the human brain. These include, but are not limited to, a distributed set of regions identified in rats and mice that may represent a putative evolutionary precursor of the human default mode network (DMN). The impact and control of potential experimental and methodological confounds are also critically discussed. Finally, we highlight the enormous potential and some initial application of connectivity mapping in transgenic models as a tool to investigate the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. We conclude by discussing the translational potential of these methods in basic and applied neuroscience.	animals, laboratory;artificial neural network;decision model and notation;default;denial-of-service attack;genetic translation process;interphase cell;large scale brain networks;neural network simulation;neuroscience discipline;resonance;resting state fmri;sensitivity and specificity	Alessandro Gozzi;Adam J.

Using scalp-recorded event-related potentials (ERPs), we sought to find ERP components that are predictive of error correction performance during rhythmic movements.   METHOD Healthy right-handed participants were asked to synchronize their finger taps to a regular tone sequence (every 600 ms), while EEG data were continuously recorded. Data from 15 participants were analyzed. Occasional irregularities were built into stimulus presentation timing: 90 ms before (advances: negative shift) or after (delays: positive shift) the expected time point. A tapping condition alternated with a listening condition in which identical stimulus sequence was presented but participants did not tap.   RESULTS Behavioral error correction was observed immediately following a shift, with a degree of over-correction with positive shifts. Our stimulus-locked ERP data analysis revealed, 1) increased auditory N1 amplitude for the positive shift condition and decreased auditory N1 modulation for the negative shift condition; and 2) a second enhanced negativity (N2) in the tapping positive condition, compared with the tapping negative condition. In response-locked epochs, we observed a CNV (contingent negative variation)-like negativity with earlier latency in the tapping negative condition compared with the tapping positive condition. This CNV-like negativity peaked at around the onset of subsequent tapping, with the earlier the peak, the better the error correction performance with the negative shifts while the later the peak, the better the error correction performance with the positive shifts.   DISCUSSION This study showed that the CNV-like negativity was associated with the error correction performance during our sensorimotor synchronization study. Auditory N1 and N2 were differentially involved in negative vs. positive error correction. However, we did not find evidence for their involvement in behavioral error correction. Overall, our study provides the basis from which further research on the role of the CNV in perceptual and motor timing can be developed.	adaptive behavior;auditory perception;average-case complexity;contingency (philosophy);contingent negative variation;copy number polymorphism;erp;electroencephalography;hearing problem;modulation;movement;negativity (quantum mechanics);onset (audio);error correction	Joonyong Jang;Myles Jones;Elizabeth Milne;Daniel Wilson;Kwang-Hyuk Lee	2016	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.11.071	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	HCI	15.659309665116696	-78.233849641395	94077

Rushworth et al. [Rushworth, M. F., Krams, M., & Passingham, R. E. The attentional role of the left parietal cortex: The distinct lateralization and localization of motor attention in the human brain. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 13, 698710, 2001] have recently provided evidence for a left-lateralized network of parietal areas involved in motor attention. Using two variants of a cued reaction time (RT) task, we set out to investigate whether high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; 5 Hz) delivered off-line in a virtual lesion paradigm over the right or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) would affect performance in a motor versus a visual attention task. Although rTMS over the DLPFC on either side did not affect RT performance on a spatial orienting task, it did lead to an increase in the RTs of invalidly cued trials in a motor attention task when delivered to the left DLPFC. The opposite effect was found when rTMS was delivered to the PPC: In this case, conditioning the right PPC led to increased RTs in invalidly cued trials located in the left hemispace, in the spatial orienting task. rTMS over the PPC on either side did not affect performance in the motor attention task. This double dissociation was evident in the first 10 min after rTMS conditioning. These results enhance our understanding of the networks associated with attention. They provide evidence of a role for the left DLPFC in the mechanisms of motor preparation, and confirm Mesulam's original proposal for a right PPC dominance in spatial attention [Mesulam, M. M.

Animal research reveals a central role of ventral striatum in emotional behavior, for both aversive conditioning, with striatum signaling aversive prediction errors (aPE), and for integrating competing influences of distinct striatal inputs from regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, hippocampus and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Translating these ventral striatal findings from animal research to human CER, we hypothesized that successful CER would affect the balance of competing influences of striatal afferents on striatal aPE signals, in a way favoring PFC as opposed to 'subcortical' (i.e., non-isocortical) striatal inputs. Using aversive Pavlovian conditioning with and without CER during fMRI, we found that during CER, superior regulators indeed reduced the modulatory impact of 'subcortical' striatal afferents (hippocampus, amygdala and VTA) on ventral striatal aPE signals, while keeping the PFC impact intact. In contrast, inferior regulators showed an opposite pattern. Our results demonstrate that ventral striatal aPE signals and associated competing modulatory inputs are critical mechanisms underlying successful cognitive regulation of aversive emotions in humans.	amygdaloid structure;animal experimentation;auditory recruitment;cfp wt allele;cognition disorders;conditioning (psychology);emotions;inborn errors of metabolism;modulation;neostriatum;operant conditioning;powerbuilder foundation classes;prefrontal cortex;rem sleep behavior disorder;ventral striatum;ventral tegmental area;fmri	Satja Mulej Bratec;Xiyao Xie;Yijun Wang;Leonhard Schilbach;Claus Zimmer;Afra M.

However, they do not explain how the activation of these large-scale networks derives from the cerebral information processing mechanisms involved in cognitive functions. At this global level of representation, the human brain can be considered as a dynamic biological system. Dynamic Bayesian networks seem currently the most promising modeling paradigm. Our modeling approach is based on the anatomical connectivity of cerebral regions, the information processing within cerebral areas and the causal influences that connected regions exert on each other. The capabilities of the formalism's current version are illustrated by the modeling of a phonemic categorization process, explaining the different cerebral activations in normal and dyslexic subjects.

Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) enables an unbiased whole-brain quantitative analysis of the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of the brain WM tracts in vivo.   PATIENTS AND METHODS We assessed with TBSS 14 patients with genetically confirmed FRDA and 14 age- and sex-matched healthy controls who were also examined with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess regional atrophy of the GM and WM.   RESULTS TBSS revealed decreased FA in the inferior and superior cerebellar peduncles and the corticospinal tracts in the medullary pyramis, in WM tracts of the right cerebellar hemisphere and in the right occipito-frontal and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. Increased MD was observed in the superior cerebellar peduncles, deep cerebellar WM, posterior limbs of the internal capsule and retrolenticular area, bilaterally, and in the WM underlying the left central sulcus. Decreased FA in the left superior cerebellar peduncle correlated with clinical severity. VBM showed small symmetric areas of loss of bulk of the peridentate WM which also correlated with clinical severity.   CONCLUSIONS TBSS enables in vivo demonstration of degeneration of the brainstem and cerebellar WM tracts which neuropathological examination indicates to be specifically affected in FRDA. TBSS complements VBM and might be a more sensitive tool to detect WM structural changes in degenerative diseases of the CNS.	abnormal degeneration;atrophic;brain stem;cns disorder;cerebellar diseases;cerebellar peduncle;cerebral hemisphere structure (body structure);complement system proteins;cortical cell layer of the cerebral cortex;fractional anisotropy;friedreich ataxia;gray matter;groove;hemisphere of cerebellum;hepatolenticular degeneration;internal capsule of brain;limb structure;molecular dynamics;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;nerve degeneration;patients;peduncle - plant part;spatial analysis;spinal cord;tract (literature);video-in video-out;voxel;white matter	Riccardo Della Nave;Andrea Ginestroni;Carlo Tessa;Elena Salvatore;Ilaria Bartolomei;Fabrizio Salvi;Maria Teresa Dotti;Giuseppe De Michele;Silvia Piacentini;Mario Mascalchi	2008	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.11.050	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;radiology;quantitative analysis;fractional anisotropy;anatomy;voxel-based morphometry	ML	20.211930232639833	-80.00102126998748	94726

Methods designed to interpret these codes, such as population vector analysis, are either inefficient, i.e., the variance of the estimate is much larger than the smallest possible variance, or biologically implausible, like maximum likelihood. Moreover, these methods attempt to compute a scalar or vector estimate of the encoded variable. Neurons are faced with a similar estimation problem. They must read out the responses of the presynaptic neurons, but, by contrast, they typically encode the variable with a further population code rather than as a scalar. We show how a non-linear recurrent network can be used to perform these estimation in an optimal way while keeping the estimate in a coarse code format. This work suggests that lateral connections in the cortex may be involved in cleaning up uncorrelated noise among neurons representing similar variables .	code;encode;lateral computing;lateral thinking;neural coding;nonlinear system;plasma cleaning;population vector;recurrent neural network;white noise	Alexandre Pouget;Kechen Zhang	1996			mathematical optimization;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;maximum likelihood;statistics	ML	19.66870053071962	-72.56567936633695	94787

Functional interaction between these two layers of FCx was examined using custom-designed ceramic-based microelectrode arrays (MEAs) that allowed simultaneous recording of firing patterns of FCx neurons in Layer 2/3 and Layer 5 in nonhuman primates performing a simple go/no-go discrimination task. This unique recording arrangement showed differential encoding of task-related sensory events by cells in each layer with Layer 2/3 cells exhibiting larger firing peaks during presentation of go target and no-go target task images, whereas Layer 5 cells showed more activity during reward contingent motor responses in the task. Firing specificity to task-related events was further demonstrated by synchronized firing between pairs of cells in different layers that occupied the same vertically oriented “column” on the MEA. Pairs of cells in different layers recorded at adjacent “noncolumnar” orientations on the MEA did not show synchronized firing during the same task-related events. The results provide required evidence in support of previously suggested task-related sensorimotor processing in the FCx via functionally segregated minicolumns.	cerebral cortex;contingency (philosophy);cysteamine;exhibits as topic;large;mammals;mental orientation;microelectrodes;multiple endocrine neoplasia;neurons;primates;protein arrays;sensitivity and specificity;anatomical layer;frontal lobe	Ioan Opris;Robert E.

a35222356e1bc22aaf98474aff7cbf3e1a048b74	of space and smell: the strange evolution of the human nose	navigation;sensory evolution;olfaction	We humans are the Cyrano de Bergerac's of the primate world, with conspicuously large external noses compared to other great apes. To understand why our nose evolved we must first understand the function of olfaction. To do this requires traveling back in time to the evolution of the first brain. I will describe the hypothesis that the sense of smell evolved as a sense of direction, playing a critical role in navigation and that this function explains why olfactory systems are so plastic and variable in size across animals. The navigation function of olfaction in humans has been largely neglected and I will describe studies showing that humans can orient accurately to odors in real world and virtual reality environments. But why such a nose? To understand this, I return to an evolutionary framework to describe how the first nose, a structure used both for respiration and olfaction, appeared in air-breathing fish. I describe a new hypothesis (PROUST: perceiving and representing odor utility in space and time) to explain how the evolution of air-breathing could have forced vertebrates to segregate olfactory mapping of space to the main olfactory system and the mapping of odors across time to the newly evolved second (vomeronasal) olfactory system. This dichotomy of function and the subsequent conflict between mapping time versus space using odors, could have led to a number of novel vertebrate solutions to sample odors, including the forked tongue of the snake and the human external nose. I will end by proposing that this perspective on the evolution and function of human olfaction could enhance current paradigms in human-robot communication and decision making.	evolution;humans;human–robot interaction;navigation function;virtual reality	Lucia F.

c88a8119c04db46044483991a2868a60245ceaaa	common and differential neural networks of emotion regulation by detachment, reinterpretation, distraction, and expressive suppression: a comparative fmri investigation	emotion regulation;expressive suppression;distraction;reinterpretation;detachment;fmri	Emotions are an indispensable part of our mental life. The term emotion regulation refers to those processes that influence the generation, the experience and the expression of emotions. There is a great variety of strategies to regulate emotions efficiently, which are used in daily life and that have been investigated by cognitive neuroscience. Distraction guides attention to a secondary task. Reinterpretation, a variant of cognitive reappraisal, works by changing the meaning of an emotional stimulus. Detachment, another reappraisal strategy, refers to distancing oneself from an emotional stimulus, thereby reducing its personal relevance. Expressive Suppression modifies the behavioral or physiological response to an emotional stimulus. These four strategies are not equally effective in terms of emotion regulation success and have been shown to partly rely on different neuronal systems. Here, we compare for the first time the neural mechanisms of these typical strategies directly in a common functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of downregulation of negative emotions. Our results indicate that three of those strategies (Detachment, Expressive Suppression and Distraction) conjointly increase brain activation in a right prefronto-parietal regulation network and significantly reduce activation of the left amygdala. Compared to the other regulation strategies, Reinterpretation specifically recruited a different control network comprising left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal gyrus and was not effective in downregulation of the amygdala. We conclude that Detachment, Distraction and Expressive Suppression recruit very similar emotion regulation networks, whereas Reinterpretation is associated with activation of a qualitatively different network, making this regulation strategy a special one. Notably, Reinterpretation also proved to be the least effective strategy in neural terms, as measured by downregulation of amygdala activation.	activation function;amygdaloid structure;artificial neural network;cognition disorders;cognitive tutor;coping behavior;distraction - pain management method;down-regulation;emotions;expressive language disorder;expressive power (computer science);magnetic resonance imaging;neural network simulation;neuroscience discipline;prefrontal cortex;programming paradigm;relevance;visual guide;word lists by frequency;zero suppression;fmri	Denise Dörfel;Jan-Peter Lamke;Falk Hummel;Ullrich Wagner;Susanne Erk;Henrik Walter	2014	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.051	psychology;cognitive psychology;developmental psychology;social psychology	AI	15.980492361290729	-78.29476730218687	95218

Activation of limb and axial muscles were driven by neural output patterns obtained from a central pattern generator (CPG) which is composed of simulated spiking neurons with adaptation. The CPG consists of a body-CPG and four limb-CPGs that are interconnected via synapses both ipsilaterally and contralaterally. We use the model both with and without sensory modulation and four different combinations of ipsilateral and contralateral coupling between the limb-CPGs. We found that the proprioceptive sensory inputs are essential in obtaining a coordinated lateral sequence walking gait (walking). The sensory feedback includes the signals coming from the stretch receptor like intraspinal neurons located in the girdle regions and the limb stretch receptors residing in the hip and scapula regions of the salamander. On the other hand, walking trot gait (trotting) is more under central (CPG) influence compared to that of the peripheral or sensory feedback. We found that the gait transition from walking to trotting can be induced by increased activity of the descending drive coming from the mesencephalic locomotor region and is helped by the sensory inputs at the hip and scapula regions detecting the late stance phase. More neurophysiological experiments are required to identify the precise type of mechanoreceptors in the salamander and the neural mechanisms mediating the sensory modulation.	acclimatization;central pattern generator;experiment;gait disorders, neurologic;lateral thinking;mechanoreceptors;midbrain structure;modulation;muscle;neurons;peripheral;sensor;sensory feedback;simulation;stretch receptors;synapses	Nalin Harischandra;Jérémie Knuesel;Alexander K.

Based on physiological data, we have developed a realistic computational model and studied its output after presenting different types of plausible cutaneous stimuli. Computer simulations show that (1) static stimuli are encoded in progressive spatio-temporal patterns made up of single-spike trains generated by each stimulated neuron, and (2) moving stimuli are encoded with a bursting discharge of those units responding to the leading edge of the stimulus. These results suggest that the role of CN could be the transformation of the stimulus representation in order to facilitate both discrimination and classification in later processing stages.

Early-stage waves mediated by acetylcholine (ACh) manifest as slow, spreading bursts of action potentials. They are believed to be initiated by the spontaneous firing of Starburst Amacrine Cells (SACs), whose dense, recurrent connectivity then propagates this activity laterally. Their inter-wave interval and shifting wave boundaries are the result of the slow after-hyperpolarization of the SACs creating an evolving mosaic of recruitable and refractory cells, which can and cannot participate in waves, respectively. Recent evidence suggests that cholinergic waves may be modulated by the extracellular concentration of ACh. Here, we construct a simplified, biophysically consistent, reaction-diffusion model of cholinergic retinal waves capable of recapitulating wave dynamics observed in mice retina recordings. The dense, recurrent connectivity of SACs is modeled through local, excitatory coupling occurring via the volume release and diffusion of ACh. In addition to simulation, we are thus able to use non-linear wave theory to connect wave features to underlying physiological parameters, making the model useful in determining appropriate pharmacological manipulations to experimentally produce waves of a prescribed spatiotemporal character.

Individual tests can be classified according to the degree to which they involve g. Here, regional brain volumes associated with g are investigated by means of structural magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry. First, individual differences in the amount of regional gray matter volumes across the entire brain were correlated with eight cognitive tests showing distinguishable g-involvement. Results show that increasing g-involvement of individual tests was associated with increased gray matter volume throughout the brain. Second, it is shown that two prototypical measures of verbal and non-verbal g (i.e., vocabulary and block design) correlate with the amount of regional gray matter across frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes, suggesting that the general factor of intelligence relates to areas distributed across the brain as opposed to the view that g derives exclusively from the frontal lobes.

Implementing realistic attentional processes in artificial vision systems could greatly improve their performance. However, existing models of attention do not adequately capture all of its complex effects on neural activity. In particular, existing models cannot reproduce recently reported effects such as shifting and scaling of receptive fields. Here we suggest that many of these effects arise naturally from feedback connections between visual areas (which redistribute top-down attentional modulation) and local, nonspecific short-range inhibition (which produce competition between stimuli that is automatically scaled to receptive field size). We show that a simple model with two reciprocally connected layers and short-range inhibition can generate many known effects of attention, including receptive field shift and resizing. Due to its conceptual simplicity, the model may be easily integrated into a broad range of computer vision systems.	computer vision;dbpedia;feedback;image scaling;interaction;lateral computing;lateral thinking;modulation;radio frequency;reification (computer science);top-down and bottom-up design	Thomas Miconi;Rufin van Rullen	2011	2011 IEEE Symposium On Computational Intelligence For Multimedia, Signal And Vision Processing	10.1109/CIMSIVP.2011.5949241	psychology;computer vision;simulation;communication	Vision	19.979406423239418	-69.04058286472556	95852

Previous studies have shown that while time perception develops early in life, interference control seems to follow a protracted course of maturation into late adolescence. Thus, the current study examined developmental changes in neural activation and functional interaction between brain regions during a combined time discrimination and interference control task using fMRI. Thirty-four participants, aged 8-15 years, were scanned while performing a spatial stimulus response compatibility (SRC) task and a time discrimination (TD) task using identical stimuli. We found shared neural activation in a fronto-parieto-cerebellar network as well as task-specific patterns of psychophysiological interaction with positive coupling between the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the superior parietal lobes bilaterally, the contralateral IFG and the thalamus during interference control and positive interactions between the right IFG and bilateral cerebellar activity and the thalamus during time discrimination. Developmental changes in task performance and brain activation patterns were only observed during the SRC task, with increased neural activity in the left inferior parietal gyrus and positive coupling between fronto-parietal brain regions that was only observed in the adolescents group. These results suggest that although both cognitive tasks rely on a shared neural network, distinct developmental curves of brain activation and connectivity could be observed associated with differential maturation patterns underlying cognitive development.	adolescent (age group);anatomical maturation;artificial neural network;basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;bilateral filter;biological neural networks;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;frontal lobe gyrus;ifng wt allele;inferior frontal gyrus;interaction;interference (communication);medical device incompatibility problem;neural network simulation;parietal lobe;sample rate conversion;scanning;structure of diencephalon;thalamic structure;time perception;cognitive development;fmri	Susanne Neufang;Gereon R.

We have examined uni-directional synaptic coupling processes between two classes of neuronal network oscillators: autonomously active “intrinsic” oscillators, and “potential” oscillators that lack sufficient excitatory drive for autonomous activity. We model such oscillator networks in the bilaterally-symmetrical, Xenopus tadpole spinal cord circuits that co-ordinate swimming. “Glutamate” coupling EPSPs can entrain a second oscillator of lower frequency provided their strength is sufficient. Fast (AMPA) EPSPs advance spiking on each cycle, while slow (NMDA) EPSPs increase frequency over many cycles. EPSPs can also enable rhythmicity in “potential” oscillators and entrain them. IPSPs operate primarily on a cycle-by-cycle basis. They can advance or delay spiking to entrain a second “intrinsic” oscillator with higher, equal or lower frequency. Bilaterally symmetrical coupling connections operate twice per cycle: once in each half-cycle, on each side of the receiving oscillator. Excitatory and inhibitory coupling allow entrainment in complimentary areas of parameter space.	action potential;autonomous robot;brainwave entrainment;class;cycle basis;glutamic acid;inhibitory postsynaptic potentials;n-methylaspartate;oscillator device component;population parameter;spinal cord;synaptic package manager	Mark J.

Astrocytes modulate neuronal firings at both single cell level of tripartite synapses and the neuron-glial network level. Astrocytes release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glutamate into the neuron-glial network. These gliotransmitters diffuse over the network to form long distance signals to regulate neuron firings. In this paper, we study a neuron-glial network model that includes a diffusion of astrocytic ATP and glutamate to investigate how long distance diffusion of the gliotransmitters affects the information processing in a neuronal network. We find that gliotransmitters diffusion can compensate for the failure of information processing of interneuron network firings induced by defectively coupled synapses. Moreover, we find that calcium waves in astrocyte network and firings in interneuron network are both sensitive to the glutamate diffusion rate and feedback intensities of astrocytes on interneurons.	information processing;synapse	Jia-Jia Li;Mengmeng Du;Rong Wang;Jin-Zhi Lei;Ying Wu	2016	I.

d1a60c16bb68c8942bb13aa8706ae90deef87e87	responding with restraint: what are the neurocognitive mechanisms?	cognitive control	An important aspect of cognitive control is the ability to respond with restraint. Here, we modeled this experimentally by measuring the degree of response slowing that occurs when people respond to an imperative stimulus in a context where they might suddenly need to stop the initiated response compared with a context in which they do not need to stop. We refer to the RT slowing that occurs as the “response delay effect.” We conjectured that this response delay effect could relate to one or more neurocognitive mechanism(s): partial response suppression (i.e., “active braking”), prolonged decision time, and slower response facilitation. These accounts make different predictions about motor system excitability and brain activation. To test which neurocognitive mechanisms underlie the response delay effect, we performed two studies with TMS and we reanalyzed fMRI data. The results suggest that the response delay effect is at least partly explained by active braking, possibly involving a mechanism that is similar to that used to stop responses completely. These results further our understanding of how people respond with restraint by pointing to proactive recruitment of a neurocognitive mechanism heretofore associated with outright stopping.	auditory recruitment;excited state;experiment;imperative programming;optimal stopping;physical restraint equipment (device);windows rt;zero suppression;fmri;facilitation;neurocognitive	Sara Jahfari;Cathy M.

These mutations change the biophysical properties of NaV1.7 channels leading to hyperexcitability of dorsal root ganglion nociceptors and pain symptoms. There is a need for better understanding of how gain-of-function mutations alter the atomic structure of Nav1.7. We used homology modeling to build an atomic model of NaV1.7 and a network-based theoretical approach, which can predict interatomic interactions and connectivity arrangements, to investigate how pain-related NaV1.7 mutations may alter specific interatomic bonds and cause connectivity rearrangement, compared to benign variants and polymorphisms. For each amino acid substitution, we calculated the topological parameters betweenness centrality (B ct ), degree (D), clustering coefficient (CC ct ), closeness (C ct ), and eccentricity (E ct ), and calculated their variation (Δ value  = mutant value -WT value ). Pathogenic NaV1.7 mutations showed significantly higher variation of |ΔB ct | compared to benign variants and polymorphisms. Using the cut-off value ±0.26 calculated by receiver operating curve analysis, we found that ΔB ct correctly differentiated pathogenic NaV1.7 mutations from variants not causing biophysical abnormalities (nABN) and homologous SNPs (hSNPs) with 76% sensitivity and 83% specificity. Our in-silico analyses predict that pain-related pathogenic NaV1.7 mutations may affect the network topological properties of the protein and suggest |ΔB ct | value as a potential in-silico marker.	amino acid substitution;amino acids;anatomy, regional;betweenness centrality;clustering coefficient;congenital abnormality;dna sequence rearrangement;distance (graph theory);erythromelalgia;ganglia, spinal;genetic polymorphism;homologous gene;homology (biology);homology modeling;interaction;mutation;network topology;nociceptors;paroxysmal extreme pain disorder;posterior root of spinal nerve;receiver operating characteristic;scn9a gene;sensitivity and specificity;single nucleotide polymorphism;small fiber neuropathy;sodium channel;syndrome;bak protein;nervous system disorder;statistical cluster;voltage	Dimos Kapetis;Jenny Sassone;Yang Yang;Barbara Galbardi;Markos N.

265b46cf1c0cf100c2e4dc3e6a3c45eb04d5ccab	effects of aging on hippocampal and anterior temporal activations during successful retrieval of memory for face–name associations	age difference;temporal lobe;older adult;functional connectivity;brain activation	Memory for face–name associations is an important type of memory in our daily lives, and often deteriorates in older adults. Although difficulty retrieving face–name associations is often apparent in the elderly, there is little neuroscientific evidence of age-related decline in this memory. The current fMRI study investigated differences in brain activations between healthy young and older adults during the successful retrieval of people's names (N) and job titles (J) associated with faces. During encoding, participants viewed unfamiliar faces, each paired with a job title and name. During retrieval, each learned face was presented with two job titles or two names, and participants were required to choose the correct job title or name. Retrieval success activity (RSA) was identified by comparing retrieval-phase activity for hits versus misses in N and J, and the RSAs in each task were compared between young and older adults. The study yielded three main findings. First, the hippocampus showed significant RSA in both tasks of N and J, and the activity was greater for young compared to older subjects. Second, the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) showed greater RSA in N than in J, but there was no age difference in the activity in this region. Third, functional connectivity between hippocampal and ATL activities in both retrieval tasks was higher for young than for older adults. Taken together, age-related differences in hippocampal activities and hippocampus–ATL connectivity could contribute to age-related decline in relational memory and to complaints of poor retrieval of people's names by older adults.	acoustic lobing;epilepsy, temporal lobe;face;hippocampus (brain);job syndrome;mental association;name;resting state fmri	Takashi Tsukiura;Atsushi Sekiguchi;Yukihito Yomogida;Seishu Nakagawa;Yayoi Shigemune;Toshimune Kambara;Yuko Akitsuki;Yasuyuki Taki;Ryuta Kawashima	2011	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2010.21476	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	HCI	16.383444093480485	-78.97131522634984	96702

In this article we argue that unsupervised deep learning represents an important step forward for improving neurocomputational models of perception and cognition, because it emphasizes the role of generative learning as opposed to discriminative (supervised) learning. As a case study, we present a series of simulations investigating the emergence of neural coding of visual space for sensorimotor transformations. We compare different network architectures commonly used as building blocks for unsupervised deep learning by systematically testing the type of receptive fields and gain modulation developed by the hidden neurons. In particular, we compare Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), which are stochastic, generative networks with bidirectional connections trained using contrastive divergence, with autoencoders, which are deterministic networks trained using error backpropagation. For both learning architectures we also explore the role of sparse coding, which has been identified as a fundamental principle of neural computation. The unsupervised models are then compared with supervised, feed-forward networks that learn an explicit mapping between different spatial reference frames. Our simulations show that both architectural and learning constraints strongly influenced the emergent coding of visual space in terms of distribution of tuning functions at the level of single neurons. Unsupervised models, and particularly RBMs, were found to more closely adhere to neurophysiological data from single-cell recordings in the primate parietal cortex. These results provide new insights into how basic properties of artificial neural networks might be relevant for modeling neural information processing in biological systems."""	architecture as topic;artificial neural network;backpropagation;biological system;cognition;computation (action);computational neuroscience;deep learning;deploy;emergence;frame (physical object);information processing;modulation;network architecture;neural coding;parietal lobe;primates;restricted boltzmann machine;sparse matrix;spatial reference system;supervised learning;unsupervised learning;cell transformation	Alberto Testolin;Michele De Filippo De Grazia;Marco Zorzi	2017		10.3389/fncom.2017.00013	semi-supervised learning;unsupervised learning;boltzmann machine;feature learning;self-organizing map;types of artificial neural networks;wake-sleep algorithm;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;deep learning;competitive learning;restricted boltzmann machine;communication;deep belief network;artificial neural network	ML	20.098971858180747	-68.12317585852996	96800
39aa0f7c38cad8c721b3f1b738f9b5b2bf288225	training spiking neural networks for cognitive tasks: a versatile framework compatible to various temporal codes		Conventional modeling approaches have found limitations in matching the increasingly detailed neural network structures and dynamics recorded in experiments to the diverse brain functionalities. On another approach, studies have demonstrated to train spiking neural networks for simple functions using supervised learning. Here, we introduce a modified SpikeProp learning algorithm, which achieved better learning stability in different activity states. In addition, we show biological realistic features such as lateral connections and sparse activities can be included in the network. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by implementing three well-known temporal codes for different types of cognitive tasks, which are MNIST digits recognition, spatial coordinate transformation, and motor sequence generation. Moreover, we find several characteristic features have evolved alongside the task training, such as selective activity, excitatory-inhibitory balance, and weak pair-wise correlation. The coincidence between the self-evolved and experimentally observed features indicates their importance on the brain functionality. Our results suggest a unified setting in which diverse cognitive computations and mechanisms can be studied.	algorithm;artificial neural network;code;computation;experiment;lateral computing;lateral thinking;mnist database;sparse matrix;spiking neural network;supervised learning	Chaofei Hong	2017	CoRR		supervised learning;artificial intelligence;machine learning;simple function;elementary cognitive task;spiking neural network;artificial neural network;computation;mnist database;computer science;cognition	ML	19.492465792512448	-67.68260848775263	96931

Plasmodium's natural movements are characterized by the rhythmic back-and-forth streaming of cytoplasm peristalsis, which results in the directed locomotion of plasmodium, and the periodic change of the electric potential on the surface of plasmodium. Although it was suggested the causal connection between the cytoplasmic streaming and the electric potential in P. polycephalum, the relationship between its plasmodium peristaltic behavior and the surface electric potential had not been statistically proven. In this study, based on the modern microscopic observation and the new electric potential measurement, we proved the consistence between the frequency spectrums of the electric potential wave and the peristaltic wave during the growth of plasmodium and the synchronization of their waveforms through cross-correlational analysis. And we concluded that the correlation exists between the peristaltic wave and the electric potential wave. This study added new evidence to the hypothesis of the sharing inner biological mechanism between plasmodium's peristaltic behavior and electric potential as previous studies indicated, and brought a new perspective towards the future research on amoeboid movement.

c813b983daa2ff5634a90e419e7c8e1ce0797fa0	is facial expression processing holistic?		Most studies examine holistic processing with respect to facial identity, but at least one study has also looked at holistic processing of facial expressions (Calder, Young, Keane, & Dean, 2000). However, this work used the partial composite paradigm, which is known to exhibit bias effects (Richler, Cheung, & Gauthier, 2011). The complete composite paradigm (Gauthier & Bukach, 2007) provides a bias-proof way to quantitatively measure holistic processing. In this paper, we perform the corresponding experiment in our face processing model (EMPATH, (Dailey, Cottrell, Padgett, & Adolphs, 2002)) to predict whether holistic processing of facial expressions will be found if the corresponding human experiments are performed, and our prediction is that it will. We also compared our model’s performance to the participants in recent experiments in facial expression recognition in humans (Tanaka, Kaiser, Butler, & Le Grand, 2012). Tanaka et al. (2012) concluded that expression recognition is not always holistic, but our results suggest that it is.	experiment;holism;humans;jacques gauthier;programming paradigm	Akinyinka Omigbodun;Garrison W.

We also developed simple neuron models for abstracting timing phenomena in large networks. Detailed biophysical models were used to study synaptic plasticity and its effect in generation and modulation of spikes in the granular layer network. Our results indicated that spatio-temporal information transfer through the granular network is controlled by synaptic inhibition [1]. Spike amplitude and number of spikes were modulated by L TP and LTD. Both in vitro and in vivo simulations indicated that inhibitory input via Golgi cells acts as a modulator and regulates the post synaptic excitability.	biological neuron model;computation;excited state;modulation;simulation;synaptic package manager;video-in video-out	Chaitanya Medini;Sathyaa Subramaniyam;Bipin Nair;Shyam Diwakar	2010	2010 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA)	10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645274	neuroscience;computer science;machine learning;communication	Robotics	18.309767579772803	-71.99687093607714	97065

FEF (Frontal Eye Field) is one of the important cortex of human being which plays a central role in the production of purposeful eye movements. A fMRI experiment was performed in this study to examine the cognitive role and functional connectivity mode between FEF and other brain cortex, such as FG (Fusiform Gyrus), PPC (Posterior Parietal Cortex) and PFC (Prefrontal Cortex). The results show that there are strong connectivity between FEF and these cortexes, and the functional connectivity pattern differs along with the complexity of task, the more complex, the higher connect intensity. Thus we infer that FEF may play an important role in visual processing not only eye movements but also high cognitive controlling. We also propose a probable reference model of visual processing which involved visual perception, visual encoding, visual imagination and declarative memorizing, FG, PPC, PFC may take part in such visual processing, and FEF may play a control role in such visual processing. Hopefully, this model could be used in computer vision processing.	computational model;computer vision;job control (unix);powerbuilder foundation classes;reference model;resting state fmri	Jie Xiang;Junjie Chen	2010	2010 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks	10.1109/CASoN.2010.81	computer vision;reference model;visualization;visual perception;visual memory;computer science;process control;vision for perception and vision for action;posterior parietal cortex;computational model;neurophysiology;eye movement	Vision	19.145502386403887	-67.50865294401659	97094

Almost by definition, those that cannot are dead. Changes that result in a mammal being able to tolerate a wider range of core body temperatures make that organism more robust to external perturbations. In this paper we show that when internal variables are regulated via ‘rein control’ mechanisms, decreasing the range of tolerable values increases the area of observed hysteresis but does not decrease the limits of regulation. We present circumstances where increasing the range of tolerable values actually decreases robustness to external perturbation.	daisyworld;homeostasis;hysteresis;robustness (computer science)	James G.

ad868857c288e6829969c98ce71783f68418cf32	categorical vs coordinate relationships do not reduce to spatial frequency differences		Categorical and coordinate stimulus processing were hypothesized by Kosslyn (1987) to be lateralized visual tasks, differentiated by task-relevant spatial frequencies. Slotnick et al. (2001) directly tested Kosslyn’s hypothesis and concluded that the lateralization presents only when tasks are sufficiently difficult. Our differential encoding model is a three layer neural network that accounts for lateralization in visual processing via the biologically plausible mechanism of differences in connection spread of long-range lateral neural connections (Hsiao, Cipollini, & Cottrell, 2013). We show that our model accounts for Slotnick’s data and that Slotnick’s analysis does not convincingly explain their results. Instead, we propose that Kosslyn’s initial hypothesis was based on an incorrect assumption: categorical and coordinate stimuli are not solely differentiated by spatial frequencies. The results that our model captures cannot be reproduced by Ivry and Robertson’s (1998) Double Filtering by Frequency theory, which is driven solely by lateralized spatial frequency processing.	artificial neural network;categorical logic;digital forensics framework (dff);encode;experiment;gnome wave cleaner;ibm notes;information;lh (complexity);lateral thinking;mathematical model;multitier architecture;self-replicating machine	Vishaal Prasad;Benjamin Cipollini;Garrison W.

It concerns the study of gradual rules, which makes it possible to represent correlations and modulation relations between variables. We propose a set of characteristics to identify these gradual rules, and a classification into direct rules and modulation rules. In neurobiology, pre-synaptic neuronal connections lead to gradual processing and modulation of cognitive information. We propose in the field of connectionism the use of Sigma-Pi connections to allow gradual processing in AI systems. In order to represent as well as possible the modulation processes between the inputs of a network, we have created a new type of connection, Asymmetric Sigma-Pi (ASP) units. These models have been implemented within a pre-existing hybrid neuro-symbolic system, the INSS system. The new hybrid system thus obtained, INSS-Gradual, allows the learning of bases of examples containing gradual modulation relations. ASP units facilitate the extraction of gradual rules from a neural network.	neuro-fuzzy	Gerardo Reyes Salgado;Bernard Amy	2005	Revue d'Intelligence Artificielle	10.3166/ria.19.951-962	psychology;developmental psychology;artificial intelligence;algorithm	Crypto	21.552629101859736	-70.16546788802218	97275

Since learning exists in the closed loop system constituted by the cerebellar cortex and the limb premotor network, the dynamics of the cerebellar cortex subsystem has to be stable for this class of functions. Two complementary problems of adaptive control have been solved: (i) the conditions of stability for the dynamics in the cerebellar neural network considered as an open-loop system, about the steady state, here called the “resting state” because the system is not in the learning phase: an internal dynamics results from these conditions; (ii) the conditions of stability for the dynamics of learning in the closed-loop system, i.e., a problem of optimization between the calculated output and the required output, which corresponds to the ability of the system to reach a target fixed in advance during the learning phase: the dynamics resulting from the variations in time of the synaptic efficacy between parallel fibres and Purkinje cell, is added to the internal dynamics in the steady state. Although the structure of the loop is imposed by the mathematical functions that make the global system stable, it is sufficiently general to be readily identified with global sensorimotor models.

However, there is very limited knowledge about whether and how the fluctuations of FC at rest are influenced by long-term training and experience. Here, we investigated how the dynamics of resting-state FC are linked to driving behavior by comparing 20 licensed taxi drivers with 20 healthy non-drivers using a sliding window approach. We found that the driving experience could be effectively decoded with 90% (p<0.001) accuracy by the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in some specific connections, based on a multivariate pattern analysis technique. Interestingly, the majority of these connections fell within a set of distributed regions named """"the vigilance network"""". Moreover, the decreased amplitude of the FC fluctuations within the vigilance network in the drivers was negatively correlated with the number of years that they had driven a taxi. Furthermore, temporally quasi-stable functional connectivity segmentation revealed significant differences between the drivers and non-drivers in the dwell time of specific vigilance-related transient brain states, although the brain's repertoire of functional states was preserved. Overall, these results suggested a significant link between the changes in the time-dependent aspects of resting-state FC within the vigilance network and long-term driving experiences. The results not only improve our understanding of how the brain supports driving behavior but also shed new light on the relationship between the dynamics of functional brain networks and individual behaviors."""	amplitude of low frequency fluctuations;behavior;biologic preservation;experience;fosamprenavir calcium;functional gastrointestinal disorders;interphase cell;name;neuroimaging;pattern recognition;rest;resting state fmri;biologic segmentation	Hui Shen;Zhenfeng Li;Jian Qin;Qiang Liu;Lubin Wang;Ling-Li Zeng;Hong Li;Dewen Hu	2016	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.09.010	psychology;neuroscience;simulation;cognition;attention;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention;computer security;behavior	HCI	20.418612104061165	-77.48617108342904	97339

The purpose of this study is to clarify the difference of perceptual process between hearing actual auditory stimuli and recalling them by use of EEG. Experiments were carried out to confirm a hypothesis which is that pseudo auditory evoked potentials (AEP) were being observed when the subjects recall the stimuli. It is necessary to use the averaging procedure to enhance P300 which is thought to have strong relationship to perception. Although weak light stimuli were used as triggers of the averaging, the P300 was contaminated by visual evoked potentials (VEP). To solve this problem, the independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to remove the VEPs. In addition, we found an independent component (IC) related to P300. As result of comparison of this IC, no significant difference was observed between hearing and recalling the stimuli. It is probable that these results imply perceptual process in late latency for recalling auditory stimuli is similar to that for hearing actual stimuli.	asymptotic equipartition property;auditory processing disorder;electroencephalography;experiment;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis	Makoto Shigeta;Takahiro Emoto;Masatake Akutagawa;Yoshio Kaji;Kazuhiko Furukawa;Fumio Shichijo;Hirofumi Nagashino;Yohsuke Kinouchi	2012	Proceedings of 2012 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/BHI.2012.6211605	psychology;speech recognition;n100;communication;audiology;auditory masking	ML	14.804486388293073	-78.71914871473322	97653

These patterns of regionally reduced activation have been linked to behavioral impairments of reading-related processes (e.g., phonological skills and rapid automatized naming). The observed functional and behavioral differences in individuals with developmental dyslexia have been complemented by reports of reduced gray matter in left parietotemporal, occipitotemporal areas, fusiform and lingual gyrus and the cerebellum. An important question for education is whether these neural differences are present before reading is taught. Developmental dyslexia can only be diagnosed after formal reading education starts. However, here we investigate whether the previously detected gray matter alterations in adults and children with developmental dyslexia can already be observed in a small group of pre-reading children with a family-history of developmental dyslexia compared to age and IQ-matched children without a family-history (N = 20/mean age: 5:9 years; age range 5:1-6:5 years). Voxel-based morphometry revealed significantly reduced gray matter volume indices for pre-reading children with, compared to children without, a family-history of developmental dyslexia in left occipitotemporal, bilateral parietotemporal regions, left fusiform gyrus and right lingual gyrus. Gray matter volume indices in left hemispheric occipitotemporal and parietotemporal regions of interest also correlated positively with rapid automatized naming. No differences between the two groups were observed in frontal and cerebellar regions. This discovery in a small group of children suggests that previously described functional and structural alterations in developmental dyslexia may not be due to experience-dependent brain changes but may be present at birth or develop in early childhood prior to reading onset. Further studies using larger sample sizes and longitudinal analyses are needed in order to determine whether the identified structural alterations may be utilized as structural markers for the early identification of children at risk, which may prevent the negative clinical, social and psychological outcome of developmental dyslexia.	bilateral filter;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;developmental reading disorder;dyslexia;gray matter;large;lateral occipitotemporal gyrus;medical imaging;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;onset (audio);region of interest;resonance;spinal cord lateral horn;tongue;voxel	Nora Maria Raschle;Maria Chang;Nadine Gaab	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.055	psychology;cognitive psychology;sample size determination;dyslexia;neuroscience;developmental psychology;radiology;lateralization of brain function;describing function;magnetic resonance imaging;communication;reading;voxel-based morphometry;region of interest	HCI	19.655417508891027	-79.93470667517066	97694

Such locomotor patterns are generated via coordination between leg movements, i.e., an interlimb coordination, which is largely controlled in a distributed manner by neural circuits located in thoracic ganglia. However, the mechanism responsible for the interlimb coordination still remains elusive. Understanding this mechanism will help us to elucidate the fundamental control principle of animals' agile locomotion and to realize robots with legs that are truly adaptive and could not be developed solely by conventional control theories. This study aims at providing a """"minimal"""" model of the interlimb coordination mechanism underlying hexapedal locomotion, in the hope that a single control principle could satisfactorily reproduce various aspects of insect locomotion. To this end, we introduce a novel concept we named """"Tegotae,"""" a Japanese concept describing the extent to which a perceived reaction matches an expectation. By using the Tegotae-based approach, we show that a surprisingly systematic design of local sensory feedback mechanisms essential for the interlimb coordination can be realized.

Based on this, we propose a model of flicker visibility on naturalistic videos. The model predicts target-related activation levels in the excitatory layer of neurons for a video using spatiotemporal backward masking. The target-related activation level is then shifted and scaled according to video quality level changes that cause flicker distortions. Finally, flicker visibility is predicted based on neural flicker adaptation processes. Results show that the predicted flicker visibility using the model correlates well with human perception of flicker distortions on naturalistic videos.	backward masking;coherence (physics);distortion;flicker (screen);flicker noise	Lark Kwon Choi;Lawrence K.

Our aim is to improve upon the above technique by measuring the importance of subgroups of neuronal structures in a different way. This new modeling technique not only leads to a more intuitive coalitional game, but also allows for specifying the relative influence of neuronal structures and a direct extension to a setting with missing information on the existence of certain connections.	cerebral cortex;computation (action);direct extension;large scale brain networks;macaca;prefrontal cortex;stable marriage problem;neuron projection extension involved in neuron projection guidance	Marieke Musegaas;Bas J.

Drosophila and other invertebrates provide valuable model systems for investigating ion channel kinetics and their impact on firing properties. Despite the increasing importance of Drosophila as a model system, few computational models of its ion channel kinetics have been developed. In this study, experimentally observed biophysical properties of voltage gated ion channels from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster are used to develop a minimal, conductance based neuron model. We investigate the impact of the densities of these channels on the excitability of the model neuron. Changing the channel densities reproduces different in situ observed firing patterns and induces a switch from integrator to resonator properties. Further, we analyze the preference to input frequency and how it depends on the channel densities and the resulting bifurcation type the system undergoes. An extension to a three dimensional model demonstrates that the inactivation kinetics of the sodium channels play an important role, allowing for firing patterns with a delayed first spike and subsequent high frequency firing as often observed in invertebrates, without altering the kinetics of the delayed rectifier current.	3d modeling;bifurcation theory;biological neuron model;computation;computational model;conductance (graph);excited state;experiment;invertebrates;ion channel;ions;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;rectifier device component;resonator device component;sodium channel;synaptic package manager;density	Sandra D.

These patterns are not static, but exhibit complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Over the last years, a multitude of methods have been proposed to reveal these dynamics on the level of the whole brain. One finding is that the brain transitions through different FC configurations over time, and substantial effort has been put into characterizing these configurations. However, the dynamics governing these transitions are more elusive, specifically, the contribution of stationary vs. non-stationary dynamics is an active field of inquiry. In this study, we use a whole-brain approach, considering FC dynamics between 66 ROIs covering the entire cortex. We combine an innovative dimensionality reduction technique, tensor decomposition, with a mean field model which possesses stationary dynamics. It has been shown to explain resting state FC averaged over time and multiple subjects, however, this average FC summarizes the spatial distribution of correlations while hiding their temporal dynamics. First, we apply tensor decomposition to resting state scans from 24 healthy controls in order to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics present in the data. We simultaneously utilize temporal and spatial information by creating tensors that are subsequently decomposed into sets of brain regions (""""communities"""") that share similar temporal dynamics, and their associated time courses. The tensors contain pairwise FC computed inside of overlapping sliding windows. Communities are discovered by clustering features pooled from all subjects, thereby ensuring that they generalize. We find that, on the group level, the data give rise to four distinct communities that resemble known resting state networks (RSNs): default mode network, visual network, control networks, and somatomotor network. Second, we simulate data with our stationary mean field model whose nodes are connected according to results from DTI and fiber tracking. In this model, all spatio-temporal structure is due to noisy fluctuations around the average FC. We analyze the simulated data in the same way as the empirical data in order to determine whether stationary dynamics can explain the emergence of distinct FC patterns (RSNs) which have their own time courses. We find that this is the case for all four networks using the spatio-temporal information revealed by tensor decomposition if nodes in the simulation are connected according to model-based effective connectivity. Furthermore, we find that these results require only a small part of the FC values, namely the highest values that occur across time and ROI pair. Our findings show that stationary dynamics can account for the emergence of RSNs. We provide an innovative method that does not make strong assumptions about the underlying data and is generally applicable to resting state or task data from different subject populations."""

We used MRI to test the hypothesis of immediate and specific training-induced alterations in motor cortical gray matter in humans. We found localized increases in motor cortical thickness after 1h of practice in a complex balancing task. These changes were specific to motor cortical effector representations primarily responsible for balance control in our task (lower limb and trunk) and these effects could be confirmed in a replication study. Cortical thickness changes (i) linearly increased across the training session, (ii) occurred independent of alterations in resting cerebral blood flow and (iii) were not triggered by repetitive use of the lower limbs.

7d08721b17edd0d94c9dcf25a6ee901a539392ed	considering the reconfiguration process of subjective temporal order by using recurrent neural networks		Starting from the famous conception of B. Libet, how the brain orders successive events has been a matter of intense debate in neuroscience. S. Yamamoto and S. Kitazawa (S. Yamamoto et al., 2001, Nature Neuroscience, 4, p.759) revealed that subjective temporal order of successive taps to hands, or to the tips of sticks held in each hand, are easily reversed just by crossing the arms. What is astonishing is that, especially in the crossing case, when the tapping interval was less than 0.3 second, the mistake rate grew to 100%. This result could be taken as general functionality of the real brain’s time-space reconfiguration process. In this session, we try to explain these phenomena and to characterize the real brain reconfiguration process of subjective temporal order, from dynamical systems perspectives. To construct the computational model, we adopted the following settings. We prepared an agent containing two arms and corresponding pairs of input nodes, consisting of proprioceptive and exteroceptive inputs, and output nodes to make the agent answer which hand had received the stimuli first. Proprioceptive nodes detect the location of the arms and exteroceptive nodes detect the stimulus applied to the hand. For the agent’s internal architectures, we adopted discrete time recurrent neural networks with plasticity and trained the network by using a genetic algorithm depending on the tasks. To prepare the same settings as S. Yamamoto and S. Kitazawa’s experiment, one calculation of internal networks was defined as 0.01 second, and one experiment takes 3 minutes by iterating 60 cycles of time period consisting of “a stimulus application interval”, “an agent responding interval” and “a resting interval”. Each interval was defined as 2 seconds, 2 seconds and 1 second, respectively. The agent receives the stimuli in “a stimulus application interval”, has to respond to the stimuli in “an agent responding interval”, and rests in “a resting interval”. Other actions are not allowed for the agent. Stimuli are designed to create alternative time delay between both hands. For the agent’s task, we set two: Task1 involved changing the locations of both arms for the entire parameterized region, and applying the stimuli to only one hand, after which the agent had to answer which hand had received the stimuli. Task2 involved changing the locations of both arms for a limited parameterized region, non-hand-crossing region, and applying the stimuli to both hands, after which the agent had to answer which hand had received the stimuli. For the experiment, we crossed the agent’s arms, applied the stimuli to both hands and then analyzed the response and the agent’s internal dynamics. Finally, determining the result, we discuss the implications of this model to real brain reconfiguration processes of empirical time and space.	artificial neural network;broadcast delay;coat of arms;computation;computational model;dynamical system;genetic algorithm;iteration;order by;recurrent neural network	Kohei Nakajima;Takashi Ikegami	2008			discrete time and continuous time;machine learning;genetic algorithm;control reconfiguration;dynamical systems theory;artificial intelligence;parameterized complexity;order by;computer science;stimulus (physiology);recurrent neural network	AI	16.137862635726034	-70.31742219780949	98719

However, such S(0) and T(2)(*) features have not been well characterized. In this study, spatial and spectral characteristics of functional connectivity on sensorimotor, default-mode, dorsal attention, and primary visual systems were examined using a multiple gradient-echo sequence at 3T. In the spatial domain, we found broad, local correlations at short echo times (TE ≤ 14 ms) due to dominant S(0) contribution, whereas long-range connections mediated by T(2)(*) became explicit at TEs longer than 22 ms. In the frequency domain, compared with the flat spectrum of S(0), spectral power of the T(2)(*)-weighted signal elevated significantly with increasing TE, particularly in the frequency ranges of 0.008-0.023 Hz and 0.037-0.043 Hz. Using the S(0) spectrum as a reference, we propose two indices to measure spectral signal change (SSC) and spectral contrast-to-noise ratio (SCNR), respectively, for quantifying the RS-fMRI signal. These indices demonstrated TE dependency of connectivity-related fluctuation strength, resembling functional contrasts in activation-based fMRI. These findings further confirm that large-scale functional circuit connectivity based on BOLD contrast may be constrained within specific frequency ranges in every brain network, and the spectral features of S(0) and T(2)(*) could be valuable for interpreting and quantifying RS-fMRI data.	basal ganglia diseases;contrast-to-noise ratio;default;gradient;hertz (hz);linear programming relaxation;numerous;quantum fluctuation;reed–solomon error correction;rest;resting state fmri;sql server compact;sensitivity and specificity;signal detection (psychology);signal-to-noise ratio;spontaneous order;tellurium;test engineer;transverse spin relaxation time;transverse wave;emotional dependency	Changwei W.

A better understanding of the aging brain may aid in elucidating the neural substrates of these behavioral effects. Investigations of resting state functional brain connectivity have provided insights into pathology, and to some degree, healthy aging. Given the role of the cerebellum in both motor and cognitive behaviors, as well as its known volumetric declines with age, investigating cerebellar networks may shed light on the neural bases of age-related functional declines. We mapped the resting state networks of the lobules of the right hemisphere and the vermis of the cerebellum in a group of healthy older adults and compared them to those of young adults. We report disrupted cortico-cerebellar resting state network connectivity in older adults. These results remain even when controlling for cerebellar volume, signal-to-noise ratio, and signal-to-fluctuation noise ratio. Specifically, there was consistent disruption of cerebellar connectivity with both the striatum and the medial temporal lobe. Associations between connectivity strength and both sensorimotor and cognitive task performances indicate that cerebellar engagement with the default mode network and striatal pathways is associated with better performance for older adults. These results extend our understanding of the resting state networks of the aging brain to include cortico-cerebellar networks, and indicate that age differences in network connectivity strength are important for behavior.	acoustic lobing;base;behavior;cerebellar diseases;cerebellar vermis structure;cognition disorders;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;default;denial-of-service attack;healthy aging;lobule;medial graph;mental association;neostriatum;performance;quantum fluctuation;rest;resting state fmri;signal-to-noise ratio;temporal lobe	Jessica A.

3128528fd550bcdb3561b049da0e122605540547	encoding symbolic sequences with spiking neural reservoirs		Biologically inspired spiking networks are an important tool to study the nature of computation and cognition in neural systems. In this work, we investigate the representational capacity of spiking networks engaged in an identity mapping task. We compare two schemes for encoding symbolic input, one in which input is injected as a direct current and one where input is delivered as a spatio-temporal spike pattern. We test the ability of networks to discriminate their input as a function of the number of distinct input symbols. We also compare performance using either membrane potentials or filtered spike trains as state variable. Furthermore, we investigate how the circuit behavior depends on the balance between excitation and inhibition, and the degree of synchrony and regularity in its internal dynamics. Finally, we compare different linear methods of decoding population activity onto desired target labels. Overall, our results suggest that even this simple mapping task is strongly influenced by design choices on input encoding, state-variables, circuit characteristics and decoding methods, and these factors can interact in complex ways. This work highlights the importance of constraining computational network models of behavior by available neurobiological evidence.	artificial neural network;computation;computational cognition;decoding methods;spiking neural network	Renato C.

50f10b2f58ba267d4ad9be93f34dbbcffff5e407	recently rewarded task-irrelevant stimuli do not distract 2-year-olds during visual search		Here we present a novel reversal-learning visual   search task for the eye-tracker. A similar paradigm   has previously been used in adults to investigate   reward based attentional capture(9,10). We asked whether children could selectively attend   to a rewarded target, and, flexibly shift attention to a   newly rewarded target. Participants: 31 typically developing toddlers (17 females). Age range was 17.26 months 36.64 months (M = 27.5, SE = 1.05). Methods: Tobii T120 eye tracker measured eye movements. Data processing: Participants with < 60% of samples, or participants who did not complete the experiment, were excluded. Valid trials were those where cumulative visit duration to screen > 1 secs, 1+ search array item was fixated, and latency to first item fixated was < 3 secs (86% of trials). Background Attentional control (also referred to as executive or cognitive control, or endogenous attention) is fundamental for goal-directed behavior. The maturation of the attentional control network is an important developmental milestone(1,2) that results in reduced distractibility(3,4,5) and improved cognitive flexibility(6,7,8). While attentional control is well studied in older children, methodological factors have limited an understanding of the development of this ability in young children. Traditional set-shifting paradigms require verbal instructions and selective attention to feature dimensions, raising the possibility that performance is conflated by factors other than attentional control (7,8).

This suggests that neurons have the capacity to estimate the distance of the injury site from their cell body. Recent work has shown that the molecular motor dynein transports importin-mediated retrograde signaling complexes from axonal lesion sites to cell bodies, raising the question whether dynein-based mechanisms enable axonal distance estimations in injured neurons? We used computer simulations to examine mechanisms that may provide nerve cells with dynein-dependent distance assessment capabilities. A multiple-signals model was postulated based on the time delay between the arrival of two or more signals produced at the site of injury-a rapid signal carried by action potentials or similar mechanisms and slower signals carried by dynein. The time delay between the arrivals of these two types of signals should reflect the distance traversed, and simulations of this model show that it can indeed provide a basis for distance measurements in the context of nerve injuries. The analyses indicate that the suggested mechanism can allow nerve cells to discriminate between distances differing by 10% or more of their total axon length, and suggest that dynein-based retrograde signaling in neurons can be utilized for this purpose over different scales of nerves and organisms. Moreover, such a mechanism might also function in synapse to nucleus signaling in uninjured neurons. This could potentially allow a neuron to dynamically sense the relative lengths of its processes on an ongoing basis, enabling appropriate metabolic output from cell body to processes.	action potentials;action potential;axon;broadcast delay;cell nucleus;cell signaling;computer simulation;cumulative trauma disorders;distance;dynein atpase;importins;metabolic process, cellular;mobility aid;neuron;neurons;synapse;traumatic injury;cell body;dynein activity	Naaman Kam;Yitzhak Pilpel;Mike Fainzilber	2009		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000477	computer simulation;biology;biochemistry;neuroscience;molecular motor;anatomy	ML	18.622821252983144	-74.1588764523488	99646

Neuroimaging results on the processing of these parameters in tasks involving the discrimination of stimuli based on these parameters are controversial. Depending on the experimental approach, varying hypotheses on the involvement of the left and right auditory cortices (ACs) have been put forward. The aim of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to find differences and commonalities in location and strength of brain activity during the processing of intensity and duration when the same stimuli have to be actively categorized according to these two parameters. For this we used a recently introduced method to determine lateralized processing in the AC with contralateral noise. Harmonic frequency modulated (FM) tone complexes were presented monaurally without and with contralateral noise. During categorization of the tones according to their intensity, contralateral noise increased activity mainly in the left AC, suggesting a special role for the left AC in this task. During categorization of tones according to their duration, contralateral noise increased activity in both the left and the right AC. This suggests that active categorization of FM tones according to their duration does not involve only the left AC as has been suggested, but also the right AC to a substantial degree. The area around Heschl's sulcus seems to be the most strongly involved during both intensity and duration categorization, albeit with different lateralization. Altogether the results of the present study support the view that the lateralized processing of the same stimuli in the human AC is strongly modulated by the given task (top-down effect).	auditory processing disorder;categorization;electroencephalography;fm broadcasting;groove;hearing loss, high-frequency;hearing problem;modulation;neuroimaging;noise-induced hearing loss;resonance;top-down and bottom-up design;fmri	Nicole Angenstein;André Brechmann	2013	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.06.071	psychology;speech recognition;communication;social psychology	ML	16.61606651142348	-77.52821890587467	99682

We introduce de Bruijn cycles, a class of combinatorial objects, as the ideal source of pseudo-random stimulus sequences with arbitrary levels of counterbalance. Neuro-vascular imaging studies (such as BOLD fMRI) have an additional requirement imposed by the filtering and noise properties of the method: only some temporal frequencies of neural modulation are detectable. Extant methods of generating counterbalanced stimulus sequences yield neural modulations that are weakly (or not at all) detected by BOLD fMRI. We solve this limitation using a novel """"path-guided"""" approach for the generation of de Bruijn cycles. The algorithm encodes a hypothesized neural modulation of specific temporal frequency within the seemingly random order of events. By positioning the modulation between the signal and noise bands of the neuro-vascular imaging method, the resulting sequence markedly improves detection power.

Glucose-excited (GE) neurons increase while glucose-inhibited (GI) neurons decrease their action potential frequency as interstitial brain glucose levels increase. We hypothesize that these neurons evolved to sense and respond to severe energy deficit (e.g., fasting) that threatens the brains glucose supply. During modern times, they are also important for the restoration of blood glucose levels following insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Our data suggest that impaired glucose sensing by hypothalamic glucose sensing neurons may contribute to the syndrome known as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure in which the mechanisms which restore euglycemia following hypoglycemia become impaired. On the other hand, increased responses of glucose sensing neurons to glucose deficit may play a role in the development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and obesity. This review will discuss the mechanisms by which glucose sensing neurons sense changes in interstitial glucose and explore the roles of these specialized glucose sensors in glucose and energy homeostasis.	action potential;autonomic networking;brain;circuit restoration;diabetes mellitus;diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent;excited state;glucose metabolism disorders;hematological disease;hypoglycemia;hypothalamic structure;interstitial webpage;neuron;obesity;pure autonomic failure;sensor;user operation prohibition;energy homeostasis	Vanessa H.

The proposed artificial neuron model is substantially characterized in terms of a time-dependent periodic activation function to involve a chaotic dynamics on the basis of the energy steepest descent strategy. It is elucidated that the present neural network has an ability of the dynamic memory retrievals beyond the conventional models with the nonmonotonous activation function as well as such a monotonous activation function as sigmoidal one. This advantage results from the nonmonotonous property of the analogue periodic mapping accompanied with a chaotic behaviour of the neurons. It is also found that the present analogue neuron model with the periodicity control has a remarkably large memory capacity in comparison with the previously proposed association models.	artificial neural network;autocorrelation	M.

Many see this as value added for science publishing that can enhance and inform secondary examination of data and results. Still others worry that data sharing is an undue burden for researchers with little long term value to science. But examples of how data sharing can be done successfully do exist. The fMRI Data Center, established at Dartmouth College in 2000 and now based at the University of California Santa Barbara, has worked to facilitate the open sharing of neuroimaging data from peer-reviewed papers to foster progress in cognitive science. The fMRI study on the representation of objects in the human occipital and temporal cortex, published in 2000 in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (JOCN), marked the first deposition in the new database. Despite initial concerns about fMRI data sharing, this data set was frequently downloaded. We describe the original results of distributed brain activation patterns elicited by faces and objects in the human visual system, and overview several secondary analyses by independent investigators. A philosopher tested Husserl’s temporal components of consciousness, whereas other brain imagers deployed new analytic tools, from Dynamic Causal Modeling, which estimates the neural interactions between cortical regions, to a novel method for constructing reproducibility maps. These re-analyses revealed new findings not reported in the original study, provided new perspectives on visual perception, generated new predictions, and resulted in new collaborations and publications in high profile journals.	causal filter;chemical vapor deposition;cognitive science;color vision;computer cluster;consciousness;data center;estimated;face;interaction;journal;map;neuroimaging;neuroscience discipline;paper;physical object;scientific publication;scientific literature;secondary source;societies;societies, scientific;temporal lobe;fmri;recurrent childhood visual pathway glioma	John D.

The primary purpose of the study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the association between feelings of mental fatigue and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) brain responses during a mentally fatiguing cognitive task. Healthy, non-fatigued controls and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients were included to determine the influence of chronic levels of fatigue on brain responses. We hypothesized that mental fatigue would be significantly related to brain activity during a fatiguing cognitive task but not during either a non-fatiguing motor (finger tapping) or cognitive (auditory monitoring) task. Patients (n=9) and controls (n=11) completed a finger tapping task, a simple auditory monitoring task and a challenging working memory task, designed to induce mental fatigue, while undergoing fMRI. Fatigue was measured prior to scanning and following each task during fMRI data collection. Results showed that mental fatigue was significantly related to brain activity during the fatiguing cognitive task but not the finger tapping or simple auditory monitoring tasks. Significant (p< or =0.005) positive relationships were found for cerebellar, temporal, cingulate and frontal regions. A significant (p=0.001) negative relationship was found for the left posterior parietal cortex. CFS participants did not differ from controls for either finger tapping or auditory monitoring tasks, but exhibited significantly greater activity in several cortical and subcortical regions during the fatiguing cognitive task. Our results suggest an association between subjective feelings of mental fatigue and brain responses during fatiguing cognition.	cerebellum;chronic fatigue syndrome;chronic lymphocytic leukemia;cognition disorders;data collection;electroencephalography;embodied cognition;functional gastrointestinal disorders;memory disorders;mental fatigue;neuroimaging;parietal lobe;patients;resonance;blood oxygen level dependent;fmri;frontal lobe	Dane B.

Following single pulse electrical stimulation at selected  sites of a multichannel implant device, we found topographically restricted response areas. Systematic variation of the stimulation  pairs and thus of the cochlear frequency sites revealed a systematic and corresponding shift of the response areas. Increasingly  higher stimulation currents evoked increasingly larger response areas resulting in decreasing spatial, i.e. cochleotopic selectivity.  The results indicate that optical imaging intrinsic signals is useful to visualize effects of cochlear stimulation, which  results in a profound cochleotopic selectivity. The implications of these findings are discussed in respect to underlying  mechanisms of sound sensation mediated by cochlear implants.  	cochlear implant	Hubert R.

Behavioral studies investigating social orienting in ASD, however, have yielded mixed results, as the use of naturalistic paradigms typically reveals clear deficits whereas computerized laboratory experiments often report normative behavior. The present study is the first to examine the neural mechanisms underlying social orienting in ASD in order to provide new insight into the social attention impairments that characterize this disorder. Using fMRI, we examined the neural correlates of social orienting in children and adolescents with ASD and in a matched sample of typically developing (TD) controls while they performed a spatial cueing paradigm with social (eye gaze) and nonsocial (arrow) cues. Cues were either directional (indicating left or right) or neutral (indicating no direction), and directional cues were uninformative of the upcoming target location in order to engage automatic processes by minimizing expectations. Behavioral results demonstrated intact orienting effects for social and nonsocial cues, with no differences between groups. The imaging results, however, revealed clear group differences in brain activity. When attention was directed by social cues compared to nonsocial cues, the TD group showed increased activity in frontoparietal attention networks, visual processing regions, and the striatum, whereas the ASD group only showed increased activity in the superior parietal lobule. Significant group × cue type interactions confirmed greater responsivity in task-relevant networks for social cues than nonsocial cues in TD as compared to ASD, despite similar behavioral performance. These results indicate that, in the autistic brain, social cues are not assigned the same privileged status as they are in the typically developing brain. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that the neural circuitry involved in social orienting is disrupted in ASD and highlight that normative behavioral performance in a laboratory setting may reflect compensatory mechanisms rather than intact social attention.	adolescent (age group);approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;autism spectrum disorders;autistic disorder;bi-directional text;cognition disorders;congenital abnormality;consciousness;ecology;electroencephalography;electronic circuit;experiment;interaction;lobule;neostriatum;neural network simulation;personnameuse - assigned;programming paradigm;real life;social characteristics;word lists by frequency;fmri	Deanna J.

Treating individual brain structures as nodes in a directed graph model permits the application of graph theoretical concepts to the analysis of these structures within their large-scale connectivity networks. In this paper, we explore the application of concepts from graph and game theory toward this end. Specifically, we utilize the Shapley value principle, which assigns a rank to players in a coalition based upon their individual contributions to the collective profit of that coalition, to assess the contributions of individual brain structures to the graph derived from the global connectivity network. We report Shapley values for variations of a prefrontal network, as well as for a visual cortical network, which had both been extensively investigated previously. This analysis highlights particular nodes as strong or weak contributors to global connectivity. To understand the nature of their contribution, we compare the Shapley values obtained from these networks and appropriate controls to other previously described nodal measures of structural connectivity. We find a strong correlation between Shapley values and both betweenness centrality and connection density. Moreover, a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicates that approximately 79% of the variance in Shapley values obtained from random networks can be explained by betweenness centrality alone. Finally, we investigate the effects of local lesions on the Shapley ratings, showing that the present networks have an immense structural resistance to degradation. We discuss our results highlighting the use of such measures for characterizing the organization and functional role of brain networks.	betweenness centrality;cerebral cortex;database;databases;directed graph;elegant degradation;flow network;game theory;graph - visual representation;license;network theory;regression analysis;sample variance;seventy nine;spawn (computing);stable marriage problem;stepwise regression	Rolf Kötter;Andrew T.

It has been demonstrated in previous theoretical studies that the main goal of the encoding of the input from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) by simple cell is to minimize the representation error. Based on the existing methods, we propose a non-negative approximation algorithm using thresholding. We validate the algorithm via simulation of several known response properties of simple cells, including the sharp and contrast invariant orientation tuning and surround suppression, and as cross orientation suppression.	approximation;thresholding (image processing)	Jiqian Liu;Chunli Song;Chengbin Zeng	2015		10.1007/978-3-319-22180-9_17	computer vision;discrete mathematics;pattern recognition	ML	21.524850703576625	-67.94911243898389	100604

The processing unit used is based on a slightly simplified version of the Learning Gate Model proposed by Ciaccia et al. (1992). The network topology integrates a well-known biological neural circuit with a lateral inhibition connection subnet. By means of simulation experiments, we show that the proposed networks exhibit basic and high-order features of associative learning.

Electrophysiological studies have shown that pairing endogenous ACh with specific visual or auditory stimuli induces long lasting enhancements of subsequent cortical responses to the previously paired stimulus. In this study we present data suggesting that similar effects can be elicited in the rat whisker sensory system. Specifically, we show that pairing whisker deflection with electrical stimulation of the magnocellular basal nucleus (BN: a natural source of cortical ACh) causes an increase in the center-surround contrast of the treated whisker's cortical response field (CRF). Meanwhile, deflections of whiskers distant from the treated whisker show overall increased response magnitudes, but non-significant changes in contrast between principle vs. surround barrel responses. Control trials, in which BN stimulation was not paired with whisker deflection, showed similar lack of contrast enhancement. These results indicate that BN stimulation, paired with incoming whisker information, selectively increases the paired whisker's CRF center-surround contrast, while unpaired BN stimulation causes a more general increases in S1 responsiveness, without contrast modulation. Enhanced control over whisker sensory pathway attentional mechanisms has the potential to facilitate a more effective transfer of desired information to the animal's neural processing circuitry, thereby allowing experimental evaluation of more complex behavior and cognition than was previously possible.	acetylcholine;barrel shifter;basal (phylogenetics);basal nucleus of meynert;cell nucleus;cerebral cortex;cognition;conditional random field;cortical implant;electric stimulation technique;electronic circuit;functional electrical stimulation;gene regulatory network;modulation;neurotransmitters;responsiveness;vibrissae	Lee M. von Kraus;Joseph T.

The same listeners were trained on different weeks to categorize the mid-regions of voice-morph continua as an individual's voice. Stimuli implicitly defined a voice-acoustics space, and training explicitly defined a voice-identity space. The pre-defined centre of the voice category was shifted from the acoustic centre each week in opposite directions, so the same stimuli had different training histories on different tests. Cortical sensitivity to voice similarity appeared over different time-scales and at different representational stages. First, there were short-term adaptation effects: increasing acoustic similarity to the directly preceding stimulus led to haemodynamic response reduction in the middle/posterior STS and in right ventrolateral prefrontal regions. Second, there were longer-term effects: response reduction was found in the orbital/insular cortex for stimuli that were most versus least similar to the acoustic mean of all preceding stimuli, and, in the anterior temporal pole, the deep posterior STS and the amygdala, for stimuli that were most versus least similar to the trained voice-identity category mean. These findings are interpreted as effects of neural sharpening of long-term stored typical acoustic and category-internal values. The analyses also reveal anatomically separable voice representations: one in a voice-acoustics space and one in a voice-identity space. Voice-identity representations flexibly followed the trained identity shift, and listeners with a greater identity effect were more accurate at recognizing familiar voices. Voice recognition is thus supported by neural voice spaces that are organized around flexible 'mean voice' representations.	acclimatization;acoustic cryptanalysis;acoustics;amygdaloid structure;categorization;hemodynamics;identity provider;insula of reil;molecular orbital;programming paradigm;representation (action);speech recognition;voice;fmri	Attila Andics;James M.

Recent evidence suggests that these abilities share common magnitude processing and neural resources, although other findings also highlight the role of dimension-specific processes. To further characterize the relation between number, time, and space, we first examined them in a population with a developmental numerical dysfunction (developmental dyscalculia) and then assessed the extent to which these abilities correlated both behaviorally and anatomically in numerically normal participants. We found that (1) participants with dyscalculia showed preserved continuous quantity processing and (2) in numerically normal adults, numerical and continuous quantity abilities were at least partially dissociated both behaviorally and anatomically. Specifically, gray matter volume correlated with both measures of numerical and continuous quantity processing in the right TPJ; in contrast, individual differences in number proficiency were associated with gray matter volume in number-specific cortical regions in the right parietal lobe. Together, our new converging evidence of selective numerical impairment and of number-specific brain areas at least partially distinct from common magnitude areas suggests that the human brain is equipped with different ways of quantifying the outside world.	acoustic lobing;biologic preservation;convergence (action);developmental dyscalculia;developmental arithmetic disorder;gray matter;numerical analysis;parietal lobe;quantity	Marinella Cappelletti;Rebecca Chamberlain;Elliot D.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined blood oxygen dependent level (BOLD) response of the human amygdala and hippocampus to novel, commonly seen objects versus novel unusual objects. When presented with the novel common stimuli, the BOLD signal increased significantly in both the amygdala and hippocampus. However, for the novel unusual stimuli, only the amygdala showed an increased response compared to the novel common stimuli. These findings suggest that the amygdala is distinctly responsive to novel unusual stimuli, making a unique contribution to the novelty detection circuit.	amygdaloid structure;novelty detection;oxygen;physical object;resonance	Jennifer Urbano Blackford;Joshua W.

The recently emerged resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) technique, capable of delineating brain's functional interaction pattern among distributed brain areas, proves to be a unique and powerful tool to study sedation-induced brain reorganization. Based on a relatively large school-aged children population (n=28, 10.3±2.6 years, range 7-15 years) and leveraging rsfMRI and graph theoretical analysis, this study aims to delineate sedation-induced changes in brain's information transferring property from a whole brain system perspective. Our results show a global deterioration in brain's efficiency properties (p=0.0085 and 0.0018, for global and local efficiency, respectively) with a locally graded distribution featuring significant disruptions of key consciousness-related regions. Moreover, our results also indicate a redistribution of brain's information-processing hubs characterized by a right and posterior shift as consistent with the reduced level of consciousness during sedation. Overall, our findings inform a sedation-induced functional reorganization pattern in school-aged children that greatly improve our understanding of sedation's effect in children and may potentially serve as reference for future sedation-related experimental studies and clinical applications.	altered level of consciousness;esthesia;future search;graph - visual representation;graph theory;interaction design pattern;interphase cell;magnetic resonance imaging;resting state fmri;sedation procedure;self-awareness	Zhen Wei;Sarael Alcauter;Ke Jin;Zi-Wen Peng;Wei Gao	2013	Brain connectivity	10.1089/brain.2012.0125	psychology;neuroscience;communication;surgery	Web+IR	20.107321904551167	-78.65554939961214	101335

Thresholding generally retains the strongest edges (correlations), either by retaining edges surpassing a given absolute weight, or by constraining the edge density. The latter (more widely used) method risks inclusion of false positive edges at high edge densities and exclusion of true positive edges at low edge densities. Here we apply new wavelet-based methods, which enable construction of probabilistically-thresholded graphs controlled for type I error, to a dataset of resting-state fMRI scans of 56 patients with schizophrenia and 71 healthy controls. By thresholding connectomes to fixed edge-specific P value, we found that functional connectomes of patients with schizophrenia were more dysconnected than those of healthy controls, exhibiting a lower edge density and a higher number of (dis)connected components. Furthermore, many participants' connectomes could not be built up to the fixed edge densities commonly studied in the literature (∼5-30%), while controlling for type I error. Additionally, we showed that the topological randomisation previously reported in the schizophrenia literature is likely attributable to """"non-significant"""" edges added when thresholding connectomes to fixed density based on correlation. Finally, by explicitly comparing connectomes thresholded by increasing P value and decreasing correlation, we showed that probabilistically thresholded connectomes show decreased randomness and increased consistency across participants. Our results have implications for future analysis of functional connectivity using graph theory, especially within datasets exhibiting heterogenous distributions of edge weights (correlations), between groups or across participants."""	connectome;cross-correlation;exclusion;exhibits as topic;graph - visual representation;graph theory;patients;randomness;rest;resting state fmri;schizophrenia;silo (dataset);sparse matrix;thresholding (image processing);wavelet;weight;density	Frantisek Vása;Edward T.

03c8e90bffe9901f4ed5b31d462e5882b751b558	modeling nonlinear synaptic dynamics: a laguerre-volterra network framework for improved computational efficiency in large scale simulations		Synapses are key components in signal transmission in the brain, often exhibiting complex non-linear dynamics. Yet, they are often crudely modelled as linear exponential equations in large-scale neuron network simulations. Mechanistic models that use detailed channel receptor kinetics more closely replicate the nonlinear dynamics observed at synapses, but use of such models are generally restricted to small scale simulations due to their computational complexity. Previously, we have developed an ``input-output’’ (IO) synapse model using the Volterra functional series to estimate nonlinear synaptic dynamics. Here, we present an improvement on the IO synapse model using the extbf{Laguerre-Volterra network (LVN) framework. We demonstrate that utilization of the LVN framework helps reduce memory requirements and improves the simulation speed in comparison to the previous iteration of the IO synapse model. We present results that demonstrate the accuracy, memory efficiency, and speed of the LVN model that can be extended to simulations with large numbers of synapses. Our efforts enable complex nonlinear synaptic dynamics to be modelled in large-scale network models, allowing us to explore how synaptic activity may influence network behavior and affects memory, learning, and neurodegenerative diseases.	benchmark (computing);computation;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;exhibits as topic;input/output;iteration;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;learning disorders;memory disorders;neurodegenerative disorders;neuron;nonlinear dynamics;nonlinear system;requirement;self-replicating machine;synapse;synapses;exponential;nervous system disorder	Eric Y.

Specifically, recent single-cell recording results seem incompatible with current structural connectivity models. We present a novel method that combines anatomical and temporal constraints to generate biologically plausible connectivity patterns of the visual system of the macaque monkey. Our method takes structural connectivity data from the CoCoMac database and recent single-cell recording data as input and employs an optimization technique to arrive at a new connectivity pattern of the visual system that is in agreement with both types of experimental data. The new connectivity pattern yields a revised model that has fewer levels than current models. In addition, it introduces subcortical-cortical connections. We show that these connections are essential for explaining latency data, are consistent with our current knowledge of the structural connectivity of the visual system, and might explain recent functional imaging results in humans. Furthermore we show that the revised model is not underconstrained like previous models and can be extended to include newer data and other kinds of data. We conclude that the revised model of the connectivity of the visual system reflects current knowledge on the structure and function of the visual system and addresses some of the limitations of previous models.	addresses (publication format);functional imaging;macaca;mathematical optimization;resting state fmri;revision procedure	Michael Capalbo;Eric Postma;Rainer Goebel	2008	PLoS Computational Biology	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000159	neuroscience;visual system;computer science;artificial intelligence;systems biology	ML	18.94005465494548	-72.91857841462588	101970

While the behavioral changes associated with native language attunement are fairly well mapped, the underlying mechanisms and neural processes are still only poorly understood. Using fNIRS and eye tracking, the current study investigated 6-month-old infants' processing of audiovisual speech that contained matching or mismatching auditory and visual speech cues. Our results revealed that infants' speech-sensitive brain responses in inferior frontal brain regions were lateralized to the left hemisphere. Critically, our results further revealed that speech-sensitive left inferior frontal regions showed enhanced responses to matching when compared to mismatching audiovisual speech, and that infants with a preference to look at the speaker's mouth showed an enhanced left inferior frontal response to speech compared to infants with a preference to look at the speaker's eyes. These results suggest that left inferior frontal regions play a crucial role in associating information from different modalities during native language attunement, fostering the formation of multimodal phonological categories.	abnormal behavior;categories;contain (action);eye tracking;matching;mouth neoplasms;multimodal interaction;speech disorders;frontal lobe	Nicole Altvater-Mackensen;Tobias Grossmann	2016	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.02.061	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;speech recognition;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;eye tracking;neurocomputational speech processing;communication	HCI	17.165052499781442	-77.95076472382982	102071
7c70768d5fbdf951f5e6a8c53a763c136bf3cfc3	chronic nicotine exposure impairs uncertainty modulation on reinforcement learning in anterior cingulate cortex and serotonin system	addiction;maladaptive decision-making;reward prediction errors;serotonin	Deficits in the computational processes of reinforcement learning have been suggested to underlie addiction. Additionally, environmental uncertainty, which is encoded in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), modulates reward prediction errors (RPEs) during reinforcement learning and exacerbates addiction. The present study tested whether and how the ACC would have an essential role in drug addiction by failing to use uncertainty to modulate the RPEs during reinforcement learning. In Experiment I, we found that the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) did not modulate RPE learning according to uncertainty in smokers. The effect of uncertainty × RPE in the ACC/MPFC was correlated with the learning rate of RPEs and the duration of nicotine use. Experiment II demonstrated that serotonin, but not dopamine, receptor mRNA expression significantly decreased in the ACC of the nicotine exposed compared to the control rats. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between learning rate and serotonin receptor mRNA expression in the ACC. Therefore, all present results suggest that impairments in uncertainty modulation in the ACC disrupt reinforcement learning processes in chronic nicotine users and contribute to maladaptive decision-making. These findings support interventions for pathological decision-making in drug addiction that strongly focus on the serotonin system in ACC.	addictive behavior;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;decision making;dopamine;drug dependence;failure;inborn errors of metabolism;learning disorders;medial graph;modulation;nicotine;prefrontal cortex;reinforcement learning;substance dependence;anterior cingulate gyrus;serotonin receptor	Zhengde Wei;Long Han;Xiuying Zhong;Ying Liu;Rujing Zha;Ying Wang;Lizhuang Yang;Junjie Bu;Hongwen Song;Wenjuan Wang;Yifeng Zhou;Ping Gao;Xiaochu Zhang	2018	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.048	serotonin;nicotine;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;dopamine;psychology;prefrontal cortex;addiction;5-ht receptor;anterior cingulate cortex;reinforcement learning	ML	15.507775131638262	-75.72485688643928	102570

Any available information should be exploited to increase the power of detecting true between-group effects. We present an adaptive strategy that exploits the data structure and the prior information concerning positive dependence between nodes and connections, without relying on strong assumptions. As a first step, we decompose the brain network, i.e., the connectome, into subnetworks and we apply a screening at the subnetwork level. The subnetworks are defined either according to prior knowledge or by applying a data driven algorithm. Given the results of the screening step, a filtering is performed to seek real differences at the node/connection level. The proposed strategy could be used to strongly control either the family-wise error rate or the false discovery rate. We show by means of different simulations the benefit of the proposed strategy, and we present a real application of comparing connectomes of preschool children and adolescents.	adolescent (age group);anatomic node;appendix;arabic numeral 0;assumed;biologic development;blueprint;cardiomyopathies;carrot/jilin ginseng/licorice root/tangerine peel/soy beverage;cognition;connectome;data structure;esc/e(z) complex;electronic circuit;expectation propagation;family-wise error rate;immunoprecipitation;information processing;international system of units;isoelectric point;johnson–nyquist noise;mixture model;netbeans ide;neuroimaging;node - plant part;normal statistical distribution;null value;p (complexity);ph (complexity);prefrontal cortex;robustness (computer science);sample variance;sensor;simulation;subnetwork;tai ji;tellurium;test engineer;titanium;algorithm;multiplicity	Djalel Eddine Meskaldji;Lana Vasung;David Romascano;Jean-Philippe Thiran;Patric Hagmann;Stephan Morgenthaler;Dimitri Van De Ville	2015	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.11.059	psychology;neuroscience;computer science;artificial intelligence;data mining;social psychology;multiple comparisons problem;complex network;statistics	ML	22.73851026151413	-78.91656273842571	102715

While single neurons in the “lower” cortical areas, including V1–V5, represent a variety of local features it is still under debate how the distributed representation of an object is bound into a coherent whole and how unrelated features are separated. Synchronization of neural signals has been proposed to code spatial feature binding, supported by the discovery of synchronized neural assemblies in cat and monkey visual cortex which occurred stimulus dependent — either as oscillatory (30–100 Hz) events due to internal processes of self-organization, or as non-rhythmical stimulus-locked responses. Spatial coherence of synchronized oscillations covered generally larger areas in visual cortical representations than the classical receptive field of single neurons. However, coherence was laterally confined to a few millimeters of cortical surface which means that synchronized cortical regions do only span the representational range of small visual objects or parts of larger ones. To relate such restricted segments to perceptual processes we introduced the concept of the “linking or association field” of local neural assemblies in accordance with receptive fields of single neurons. The linking field is defined by the aggregate receptive fields of a neural assembly engaged in a common synchronized state. We further argue that spatial continuity of an object might either be coded 1.) by a continuum of overlapping linking fields, i.e. by overlapping synchronized regions spanning the entire object representation or (and) 2.) by a hierarchy of linking fields in which the assemblies engage in phase locked oscillations at different frequencies — where large objects or larger parts are represented by larger linking fields defined by synchronization at lower frequencies and smaller subparts are represented by smaller linking fields at higher frequencies. Our cortical recordings showed the presence of both types of synchronized states, including phase-locking among different frequencies.

Here, we propose that the flying and floating in OBEs can be explained as the result of a Bayesian inference, where ambiguous bottom-up signals from the otholiths in a supine position are integrated with a top-down prior for the upright position, which is not appropriate for the current supine position.

Our results suggest a simple interpretation of some aspects of OBEs in terms of a mislead sensory inference and suggests new ways of experimentally inducing OBE-like experiences by manipulating sensory signals and top-down prior information.	bayesian approaches to brain function;bottom-up parsing;ecology;experience;experiment;top-down and bottom-up design	Lars Schwabe;Olaf Blanke	2008	2008 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence)	10.1109/IJCNN.2008.4634329	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;top-down and bottom-up design;mathematics;artificial neural network;statistics	Robotics	13.66713114684519	-72.74804612182422	103170

To investigate this hypothesis, an fMRI study involving an associative learning task was conducted with schizophrenia patients and controls. A set of generative models of the BOLD signal generation were defined to describe the interaction of five brain regions (Primary Visual Cortex, Superior Parietal and Inferior Temporal Cortex, Hippocampus and Dorsal Prefrontal Cortex) and the experimental conditions. The models were fitted to the data using Bayesian model inversion. The comparison of different model connectivity structures lead to the finding that in schizophrenia, there are significant impairments in backward connections from prefrontal cortex to hippocampal and temporal regions in patients. These findings fit very well with the predictions of a neuron network model of encoding-recall switching dynamics we have described previously.	bayesian network;control function (econometrics);generative model;information processing;network model;neuron;the circle (file system)	Péter Érdi;Mihály Bányai;Vaibhav A.

However, this capacity is not present at birth, and it is acquired only through interactions with cross-modal events during maturation. Mathematical models provide a quantitative framework, valuable in helping to clarify the specific neural mechanisms underlying the maturation of the multisensory integration in the SC. We extended a neural network model of the adult SC (Cuppini et al., Front Integr Neurosci 4:1–15, 2010) to describe the development of this phenomenon starting from an immature state, based on known or suspected anatomy and physiology, in which: (1) AES afferents are present but weak, (2) Responses are driven from non-AES afferents, and (3) The visual inputs have a marginal spatial tuning. Sensory experience was modeled by repeatedly presenting modality-specific and cross-modal stimuli. Synapses in the network were modified by simple Hebbian learning rules. As a consequence of this exposure, (1) Receptive fields shrink and come into spatial register, and (2) SC neurons gained the adult characteristic integrative properties: enhancement, depression, and inverse effectiveness. Importantly, the unique architecture of the model guided the development so that integration became dependent on the relationship between the cortical input and the SC. Manipulations of the statistics of the experience during the development changed the integrative profiles of the neurons, and results matched well with the results of physiological studies.	anatomic structures;artificial neural network;biologic development;corpora quadrigemina, superior colliculus;dna integration;depressive disorder;escuela superior latinoamericana de informática;gain;hebbian theory;interaction;marginal model;mathematical model;modal logic;modality (human–computer interaction);network model;rule (guideline);synapses;physiological aspects	Cristiano Cuppini;Elisa Magosso;Benjamin A.

We used mutual information as a measure to quantify the information from the total excitatory input current (I(Glu)) encoded in each dendritic current. In this context, each active current was considered an information channel. Our analyses showed that most of the information was encoded by the calcium (I(CaP)) and calcium activated potassium (I(Kc)) currents. Mutual information between I(Glu) and I(CaP) and I(Kc) was sensitive to different levels of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity that, at the same time, resulted in the same firing rate at the soma. Since dendritic excitability could be a mechanism to regulate information processing in neurons we quantified the changes in mutual information between I(Glu) and all Purkinje cell currents as a function of the density of dendritic Ca (g(CaP)) and Kca (g(Kc)) conductances. We extended our analysis to determine the window of temporal integration of I(Glu) by I(CaP) and I(Kc) as a function of channel density and synaptic activity. The window of information integration has a stronger dependence on increasing values of g(Kc) than on g(CaP), but at high levels of synaptic stimulation information integration is reduced to a few milliseconds. Overall, our results show that different dendritic conductances differentially encode synaptic activity and that dendritic excitability and the level of synaptic activity regulate the flow of information in dendrites.	calcium;cell body of neuron;dendrites;dendritic spine;encode (action);granule (oracle dbms);information processing;leukemia, b-cell;multi-compartment model;mutual information;potassium;quantum channel;synaptic package manager	Allan D.

83044fed57c2942d15ad092a659bda916cd6b6ed	preparatory encoding of the fine scale of human spatial attention		Our attentional focus is constantly shifting: In one moment, our attention may be intently concentrated on a specific spot, whereas in another moment we might spread our attention more broadly. Although much is known about the mechanisms by which we shift our visual attention from place to place, relatively little is known about how we shift the aperture of attention from more narrowly to more broadly focused. Here we introduce a novel attentional distribution task to examine the neural mechanisms underlying this process. In this task, participants are presented with an informative cue that indicates the location of an upcoming target. This cue can be perfectly predictive of the exact target location, or it can indicate—with varying degrees of certainty—approximately where the target might appear. This cue is followed by a preparatory period in which there is nothing on the screen except a central fixation cross. Using scalp EEG, we examined neural activity during this preparatory period. We find that, with decreasing certainty regarding the precise location of the impending target, participant RTs increased whereas target identification accuracy decreased. Additionally, the multivariate pattern of preparatory period visual cortical alpha (8–12 Hz) activity encoded attentional distribution. This alpha encoding was predictive of behavioral accuracy and RT nearly 1 sec later. These results offer insight into the neural mechanisms underlying how we use information to guide our attentional distribution and how that influences behavior.	concentrate dosage form;electroencephalography;hertz (hz);information;pitch shift	Bradley Voytek;Jason Samaha;Camarin E.

0ce0909fdb345497b6f3a6525fb1c83c870fd5e6	the role of spatial skills in mathematics cognition: evidence from children aged 5-10 years		While there is evidence of associations between spatial skills and mathematics, relatively few studies explore these associations in children aged 5-10 years. I will present findings from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies to highlight the importance of spatial skills as both longitudinal and concurrent predictors of mathematics. First, secondary data analysis of the Millennium Cohort Study indicates that spatial performance at both 5 and 7 years is a significant predictor of mathematics at age 7 (N = 12099). Second, cross-sectional findings from children aged 5-10 years (N=156), suggest that spatial skills explain 1012% of the variation in standardised maths performance and approximate number sense, even after accounting for vocabulary skills. That is, spatial scaling was a significant predictor of mathematics for all age groups, while the role of mental rotation and mental folding varied with age. These findings have implications for the design of mathematics interventions customised for specific developmental stages.	2.5d;approximation algorithm;cognition;cross-sectional data;kerrison predictor;vocabulary	Katie Gilligan;Alex Hodgkiss;Michael Thomas;Emily Farran	2017			mental rotation;psychology;cognitive psychology;developmental psychology;number sense;cognition;psychological intervention;millennium cohort study (united states);secondary data;vocabulary	HCI	19.49745812627751	-78.86727697288627	103564

However, the development of these ML models rely on a unique training set and learning stops once this set has been processed. Training these classifiers requires a representative amount of data, but the gathering, preprocess, and validation of samples is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, for a classical, non-incremental approach to ML, it is necessary to wait long enough to collect all the required data. In contrast, an incremental learning approach may allow us to build an initial classifier with a smaller number of samples and update it incrementally when new data are collected. In this study, an incremental learning algorithm for Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (iGDA) based on the Graybill and Deal weighted combination of estimators is introduced. Each time a new set of data becomes available, a new estimation is carried out and a combination with a previous estimation is performed. iGDA does not require access to the previously used data and is able to include new classes that were not in the original analysis, thus allowing the customization of the models to the distribution of data at a particular clinical center. An evaluation using five benchmark databases has been used to evaluate the behaviour of the iGDA algorithm in terms of stability-plasticity, class inclusion and order effect. Finally, the iGDA algorithm has been applied to automatic brain tumour classification with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and compared with two state-of-the-art incremental algorithms. The empirical results obtained show the ability of the algorithm to learn in an incremental fashion, improving the performance of the models when new information is available, and converging in the course of time. Furthermore, the algorithm shows a negligible instance and concept order effect, avoiding the bias that such effects could introduce.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);brain neoplasms;class;database;dynamic problem (algorithms);increment;linear discriminant analysis;machine learning;normal statistical distribution;preprocessor;resonance;small;test set;who tumor classification	Salvador Tortajada;Elies Fuster-García;Javier Vicente;Pieter Wesseling;Franklyn A.

In this work, a mathematical model of the integrative response of SC neurons is presented, to gain a deeper insight into the possible mechanisms involved, and on individual differences in integrative abilities. The model includes two unimodal areas (auditory and visual), which communicate via feedforward and feedback synapses with a third multisensory area. Each neuron is represented via a sigmoidal relationship and a first-order dynamic. Neurons in the same area interact via lateral synapses. Simulations show that the model, with a basal parameter set, can mimic various responses described in the literature: (i) multimodal enhancement in response to two cross-modal stimuli within the receptive field, according to the inverse-effectiveness principle; (ii) within-modality suppression and cross-modality suppression by a stimulus (of the same or other modality) placed outside the receptive field. Sensitivity analysis on model parameters demonstrate that different classes of neurons observed in the literature (such as, neurons which exhibit within modality suppression without cross-modality suppression, or neurons with asymmetrical cross-modality suppression) can be reproduced by simply modifying synaptic strengths in the multimodal area. Finally, exempla of the possible role of feedback mechanisms in ambiguous conditions (such as reinforcement of a poor perception by a second cross-modal stimulus, or ventriloquism) are shown and critically discussed. The model may be of value to assess the different mechanisms responsible for multisensory integration in the SC, and, in future, to study neural plasticity in multisensory systems during development or rehabilitation.

This method is applied to diffusion MRI scans of a subset of the Human Connectome Project dataset: 57 pairs of monozygotic and 52 pairs of dizygotic twins. After controlling for morphological similarity between twins, we identify 3.7% of all white matter as being associated with genetic similarity (35.1 k voxels, p<10-4, false discovery rate 1.5%), 75% of which spatially clusters into twenty-two contiguous white matter regions. Furthermore, we show that the orientation similarity within these regions generalizes to a subset of 47 pairs of non-twin siblings, and show that these siblings are on average as similar as dizygotic twins. The regions are located in deep white matter including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the optic radiations, the middle cerebellar peduncle, the corticospinal tract, and within the anterior temporal lobe, as well as the cerebellum, brain stem, and amygdalae. These results extend previous work using undirected fractional anisotrophy for measuring putative heritable influences in white matter. Our multidirectional extension better accounts for crossing fiber connections within voxels. This bottom up approach has at its basis a novel measurement of coherence within neighboring voxel dyads between subjects, and avoids some of the fundamental ambiguities encountered with tractographic approaches to white matter analysis that estimate global connectivity.	acoustic lobing;brain stem;cerebellum;coherence (physics);corticospinal tracts;fascicle - nerve fibers;genetic distance;graph (discrete mathematics);human connectome project;optics;peduncle - plant part;population;radiation;silo (dataset);structure of middle cerebellar peduncle;subgroup;temporal lobe;tissue fiber;top-down and bottom-up design;tract (literature);twenty two;twin;voxel;white matter	Haraldur Tómas Hallgrímsson;Matthew Cieslak;Luca Foschini;Scott T.

bfcd83c6bbabddaf996d1468a5d252a939f2d2ae	brain network eigenmodes provide a robust and compact representation of the structural connectome in health and disease		Recent research has demonstrated the use of the structural connectome as a powerful tool to characterize the network architecture of the brain and potentially generate biomarkers for neurologic and psychiatric disorders. In particular, the anatomic embedding of the edges of the cerebral graph have been postulated to elucidate the relative importance of white matter tracts to the overall network connectivity, explaining the varying effects of localized white matter pathology on cognition and behavior. Here, we demonstrate the use of a linear diffusion model to quantify the impact of these perturbations on brain connectivity. We show that the eigenmodes governing the dynamics of this model are strongly conserved between healthy subjects regardless of cortical and sub-cortical parcellations, but show significant, interpretable deviations in improperly developed brains. More specifically, we investigated the effect of agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), one of the most common brain malformations to identify differences in the effect of virtual corpus callosotomies and the neurodevelopmental disorder itself. These findings, including the strong correspondence between regions of highest importance from graph eigenmodes of network diffusion and nexus regions of white matter from edge density imaging, show converging evidence toward understanding the relationship between white matter anatomy and the structural connectome.	agenesis of corpus callosum;anatomic structures;biological markers;body of uterus;cognition;congenital abnormality;congenital anomaly of brain;connectome;convergence (action);embedding;graph - visual representation;mental disorders;network architecture;neurodevelopmental disorders;nexus (resin cement);normal mode;white matter	Maxwell B.

8718fe2c1801712e3aa9f22650949cb56ef069d1	lateralization of resting state networks and relationship to age and gender		Brain lateralization is a widely studied topic, however there has been little work focused on lateralization of intrinsic networks (regions showing similar patterns of covariation among voxels) in the resting brain. In this study, we evaluate resting state network lateralization in an age and gender-balanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset comprising over 600 healthy subjects ranging in age from 12 to 71. After establishing sample-wide network lateralization properties, we continue with an investigation of age and gender effects on network lateralization. All data was gathered on the same scanner and preprocessed using an automated pipeline (Scott et al., 2011). Networks were extracted via group independent component analysis (gICA) (Calhoun et al., 2001). Twenty-eight resting state networks discussed in previous (Allen et al., 2011) work were re-analyzed with a focus on lateralization. We calculated homotopic voxelwise measures of laterality in addition to a global lateralization measure, called the laterality cofactor, for each network. As expected, many of the intrinsic brain networks were lateralized. For example, the visual network was strongly right lateralized, auditory network and default mode networks were mostly left lateralized. Attentional and frontal networks included nodes that were left lateralized and other nodes that were right lateralized. Age was strongly related to lateralization in multiple regions including sensorimotor network regions precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus and supramarginal gyrus; and visual network regions lingual gyrus; attentional network regions inferior parietal lobule, superior parietal lobule and middle temporal gyrus; and frontal network regions including the inferior frontal gyrus. Gender showed significant effects mainly in two regions, including visual and frontal networks. For example, the inferior frontal gyrus was more right lateralized in males. Significant effects of age were found in sensorimotor and visual networks on the global measure. In summary, we report a large-sample of lateralization study that finds intrinsic functional brain networks to be highly lateralized, with regions that are strongly related to gender and age locally, and with age a strong factor in lateralization, and gender exhibiting a trend-level effect on global measures of laterality.	default;exhibits as topic;extraction;frontal lobe gyrus;functional laterality;handedness;independent component analysis;inferior frontal gyrus;lobule;magnetic resonance imaging;pipeline (computing);precentral gyrus;rest;resting state fmri;scanner device component;structure of middle temporal gyrus;structure of postcentral gyrus;tongue;voxel;chemical cofactor	Oktay Agcaoglu;Robyn L.

In this paper we study the effect of metaplasticity on network behavior. Our guiding assumption is that the primary purpose of metaplasticity is to regulate synaptic plasticity, by increasing it when input is low and decreasing it when input is high. For our experiments we adopt a model of metaplasticity that demonstrably has this effect for a single synapse; our primary interest is in how metaplasticity thus defined affects network-level phenomena. We focus on a network-level phenomenon called polychronicity, that has a potential role in representation and memory. A network with polychronicity has the ability to produce non-synchronous but precisely timed sequences of neural firing events that can arise from strongly connected groups of neurons called polychronous neural groups (Izhikevich et al., 2004). Polychronous groups (PNGs) develop readily when spiking networks are exposed to repeated spatio-temporal stimuli under the influence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), but are sensitive to changes in synaptic weight distribution. We use a technique we have recently developed called Response Fingerprinting to show that PNGs formed in the presence of metaplasticity are significantly larger than those with no metaplasticity. A potential mechanism for this enhancement is proposed that links an inherent property of integrator type neurons called spike latency to an increase in the tolerance of PNG neurons to jitter in their inputs.	action potential;artificial neural network;computer simulation;dependent ml;experiment;fingerprint;large;neural oscillation;neuronal plasticity;portable network graphics;strongly connected component;synapse;synapses;synaptic weight	Mira Guise;Alistair Knott;Lubica Benusková	2015		10.3389/fncom.2015.00009	psychology;text mining;neuroscience;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;metaplasticity;memory	ML	18.317136517219584	-71.21153557632691	104624

Although results of rTMS intervention are promising, so far, little is known about the rTMS effect on brain functional networks in clinical populations. In this study, we used a whole-brain connectivity analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to uncover changes in functional connectivity following rTMS intervention and their association with motor symptoms in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Patients were randomized to active rTMS or sham rTMS groups and completed a 10-session 5-Hz rTMS treatment over the left primary motor area. The results showed significant rTMS-related changes in motor symptoms and functional connectivity. Specifically, (1) significant improvement of motor symptoms was observed in the active rTMS group, but not in the sham rTMS group; and (2) several functional links involving the default mode, cerebellar, and limbic networks exhibited positive changes in functional connectivity in the active rTMS group. Moreover, the positive changes in functional connectivity were associated with improvement in motor symptoms for the active rTMS group. The present findings suggest that rTMS may improve motor symptoms by modulating functional links connecting to the default mode, cerebellar, and limbic networks, inferring a future therapeutic candidate for patients with MSA.	atrophic;decision model and notation;default;kohn–sham equations;magnetic resonance imaging;mental association;mental disorders;motor neuron disease;neuromodulation (medicine);patients;population;randomized algorithm;rest;resting state fmri;shy-drager syndrome;tpo wt allele;transcranial magnetic stimulation;primary motor cortex	Ying-Hui Chou;Hui You;Han Wang;Yan-Ping Zhao;Bo Hou;Nankuei Chen;Feng Feng	2015	Brain connectivity	10.1089/brain.2014.0325	psychology;psychiatry;neuroscience;developmental psychology	ML	19.31450703718526	-79.52506390242019	104705
3fb6d6810f20798aff7c74f11584a8afadb9c50c	single neuron memories and the network's proximity matrix	evolutionary computing	It is reasonable to assume that in a network of densely connected neurons, activity originates in some area and spreads to others. Neurons belonging to different physiological structures are associated with different functions and their organization is characterized by category and hierarchy [1]. As to neuron activity, after firing, they enter a phase of refractoriness. Conversely, models of neural network memory have feedback connections trained by Hebbian learning [2],[3] without consideration to physical separation amongst the neurons and the delay caused by the propagation of spike activity. The B-matrix approach to neural network function [4] accounts for spreading of activity from one region to others based on adjacency of neurons. The B-matrix approach emerged out of research seeking to find ways to index information in neural networks [5]-[11].	artificial neural network;hebbian theory;neuron;software propagation;transfer function	Subhash C.

Why are there approximately this many hierarchical levels? Here I put forth a generic information-processing hierarchical model, and show how the total number of neurons required depends on the number of hierarchical levels and on the complexity of visual objects that must be recognized. Because the recognition of written words appears to occur in a similar part of inferotemporal cortex as other visual objects, the complexity of written words may be similar to that of other visual objects for humans; for this reason, I measure the complexity of written words, and use it as an approximate estimate of the complexity more generally of visual objects. I then show that the information-processing hierarchy that accommodates visual objects of that complexity possesses the minimum number of neurons when the number of hierarchical levels is approximately 15.	approximation algorithm;cerebral cortex;estimated;generic drugs;hierarchical database model;information processing;physical object;primates;visual objects	Mark A.

Hemodynamic responses of brain during single-event trials in an odd-ball experiment are measured by functional near infrared spectroscopy method. The frequency axis is partitioned into subbands by clustering the time-frequency power spectrum profiles of the brain responses. The predominant subbands are observed to confine the 0–30 mHz, 30–60 mHz, and 60–330 mHz ranges. We identify the group of subbands that shows strong evidence of protocol-induced periodicity as well as the bands where good correlation with an assumed hemodynamic response models is found.	anisotropic band;apache axis;assumed;bands;canonical account;cluster analysis;detectors;existential quantification;experiment;frequency band;hemodynamics;holographic principle;l band;microsoft band;quasiperiodicity;rc circuit;sensor;spatial variability;spectral density;spectroscopy, near-infrared;waveform;statistical cluster	Ceyhun Burak Akgül;Bülent Sankur;Ata Akin	2005	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-005-5478-2	psychology;near-infrared spectroscopy;neuroscience;time–frequency analysis;mathematics;haemodynamic response;optics;nuclear magnetic resonance;spectral density;quantum mechanics;statistics	ML	17.198165242541293	-79.89856106164504	104869
3b8414ad2f8c76920883ecb355e8715845593018	asymmetric processing of numerical and nonnumerical magnitudes in the brain: an fmri study		It is well established that, when comparing nonsymbolic magnitudes (e.g., dot arrays), adults can use both numerical (i.e., the number of items) and nonnumerical (density, total surface areas, etc.) magnitudes. It is less clear which of these magnitudes is more salient or processed more automatically. In this fMRI study, we used a nonsymbolic comparison task to ask if different brain areas are responsible for the automatic processing of numerical and nonnumerical magnitudes, when participants were instructed to attend to either the numerical or the nonnumerical magnitudes of the same stimuli. An interaction of task (numerical vs. nonnumerical) and congruity (congruent vs. incongruent) was found in the right TPJ. Specifically, this brain region was more strongly activated during numerical processing when the nonnumerical magnitudes were negatively correlated with numerosity (incongruent trials). In contrast, such an interference effect was not evident during nonnumerical processing when the task-irrelevant numerical magnitude was incongruent. In view of the role of the right TPJ in the control of stimulus-driven attention, we argue that these data demonstrate that the processing of nonnumerical magnitudes is more automatic than that of numerical magnitudes and that, therefore, the influence of numerical and nonnumerical variables on each other is asymmetrical.	cognition disorders;consciousness;greater than;interference (communication);judgment;modulation;neuroscience discipline;numerical analysis;relevance;fmri	Tali Leibovich;Stephan E.

However, there has been little work on the effect of atrophy on the cortical folding patterns. In this study, we examined whether the cortical folding could be used as a biomarker of AD. Cortical folding metrics were computed on 678 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. For each subject, the boundary between grey matter and white matter was extracted using a level set technique. At each point on the boundary two metrics characterising folding, curvedness and shape index, were generated. Joint histograms using these metrics were calculated for five regions of interest (ROIs): frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes as well as the cingulum. Pixelwise statistical maps were generated from the joint histograms using permutations tests. In each ROI, a significant reduction was observed between controls and AD in areas associated with the sulcal folds, suggesting a sulcal opening associated with neurodegeneration. When comparing to MCI patients, the regions of significance were smaller but overlapping with those regions found comparing controls to AD. It indicates that the differences in cortical folding are progressive and can be detected before formal diagnosis of AD. Our preliminary analysis showed a viable signal in the cortical folding patterns for Alzheimer's disease that should be explored further.		David M.

This is suggested by interfering effects of unit digit processing on two-digit number comparison. In the present study, we extended the computational model for two-digit number magnitude comparison of Moeller, Huber, Nuerk, and Willmes (2011a) to the case of three-digit number comparison (e.g., 371_826). In a second step, we evaluated how hundred-decade and hundred-unit compatibility effects were moderated by varying the percentage of within-hundred (e.g., 539_582) and within-hundred-and-decade filler items (e.g., 483_489). From the results we predict that numerical distance as well as compatibility effects should indeed be modulated by the relevance of tens and units in three-digit number magnitude comparison: While in particular the hundred distance effect should decrease, we predict hundred-decade and hundred-unit compatibility effects to increase with the relevance of tens and units.	computation;computational model;digit structure;filler (substance);medical device incompatibility problem;modulation;numerical analysis;numerous;relevance;star filler;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation	Stefan Huber;Korbinian Moeller;Hans-Christoph Nuerk;Klaus Willmes	2013	Topics in cognitive science	10.1111/tops.12016	arithmetic;computer science;mathematics;computational model;algorithm	ML	14.109648616837788	-78.87498495303484	104968

Yet the growing success of domestic and field robotics shows the importance of a design framework. The design methodology presented here explicitly addresses design and evolution integration. Mimicking the biological nervous system's network of neurons, a comparable low-level ubiquitous element is developed, called the imbalance element. This element's model stems from comparing diverse biological behavior phenomena from which results a mechanism called the equilibrium-action cycle. In this cycle, action is driven by imbalanced elements and is specifically aimed at restoring the stimuli necessary for elements to maintain equilibrium. The structure of the imbalance element network is first designed, leaving a set of parameters which can either be set analytically or evolved. Overall, integration of parameters are more predictable due to a clear mapping between a behavior and a parameter, as made possible by the design methodology's focus on the equilibrium-action cycle. A simple line follower's nervous system is designed to serve as example of the suggested design and evolution integration.

edeea7385caa85ea30608d9a32bdeb02e2c562b4	multivoxel object representations in adult human visual cortex are flexible: an associative learning study		Learning associations between co-occurring events enables us to extract structure from our environment. Medial-temporal lobe structures are critical for associative learning. However, the role of the ventral visual pathway (VVP) in associative learning is not clear. Do multivoxel object representations in the VVP reflect newly formed associations? We show that VVP multivoxel representations become more similar to each other after human participants learn arbitrary new associations between pairs of unrelated objects (faces, houses, cars, chairs). Participants were scanned before and after 15 days of associative learning. To evaluate how object representations changed, a classifier was trained on discriminating two nonassociated categories (e.g., faces/houses) and tested on discriminating their paired associates (e.g., cars/chairs). Because the associations were arbitrary and counterbalanced across participants, there was initially no particular reason for this cross-classification decision to tend toward either alternative. Nonetheless, after learning, cross-classification performance increased in the VVP (but not hippocampus), on average by 3.3%, with some voxels showing increases of up to 10%. For example, a chair multivoxel representation that initially resembled neither face nor house representations was, after learning, classified as more similar to that of faces for participants who associated chairs with faces and to that of houses for participants who associated chairs with houses. Additionally, learning produced long-lasting perceptual consequences. In a behavioral priming experiment performed several months later, the change in cross-classification performance was correlated with the degree of priming. Thus, VVP multivoxel representations are not static but become more similar to each other after associative learning.	acoustic lobing;categories;cerebral cortex;chairs;conditioning, classical;contingency table;face;gene regulatory network;learning disorders;medial graph;mental association;physical object;priming exercise;scanning;statistical classification;temporal lobe;visual pathways;voxel	Mehdi Senoussi;Isabelle Berry;Rufin van Rullen;Leila Reddy	2016	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00933	psychology;communication;social psychology	ML	16.405164737666812	-75.79547748949565	105530
3ef1b9bad2ed178e638a598468a49957f83cb792	critical periods as fundamental events in life	dissipative structure;critical period;dissipative system;non linear dynamics	Development is not a continuous phenomenon. Rather, phenophases are interspaced with short critical periods. This phenomenon reflects an alternance between stabilization (during a phenophase) and dismantling (during a critical period) of a network of between-organ relationships generating the organism. Networks of relationships may be compared to dissipative systems in physics. In this context, a critical period represents a transient phase of isolation of the systems enabling its evolution towards equilibrium. As suggested here, this transition from dissipative to isolated system represents the source of newly emerging dissipative structures in which environmental or developmental perturbations are adaptively integrated. In contrast to non-living systems, an endogenous control of the transition towards critical period seems to exist during development. By extension to other scales of biological organization, it is suggested that the capacity to self-define its status (dissipative or close-to-equilibrium) represents the key property of living systems. This asks for a reconsideration of some basic notions about life, such as the role of genes in normal development, in physiological adaptation, and even in the emergence of evolutionary novelty.	acclimatization;adaptation, physiological;biological organisation;dissipative system;emergence;equilibrium;living systems	G.

The first change to occur is in the intrinsic properties of the neurons. One day after learning, pyramidal neurons show enhanced neuronal excitability. This enhancement results from reduction in calcium-dependent conductance that mediates the post burst after-hyperpolarization. Such enhanced excitability lasts for 3 days and is followed by a series of synaptic modifications. Several forms of long-term enhancement in synaptic connections between layer II pyramidal neurons in the piriform cortex accompany olfactory learning. Enhanced synaptic release is indicated by reduced paired-pulse facilitation. Post-synaptic enhancement of synaptic transmission is indicated by reduced rise time of post-synaptic potentials and formation of new synaptic connections is indicated by increased spine density along dendrites of these neurons. Such modifications last for up to 5 days. Thus, olfactory discrimination rule learning is accompanied by a series of cellular modifications which occur and then disappear at different times. These modifications overlap partially, allowing the maintenance of the cortical system in a ‘learning mode’ in which memories for specific odors can be acquired rapidly and efficiently.	anhaptoglobinemia;blinking;calcium;cerebral cortex;conditioning (psychology);conditioning, classical;conductance (graph);dendrites;excited state;learning disorders;lung consolidation;memory disorders;memory, long-term;neuron;odors;olfactory learning;olfactory nerve injuries;olfactory receptor cells;population;post–turing machine;pyramidal cells;rise time;semiconductor consolidation;smell perception;synaptic package manager;synaptic potentials;synaptic transmission;facilitation	Edi Barkai	2005	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-005-0564-0	psychology;neuroscience;long-term memory;developmental psychology;anti-hebbian learning;neural facilitation;communication;discrimination learning;neurotransmission	ML	18.573690744242555	-72.25165747889183	106221
9f83e9970e8307aadfe9428784881bc3fec673bf	three-dimensional spatial representation in freely swimming fish		Research on spatial cognition has focused on how animals encode the horizontal component of space. However, most animals travel vertically within their environments, particularly those that fly or swim. Pelagic fish move with six degrees of freedom and must integrate these components to navigate accurately—how do they do this? Using an assay based on associative learning of the vertical and horizontal components of space within a rotating Y-maze, we found that fish (Astyanax fasciatus) learned and remembered information from both horizontal and vertical axes when they were presented either separately or as an integrated three-dimensional unit. When information from the two components conflicted, the fish used the previously learned vertical information in preference to the horizontal. This not only demonstrates that the horizontal and vertical components are stored separately in the fishes’ representation of space (simplifying the problem of 3D navigation), but also suggests that the vertical axis contains particularly salient spatial cues—presumably including hydrostatic pressure. To explore this latter possibility, we developed a physical theoretical model that shows how fish could determine their absolute depth using pressure. We next considered full volumetric spatial cognition. Astyanax were trained to swim towards a reward in a Y-maze that could be rotated, before the arms were removed during probe trials. The subjects were tracked in three dimensions as they swam freely through the surrounding cubic tank. The results revealed that fish are able to accurately encode metric information in a volume, and that the error accrued in the horizontal and vertical axes whilst swimming in probe trials was similar. Together, these experiments demonstrate that unlike in surface-bound rats, the vertical component of the representation of space is vitally important to fishes. We hypothesise that the representation of space in the brain of vertebrates could ultimately be shaped by the number of the degrees of freedom of movement that binds the navigating animal.	alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma;apache axis;aquatic ecosystem;axis vertebra;b23 protein, astyanax fasciatus;coat of arms;cognition;cubic function;dimensions;disk controller;encode;experiment;fishes;hydrostatic pressure;image resolution;intracranial hypertension;learning disorders;mopy fish;six degrees of separation;system wide information management;theory;vertebrates;while	Theresa Burt de Perera;Robert I.

1ac8641e8048dbff3d06fe38e1852247642f5d12	on a unified point process approach for the characterization of bioelectric discrete phenomena		This paper discusses a unified method based on the theory of point processes to characterize various types of bioelectric discrete signals such as heart beat timing, myoelectric activity, discharge of primary sensory neurons or neurons in the central nervous systems. The doubly stochastic point processes, in which the discrete event occurring intensity is stochastic, forms the most general class to characterize the discrete phenomena. In this paper the self-exciting process has been shown to be useful to characterize wide range of discrete biosignals. The modeling of conditional intensity function is the essential part of the characterization. When the intensity has a parametric model, the maximum likelihood parameter estimation will be the useful way to characterize the phenomena. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by a specific modeling of the spontaneous neuronal burst discharges recorded from the brain thalamus during the neuro surgery. The first approximation model has four parameters obtained by the instantaneous nonlinearly transformed sinusoidal function. An extended model allows arbitrary periodic intensity with refractory period. Predicted interval histograms show good agreement with the observed ones indicating the validity of the proposed method.	afferent neuron;body fluid discharge;cns disorder;discharger;doubly stochastic model;estimation theory;interval arithmetic;neurosurgical procedures;nonlinear system;order of approximation;parametric model;point process;population parameter;spontaneous order;stochastic process;thalamic structure	Kazuo Yana;Hiroyuki Mino	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037737	periodic graph (geometry);electronic engineering;parametric model;beat (music);sensory system;computer science;estimation theory;point process;histogram;sine wave	Robotics	21.02757644086639	-74.02489713780372	106303
4a6f3ddfe541121581b8e525495ee388d232bcf9	why verbalization of facial features increases false positive responses on visually-similar distractors: a computational exploration of verbal overshadowing		Verbal overshadowing refers to a phenomenon whereby verbalization of a non-verbal stimulus (e.g., he had slant eyes) impairs subsequent non-verbal recognition accuracy. In order to understand the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs, we constructed a computational model that was trained to generate an individual-face-specific representation upon input of a noise-filtered retinotopic face (i.e., face recognition). When the model verbalized the facial features before receiving the retinotopic input, the model incorrectly recognized a new face input as one of the different, yet visually-similar, trained items (that is, a false-alarm occurred). In contrast, this recognition error did not occur without prior verbalization. Close inspection of the model revealed that verbalization changed the internal representation such that it lacked the fine-grained information necessary to discriminate visually-similar faces. This supports the view that verbalization causes unavailability/degradation of finegrained non-verbal representations, thus impairing recognition accuracy.	computation;computational model;elegant degradation;facial recognition system;unavailability	Aya Hatano;Taiji Ueno;Shinji Kitagami;Jun Kawaguchi	2013			psychology;social psychology;cognitive science;crime scene;false alarm;human physical appearance;cognitive psychology;stimulus (physiology);facial recognition system;perception;cognition;eyewitness memory	Vision	14.77994573512764	-75.90595674109272	106442

Ten healthy subjects (20-45 years) were investigated. Vibrotactile stimulation of the sole of the foot with a frequency of 50 Hz and a displacement of 1 mm was performed during fMRI (echo-planar imaging sequence at 1.5 T) using an MRI compatible moving magnet actuator that is able to produce vibration frequencies between 0 and 100 Hz and displacement amplitudes between 0 and 4 mm. The fMRI measurement during vibrotactile stimulation of the right foot revealed brain activation contralaterally within the primary sensorimotor cortex, bilaterally within the secondary somatosensory cortex, bilaterally within the superior temporal, inferior parietal, and posterior insular region, bilaterally within the anterior and posterior cingular gyrus, bilaterally within the thalamus and caudate nucleus, contralaterally within the lentiform nucleus, and bilaterally within the anterior and posterior cerebellar lobe. The advantages of the new MRI compatible vibration device include effective transmission of the stimulus and controlled vibration amplitudes, frequencies, and intensities. The results indicate that plantar vibration can be a suitable paradigm to observe activation within the sensorimotor network in fMRI. Furthermore, the method may be used to determine the optimal responsiveness of the individual sensorimotor network.	acoustic lobing;actuator device component;caudate nucleus structure;cell nucleus;cerebral cortex;deep brain stimulation;displacement mapping;echo-planar imaging;gyrus cinguli;hertz (hz);insula of reil;lentiform nucleus structure;magnet <device>;plantar - anatomical location;programming paradigm;psychologic displacement;resonance;responsiveness;somatosensory cortex;thalamic structure;transcranial magnetic stimulation;fmri	Stefan Golaszewski;Christian M.

This phenomenon is reminiscent of the formation of clusters in models of coupled phase oscillators. To investigate real neural networks as systems of coupled oscillators, we have recently proposed an efficient method to estimate phase-resetting curves (PRCs) in real neurons with whole-cell patch-clamp procedures. In particular, we have applied our approach to the study of the neural dynamics in the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB). First we found that i) the estimated PRC of the mitral cells have positive and partially negative regions (type II neurons or resonators); ii) these PRCs possess higher order harmonics, a necessary condition for the formation of more than one oscillator clusters. The PRC-based phase models showed that neurons quickly organized into subsets of synchronized assemblies. The type and pattern of synaptic interactions determined the nature of these assemblies. For excitatory connections neurons divided into three equidistant assemblies were obtained. For inhibitory connections two close assemblies were found. These examples suggest that this simple model can reproduce many features of (transient) synchronization and have led us to begin a more thorough investigation of these phenomena in phase models.	artificial neural network;clamping (graphics);computer cluster;experiment;in-phase and quadrature components;interaction;led lamp;neural oscillation;neuron;outside broadcasting;synaptic package manager	Roberto Fdez.

Such tasks are usually designed to isolate and measure some aspect of a single memory system. However, it is not necessarily clear that any given task actually does isolate a system or that the strategy used by a subject in the experiment is the one desired by the experimenter. We have previously shown that when tasks are written mathematically as a form of partially observable Markov decision processes, the structure of the tasks provide information regarding the possible utility of certain memory systems. These previous analyses dealt with the disambiguation problem: given a specific ambiguous observation of the environment, is there information provided by a given memory strategy that can disambiguate that observation to allow a correct decision? Here we extend this approach to cases where multiple memory systems can be strategically combined in different ways. Specifically, we analyze the disambiguation arising from three ways by which episodic-like memory retrieval might be cued (by another episodic-like memory, by a semantic association, or by working memory for some earlier observation). We also consider the disambiguation arising from holding earlier working memories, episodic-like memories or semantic associations in working memory. From these analyses we can begin to develop a quantitative hierarchy among memory systems in which stimulus-response memories and semantic associations provide no disambiguation while the episodic memory system provides the most flexible disambiguation, with working memory at an intermediate level.	experiment;markov chain;memory disorders;memory, episodic;mental association;partially observable markov decision process;partially observable system;word-sense disambiguation	Eric A.

fead2d852bde0ca4f53708720717a0b2512b94c6	relation of neural response to palatable food tastes and images to future weight gain: using bootstrap sampling to examine replicability of neuroimaging findings		Because understanding neural vulnerability factors that predict future weight gain may guide the design of more effective obesity prevention programs and treatments, we tested whether neural response to palatable food tastes and images predicted future weight gain. We recruited 135 initially healthy weight adolescents, to reduce the possibility that a history of overeating affected neural responsivity, had them complete fMRI paradigms examining neural response to tastes of milkshakes that varied in fat and sugar content and images of palatable foods, and assessed BMI annually over a 3-year follow-up. We used a novel bootstrapping analytic approach to investigate the replicability of the fMRI findings. Whole-brain analyses indicated that lower response in the pre-supplemental motor area to high-fat/low-sugar milkshake taste predicted future BMI gain in the full sample and in 5 out of the 10 bootstrap samples. Elevated response in the precentral gyrus/Rolandic operculum to images of appetizing foods predicted future BMI gain in the full sample and in 4 out of the 10 bootstrap samples. Other peaks that emerged in the full sample did not replicate in most of the bootstrap samples, suggesting they were not reliable. Region of interest analyses did not replicate the predictive effects of peaks reported in past papers that used similar paradigms, including the evidence that TaqIA polymorphism moderated the relation of striatal response to palatable food tastes to future weight gain. Results suggest that lower responsivity of a region implicated in motor processing in response to palatable taste was associated with greater BMI gain over time, and further that bootstrap sampling may be useful for estimating the replicability of findings that emerge from whole brain analyses or regions of interest analyses with the full sample.	bootstrapping (statistics);brain–computer interface;estimated;food;heparin, low-molecular-weight;motor cortex;neural oscillation;neuroimaging;paper;platelet glycoprotein 4, human;precentral gyrus;reducing diet;region of interest;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;self-replicating machine;self-replication;sugars;taste perception;fmri;invert sugar	Eric Stice;Sonja Yokum	2018	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.08.035	replicate;cognitive psychology;psychology;developmental psychology;bootstrapping (electronics);overeating;taste;region of interest;bootstrapping (statistics);weight gain;neuroimaging	ML	17.705104790914692	-79.22355729037058	107073

While the two constructs bear behavioral similarities, previous work has not extended these parallels to the neural level. This study examined amygdala reactivity during a task previously used with clinically anxious adolescents. Adolescents were selected for enduring patterns of BI or non-inhibition (BN). We examined amygdala response to evocative emotion faces in BI (N=10, mean 12.8 years) and BN (N=17, mean 12.5 years) adolescents while systematically manipulating attention. Analyses focused on amygdala response during subjective ratings of internal fear (constrained attention) and passive viewing (unconstrained attention) during the presentation of emotion faces (Happy, Angry, Fearful, and Neutral). BI adolescents, relative to BN adolescents, showed exaggerated amygdala response during subjective fear ratings and deactivation during passive viewing, across all emotion faces. In addition, the BI group showed an abnormally high amygdala response to a task condition marked by novelty and uncertainty (i.e., rating fear state to a Happy face). Perturbations in amygdala function are evident in adolescents temperamentally at risk for anxiety. Attention state alters the underlying pattern of neural processing, potentially mediating the observed behavioral patterns across development. BI adolescents also show a heightened sensitivity to novelty and uncertainty, which has been linked to anxiety. These patterns of reactivity may help sustain early temperamental biases over time and contribute to the observed relation between BI and anxiety.	activation function;adolescent (age group);amygdaloid structure;anxiety disorders;behavioral pattern;conceptualization (information science);face;parallels desktop for mac;patients;relevance;sensitivity and specificity;ursidae family;virtual reality cue reactivity	Koraly E.

6b891ea7f57209df14d61d50832173a5c48c0112	separating timing, movement conditions and individual differences in the analysis of human movement		A central task in the analysis of human movement behavior is to determine systematic patterns and differences across experimental conditions, participants and repetitions. This is possible because human movement is highly regular, being constrained by invariance principles. Movement timing and movement path, in particular, are linked through scaling laws. Separating variations of movement timing from the spatial variations of movements is a well-known challenge that is addressed in current approaches only through forms of preprocessing that bias analysis. Here we propose a novel nonlinear mixed-effects model for analyzing temporally continuous signals that contain systematic effects in both timing and path. Identifiability issues of path relative to timing are overcome by using maximum likelihood estimation in which the most likely separation of space and time is chosen given the variation found in data. The model is applied to analyze experimental data of human arm movements in which participants move a hand-held object to a target location while avoiding an obstacle. The model is used to classify movement data according to participant. Comparison to alternative approaches establishes nonlinear mixed-effects models as viable alternatives to conventional analysis frameworks. The model is then combined with a novel factor-analysis model that estimates the low-dimensional subspace within which movements vary when the task demands vary. Our framework enables us to visualize different dimensions of movement variation and to test hypotheses about the effect of obstacle placement and height on the movement path. We demonstrate that the approach can be used to uncover new properties of human movement.	estimated;factor analysis;image scaling;mobile device;movement disorders;nonlinear system;perseveration;preprocessor;temporal logic;test scaling	Lars Lau Rakêt;Britta Grimme;Gregor Schöner;Christian Igel;Bo Markussen	2016		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005092	simulation;artificial intelligence	ML	13.399551301513252	-79.65033816795517	107400

Most studies to date have focused on resting data, while the study of functional connectivity during task and the differences between task and rest are of great interest as well. In this work, we examine the graph-theoretical properties of the connectivity maps constructed using spatial components derived from independent component analysis (ICA) for healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia during an auditory oddball task (AOD) and at extended rest. We estimate functional connectivity using the higher-order statistical dependence, i.e., mutual information among the ICA spatial components, instead of the typically used temporal correlation. We also define three novel topological metrics based on the modules of brain networks obtained using a clustering approach. Our experimental results show that although the schizophrenia patients preserve the small-world property, they present a significantly lower small-worldness during both AOD task and rest when compared to the healthy controls, indicating a consistent tendency towards a more random organization of brain networks. In addition, the task-induced modulations to topological measures of several components involving motor, cerebellum and parietal regions are altered in patients relative to controls, providing further evidence for the aberrant connectivity in schizophrenia.	biological markers;cerebellum;cluster analysis;graph - visual representation;hearing problem;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;magnetic resonance imaging;map;mental disorders;mutual information;parietal lobe;patients;rest;resting state fmri;schizophrenia;small-world experiment;unidentified flying oddball;statistical cluster	Sai Ma;Vince D.

a36b49581e10ec469475bb8e3224a3d7184ed269	achromatic synesthesias — a functional magnetic resonance imaging study	achromatic synesthesias;emotional binding theory;the congruency effect	Grapheme-color synesthetes experience consistent, automatic and idiosyncratic colors associated with specific letters and numbers. Frequently, these specific associations exhibit achromatic synesthetic qualities (e.g. white, black or gray). In this study, we have investigated for the first time the neural basis of achromatic synesthesias, their relationship to chromatic synesthesias and the achromatic congruency effect in order to understand not only synesthetic color but also other components of the synesthetic experience. To achieve this aim, functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments were performed in a group of associator grapheme-color synesthetes and matched controls who were stimulated with real chromatic and achromatic stimuli (Mondrians), and with letters and numbers that elicited different types of grapheme-color synesthesias (i.e. chromatic and achromatic inducers which elicited chromatic but also achromatic synesthesias, as well as congruent and incongruent ones). The information derived from the analysis of Mondrians and chromatic/achromatic synesthesias suggests that real and synesthetic colors/achromaticity do not fully share neural mechanisms. The whole-brain analysis of BOLD signals in response to the complete set of synesthetic inducers revealed that the functional peculiarities of the synesthetic brain are distributed, and reflect different components of the synesthetic experience: a perceptual component, an (attentional) feature binding component, and an emotional component. Additionally, the inclusion of achromatic experiences has provided new evidence in favor of the emotional binding theory, a line of interpretation which constitutes a bridge between grapheme-color synesthesia and other developmental modalities of the phenomenon.	bi-directional text;color;experience;experiment;magnetic resonance imaging;mental association;monochrome;neural binding;synesthesia;fmri	H.

Recent results show that practice does not necessarily lead to the best possible performance on the task. It was shown that learning a task (contrast discrimination) that has already reached saturation could be enabled by a contextual change in the stimulus (the addition of surrounding flankers) during practice. Psychophysical results with varying context show a behavior that is described by a network of local visual processors with horizontal recurrent interactions. We describe a mathematical learning rule for the modification of cortical synapses that is inspired by the experimental results and apply it to recurrent cortical networks that respond to external stimuli. The model predicts that repeated presentation of the same stimulus leads to saturation of synaptic modification, such that the strengths of recurrent connections depend on the configuration of the stimulus but not on its amplitude. When a new stimulus is introduced, the modification is rekindled until a new equilibrium is reached. This effect may explain the saturation of perceptual learning when practicing a certain task repeatedly. We present simulations of contrast discrimination in a simplified model of a cortical column in the primary visual cortex and show that performance of the model is reminiscent of context-dependent perceptual learning.	area striata structure;central processing unit;cerebral cortex;context-sensitive language;inspiration function;interaction;learning disorders;learning rule;mathematics;recurrent neural network;sensory neuroscience;simulation;synapses;synaptic package manager	Misha Tsodyks;Yael Adini;Dov Sagi	2004	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2004.03.004	synaptic plasticity;visual perception;artificial intelligence;machine learning;context-dependent memory;perceptual learning;artificial neural network	ML	20.795695285733128	-70.22220797692162	107463

Measures of cortical development, including thickness, curvature, and gyrification have been extensively studied in older children, adolescents, and adults, revealing regional associations with cognitive performance, and alterations with disease or pathology. In addition to these gross morphometric measures, increased attention has recently focused on quantifying more specific indices of cortical structure, in particular intracortical myelination, and their relationship to cognitive skills, including IQ, executive functioning, and language performance. Here we analyze the progression of cortical myelination across early childhood, from 1 to 6 years of age, in vivo for the first time. Using two quantitative imaging techniques, namely T1 relaxation time and myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging, we characterize myelination throughout the cortex, examine developmental trends, and investigate hemispheric and gender-based differences. We present a pattern of cortical myelination that broadly mirrors established histological timelines, with somatosensory, motor and visual cortices myelinating by 1 year of age; and frontal and temporal cortices exhibiting more protracted myelination. Developmental trajectories, defined by logarithmic functions (increasing for MWF, decreasing for T1), were characterized for each of 68 cortical regions. Comparisons of trajectories between hemispheres and gender revealed no significant differences. Results illustrate the ability to quantitatively map cortical myelination throughout early neurodevelopment, and may provide an important new tool for investigating typical and atypical development.	adrenal cortex;anatomical maturation;color gradient;executive function;exhibits as topic;futures studies;imaging techniques;linear programming relaxation;mental association;morphometrics;myelin;structure of cortex of kidney;temporal lobe;thickness (graph theory);timeline;toddler (age group);video-in video-out;white matter;metal working fluid;myelination	Sean C.

The olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli, spherical neuropil regions with well-defined neuronal circuitry, can provide insights into this issue. Optical calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye imaging (OICa(2+)) reflects dynamics of pre-synaptic input to glomeruli, whereas high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using deoxyhemoglobin contrast reveals neuropil function within the glomerular layer where both pre- and post-synaptic activities contribute. We imaged odor-specific activity patterns of the dorsal OB in the same anesthetized rats with fMRI and OICa(2+) and then co-registered the respective maps to compare patterns in the same space. Maps by each modality were very reproducible as trial-to-trial patterns for a given odor, overlapping by ~80%. Maps evoked by ethyl butyrate and methyl valerate for a given modality overlapped by ~80%, suggesting activation of similar dorsal glomerular networks by these odors. Comparison of maps generated by both methods for a given odor showed ~70% overlap, indicating similar odor-specific maps by each method. These results suggest that odor-specific glomerular patterns by high-resolution fMRI primarily tracks pre-synaptic input to the OB. Thus combining OICa(2+) and fMRI lays the framework for studies of OB processing over a range of spatiotemporal scales, where OICa(2+) can feature the fast dynamics of dorsal glomerular clusters and fMRI can map the entire glomerular sheet in the OB.	butyrates;calcium;deoxyhemoglobin;electronic circuit;fluorescent dyes;functional imaging;functional imaging;hemodynamics;image resolution;led lamp;magnetic resonance imaging;map;metabolic process, cellular;methylmethacrylate;modal logic;modality (human–computer interaction);numerous;odors;outside broadcasting;registration;smell perception;structure of olfactory bulb;synaptic package manager;track (course);valerates;ethyl butyrate;fmri	Basavaraju G.

In the simplest model discussed, each interval is assumed to be the sum of a random neuron refractory period and a statistically independent interval due to a stationary external process, whose statistics are assumed known. The power spectral density (hence the autocorrelation) of the composite neuron-firing renewal process is derived from the known spectrum of the external process and from the unknown spectrum of the neuron-refraction process. The results are applied to spike trains recorded in a previous study [2] of single neurons in visual cortex of awake monkey. Two models are demonstrated that may produce peaks in the power spectrum near 40 Hz.	autocorrelation;neuron;spectral density;stationary process;steady state	Joel Franklin;Wyeth Bair	1995	SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics	10.1137/S0036139993258691	calculus;mathematics;spectral density;statistics	ML	20.918220893083635	-72.08497771792364	107932
8c9534a2fd56b08c27c8cb87ec853dc6ace4491b	seeing without knowing: neural signatures of perceptual inference in the absence of report	universiteitsbibliotheek	Every day, we experience a rich and complex visual world. Our brain constantly translates meaningless fragmented input into coherent objects and scenes. However, our attentional capabilities are limited, and we can only report the few items that we happen to attend to. So what happens to items that are not cognitively accessed? Do these remain fragmentary and meaningless? Or are they processed up to a level where perceptual inferences take place about image composition? To investigate this, we recorded brain activity using fMRI while participants viewed images containing a Kanizsa figure, an illusion in which an object is perceived by means of perceptual inference. Participants were presented with the Kanizsa figure and three matched nonillusory control figures while they were engaged in an attentionally demanding distractor task. After the task, one group of participants was unable to identify the Kanizsa figure in a forced-choice decision task; hence, they were “inattentionally blind.” A second group had no trouble identifying the Kanizsa figure. Interestingly, the neural signature that was unique to the processing of the Kanizsa figure was present in both groups. Moreover, within-subject multivoxel pattern analysis showed that the neural signature of unreported Kanizsa figures could be used to classify reported Kanizsa figures and that this cross-report classification worked better for the Kanizsa condition than for the control conditions. Together, these results suggest that stimuli that are not cognitively accessed are processed up to levels of perceptual interpretation.	cognition;coherence (physics);deaf-blind disorders;electroencephalography;electronic signature;endoscopic retrograde cholangiography;hearing loss, high-frequency;illusions;inference;manuscripts;moore machine;occur (action);pattern recognition;physical object;unconscious personality factor;walter pitts;word lists by frequency;fmri	Annelinde R.

e96d9e927b2f2be9eeceba60f8c2fdd0608ead0e	local lyapunov exponents of deep echo state networks		Abstract The analysis of deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models represents a research area of increasing interest. In this context, the recent introduction of Deep Echo State Networks (DeepESNs) within the Reservoir Computing paradigm, enabled to study the intrinsic properties of hierarchically organized RNN architectures.In this paper we investigate the DeepESN model under a dynamical system perspective, aiming at characterizing the important aspect of stability of layered recurrent dynamics excited by external input signals.To this purpose, we develop a framework based on the study of the local Lyapunov exponents of stacked recurrent models, enabling the analysis and control of the resulting dynamical regimes. The introduced framework is demonstrated on artificial as well as real-world datasets. The results of our analysis on DeepESNs provide interesting insights on the real effect of layering in RNNs. In particular, they show that when recurrent units are organized in layers, then the resulting network intrinsically develops a richer dynamical behavior that is naturally driven closer to the edge of criticality. As confirmed by experiments on the short-term Memory Capacity task, this characterization makes the layered design effective, with respect to the shallow counterpart with the same number of units, especially in tasks that require much in terms of memory.	echo state network;lyapunov fractal	Claudio Gallicchio;Alessio Micheli;Luca Silvestri	2018	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2017.11.073	lyapunov exponent;machine learning;dynamical system;criticality;artificial intelligence;reservoir computing;recurrent neural network;excited state;mathematics	Robotics	17.665236992076192	-68.88975459158556	107988

ToM recursion was examined using a series of two-player, sequential-move matrix games with a maximum of three steps. Participants were assigned the role of Player I, controlling the initial and the last step, or of Player II, controlling the second step. Appropriate for the assigned role, participants either anticipated or planned Player II's strategy at the second step, and then determined Player I's optimal strategy at the first step. Participants more readily used predictive reasoning as Player II (i.e., planning one's own move) than as Player I (i.e., anticipating an opponent's move), although they did not differ when translating reasoning outcome about the second step to optimal action in the first step. Perspective-taking influenced likelihood of predictive reasoning, but it did not affect the rate at which participants acquired it during the experimental block. We conclude that the depth of ToM recursion (related to perspective-taking mechanisms) and rational application of belief-desire to action (instrumental rationality) constitute separate cognitive processes in ToM reasoning.	cognition;mental state;myopia;personnameuse - assigned;rationality;reasoning - publishing subsection;recursion	Jun Zhang;Trey Hedden;Adrian Chia	2012	Cognitive science	10.1111/j.1551-6709.2012.01238.x	psychology;cognitive psychology;games;game theory;logical reasoning;simulation;rationality;computer science;artificial intelligence;working memory;mathematics;social psychology;cognitive science	AI	13.670968815537012	-74.66316852031346	108019
49ff0c76b8f7c11bdf0de6984f7eabc6959f355e	calibration of neurotransmitter release from neural cells for therapeutic implants	neurotransmitter release;gaba;neural stimulation;glutamate	In this work we quantified the in vitro calibration relationships between high frequency electrical stimulation and GABA and glutamate release in both mature retinoic acid differentiated P19 neurons and immortalized embryonic cortical cells engineered to express glutamic acid decarboxylase, GAD65. Extracellular glutamate and GABA was quantified by 2D gas chromatography and time of flight mass spectrometry after stimulation at varying amplitudes and frequencies. Amplitude sweeps resulted in a linear calibration for P19 neurons; the level of neurotransmitter varied over one order of magnitude from ~ 200 pg/neuron to ~ 1.2 ng/neuron for glutamate and ~ 1 ng/neuron to ~ 2 ng/neuron for GABA, depending on the stimulation amplitude. Frequency sweeps resulted in a peak release at 250 Hz for glutamate and 400 Hz for GABA in P19 cells. The GABA transporter inhibitor, nipecotic acid, increased extracellular GABA levels and decrease glutamate. In contrast the embryonic cortical cells had a strongly nonlinear dependency of release on stimulation amplitude, and a weak dependence on frequency. These cells had roughly equal extracellular glutamate and GABA levels after stimulation despite the expression of GAD65. In addition glutamate and GABA levels were insensitive to nipecotic acid. These results demonstrate an ability to calibrate and tune neurotransmitter release from neural cells using high frequency stimulation parameters.	blood supply aspects;calibration;carboxy-lyases;cell culture techniques;cell hybridization;cultured cell line;electric stimulation technique;embryo;epilepsy;excitation;extracellular matrix;frequency band;functional electrical stimulation;gaba transporter;gad2 gene;gases;generalized anxiety disorder;glutamate decarboxylase;glutamic acid;hertz (hz);hyalinosis, systemic;immortalization;implants;in vitro [publication type];ion implantation;metabolomics;neuron;neurons;neurotransmitters;nonlinear system;procedure implants:finding:point in time:^patient:narrative;silicon;spectrometry;stem cells;transcranial magnetic stimulation;tretinoin;video-in video-out;cell type;emotional dependency;gamma-aminobutyric acid;neurotransmitter release;nipecotic acid	Sabrina S.

Amplitudes of separate excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were defined via differences between values of MP at the end and beginning of the positive derivative waves, which were also used as basic elements in the model of the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). EPSCs were assumed to be transformed into EPSPs by low-pass filtering properties of the somatic membrane; parameters of the filtering were firstly defined from analysis of Ia EPSP in the same cell and then were applied in model P m0. The model showed unsatisfactory quality in tracking slow components of MP; to overcome the disadvantage there was proposed model P m1 based on addition to P m0 the difference between two low-pass filtered signals MP and P m0 (the cutoff frequency 10 or 20 Hz). An overestimation of EPSPs’ amplitudes was corrected in model P m2. The mismatch in tracking slow changes of MP was assumed to be connected with summation of a great number of low-amplitude EPSPs generated at distal dendrites; information about waveform of separate EPSPs could disappear in this process. One can speculate that slow components of membrane depolarization at least partly are linked with the persistent inward currents in dendrites; variable and, sometimes, too fast decays in EPSPs seem to reflect inhibitory synaptic influences.	assumed;dendrites;diploid cell;direct inward dial;excitatory postsynaptic currents;excitatory postsynaptic potentials;gastrocnemius muscle structure;hertz (hz);low-pass filter;membrane potentials;postsynaptic current;probability amplitude;reflex action;reflex, stretch;smoothing;soleus muscle structure;summation (document);synapses;synaptic package manager;tissue membrane;trapezoid bone structure;waveform;membrane depolarization;slope	A.

f403dfecbaefc6fdb0d1450a6a8d3a3301994f0b	lateralization of affective processing in the insula		Evidence from electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging studies has suggested strong lateralization of affective processing within the insular cortices; however, little is known about the spatial location of these processes in these regions. Using quantitative meta-analytic methods the laterality of: (1) emotional processing; (2) stimulus valence (positive vs. negative); (3) perception vs. experience of emotion; and (4) sex-differences were assessed using the data from 143 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Activation in response to all emotional stimuli occurred in bilateral anterior and mid-insula, and the left posterior insula. Positive emotional stimuli were associated with activation in the left anterior and mid-insula, while negative emotional stimuli activated bilateral anterior and mid-insula. Activation in response to the perception and experience of emotions was highest in bilateral anterior insula, and within the mid and posterior insula it was left lateralized. In males, emotional stimuli predominantly activated the left anterior/mid-insula and right posterior insula, whereas females activated bilateral anterior insula and the left mid and posterior insula. Spatial distinctions observed in emotional processing and its subcategories can provide a comprehensive account of the role of the insular cortices in affect processing, which could aid in understanding deficits seen in psychiatric or developmental disorders.	bilateral filter;brain;consciousness;developmental disabilities;emotions;functional laterality;functional neuroimaging;insula of reil;language development disorders;magnetic resonance imaging;medical imaging;mental disorders;neurodevelopmental disorders;neurovascular bundle;fmri	Emma G.

Basket cells in the hippocampus demonstrate this plasticity in the form of synaptic depression, and recent in vivo work indicates that basket cell activities contribute significantly to hippocampal output associated with different behavioural states. Thus it is essential to understand the generation and synchronization of patterns produced by basket cell networks with depression. We study two-cell model inhibitory networks with depression and obtain alternating bursting patterns and synchronous activity occurring between bursts. We describe mechanisms for how these patterns emerge by performing several simulations in the plane of different depression time constants, τ D . Such patterns might contribute significantly to various population activites observed in the hippocampus.	cellular phone;depressive disorder;myoepithelial cell;neural coding;neuronal plasticity;simulation;synapse;synaptic package manager;video-in video-out	S.

a2f9e69eabf7402c73e17fa76efac28ca6858041	capturing spike variability in noisy izhikevich neurons using point process generalized linear models		To understand neural activity, two broad categories of models exist: statistical and dynamical. While statistical models possess rigorous methods for parameter estimation and goodness-of-fit assessment, dynamical models provide mechanistic insight. In general, these two categories of models are separately applied; understanding the relationships between these modeling approaches remains an area of active research. In this letter, we examine this relationship using simulation. To do so, we first generate spike train data from a well-known dynamical model, the Izhikevich neuron, with a noisy input current. We then fit these spike train data with a statistical model (a generalized linear model, GLM, with multiplicative influences of past spiking). For different levels of noise, we show how the GLM captures both the deterministic features of the Izhikevich neuron and the variability driven by the noise. We conclude that the GLM captures essential features of the simulated spike trains, but for near-deterministic spike trains, goodness-of-fit analyses reveal that the model does not fit very well in a statistical sense; the essential random part of the GLM is not captured.	action potential;artificial neuron;categories;dynamical system;estimation theory;general linear model;generalized linear model;heart rate variability;neural oscillation;point process;population parameter;selaginella;simulation;spatial variability;spike glycoprotein, coronavirus;statistical model	Jacob Østergaard;Mark A.

f0ef9dafa45a672dec1342e4e6f4514d2c297ea3	inheritance of hippocampal place fields through hebbian learning: effects of theta modulation and phase precession on structure formation		A place cell is a neuron that fires whenever the animal traverses a particular location of the environment—the place field of the cell. Place cells are found in two regions of the rodent hippocampus: CA3 and CA1. Motivated by the anatomical connectivity between these two regions and by the evidence for synaptic plasticity at these connections, we study how a place field in CA1 can be inherited from an upstream region such as CA3 through a Hebbian learning rule, in particular, through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). To this end, we model a population of CA3 place cells projecting to a single CA1 cell, and we assume that the CA1 input synapses are plastic according to STDP. With both numerical and analytical methods, we show that in the case of overlapping CA3 input place fields, the STDP learning rule leads to the formation of a place field in CA1. We then investigate the roles of the hippocampal theta modulation and phase precession on the inheritance process. We find that theta modulation favors the inheritance and leads to faster place field formation whereas phase precession changes the drift of CA1 place fields over time.	5' region;ca1 field;ca3 field;connected_to relation;dependent ml;hebbian theory;learning rule;modulation;neuron;neuronal plasticity;numerical analysis;place cells;synapses;synaptic package manager;theta model	Tiziano D'Albis;Jorge Jaramillo;Henning Sprekeler;Richard Kempter	2015	Neural Computation	10.1162/NECO_a_00752	neuroscience;artificial intelligence;machine learning	ML	18.383550932817734	-73.5867980678748	109014

Dopamine acting at D1 receptor activates adenylate cyclase through the coupling of D1 receptors with Gs/olf. The complex of adenylate cyclase activates and increases the intracellular levels of cAMP and thereby stimulating cAMP dependent protein kinase and increasing the state of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, M, = 32,000). DARPP-32 plays an important role in autophosphorylation of calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinaseII (CaMKII) which is crucial for prolongation of long term potentiation (LTP). Here we verified the effect of pre-synaptic re-uptake of dopamine by dopamine transporter on the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 and found that the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 is unaffected by pre-synaptic re-uptake. Further we have seen that the DARPP-32 phosphorylation does not change with the change in the DA or D1R concentrations.	computation;dopamine;experiment;linux test project (ltp);simulation;synapse;synaptic package manager	Shesharao M.

In particular, we develop a recurrent network with dynamic properties of Izhikevich spiking neuron model and train the network to associate a stimulus pair using reward modulated spike-time dependent plasticity. The learning algorithm associates a prime stimulus, known as the predictor, with a second stimulus, known as the choice, comes after an inter-stimulus interval. The influence of the prime stimulus on the neural response after the onset of the later stimulus is then observed. A series of probe trials resemble the retrospective and prospective activities in human response processing.	algorithm;artificial neural network;biological neuron model;kerrison predictor;modulation;onset (audio);prospective search;recurrent neural network;reinforcement learning;spiking neural network	Nooraini Yusoff;Farzana Kabir Ahmad	2013	2013 13th International Conference on Intellient Systems Design and Applications	10.1109/ISDA.2013.6920722	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;reinforcement learning;priming;spiking neural network	ML	16.826906727833062	-73.38713304459361	109098

If true, intentional inhibition in one domain may have unintended inhibitory effects (""""spillover"""") in other domains. The present study used an emotional go/no-go task that produces responses in both motor and affective domains, but induces intentional inhibition in only the motor domain. Data support the hypothesis that intentional inhibition in the motor domain, via rIFC, produces inhibitory spillover in the affective domain. Specifically, we observed increased rIFC along with reduced amygdala activity when participants intentionally inhibited motor responses during the presentation of negatively-valenced stimuli, and greater inverse connectivity between these regions during motor inhibition in a PPI analysis. Given the absence of intentional affect regulation, these results suggest that intentional inhibition of a motor response dampens the amygdala activation coincident with affective stimuli to the extent that rIFC activation is higher."""	amygdaloid structure;cerebral cortex;knowledge spillover;pixel density;proton pump inhibitors	Elliot T.

4a50e9175adfbf82531d618bd2490a5e08755fe4	a primitive based generative model to infer timing information in unpartitioned handwriting data	muscle activity;generic model;factorial hidden markov model;top down;compact representation;sparse coding	Biological movement control and planning is based upon motor primitives. Each motor primitive takes responsibility for controlling a small sub-block of motion, containing coherent muscle activation outputs. A central timing controller cues these subroutines of movement, creating complete movement strategies that are built up by overlaying primitives, thus creating synergies of muscle activation. This partitioning allows the movement to be defined by a sparse code representing the timing of primitive activations. This paper shows that it is possible to use a factorial hidden Markov model to infer primitives in handwriting data. The variation in the handwriting data can to a large extent be explained by timing variation in the triggering of the primitives. Once an appropriate set of primitives has been inferred, the characters can be represented as a set of timings of primitive activations, along with variances, giving a very compact representation of the character. The model is naturally partitioned into a low level primitive output stage, and a top-down primitive timing stage. This partitioning gives us an insight into behaviours such as scribbling, and what is learnt in order to write a new character.	coherence (physics);generative model;hidden markov model;markov chain;neural coding;sparse matrix;subroutine;synergy;top-down and bottom-up design	Ben H.

eabcbaa55344c09a848ed5bd096cae84f0f75784	multiscale stochastic neuron modeling - with applications in deep brain stimulation (wip)		In recent years deep brain stimulation (DBS) has seen success in curing adverse effects of several illnesses e.g. Parkinson. Current DBS method uses implanted brain which stimulate neurons. The mechanism behinds its success is still being researched, and there is a need for theoretical tools. To this end a comprehensible model will aid in the development of DBS-signals (Cubo, Medvedev, and Astrom 2016). Ionic channels, and synaptic channels, are simulated through Gillespieu0027s algorithm implemented in C compiled with Mex. A neuron tree is formulated spatially and the propagation of electric potential in the neuronal membrane is calculated using a Crank Nicholson scheme. The membrane current is sent to COMSOL where the extracellular potential is calculated. We show that the stochastic model of a neuron has lower threshold current for a potential spike compared to the deterministic model, and simulate propagation through chains of neurons showing that the potential field resembles that of measured EEGs.	deep brain stimulation;neuron	Aleksandar Senek;Stefan Engblom	2017			continuous-time markov chain;computational neuroscience;electric potential;crank–nicolson method;stochastic modelling;neuroscience;deterministic system;deep brain stimulation;neuron;computer science	ML	11.670952653699834	-69.14170516025543	109412

Little research has been dedicated to the effect of rtfMRI NF on the functional connectivity of the amygdala and connectivity patterns in amygdala down-regulation with neurofeedback have not been addressed yet. Using psychophysiological interaction analysis of fMRI data, we present evidence that voluntary amygdala down-regulation by rtfMRI NF while viewing aversive pictures was associated with increased connectivity of the right amygdala with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in healthy subjects (N=16). In contrast, a control group (N=16) receiving sham feedback did not alter amygdala connectivity (Group×Condition t-contrast: p<.05 at cluster-level). Task-dependent increases in amygdala-vmPFC connectivity were predicted by picture arousal (β=.59, p<.05). A dynamic causal modeling analysis with Bayesian model selection aimed at further characterizing the underlying causal structure and favored a bottom-up model assuming predominant information flow from the amygdala to the vmPFC (xp=.90). The results were complemented by the observation of task-dependent alterations in functional connectivity of the vmPFC with the visual cortex and the ventrolateral PFC in the experimental group (Condition t-contrast: p<.05 at cluster-level). Taken together, the results underscore the potential of amygdala fMRI neurofeedback to influence functional connectivity in key networks of emotion processing and regulation. This may be beneficial for patients suffering from severe emotion dysregulation by improving neural self-regulation.	amygdaloid structure;arousal;artificial neural network;bayes factor;borderline personality disorder;bottom-up parsing;causal filter;down-regulation;emotions;experiment;kohn–sham equations;lichen sclerosus et atrophicus;model selection;neural network simulation;neurofeedback;patients;personality disorders;post-traumatic stress disorder;powerbuilder foundation classes;processor control region;real-time clock;resting state fmri;self-control as a personality trait;stress disorders, traumatic;ventromedial prefrontal cortex;cellular targeting	Christian Paret;Matthias Ruf;Martin Fungisai Gerchen;Rosemarie Kluetsch;Traute Demirakca;Martin Jungkunz;Katja Bertsch;Christian Schmahl;Gabriele Ende	2016	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.10.027	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;emotion;magnetic resonance imaging	ML	19.196792745978	-78.47086705757086	109418

METHODS We obtained noninvasive rCBF measurements using Tc-99m-ethyl cysteinate diamer Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in 7 patients diagnosed with TGA within 4 days of onset of the amnestic episode while the patients were still symptomatic and in 17 age-matched healthy control subjects. We assessed memory functioning using the Hopkins's Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) and Statistical Parametric Mapping to compare rCBF across diagnostic groups.   RESULTS The patients with TGA were significantly impaired in their performance on the 20-minute delayed recall of the HVLT. They also exhibited significantly decreased rCBF on their SPECT scans in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus bilaterally, with more prominent left-sided reductions in the superior temporal, precentral, and postcentral gyri, as well as increased rCBF primarily in the right hemisphere within the middle temporal, superior temporal, and inferior frontal gyri, cerebellum, and thalamus, compared with the normal control group.   CONCLUSION These findings suggest that lateralized abnormalities in brain functioning are an important component of the pathophysiology of TGA. Lateralized abnormalities may disrupt functions that are relatively specific to the left hemisphere, including receptive language, symbolic representation, and the processing of local features in the environment, while preserving anterograde memory processes. Increased flow to the right hemisphere centered on regions that subserve the functions of expressive language and visuospatial processing, and may represent processes that compensate for flow reductions to the left hemisphere.	amnesia;amnesia, transient global;cerebellum;cerebrovascular circulation;childhood cerebral astrocytoma;congenital abnormality;congenital heart defects;frontal lobe gyrus;learning disorders;memory disorders;middle frontal gyrus structure;onset (audio);patients;spatial–temporal reasoning;tbx1 wt allele;technetium tc 99m sestamibi;thalamic structure;tomography, emission-computed;tomography, emission-computed, single-photon;transient ischemic attack;truevision tga;x-ray computed tomography;icosapent ethyl	Yong An Chung;Jaeseung Jeong;Dong Won Yang;Bong-Joo Kang;Sung Hoon Kim;Soo Kyo Chung;Hyung Sun Sohn;Bradley S.

Pooling over space a/ects the representation of individual stimuli, and thus its understanding is crucial for attention and ultimately for object recognition. Since attention, in turn, is likely to modify such spatial pooling by changing the competitive weight of individual stimuli, we compare the predictions of sumand max-pooling methods using a model of attention. Both pooling functions can account for data investigating the competition between a pair of stimuli within a V4 receptive .eld; however, our model using sum-pooling predicts a di/erent tuning curve. If we present an additional probe stimulus with the pair, sum-pooling predicts a bottom-up bias of attention, whereas the competition for attention using max-pooling is robust against the additional stimulus. c © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.	bottom-up parsing;convolutional neural network;outline of object recognition	Fred Henrik Hamker	2004	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2003.09.006	vision;computer vision;attention;cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition;top-down and bottom-up design	ML	20.499341244708738	-68.23004512609359	109740

Since binary synapses are considered, learning happens through formation and elimination of connections between the inputs and the dendritic branches to modify the structure or morphology of the NNLD. A morphological learning algorithm inspired by the tempotron, i.e., a recently proposed temporal learning algorithm is presented in this brief. Unlike tempotron, the proposed learning rule uses a technique to automatically adapt the NNLD threshold during training. Experimental results indicate that our NNLD with 1-bit synapses can obtain accuracy similar to that of a traditional tempotron with 4-bit synapses in classifying single spike random latency and pairwise synchrony patterns. Hence, the proposed method is better suited for robust hardware implementation in the presence of statistical variations. We also present results of applying this rule to real-life spike classification problems from the field of tactile sensing.	1-bit architecture;4-bit;acclimatization;algorithm;classification;dendrites;dendritic spine;excretory function;inspiration function;learning rule;mathematical morphology;neuron;nonlinear system;quantization (signal processing);real life;synapse;synapses;tempotron;wdfy2 wt allele;weight	Subhrajit Roy;Phyo Phyo San;Shaista Hussain;Lee Wang Wei;Arindam Basu	2016	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems	10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2447011	computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;mathematics;accuracy and precision;competitive learning;artificial neural network;statistics	ML	19.76442744214265	-66.320673752555	109854

However, the physiologically accurate open on pressure, close on flow valve law is computationally heavy to implement, reducing the model's potential clinical benefit. A significantly simpler representation of the valve law using Heaviside functions is derived and the ventricular interaction equations are reformulated to obtain a unique closed form analytical solution. The new formulation is tested and compared with the previous formulation for a healthy human and four clinically significant disease states: mitral and aortic stenosis, pulmonary embolism and septic shock. The new model formulation matches the previous model definition, differing by a mean model response error of no more than 0.2%. Computationally, it is 24 x faster than the previous method. More specifically, a short 20-beat simulation that took 102 s now requires 4.3 s, significantly improving the model's potential for practical use in a diagnostic and/or decision support role in the intensive care unit.	aortic valve stenosis;cns disorder;concurrent versions system;decision support system;flow valve device component;greater than;mean squared error;nonlinear system;pulmonary embolism;pulmonary stenosis;septic shock;septic equation;simulation;intensive care unit	Christopher E.

fef1c5337add12654454869601ab8d254d970b04	modulation of alpha activity in the parieto-occipital area by distractors during a visuospatial working memory task: a magnetoencephalographic study		Oscillatory brain activity is known to play an essential role in information processing in working memory. Recent studies have indicated that alpha activity (8–13 Hz) in the parieto-occipital area is strongly modulated in working memory tasks. However, the function of alpha activity in working memory is open to several interpretations, such that alpha activity may be a direct neural correlate of information processing in working memory or may reflect disengagement from information processing in other brain areas. To examine the functional contribution of alpha activity to visuospatial working memory, we introduced visuospatial distractors during a delay period and examined neural activity from the whole brain using magnetoencephalography. The strength of event-related alpha activity was estimated using the temporal spectral evolution (TSE) method. The results were as follows: (1) an increase of alpha activity during the delay period as indicated by elevated TSE curves was observed in parieto-occipital sensors in both the working memory task and a control task that did not require working memory; and (2) an increase of alpha activity during the delay period was not observed when distractors were presented, although TSE curves were constructed only from correct trials. These results indicate that the increase of alpha activity is not directly related to information processing in working memory but rather reflects the disengagement of attention from the visuospatial input.	electroencephalography;epilepsy, temporal lobe;hertz (hz);information processing;interpretation process;magnetoencephalography;memory disorders;modulation;neural correlates of consciousness;neural oscillation;spatial–temporal reasoning;sensor (device)	Satoe Ichihara-Takeda;Shogo Yazawa;Takashi Murahara;Takanobu Toyoshima;Jun Shinozaki;Masanori Ishiguro;Hideaki Shiraishi;Nozomu Ikeda;Kiyoji Matsuyama;Shintaro Funahashi;Takashi Nagamine	2015	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00718	psychology;cognitive psychology;developmental psychology;communication	ML	17.04357163711153	-77.5129027658025	110151

Many accounts link MD activity to top-down task control, raising the question of response when performance is limited by the quality of sensory input, and indeed, some prior results suggest little effect of sensory manipulations. Here we examined judgments of motion direction, manipulating difficulty by either motion coherence or salience of irrelevant dots. We manipulated each difficulty type across six levels, from very easy to very hard, and additionally manipulated whether difficulty level was blocked, and thus known in advance, or randomized. Despite the very large manipulations employed, difficulty had little effect on MD activity, especially for the coherence manipulation. Contrasting with these small or absent effects, we observed the usual increase of MD activity with increased rule complexity. We suggest that, for simple sensory discriminations, it may be impossible to compensate for reduced stimulus information by increased top-down control.	judgment;molecular dynamics;multiple personality disorder;randomized algorithm;relevance;sensory neuroscience;top-down and bottom-up design	Tanya Wen;Daniel J.

80e6a2ef4abc69aea18c670e156da4ddf1abffed	the cat's meow: a high-field fmri assessment of cortical activity in response to vocalizations and complex auditory stimuli		Sensory systems are typically constructed in a hierarchical fashion such that lower level subcortical and cortical areas process basic stimulus features, while higher level areas reassemble these features into object-level representations. A number of anatomical pathway tracing studies have suggested that the auditory cortical hierarchy of the cat extends from a core region, consisting of the primary auditory cortex (A1) and the anterior auditory field (AAF), to higher level auditory fields that are located ventrally. Unfortunately, limitations on electrophysiological examination of these higher level fields have resulted in an incomplete understanding of the functional organization of the auditory cortex. Thus, the current study uses functional MRI in conjunction with a variety of simple and complex auditory stimuli to provide the first comprehensive examination of function across the entire cortical hierarchy. Auditory cortex function is shown to be largely lateralized to the left hemisphere, and is concentrated bilaterally in fields surrounding the posterior ectosylvian sulcus. The use of narrowband noise stimuli enables the visualization of tonotopic gradients in the posterior auditory field (PAF) and ventral posterior auditory field (VPAF) that have previously been unverifiable using fMRI and pure tones. Furthermore, auditory fields that are inaccessible to more invasive techniques, such as the insular (IN) and temporal (T) cortices, are shown to be selectively responsive to vocalizations. Collectively, these data provide a much needed functional correlate for anatomical examinations of the hierarchy of cortical structures within the cat auditory cortex.	acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;anti-aliasing filter;auditory perception;auditory perceptual disorders;auditory area;cerebral cortex;concentrate dosage form;gene regulatory network;gradient;groove;imagery;imaging techniques;partial;temporal lobe;fmri	Amee J.

Visual saliency is used as a criterion for selecting the local regions from where HoG features are extracted. Experimental results show that such saliency-based masking significantly affects the classification performance: contrary to the previous reports in the field of object recognition, the low-salient regions contribute more than the high-salient regions in scene classification, and that is consistent with several previous reports of insisting the importance of spatial layout in the low frequency channel, which support the scene schema hypothesis. Also, the result implies that the highest salient regions, which occupies top 20 percent in saliency, hardly contribute to classification performance.	channel (communications);computer performance;feature selection;outline of object recognition;spatial scale;statistical classification	Tae-Suh Park;Byoung-Tak Zhang	2012			cognitive psychology;psychology;salience (neuroscience);masking (art)	Vision	16.89915158111027	-74.79678212513167	110697

(plasticité corticale, champs neuronaux dynamiques et auto-organisation)		The aim of the present work is the modeling of the formation, maintenance and reorganization of somatosensory cortical maps using the theory of dynamic neural fields. A dynamic neural field is a partial integro-differential equation that is used to model the cortical activity of a part of the cortex. Such a neural field is used in this work in order to model a part of the area 3b of the primary somatosensory cortex. In addition a skin model is used in order to provide input to the cortical model. From a computational point of view the model is able to perform distributed, numerical and adaptive computations. The model is able to explain the formation of topographic maps and their reorganization in the presence of a cortical lesion or a sensory deprivation, where balance between excitation and inhibition plays a crucial role. In addition, the model is consistent with neurophysiological data of area 3b. Finally, it has been shown that attention plays a key role in the organization of receptive fields of neurons of the somatosensory cortex. Therefore, in this work has been proposed a definition of somatosensory attention and a potential explanation of its influence on somatotopic organization through a number of experimental results. By changing the gains of lateral connections, it is possible to control the shape of the solution of the neural field. This leads to significant alterations of receptive fields sizes, resulting to a better performance during the execution of demanding haptic tasks.	computation;haptic technology;lateral computing;lateral thinking;map;numerical analysis;self-organization;spherical basis;topography	Georgios Detorakis	2013				ML	19.038747257445753	-75.38589957991137	110860

Specifically, we consider neural field models of cortical activity as generative models in the context of dynamic causal modeling (DCM). This paper considers the simplest case of a single cortical source modeled by the spatiotemporal dynamics of hidden neuronal states on a bounded cortical surface or manifold. We build this model using multiple layers, corresponding to cortical lamina in the real cortical manifold. These layers correspond to the populations considered in classical (Jansen and Rit) neural mass models. This allows us to formulate a neural field model that can be reduced to a neural mass model using appropriate constraints on its spatial parameters. In turn, this enables one to compare and contrast the predicted responses from equivalent neural field and mass models respectively. We pursue this using empirical LFP data from a single electrode to show that the parameters controlling the spatial dynamics of cortical activity can be recovered, using DCM, even in the absence of explicit spatial information in observed data.	a(2)c;appendix;bayesian approaches to brain function;causal filter;cortical implant;dicom;electroencephalography;equivalent weight;final fantasy xi;generative model;inference;international conference on functional programming;irido-corneo-trabecular dysgenesis (disorder);jean;kalman filter;lateral computing;lateral thinking;magnetoencephalography;population;sensor;synaptic package manager;transfer function;treponema sp. iv:17d:d31;word lists by frequency;anatomical layer;electrode;manifold	Dimitris A.

Studies have shown that VP movements possess properties, such as smooth curvature around the VP, that are not explicable by treating VP movements as strict concatenations of simpler point-to-point (PTP) movements. Such properties have led some theorists to propose whole-trajectory optimization models, which imply that the entire trajectory is precomputed before movement initiation. This paper reports new experiments conducted to systematically compare VP with PTP trajectories. Analyses revealed a statistically significant early directional deviation in VP movements but no associated curvature change. An explanation of this effect is offered by extending the vector-integration-to-endpoint (VITE) model (Bullock, D., & Grossberg, S. (1988a).

Singapore: World Scientific Publishers.), which postulates that voluntary movement trajectories emerge as internal gating signals control the integration of continuously computed vector commands based on the evolving, perceptible difference between desired and actual position variables. The model explains the observed trajectories of VP and PTP movements as emergent properties of a dynamical system that does not precompute entire trajectories before movement initiation. The new model includes a working memory and a stage sensitive to time-to-contact information. These cooperate to control serial performance. The structural and functional relationships proposed in the model are consistent with available data on forebrain physiology and anatomy.	anatomic structures;articulators;cdisc adas-cog - commands summary score;chorea;cognitive function: initiation;communication endpoint;complex systems;concatenation;dna integration;dynamical system;emergent;experiment;fibre channel point-to-point;forty nine;j. a. scott kelso;mathematical optimization;memory disorders;movement;point-to-point (telecommunications);precomputation;prosencephalon;protocol treatment arm;trajectory optimization;vp/css;vitamin e assay;physiological aspects	Daniel Bullock;Raoul M.

We show that an agent equipped with such a memory structure can autonomously learn the situation and can later use its memory to accomplish homing behaviour. The architecture is based on neuronal structures and grows in a self-organized way depending on experience. The basic architecture consists of three parts, (i) a pre-processor, (ii) a simple, one-layered feed-forward network, called distributor net, and (iii) a full recurrently connected net for representing the situation models to be stored. Apart from Hebbian learning and a local version of the delta-rule, explorative learning is applied that is not based on passive detection of correlations, but is actively searching for interesting hypotheses. Hypotheses are spontaneously introduced and are verified or falsified depending on how well the network representing the hypothesis approaches an internal error of zero. The stability of this approach is successfully tested by removal of one landmark or shifting the position of one or several landmarks showing results comparable to those found in biological experiments. Furthermore, we applied noise in two ways. The trained network was either due to sensory noise or to noise applied to the bias weights describing the memory content. Finally, we tested to what extent learning of the weights is affected by noisy input given to the sensor data. The architecture proposed is discussed to have some at least superficial similarity to the mushroom bodies of insects.	arabic numeral 0;delta aminolevulinate:srat:24h:urine:qn;delta rule;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;experiment;feedforward neural network;hebbian theory;hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, type 1;memory disorders;missile guidance;mushroom poisoning;navigation;self-organization;the superficial;weight;anatomical layer	Holk Cruse;David Hübner	2008	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-008-0256-7	computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;recurrent neural network;machine learning;leabra;competitive learning;communication	ML	18.715890034678747	-66.46430834200233	111255
b9b4e290521132f8271ce36264fc3165dcc90bb6	learning the morphology of brain signals using alpha-stable convolutional sparse coding		Neural time-series data contain a wide variety of prototypical signal waveforms (atoms) that are of significant importance in clinical and cognitive research. One of the goals for analyzing such data is hence to extract such ‘shift-invariant’ atoms. Even though some success has been reported with existing algorithms, they are limited in applicability due to their heuristic nature. Moreover, they are often vulnerable to artifacts and impulsive noise, which are typically present in raw neural recordings. In this study, we address these issues and propose a novel probabilistic convolutional sparse coding (CSC) model for learning shift-invariant atoms from raw neural signals containing potentially severe artifacts. In the core of our model, which we call αCSC, lies a family of heavy-tailed distributions called α-stable distributions. We develop a novel, computationally efficient Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm for inference. The maximization step boils down to a weighted CSC problem, for which we develop a computationally efficient optimization algorithm. Our results show that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art convergence speeds. Besides, αCSC is significantly more robust to artifacts when compared to three competing algorithms: it can extract spike bursts, oscillations, and even reveal more subtle phenomena such as cross-frequency coupling when applied to noisy neural time series.	algorithmic efficiency;computational complexity theory;expectation–maximization algorithm;galaxy morphological classification;heuristic;least fixed point;mathematical morphology;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;neural coding;neural oscillation;newton;quasi-newton method;sparse matrix;time series;vergence	Mainak Jas;Tom Dupré la Tour;Umut Simsekli;Alexandre Gramfort	2017			computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning;statistics	ML	24.246411963360085	-73.73249629961522	111295

By extrinsically manipulating the phase of alpha before stimulus presentation, we provide direct evidence that the neural circuitry in the parietal cortex involved with generating alpha oscillations plays a causal role in determining whether or not a visual stimulus is successfully perceived.	area striata structure;artificial neural network;causal filter;causality;cerebral cortex;electroencephalography;electronic circuit;hertz (hz);kohn–sham equations;modulation;movement disorders, rhythmic nocturnal;transcranial magnetic stimulation;vision;waveform;recurrent childhood visual pathway glioma	Andrew Jaegle;Tony Ro	2014	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00494	psychology;cognitive psychology;developmental psychology;posterior parietal cortex;communication	HCI	16.885254141430398	-77.20501723540691	111907

The current work, inspired by a similar fMRI design (Detre et al., in press), used a modified Think/No-Think(TNT) paradigm to investigate the neural signatures of volition over enhancing and suppressing memory retrieval. Previous studies have shown memory enhancement when well-learned stimulus pairs are restudied in cued recall (""""Recall or think of studied pair item""""), and degradation when restudied with cued suppression (""""Avoid thinking of studied pair item""""). We used category-based (faces vs. scenes) multivariate classification of electroencephalography signals to determine if individual target items were successfully retrieved or suppressed. A logistic regression based on classifier output determined that retrieval activation during the cued recall/suppression period was a predictor for subsequent memory. Labeling trials with this internal measure, as opposed to their nominal Think vs. No-Think condition, revealed the classic TNT pattern of enhanced memory for successful cued-retrieval and degraded memory for cued-suppression. This classification process enabled a more selective investigation into the time-frequency signatures of control over retrieval. Comparing controlled retrieval vs. controlled suppression, results showed more prominent Theta oscillations (3 to 8 Hz) in controlled retrieval. Beta oscillations (12 to 30 Hz) were involved in high levels of both controlled retrieval and suppression, suggesting it may have a more general control-related role. These results suggest unique roles for these frequency bands in retrieval processes."""	antivirus software;bands;classification;electroencephalography;electronic signature;elegant degradation;face;frequency band;hertz (hz);inspiration function;interference (communication);kerrison predictor;logistic regression;neural oscillation;programming paradigm;type signature;volition;zero suppression;fmri;oscillations	Nicholas Ketz;Randall C.

cfe0c08a7bfd88c5fefc1b52ff26eee9147c39fa	cortical control of normal gait and precision stepping: an fnirs study	article letter to editor	Recently, real time imaging of the cortical control of gait became possible with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). So far, little is known about the activations of various cortical areas in more complex forms of gait, such as precision stepping. From previous work on animals and humans one would expect precision stepping to elicit extra activity in the sensorimotor cortices (S1/M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), as well as in prefrontal cortices (PFC). In the current study, hemodynamic changes in the PFC, SMA, M1, and S1 were measured with fNIRS. In contrast to previous fNIRS gait studies, the technique was optimized by the use of reference channels (to correct for superficial hemodynamic interference). Eleven subjects randomly performed ten trials of treadmill walking at 3 km/h (normal walking) and ten trials of 3 km/h treadmill walking on predefined spots for the left and right foot presented on the treadmill (precision stepping). The walking trials of approximately 35 seconds were alternated with rest periods of 25-35 seconds consisting of quiet standing. The PFC revealed profound activation just prior to the onset of both walking tasks. There was also extra activation of the PFC during the first half of the task period for precision stepping. The SMA showed mainly increased activation prior to the start of both tasks. In contrast, the sensorimotor cortex did not show a change in activation during either task as compared to a condition of standing. The SMA, M1, and S1 revealed no significant differences between normal walking and precision stepping. It was concluded that fNIRS is suited to record the planning and initiation of gait. The lack of M1/S1 activation during gait suggests that even in the current precision stepping task the control of ongoing gait depended mostly on subcortical automatisms, while motor cortex contributions did not differ between standing and walking.	cfp gene;cfp wt allele;cerebral cortex;exanthema;interference (communication);kilometer per hour;motor cortex;onset (audio);powerbuilder foundation classes;randomness;sensorimotor cortex;spectroscopy, near-infrared;stepping level;the superficial;treadmill, device;hemodynamics (procedure);mesial premotor cortex	Koen L.

The cortical structures that implement the visual system have been successfully emulated in several biologically-inspired synthetic vision systems. Developmental evidence lends credence to the claim that visual cortical structures emerge during development, i.e. they self-organize, when exposed to training stimulus. This paper demonstrates that a set of simple developmental rules can govern the emergence of a self-learning variant of a map-seeking circuit (SL-MSC) in a simulated visual system. The SL-MSC is capable of the same visual tasks as the original hand-crafted MSC: object recognition independent of rotation, translation, and scaling, and the ability to identify and learn new objects. The SL-MSC learns invariant visual transformations by relying on temporal association in its visual field, and is able to group the transformations into independent layers. Experimental results show that the SL-MSC can generalize the rotation, translation, and scaling transformations learned for one object to new objects, leading to learning and recognition of new objects with very few training samples.	algorithm;cognitive map;computer hardware;emergence;emulator;hebbian theory;human visual system model;image scaling;linear algebra;outline of object recognition;sl (complexity);self-organization;synthetic vision system	Rohit Shukla;Mikko H.

In the rat, pharmacoresistant epilepsy can be mimicked by inducing status epilepticus by intraperitoneal injection of kainate, which leads to development of spontaneous seizures after 3 weeks to 3 months. The aim of this study was to investigate potential changes in P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and functionality at an early stage after induction of status epilepticus by kainate.   METHODS (R)-[11C]verapamil, which is currently the most frequently used positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for determining P-gp functionality at the blood-brain barrier, was used in kainate and saline (control) treated rats, at 7 days after treatment. To investigate the effect of P-gp on (R)-[11C]verapamil brain distribution, both groups were studied without or with co-administration of the P-gp inhibitor tariquidar. P-gp expression was determined using immunohistochemistry in post mortem brains. (R)-[11C]verapamil kinetics were analyzed with approaches common in PET research (Logan analysis, and compartmental modelling of individual profiles) as well as by population mixed effects modelling (NONMEM).   RESULTS All data analysis approaches indicated only modest differences in brain distribution of (R)-[11C]verapamil between saline and kainate treated rats, while tariquidar treatment in both groups resulted in a more than 10-fold increase. NONMEM provided most precise parameter estimates. P-gp expression was found to be similar for kainate and saline treated rats.   CONCLUSIONS P-gp expression and functionality does not seem to change at early stage after induction of anticipated pharmacoresistant epilepsy by kainate.	blood - brain barrier anatomy;cns disorder;ct scan;epilepsy;estimated;injections, intraperitoneal;kainate;kinetics (discipline);kinetics internet protocol;ligands;limited stage (cancer stage);mathematical induction;membrane transport proteins;multi-compartment model;myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile;p-glycoprotein;p-glycoproteins;polyethylene terephthalate;population parameter;positron-emission tomography;positrons;salineos;seizures;spontaneous order;status epilepticus;tariquidar	Stina Syvänen;Gert Luurtsema;Carla F.

Pattern masks with different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) reduced the visibility in three steps. We took EEG recordings to measure neural correlates of Stroop interference and their relation to stimulus visibility. The analysis of event-related potentials indicated that N400 differences between congruent and incongruent trials varied with the degree of visibility, leaving no differences with stimuli near identification threshold. An equivalent current dipole model (ECD) was used to map source activity onto regions known to reflect interference-related activity. As expected, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) signaled the biggest differences between congruent and incongruent trials. As with event-related potentials, these differences disappeared with reduced stimulus visibility. In addition to equivalent current dipole modeling, Stroop-related neural sources were confirmed by means of current density reconstruction (SWARM) based on individualized boundary element models (BEMs) and a cortical constraint.	blinded;boundary element method;catastrophic interference;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;common variable immunodeficiency;consciousness;departure - action;electroencephalography;explanatory combinatorial dictionary;interference (communication);masks;onset (audio)	Maximilian Bruchmann;Kristin Herper;Carsten Konrad;Christo Pantev;René J.

ea2458692ea3c45c84405ab4606b0781807add83	aberrant functional connectivity in patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome: a resting-state functional mri study		The objective of this study was to investigate the change in the default mode network (DMN) in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) using resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were collected from twenty-nine subjects with OSAHS and twenty-six normal controls. The data were analyzed with the rsFC method and were compared between OSAHS subjects and controls. The Z-values of abnormal rsFC in different brain regions were correlated with clinical variables, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), Rey-osterrieth complex figure test (CFT-immediately), CFT-delay, Logical memory test-immediately (LMT-immediately), LMT-delay and Minimum mental state examination (MMSE). The rsFC showed significant increases in the left temporal cortex, right midfrontal cortex, and left precuneus cortex as well as decreases in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL), left medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), left superior frontal cortex and right cerebellum in patients with OSAHS. The FC strength in the left precuneus showed a remarkable positive correlation with ODI(p = .032, r = .399)and CFT-delay scores (p = .043, r = .378). We found that the FC strength in the right cerebellum was positively correlated with the CFT-delay scores (p = .017, r = .441). FC strength in the right cerebellum and left IPL demonstrated a remarkable positive correlation with LMT-delay scores (p = .037,r = .389;p = .043 and r = .379, respectively). However, there was a strong negative correlation between the left MPFC region and ESS scores (p = .032, r = −.398). The abnormal rsFC in subjects with OSAHS indicated the compensatory change of brain function, which possibly provides an innovative approach and perspective on understanding the neural mechanism alteration of OSAHS-related cognition.	bilateral filter;cognition;decision model and notation;discrete wavelet transform;displacement mapping;image processing;index (publishing);inverted index;logistic model tree;medial graph;memory tester;mental state;resonance;resting state fmri;sleep mode	Yu-Ting Liu;Hui-Jun Li;Ting Chen;Ya-Qing Huang;Lian Zhang;Hui-Xin Zhang;Zhi-Chun Huang;Bin Liu;Ming Yang	2017	Multimedia Tools and Applications	10.1007/s11042-017-4670-5	obstructive sleep apnea;resting state fmri;computer science;artificial intelligence;hypopnea;inferior parietal lobule;pattern recognition;epworth sleepiness scale;default mode network;prefrontal cortex;internal medicine;functional magnetic resonance imaging;cardiology	ML	19.60167104400076	-79.79270890458565	112474
36b80e1e9f4da8e5831f55aa3b8b42509702d8b4	from warning to wallpaper: why the brain habituates to security warnings and what can be done about it		Warning messages are fundamental to users’ security interactions. Unfortunately, research has shown that they are largely ineffective. A key contributor to this failure is habituation: decreased response to a repeated warning. Previous research has inferred the occurrence of habituation to warnings or measured it indirectly, such as through the proxy of a related behavior. Therefore, there is a gap in our understanding of how habituation to security warnings develops in the brain. Without direct measures of habituation, we are limited in designing warnings that can mitigate its effects. In this study, we use neurophysiological measures to directly observe habituation as it occurs in the brain and behaviorally. We also design a polymorphic warning artifact that repeatedly changes its appearance in order to resist the effects of habituation. In an experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 25), we found that our polymorphic warning was significantly more resistant to habituation than were conventional warnings in regions of the brain related to attention. In a second experiment (n = 80), we implemented the top four most resistant polymorphic warnings in a realistic setting. Using mouse cursor tracking as a surrogate for attention to unobtrusively measure habituation on participants’ personal computers, we found that polymorphic warnings reduced habituation compared to conventional warnings. Together, our findings reveal the substantial influence of neurobiology on users’ habituation to security warnings and security behavior in general, and we offer our polymorphic warning design as an effective solution to practice.	cursor (databases);interaction;personal computer;pointer (user interface);proxy server;resonance	Bonnie Brinton Anderson;Anthony Vance;C.

8f8338a82fded0e8bad373db35225a311b73a340	s-cone visual stimuli activate superior colliculus neurons in old world monkeys: implications for understanding blindsight		The superior colliculus (SC) is thought to be unresponsive to stimuli that activate only short wavelength-sensitive cones (S-cones) in the retina. The apparent lack of S-cone input to the SC was recognized by Sumner et al. [Sumner, P., Adamjee, T., & Mollon, J. D. Signals invisible to the collicular and magnocellular pathways can capture visual attention. Current Biology, 12, 1312–1316, 2002] as an opportunity to test SC function. The idea is that visual behavior dependent on the SC should be impaired when S-cone stimuli are used because they are invisible to the SC. The SC plays a critical role in blindsight. If the SC is insensitive to S-cone stimuli blindsight behavior should be impaired when S-cone stimuli are used. Many clinical and behavioral studies have been based on the assumption that S-cone-specific stimuli do not activate neurons in the SC. Our goal was to test whether single neurons in macaque SC respond to stimuli that activate only S-cones. Stimuli were calibrated psychophysically in each animal and at each individual spatial location used in experimental testing [Hall, N. J., & Colby, C. L. Psychophysical definition of S-cone stimuli in the macaque. Journal of Vision, 13, 2013]. We recorded from 178 visually responsive neurons in two awake, behaving rhesus monkeys. Contrary to the prevailing view, we found that nearly all visual SC neurons can be activated by S-cone-specific visual stimuli. Most of these neurons were sensitive to the degree of S-cone contrast. Of 178 visual SC neurons, 155 (87%) had stronger responses to a high than to a low S-cone contrast. Many of these neurons' responses (56/178 or 31%) significantly distinguished between the high and low S-cone contrast stimuli. The latency and amplitude of responses depended on S-cone contrast. These findings indicate that stimuli that activate only S-cones cannot be used to diagnose collicular mediation.	activation action;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;blindsight;cone (formal languages);corpora quadrigemina, superior colliculus;macaca mulatta;monkeys;neuron;rem sleep behavior disorder;recession cone;retina;retinal cone;retinitis pigmentosa	Nathan Hall;Carol L.

This abstract, notation-independent appreciation of numbers develops gradually over the first several years of life. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examine the brain mechanisms that 6- and 7-year-old children and adults recruit to solve numerical comparisons across different notation systems. The data reveal that when young children compare numerical values in symbolic and nonsymbolic notations, they invoke the same network of brain regions as adults including occipito-temporal and parietal cortex. However, children also recruit inferior frontal cortex during these numerical tasks to a much greater degree than adults. Our data lend additional support to an emerging consensus from adult neuroimaging, nonhuman primate neurophysiology, and computational modeling studies that a core neural system integrates notation-independent numerical representations throughout development but, early in development, higher-order brain mechanisms mediate this process.	entity;epilepsy, temporal lobe;neuroimaging;numerical analysis;parietal lobe;primates;resonance;science of neurophysiology;frontal lobe;notation	Jessica F.

Background Memory of the recently passed roadway can be inferred from feedback control models of the participants' manual movement patterns. Similarly, attention to preview of the upcoming roadway can be inferred from feedforward control models of manual movement patterns. Method Perturbation techniques were used to measure these memory and attention functions. Results In a laboratory tracking task, the bandwidth of lateral roadway deviations was found to primarily influence memory for the past roadway rather than attention to preview. A secondary auditory/verbal/vocal memory task resulted in higher velocity error and acceleration error in the tracking task but did not affect attention to preview. Attention to preview was affected by the frequency pattern of sinusoidal perturbations of the roadway. Conclusion Perturbation techniques permit measurement of the spatio-temporal span of memory and attention to preview that affect tracking a winding roadway. They also provide new ways to explore goal-directed forgetting and spatially distributed attention in the context of movement. More generally, these techniques provide sensitive measures of individual differences in cognitive aspects of action. Application Models of driving behavior and assessment of driving skill may benefit from more detailed spatio-temporal measurement of attention to preview.		Richard J. Jagacinski;Gordon M.

Recent studies in animals suggest a similar functional role for very high frequency oscillations (VHFO) in the range 80-200 Hz. Since some intracerebral studies in humans link VHFO to epileptogenesis, it remains unclear if VHFO appear in the healthy human brain and if so which is their role. This study uses EEG recordings from twelve healthy volunteers, engaged in a visuo-motor reaction time task, to show that VHFO are not necessarily pathological but rather code information about upcoming movements. Oscillations within the range (30-200 Hz) occurring in the period between stimuli presentation and the fastest hand responses allow highly accurate (>96%) prediction of the laterality of the responding hand in single trials. Our results suggest that VHFO belong in functional terms to the gamma band that must be considerably enlarged to better understand the role of oscillatory activity in brain functioning. This study has therefore important implications for the recording and analysis of electrophysiological data in normal subjects and patients.	eighty;electroencephalography;enlargement procedure;fastest;gamma correction;handedness;hertz (hz);intention - mental process;kerrison predictor;motor neuron disease;movement;neural coding;patients	Sara L.

However, suitable computational network analysis tools are still lacking in human connectome research. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-graph min-max cut model to detect the consistent network modules from the brain connectivity networks of all studied subjects. A new multi-graph MinMax cut model is introduced to solve this challenging computational neuroscience problem and the efficient optimization algorithm is derived. In the identified connectome module patterns, each network module shows similar connectivity patterns in all subjects, which potentially associate to specific brain functions shared by all subjects. We validate our method by analyzing the weighted fiber connectivity networks. The promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In particular, in the presence of baseline firing, the reconstruction error rapidly increases with D in the case of Poissonian noise but not for additive noise. The existence of limited-range correlations of the type found in cortical tissue yields a saturation of the Fisher information content as a function of the population size only for an additive noise model. We also show that random variability in the correlation coefficient within a neural population, as found empirically, considerably improves the average encoding quality. Finally, the representational accuracy of populations with inhomogeneous tuning properties, either with variability in the tuning widths or fragmented into specialized subpopulations, is superior to the case of identical and radially symmetric tuning curves usually considered in the literature.	additive white gaussian noise;baseline (configuration management);coefficient;fisher information;heart rate variability;neural ensemble;population;representation (action);self-information;spatial variability;utility functions on indivisible goods	Stefan D.

5aae098616f2a88794b40626206c9a318ff2d4a9	a hybrid multishape learning framework for longitudinal prediction of cortical surfaces and fiber tracts using neonatal data		Dramatic changes of the human brain during the first year of postnatal development are poorly understood due to their multifold complexity. In this paper, we present the first attempt to jointly predict, using neonatal data, the dynamic growth pattern of brain cortical surfaces (collection of 3D triangular faces) and fiber tracts (collection of 3D lines). These two entities are modeled jointly as a multishape (a set of interlinked shapes). We propose a hybrid learning-based multishape prediction framework that captures both the diffeomorphic evolution of the cortical surfaces and the non-diffeomorphic growth of fiber tracts. In particular, we learn a set of geometric and dynamic cortical features and fiber connectivity features that characterize the relationships between cortical surfaces and fibers at different timepoints (0, 3, 6, and 9 months of age). Given a new neonatal multishape at 0 month of age, we hierarchically predict, at 3, 6 and 9 months, the postnatal cortical surfaces vertex-by-vertex along with fibers connected to adjacent faces to these vertices. This is achieved using a new fiber-to-face metric that quantifies the similarity between multishapes. For validation, we propose several evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the performance of our framework. The results confirm that our framework yields good prediction accuracy of complex neonatal multishape development within a few seconds.

a2ee3f0b03439f6f91f0268a9b6101851aee095b	the new graph kernels on connectivity networks for identification of mci		Brain connectivity networks have been applied recently to brain disease diagnosis and classification. Especially for both functional and structural connectivity interaction, graph theoretical analysis provided a new measure for human brain organization in vivo, with one fundamental challenge that is how to define the similarity between a pair of graphs. As one kind of similarity measure for graphs, graph kernels have been widely studied and applied in the literature. However, few works exploit to construct graph kernels for brain connectivity networks, where each node corresponds a unique EEG electrode or regions of interest(ROI). Accordingly, in this paper, we construct a new graph kernel for brain connectivity networks, which takes into account the inherent characteristic of nodes and captures the local topological properties of brain connectivity networks. To validate our method, we have performed extensive evaluation on a real mild cognitive impairment (MCI) dataset with the baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from Alzheimers disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

6c7c6258185ae7f973379876b3715065cc92275b	sensitivity and specificity considerations for fmri encoding, decoding, and mapping of auditory cortex at ultra-high field	ultra high field fmri;sensitivity;human auditory cortex;specificity	Abstract Following rapid technological advances, ultra-high field functional MRI (fMRI) enables exploring correlates of neuronal population activity at an increasing spatial resolution. However, as the fMRI blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast is a vascular signal, the spatial specificity of fMRI data is ultimately determined by the characteristics of the underlying vasculature. At 7 T, fMRI measurement parameters determine the relative contribution of the macro- and microvasculature to the acquired signal. Here we investigate how these parameters affect relevant high-end fMRI analyses such as encoding, decoding, and submillimeter mapping of voxel preferences in the human auditory cortex. Specifically, we compare a T 2 * weighted fMRI dataset, obtained with 2D gradient echo (GE) EPI, to a predominantly T 2 weighted dataset obtained with 3D GRASE. We first investigated the decoding accuracy based on two encoding models that represented different hypotheses about auditory cortical processing. This encoding/decoding analysis profited from the large spatial coverage and sensitivity of the T 2 * weighted acquisitions, as evidenced by a significantly higher prediction accuracy in the GE-EPI dataset compared to the 3D GRASE dataset for both encoding models. The main disadvantage of the T 2 * weighted GE-EPI dataset for encoding/decoding analyses was that the prediction accuracy exhibited cortical depth dependent vascular biases. However, we propose that the comparison of prediction accuracy across the different encoding models may be used as a post processing technique to salvage the spatial interpretability of the GE-EPI cortical depth-dependent prediction accuracy. Second, we explored the mapping of voxel preferences. Large-scale maps of frequency preference (i.e., tonotopy) were similar across datasets, yet the GE-EPI dataset was preferable due to its larger spatial coverage and sensitivity. However, submillimeter tonotopy maps revealed biases in assigned frequency preference and selectivity for the GE-EPI dataset, but not for the 3D GRASE dataset. Thus, a T 2 weighted acquisition is recommended if high specificity in tonotopic maps is required. In conclusion, different fMRI acquisitions were better suited for different analyses. It is therefore critical that any sequence parameter optimization considers the eventual intended fMRI analyses and the nature of the neuroscience questions being asked.	auditory area;blood supply aspects;casio exilim;cell respiration;cerebral cortex;data recovery;echo-planar imaging;endoscopic retrograde cholangiography;epi info;experiment;gradient;large;manuscripts;map;mathematical optimization;neural ensemble;neuroscience discipline;personnameuse - assigned;population parameter;processing (action);selectivity (electronic);sensitivity and specificity;silo (dataset);voxel;fmri	Michelle Moerel;Federico De Martino;Valentin G.

We discuss the basis of reverse correlation in linear transducers and in spiking neurons. The application of reverse correlation to measure the receptive fields of visual neurons using white noise and m-sequences, and classical findings about spatial and color processing in the cortex resulting from such measurements, are emphasized. Finally, we describe new developments in reverse correlation, including “sub-space” and categorical reverse-correlation. Recent results obtained by applying such methods in the orientation, spatial-frequency and Fourier domains have revealed the importance of cortical inhibition in the establishment of sharp tuning selectivity in single neurons. © 2004 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

To date, the gradients of dopamine D2/3 receptor binding in the human striatum have not been measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Seven healthy male subjects aged 24.5 ± 3.5 years were scanned with brain-dedicated high-resolution research tomography (HRRT, Siemens Medical Solutions, Knoxville, TN, USA) and [(11)C]raclopride. Coronally defined regions of interest (ROIs) of the caudate nucleus, putamen and ventral striatum (VST) were sampled plane-by-plane, 1.5mm apart, on spatially normalized binding potential (BPND) images. Regional [(11)C]raclopride BPND values were calculated using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) from a total of 25 coronal planes. An increasing rostrocaudal gradient of the D2/3 receptor binding was detected in the putamen, which is consistent with the known distribution of D2/3 dopamine receptors. In the caudate nucleus, there was an initial increase in the BPND values in the most anterior planes, suggesting that the highest D2/3 receptor binding occurred in the head; however, there was an overall descending gradient. A declining trend was also observed in the VST. The novelty of this study lies in the presentation, for the first time, of the D2/3 receptor binding gradients in each striatal subregion in the brains of living healthy humans. The high spatial resolution provided by HRRT enables frequent sampling of BPND along the longitudinal extent of striatum; this method is superior to the sectioning used in previous post mortem studies. Regarding the functional organization of the striatum, our findings can inform future investigations of normal neurophysiology as well as efforts to differentiate neuropsychiatric disorders affecting the brain dopamine (DA) system. Furthermore, the average distribution of D2/3 receptor binding revealed in this study could serve as a basis for a database that includes distributions of various DA markers as a function of healthy aging.	apache axis;axis vertebra;brain;ct scan;caudate nucleus structure;cell nucleus;dopamine receptor;futures studies;gradient;healthy aging;image resolution;neostriatum;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;positrons;region of interest;snap25 wt allele;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;scanning;scanning systems;science of neurophysiology;sectioning technique;shuttle radar topography mission;structure of putamen;twisted nematic field effect;units of measure - siemens;ventral striatum;nervous system disorder	Kati Alakurtti;Jarkko Johansson;Terhi Tuokkola;Kjell Någren;Juha O.

This is particularly apparent in the inference of object motion, where psychophysical experiments have shown that integration of motion signals, distributed across space, must also be integrated with form cues. This has led several to conclude that there exist mechanisms which enable form cues to 'veto' or completely suppress ambiguous motion signals. We describe a probabilistic approach which uses a generative network model for integrating form and motion cues using the machinery of belief propagation and Bayesian inference. We show, using computer simulations, that motion integration can be mediated via a local, probabilistic representation of contour ownership, which we have previously termed 'direction of figure'. The uncertainty of this inferred form cue is used to modulate the covariance matrix of network nodes representing local motion estimates in the motion stream. We show with results for two sets of stimuli that the model does not completely suppress ambiguous cues, but instead integrates them in a way that is a function of their underlying uncertainty. The result is that the model can account for the continuum of bias seen for motion coherence and perceived object motion in psychophysical experiments.	ambiguous grammar;apache continuum;belief propagation;cerebral cortex;computer simulation;dna integration;estimated;existential quantification;experiment;generative model;inference;network model;software propagation	Paul Sajda;Kyungim Baek	2004	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2004.03.013	computer simulation;computer vision;covariance matrix;structure from motion;systems modeling;edge detection;visual system;motion perception;computer science;network model;machine learning;motion estimation;mathematics;generative model;bayesian inference;artificial neural network;belief propagation	ML	22.604109658291097	-68.83757661302293	113497

Simulated BOLD responses are compared to experimental BOLD signals observed in the rat barrel cortex and in the hippocampus under seizure conditions showing good agreement. Bursting phenomena provides relatively clear BOLD signals as long as the time between bursts is not too short. For short burst periods the BOLD signal remains constant even though the neuron is in a predominantly bursting mode. Simulation of CSD exhibits large negative BOLD signals. Visco-elastic effects of the capillary bed do not seem to have a large effect on the BOLD signal even for relatively high values of oxygen consumption. While the results of the model suggests that potassium ions released during neural activity could act as the main mediator in NVC, it suggests the possibility of other mechanisms that can coexist and increase blood flow such as the arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) pathway. The comparison with experimental cerebral blood flow (CBF) data indicates the possible existence of multiple neural pathways influencing the vascular response. Initial negative BOLD signals occur for all simulations due to the rate at which the metabolic oxygen consumption occurs relative to the dilation of the perfusing cerebro-vasculature. However it is unclear as to whether these are normally seen clinically due to the size of the magnetic field. Experimental comparisons for different animal experiments may very well require variation in the model parameters. The complex integrated model is believed to be the first of its kind to simulate both NVC and the resulting BOLD signal.	arm cortex-m;arachidonic acid;blood supply aspects;cambridge structural database;capillary beds;cerebrovascular circulation;coexist (image);cortical spreading depression;dilation (morphology);epoxyeicosatrienoic acid;exhibits as topic;experiment;gene regulatory network;ions;magnetic fields;mediator brand of benfluorex hydrochloride;metabolic process, cellular;neural pathways;neuron;neurovascular coupling;oxygen consumption;pathological dilatation;potassium ion;sa node cell to atrial cardiac muscle cell communication by electrical coupling;seizures;simulation;fmri	Elshin J.

The present P300 event-related potential study (N=20) investigated whether this enhancement depends on the process of actively synchronizing one's motor output with the acoustic input or whether a passive state of auditory-motor synchrony elicits the same effect. Participants silently counted frequency deviants in sequences of pure tones either during a physically inactive control condition or while pedaling on a cycling ergometer. Tones were presented either at fixed or variable intervals. In addition to the pedaling conditions with fixed or variable stimulation, there was a third condition in which stimuli were adaptively presented in sync with the participants' spontaneous pedaling. We replicated the P300 enhancement for fixed versus variable stimulation and the amplification of this effect by AMS. Synchronization performance correlated positively with P300 amplitude in the fixed stimulation condition. Most interestingly, P300 amplitude was significantly reduced for the passive synchronization condition by adaptive stimulus presentation as compared to the fixed stimulation condition. For the first time we thus provide evidence that it is not the passive state of (even perfect) auditory-motor synchrony that facilitates attention allocation during AMS but rather the active process of synchronizing one's movements with external stimuli.	ablepharon-macrostomia syndrome;acoustic cryptanalysis;allocation;auditory perceptual disorders;color cycling;etoposide;expectation propagation;fill;movement;physical inactivity;physical activity;region of interest;region of interest:presence or identity:point in time:*:nominal;relevance;spontaneous order;tellurium;test engineer;topography;vhdl-ams;verilog-ams;virtual synchrony;xfig;electrode	Nadine Conradi;Cornelius Abel;Stefan Frisch;Christian Alexander Kell;Jochen Kaiser;Maren Schmidt-Kassow	2016	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.06.033	psychology;real-time computing;control theory;communication	HCI	15.491975585641729	-78.20183908162709	113951

We propose that balanced recurrence can be achieved by tuning networks near their critical branching (CB) points when spike propagation is formalized as a branching process. We consider critical branching networks as foundations for artificial general intelligence when they are analyzed as reservoir computing models. Our reservoir models are based on principles of metastability and criticality that were developed in statistical mechanics in order to account for long-range correlations in activities exhibited by many types of complex systems. We discuss reservoir models and their computational properties, and we demonstrate their versatility by reviewing a number of applications.	artificial general intelligence;complex systems;computation;recurrent neural network;reservoir computing;self-organized criticality;software propagation	Janelle Szary;Bryan Kerster;Christopher T.

cdc8d284c2c16e937389eaefdf8413304e42de69	structural connectivity of visuotopic intraparietal sulcus		The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) contains topographically organized regions, similar to retinotopic maps in visual cortex. These regions, referred to as IPS1-4, show similar functional responses to the mapping tasks used to define them, yet differing responses to tests of other posterior parietal cortex (PPC) functions such as short-term memory, eye movements and object viewing, suggesting that they may have distinct patterns of structural connectivity to other parts of the brain. The present study combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mapping with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to describe white matter connections of visuotopic regions along the IPS, in 25 neurotypical young-adult participants. We found that posterior IPS more likely connects to retinotopically defined visual regions, and superior temporal gyrus, relative to anterior IPS. Anterior IPS regions 3 and 4 had higher connection probabilities to prefrontal regions, relative to posterior IPS. All four IPS regions showed inter-hemispheric connections to analogous regions in the opposite hemisphere, as well as consistent connections to the thalamus and regions of the striatum. Multivariate pattern classification at the group level reliably distinguished IPS regions from one another on the basis of connectivity patterns, especially for the most distal pairs of regions; occipital and prefrontal regions provided the most discriminating information. These findings advance our understanding of the structure of visuotopic IPS, with implications for functional differences between regions, and possible homologies between humans and macaques. Visuospatial functions dependent on the parietal cortex are frequently impaired in individuals with developmental disorders and those afflicted by cerebrovascular disease; the findings described here can be used as a basis for comparing connectivity differences in these populations.	cerebrovascular disorders;developmental disabilities;diffusion tensor imaging;eye movements;homology (biology);mavs gene;macaca;magnetic resonance imaging;mind map;movement;neostriatum;parietal lobe;population;posterior parietal cortex;probability;spatial–temporal reasoning;structure of central sulcus;structure of intraparietal sulcus;superior temporal gyrus;thalamic structure;white matter;dinoflagellate sulcus;fmri	Signe Bray;Aiden E.

ef5410e3b6118588a8ec8621f0f6874679cc76bd	how do you see me? the neural basis of motivated meta-perception		We cannot see the minds of others, yet people often spontaneously interpret how they are viewed by other people (i.e., meta-perceptions) and often in a self-flattering manner. Very little is known about the neural associations of meta-perceptions, but a likely candidate is the ventromedial pFC (VMPFC). VMPFC has been associated with both self- and other-perception as well as motivated self-perception. Does this function extend to meta-perceptions? The current study examined neural activity while participants made meta-perceptive interpretations in various social scenarios. A drift-diffusion model was used to test whether the VMPFC is associated with two processes involved in interpreting meta-perceptions in a self-flattering manner: the extent to which the interpretation process involves the preferential accumulation of evidence in favor of a self-flattering interpretation versus the extent to which the interpretation process begins with an expectation that favors a self-flattering outcome. Increased VMPFC activity was associated with the extent to which people preferentially accumulate information when interpreting meta-perceptions under ambiguous conditions and marginally associated with self-flattering meta-perceptions. Together, the present findings illuminate the neural underpinnings of a social cognitive process that has received little attention to date: how we make meaning of others' minds when we think those minds are pointed at us.	cognition;interpretation process;mental processes;mental association;mind;powerbuilder foundation classes;race condition;structure of ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus;tree accumulation	Taru Flagan;Jeanette A.

In this study, we attempt to identify the spatio-temporal interactions of an epileptic brain using a previously proposed nonlinear dependency measure. Using a clustering model, we determine the average spatial mappings in an epileptic brain at different stages of a complex partial seizure. Results involving 8 seizures from 2 epileptic patients suggest that there may be a fixed pattern associated with regional spatio-temporal dynamics during the interictal to pre-post-ictal transition.	cluster analysis;electroencephalography;epilepsy;interaction;intracranial aneurysm;nonlinear system;patients;seizures;seizures, focal;software propagation;emotional dependency;statistical cluster	Anant Hegde;Deniz Erdogmus;Deng-Shan Shiau;José Carlos Príncipe;J.

These two groups are separated based on their different autonomic nervous system responses to stressful situations. Baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is a prompt biological reflex which is stimulated by baroreceptors, and regulated by autonomic nervous system. We applied sigmoid function as the model of baroreflex characteristic while this method is well-accepted by physiologists and engineers in the field. Sigmoid function is defined by using three variables; dynamic range, saturation rate, and inflection point. Any deficiency in this biological reflex, i.e. unwanted variation in the amount of the mentioned variables, results in the baroreflex malfunctioning. In this paper, it is shown that inflection point of the baroreflex characteristic is greater in highly-reactive children compared to non-reactive children. We introduced an optimization problem to estimate unknown parameters of sigmoid function. We also applied a search method named genetic algorithm to solve the optimization problem.	angular defect;autonomic computing;digital single-lens reflex camera;dynamic range;genetic algorithm;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;sigmoid function	Pedram Ataee;Guy Albert Dumont;W.

2ecc9a47b3a882e53127c7f714ac7f4028934b6d	reduced prefrontal and orbitofrontal gray matter in female adolescents with borderline personality disorder: is it disorder specific?	healthy control;limbic system;psychiatric disorder;control group;white matter;three dimensional;right handed;voxel based morphometry;borderline personality disorder;gray matter;gradient echo;control subjects;orbitofrontal cortex	There is evidence that adults with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are characterized by abnormalities in frontolimbic brain areas. In this study we aimed to determine whether brain volume alterations already exist in adolescents with BPD. Sixty female right-handed individuals (age range, 14-18 years), 20 with a DSM-IV diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, 20 patients with a DSM-IV defined current psychiatric disorder and 20 healthy control subjects were included. Groups were matched for age and IQ. Using a 3 T MRI scanner, we collected 1 mm axial sections using a three-dimensional sagittal isotropic Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence. Images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Voxel-based analysis revealed that adolescents with BPD showed reduced gray matter in the dorsolateral cortex (DLPFC) bilaterally and in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) relative to healthy control subjects. Adolescent clinical control subjects displayed significantly decreased gray matter volume in the right DLPFC in comparison with healthy control subjects. No significant gray matter differences were detected between the BPD group and the clinical control group. No group differences were found in the limbic system or in any white matter structures. The present study indicates that the early morphological changes in BPD are located in the PFC. However, these changes may not be BPD specific since similar changes were found in the clinical control group. Changes in limbic brain volumes and white matter structures might occur over the course of the illness.	adolescent (age group);borderline personality disorder;brain implant;congenital abnormality;dsm-iv;echo-planar imaging;gray matter;limbic system;magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of heart;magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo mri;mental disorders;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;orbitofrontal cortex;patients;personality disorders;powerbuilder foundation classes;sagittal plane;scanning systems;voxel;white matter	Romuald Brunner;Romy Henze;Peter Parzer;Jasmin Kramer;Nina Feigl;Kira Lutz;Marco Essig;Franz Resch;Bram Stieltjes	2010	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.070	psychology;three-dimensional space;psychiatry;neuroscience;developmental psychology;limbic system;scientific control;voxel-based morphometry	HCI	19.823981309506767	-80.21326049389694	114494

The idea that elementary processors move within a network to get a proper position is borne out both by biological neurons in the brain morphogenesis and by agents within social networks. From the former, we take inspiration to devise a medium-term project for new artificial neural network training procedures where mobile neurons exchange data only when they are close to one another in a proper space (are in contact). From the latter, we accumulate mobility tracks experience. We focus on the preliminary step of characterizing the elapsed time between neuron contacts, which results from a spatial process fitting in the family of random processes with memory, where chasing neurons are stochastically driven by the goal of hitting target neurons. Thus, we add an unprecedented mobility model to the literature in the field, introducing a distribution law of the intercontact times that merges features of both negative exponential and Pareto distribution laws. We give a constructive description and implementation of our model, as well as a short analytical form whose parameters are suitably estimated in terms of confidence intervals from experimental data. Numerical experiments show the model and related inference tools to be sufficiently robust to cope with two main requisites for its exploitation in a neural network: the nonindependence of the observed intercontact times and the feasibility of the model inversion problem to infer suitable mobility parameters.	artificial neural network;benchmark (computing);central processing unit;community;confidence intervals;connectionism;contain (action);experiment;inference;information;mind;neuron;neurons;numerical method;pareto efficiency;programming paradigm;prospective search;refinement (computing);relevance;rule (guideline);screenshot;social network;stochastic process;telling untruths;trait;brain morphogenesis;exponential	Bruno Apolloni;Simone Bassis;Elena Pagani;Gian Paolo Rossi;Lorenzo Valerio	2011	IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks	10.1109/TNN.2011.2168536	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics;mobility model;artificial neural network;complex network;statistics;social network	ML	16.109023812259984	-69.0138390288976	114578
5ec9aa1ced89cc650923c329e9b3905f8d342551	a systematic review of the psychological factors that influence neurofeedback learning outcomes		Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based neurofeedback represents the latest applied behavioural neuroscience methodology developed to train participants in the self-regulation of brain regions or networks. However, as with previous biofeedback approaches which rely on electroencephalography (EEG) or related approaches such as brain-machine interface technology (BCI), individual success rates vary significantly, and some participants never learn to control their brain responses at all. Given that these approaches are often being developed for eventual use in a clinical setting (albeit there is also significant interest in using NF for neuro-enhancement in typical populations), this represents a significant hurdle which requires more research. Here we present the findings of a systematic review which focused on how psychological variables contribute to learning outcomes in fMRI-based neurofeedback. However, as this is a relatively new methodology, we also considered findings from EEG-based neurofeedback and BCI. 271 papers were found and screened through PsycINFO, psycARTICLES, Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Collection, ISI Web of Science and Medline and 21 were found to contribute towards the aim of this survey. Several main categories emerged: Attentional variables appear to be of importance to both performance and learning, motivational factors and mood have been implicated as moderate predictors of success, while personality factors have mixed findings. We conclude that future research will need to systematically manipulate psychological variables such as motivation or mood, and to define clear thresholds for a successful neurofeedback effect. Non-responders need to be targeted for interventions and tested with different neurofeedback setups to understand whether their non-response is specific or general. Also, there is a need for qualitative evidence to understand how psychological variables influence participants throughout their training. This will help us to understand the subtleties of psychological effects over time. This research will allow interventions to be developed for non-responders and better selection procedures in future to improve the efficacy of neurofeedback.	biofeedback;brain neoplasms;categories;electroencephalography phase synchronization;magnetic resonance imaging;neurofeedback;neuroscience discipline;paper;self-control as a personality trait;fmri	Kathrin Cohen Kadosh;Kuixi Zhu	2018	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.10.021	cognitive psychology;mood;psychology;psycinfo;behavioral neuroscience;neurofeedback;personality;biofeedback;behavioural sciences;psychological intervention	HCI	14.185004258352146	-78.34969875392164	114602
b4966332aafde589ce6dbbe804b02ae2b5abd128	prefrontal modulation of visual processing and sustained attention in aging, a tdcs–eeg coregistration approach		The ability to sustain attention is integral to healthy cognition in aging. The right PFC (rPFC) is critical for maintaining high levels of attentional focus. Whether plasticity of this region can be harnessed to support sustained attention in older adults is unknown. We used transcranial direct current stimulation to increase cortical excitability of the rPFC, while monitoring behavioral and electrophysiological markers of sustained attention in older adults with suboptimal sustained attention capacity. During rPFC transcranial direct current stimulation, fewer lapses of attention occurred and electroencephalography signals of frontal engagement and early visual attention were enhanced. To further verify these results, we repeated the experiment in an independent cohort of cognitively typical older adults using a different sustained attention paradigm. Again, prefrontal stimulation was associated with fewer attentional lapses. These experiments suggest the rPFC can be manipulated in later years to increase top–down modulation over early sensory processing and improve sustained attention performance. This holds valuable information for the development of neurorehabilitation protocols to ameliorate age-related deficits in this capacity.	abnormal behavior;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;cfp gene;cerebral cortex;cerebrovascular accident;cognition;electroencephalography;excited state;experiment;image registration;mccarthy formalism;modulation;neurological rehabilitation;population;powerbuilder foundation classes;programming paradigm;protocols documentation;sensory process;transcranial direct current stimulation	Méadhbh B.

In order to interpret depth-EEG signals, we developed an extended source model which connects two levels of representation: 1) a distributed current dipole model which describes the spatial distribution of neuronal sources; 2) a model of coupled neuronal populations which describes their temporal dynamics. From this extended source model, depth-EEG signals were simulated from the forward solution at each electrode sensor located inside the brain. Results showed that realistic transient epileptiform activities (spikes) are obtained under specific conditions in the model in terms of degree of coupling between neuronal populations and spatial extent of the source. In particular, the cortical area involved in the generation of epileptic spikes was estimated to vary from 18 to 25 cm2, for brain conductivity values ranging from 30 to 35times10-5 S/mm, for high coupling degree between neuronal populations and for a volume conductor model that accounts for the three main tissues of the head (brain, skull, and scalp).

The present study employed a support vector machine-based MVPA approach to identify the complex patterns of sex differences in brain structure and resting-state function. We also aimed to assess the role of anatomy on functional sex differences during rest. One hundred and forty healthy young Chinese adults (70 men and 70 women) underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scans. Gray matter density and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were used to map brain structure and resting-state function, respectively. After combining these two feature vectors into one union-vector, a pattern classifier was designed using principal component analysis and linear support vector machine to identify brain areas that had distinct characteristics between the groups. We found that: (1) male and female brains were different with a mean classification accuracy of 89%; (2) sex differences in gray matter density were widely distributed in the brain, notably in the occipital lobe and the cerebellum; (3) men primarily showed higher ReHo in their right hemispheres and women tended to show greater ReHo in their left hemispheres; (4) about 50% of brain areas with functional sex differences exhibited significant positive correlations between gray matter density and ReHo. Our results suggest that sex is an important factor that account for interindividual variability in the healthy brain.	acoustic lobing;anatomic structures;brain;cerebellum;eighty nine;gray matter;heart rate variability;interphase cell;mental disorders;neuroimaging;occipital lobe;pattern recognition;principal component analysis;rest;resting state fmri;sex characteristics;support vector machine;young adult	Lubin Wang;Hui Shen;Feng Tang;Yufeng Zang;Dewen Hu	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.03.080	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;sexual dimorphism;communication;resting state fmri	ML	20.83149793503858	-79.33643772601147	114828

Recent studies have demonstrated the nonstationarity of spatial and temporal dynamics of resting state brain activity and highlighted the importance of understanding network dynamics to better characterize brain states.

In previous computer simulation studies with rate-coded neural networks, the development of transformation-invariant representations has been demonstrated using either of two biologically plausible learning mechanisms, Trace learning and Continuous Transformation (CT) learning. However, it has not previously been investigated how transformation-invariant representations may be learned in a more biologically accurate spiking neural network. A key issue is how the synaptic connection strengths in such a spiking network might self-organize through Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) where the change in synaptic strength is dependent on the relative times of the spikes emitted by the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons rather than simply correlated activity driving changes in synaptic efficacy. Here we present simulations with conductance-based integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons using a STDP learning rule to address these gaps in our understanding. It is demonstrated that with the appropriate selection of model parameters and training regime, the spiking network model can utilize either Trace-like or CT-like learning mechanisms to achieve transform-invariant representations.	artificial neural network;biological neural networks;biological neuron model;computer simulation;conductance (graph);facial recognition system;gene regulatory network;learning rule;network model;neural network simulation;organizing (structure);self-organization;spiking neural network;synaptic package manager;visual pathways	Benjamin D.

7b02ba4c6eb5656b818125456ee4a9855888d9cf	an associative network with chaotic neurons and dynamic synapses	neural networks;chaos;dynamic synapses	Chaotic neurons are interconnected with each other through a matrix of dynamic synaptic weights to constitute an associative network. First, the dynamics of the two chaotic neurons connected with dynamic synapses is analyzed. A quick memory switching phenomenon in the Associative Network with Chaotic Neurons and Dynamic Synapses (ANCNDS) is then demonstrated. It is further discovered that the memory retrieval frequency of the network among stored patterns distributes more uniformly, and is much higher than that of a chaotic network without dynamic synapses. Moreover, the network acts as a peculiar pattern recognition system when applied with external stimulations. If the external stimulation is close to only one stored pattern, the network recalls the stored pattern exactly. On the other hand, if the external stimulation shares similarity with two or several stored patterns, the network transits among these related stored patterns. When the external stimulation does not resemble any stored patterns, the network wanders among all the stored patterns.	synapse	Zhijie Wang;Hong Fan;Kazuyuki Aihara	2007	I. J.

They provide important information about visual attention and turn-taking during human-human and human-avatar interaction. In fact, the eye is a complex organ and gaze is only one of its behaviours. It is composed, among other components, of an eyeball, an iris, a pupil and a cornea. The pupil and the cornea present time-varying phenomena that a realistic eye model should take into account. The primary role of the pupil is to regulate the amount of light entering the eye in response to the changing environmental illumination. The pupil dilates in low illumination conditions and constricts in high illumination conditions. A physiologically inspired (time varying) model of pupil light reflex was proposed by Pamplona and colleagues [Pamplona et al. 2009]. Another kind of pupillary movements are hippus which correspond to spontaneous oscillations of the pupil diameter under steady conditions of illumination. It is considered as a chaotic system with period doubling [Rosenberg and Kroll 1999]. In fact, the oscillations (with a frequency equal to 0.2 Hz) go from chaotic to periodic behaviours and vice-versa. The eyeball is composed of the sclera and the cornea. The sclera is the tough, fibrous outer layer of the eyeball that forms the whites of the eyes. Another eye component is the cornea which is a transparent tissue that covers the iris. On its surface, a reflection of the world surrounding the person appears: this effect is called corneal reflection. Only recently, an anatomically accurate eye model (replicating video of human eye) has been implemented that takes into account this reflection [François et al. 2007] but not tested embedded in an avatar interacting with humans. The aim of this study was to build a 3D eye model for virtual humans replicating corneal reflection, pupil size variation due to bottom-up processes and the hippus phenomenon.	bottom-up parsing;chaos theory;dialog system;embedded system;embodied agent;françois lionet;global illumination;illumination (image);interaction;period-doubling bifurcation;spontaneous order	Guillaume Gibert;Catherine J.

In the present paper, employing a homogeneous spherical conductor serving as an approximation of the brain, we provide a criterion which determines whether the measured surface potential is evoked by a single or multiple localized neuronal excitations. We show that the uniqueness of the inverse problem for a single dipole is closely connected with attaining certain relations connecting the measured data. Further, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions which decide whether the collected data originates from a single dipole or from numerous dipoles. In the case where the EEG data arouses from multiple parallel dipoles, an isolation of the source is, in general, not possible.	approximation;electroencephalography	George Dassios;Michael Doschoris;Konstantia Satrazemi	2014	J.

This hypothesis has been reinforced by numerous studies showing the relevance of TD learning algorithms to describe the role of basal ganglia in classical conditioning. However, recent recordings of DA neurons during multi-choice tasks raised contradictory interpretations on whether DA’s RPE signal is action dependent or not. Thus the precise TD algorithm (i.e. Actor-Critic, Q-learning or SARSA) that best describes DA signals remains unknown. Here we simulate and precisely analyze these TD algorithms on a multi-choice task performed by rats. We find that DA activity previously reported in this task is best fitted by a TD error which has not fully converged, and which converged faster than observed behavioral adaptation.	algorithm;basal (phylogenetics);bellman equation;dopamine;encode;fits;ganglia;machine learning;neuron;q-learning;reinforcement learning;relevance;simulation;state-action-reward-state-action;temporal difference learning	Jean Bellot;Olivier Sigaud;Mehdi Khamassi	2012		10.1186/1471-2202-14-S1-P144	psychology;biology;neuroscience;medical research;developmental psychology;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;communication	ML	16.415639050099802	-73.29836407309381	116558

This study was designed to elucidate changes in specific frontally mediated retrieval processes involved in word-finding difficulties associated with advanced age. We implemented two overt verbal (semantic and phonemic) fluency tasks during fMRI and compared brain activity patterns of old and young adults. Performance during the phonemic task was comparable for both age groups and mirrored by strongly left-lateralized (frontal) activity patterns. On the other hand, a significant drop of performance during the semantic task in the older group was accompanied by additional right (inferior and middle) frontal activity, which was negatively correlated with performance. Moreover, the younger group recruited different subportions of the left inferior frontal gyrus for both fluency tasks, whereas the older participants failed to show this distinction. Thus, functional integrity and efficient recruitment of left frontal language areas seems to be critical for successful word retrieval in old age.	childhood onset fluency disorder;electroencephalography;electronic signature;frontal lobe gyrus;inferior frontal gyrus;fmri	Marcus Meinzer;Tobias Flaisch;Lotte Wilser;Carsten Eulitz;Brigitte Rockstroh;Tim W.

064e020931963ef03ccd932b62b4224e64183918	network estimation via poisson autoregressive models		Multivariate Poisson autoregressive models are a common way of capturing self-exciting point processes, where cascading series of events from nodes in a network either stimulate or inhibit events from other nodes. These models can be used to learn the structure of social or biological neural networks. An important problem associated with these multivariate network models is determining how different nodes influence each other. This problem presents a number of technical challenges since the number of nodes is typically large relative to the number of observed events. This paper addresses these challenges and provides learning rates for a class of multivariate self-exciting Poisson autoregressive models. Importantly, the derived learning rates apply in the high-dimensional setting when our network is sparse. We also provide a real data example to support our methodology and main results.	artificial neural network;autoregressive model;machine learning;poisson–boltzmann equation;sparse matrix;world-system	Benjamin Mark;Garvesh Raskutti;Rebecca M Willett	2017	2017 IEEE 7th International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (CAMSAP)	10.1109/CAMSAP.2017.8313192	point process;artificial neural network;network model;machine learning;autoregressive model;multivariate statistics;artificial intelligence;mathematics;poisson distribution	ML	22.682286714839233	-74.63608292119592	116668

In addition, it is often desirable to know which features of the stimulus or response are most informative. The literature offers several different decompositions of the mutual information into its stimulus or response-specific components, such as the specific surprise or the uncertainty reduction, but the number of mutually distinct measures is in fact infinite. We resolve this ambiguity by requiring the specific information measures to be invariant under invertible coordinate transformations of the stimulus and the response ensembles. We prove that the Kullback–Leibler divergence is then the only suitable measure of the specific information. On a more general level, we discuss the necessity and the fundamental aspects of the coordinate invariance as a selection principle. We believe that our results will encourage further research into invariant statistical methods for the analysis of neural coding.	auditory processing disorder;cochlear nerve;computational neuroscience;frame (physical object);horst sachs;jumbo frame;kullback–leibler divergence;lansky play-performance status;manuscripts;maximal set;mutual information;nerve fibers;neural coding;neuroscience discipline;physiology;reference frame (video);self-information;shannon (unit);sidney fernbach award;cell transformation	Lubomir Kostal;Giuseppe D'Onofrio	2017	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-017-0729-7	machine learning;kullback–leibler divergence;pointwise mutual information;variation of information;total correlation;mutual information;artificial intelligence;mathematics;invariant (mathematics);neural coding;interaction information	ML	23.006621894129058	-72.0451034858629	116709
f677b44df2b7b244a996e72fec8d5642578c48bf	cross-frequency phase–amplitude coupling as a mechanism for temporal orienting of attention in childhood		Temporal orienting of attention operates by biasing the allocation of cognitive and motor resources in specific moments in time, resulting in the improved processing of information from expected compared with unexpected targets. Recent findings have shown that temporal orienting operates relatively early across development, suggesting that this attentional mechanism plays a core role for human cognition. However, the exact neurophysiological mechanisms allowing children to attune their attention over time are not well understood. In this study, we presented 8- to 12-year-old children with a temporal cueing task designed to test (1) whether anticipatory oscillatory dynamics predict children's behavioral performance on a trial-by-trial basis and (2) whether anticipatory oscillatory neural activity may be supported by cross-frequency phase–amplitude coupling as previously shown in adults. Crucially, we found that, similar to what has been reported in adults, children's ongoing beta rhythm was strongly coupled with their theta rhythm and that the strength of this coupling distinguished validly cued temporal intervals, relative to neutral cued trials. In addition, in long trials, there was an inverse correlation between oscillatory beta power and children's trial-by-trial reaction, consistent with oscillatory beta power reflecting better response preparation. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that temporal attention in children operates by exploiting oscillatory mechanism.	beta rhythm;biasing;cognition;neural oscillation;sleep disorders, circadian rhythm;theta model	Giovanni Mento;Duncan E.

In this paper, we propose a structurally-weighted LASSO (SW-LASSO) regression model to represent the functional interaction among multiple regions of interests (ROIs) based on resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) data. The structural connectivity constraints derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data will guide the selection of the weights which adjust the penalty levels of different coefficients corresponding to different ROIs. Using the Default Mode Network (DMN) as a test-bed, our results indicate that the learned SW-LASSO has good capability of differentiating Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects from their normal controls and has promising potential to characterize the brain functions among different condition, thus serving as the functional network-based signature.	antivirus software;coefficient;cognition disorders;decision model and notation;diffusion tensor imaging;interaction;lasso;least squares;mild cognitive disorder;rest;resting state fmri;shattered world;testbed;weight;interest	Dajiang Zhu;Dinggang Shen;Tianming Liu	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging	10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556638	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;data mining;neurophysiology;regression analysis	Visualization	24.217388129229768	-77.94329177114089	116790

However, the specific cortical structure abnormalities underlying this disorder remain largely unknown. Here, we designed a multi-modal segmentation pipeline adapted to anatomical MR images acquired in a clinical setting in order to apply state-of-the-art sulcus-based morphometry methods to a large cohort of 73 young children. We computed multiple descriptors of the geometry of each sulcus, hereby separating the folding measurement into distinct factors such as the length and depth of the sulcus. We demonstrated that several sulci showed a significant and consistent pattern of abnormalities across our different geometrical features. These structural abnormalities are confined to regions that are functionally relevant with respect to cognitive disorders in ASD, and might thus represent a set of complementary anatomical markers of this pathology.	focal (programming language);galaxy morphological classification;mathematical morphology;modal logic;molecular descriptor;morphometrics;risk assessment	Guillaume Auzias;Marine Viellard;Sylvain Takerkart;Nathalie Villeneuve;François Poinso;David Da Fonseca;Nadine Girard;Christine Deruelle	2014	IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)	10.1109/BHI.2014.6864302	psychology;computer vision;neuroscience;developmental psychology	Vision	21.05603277360449	-79.4495005999974	116859

We have analyzed spatio-temporal profiles of the distribution of spikes in the bursts recorded after 2 weeks in vitro. We have found a statistically significant similarity between the spiking patterns in sequential bursting events, we refer to these spiking patterns as spiking signatures. Such spiking signatures may appear in different parts of the bursts, including the activation patterns - the first spike times in the bursts, and deactivation patterns - the last spike times in the bursts. Moreover, these patterns may display apparent time scaling, e.g., they may be replayed in the subsequent bursts at different speeds, while preserving the spiking order. We discuss how such properties of the bursts may be associated with the formation of repeatable signaling pathways in cultured networks in vitro.	electronic signature;hippocampus (brain);image scaling;in vitro [publication type];neural oscillation;spontaneous order;test scaling;type signature;electrical activity	Alexey S.

What is less clear is the extent and properties such plasticity may acquire following permanent damage to the adult visual system. Answering this question is important. Aside from improving our understanding of visual processing in the absence of an intact visual circuitry, such knowledge is essential for the development of effective therapies to rehabilitate the increasing number of people who suffer the functional consequences of damage at different levels of their visual cortical hierarchy. This review summarizes the known characteristics of visual learning after adult visual cortex damage and begins to dissect some of the neural correlates of this process.	blindness, cortical;cerebral cortex;consciousness;data recovery;depressive disorder;electronic circuit;learning disorders;long-term potentiation;mammals;neuronal plasticity;randomized algorithm;reperfusion therapy;retina;spontaneous order;therapeutic procedure;visual learning;bypass;chemosensitization/potentiation;synaptogenesis	Tim Martin;Krystel R.

Data on structural and perfusion MRI in the brain were collected from 202 healthy children aged 5-18 years. Gender differences in brain perfusion using partial volume correction (PVC), which was calculated by dividing the normalized perfusion MRI by the normalized gray-matter segments, were analyzed by applying voxel-based analysis and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. Girls showed significantly higher brain perfusion with PVC in the bilateral medial aspect of the parietal lobes, including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, as compared to boys using voxel-based analysis. In addition, brain perfusion with PVC in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral precuneus, and left thalamus was significantly higher in girls than in boys in the ROI analysis. In contrast, no regions were seen in which boys exhibited higher brain perfusion with PVC than girls in both analyses. The findings showed significant differences between boys and girls in brain perfusion with PVC, and these differences may contribute to gender differences in the cognitive ability of healthy children.	bilateral filter;cingulate cortex;cognition;female child;magnetic resonance imaging;medial graph;parietal lobe;region of interest;sex characteristics;structure of precuneus;thalamic structure;voxel	Yasuyuki Taki;Hiroshi Hashizume;Yuko Sassa;Hikaru Takeuchi;Kai Wu;Michiko Asano;Kohei Asano;Hiroshi Fukuda;Ryuta Kawashima	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.020	psychology;neuroscience;cognition;developmental psychology;radiology;medicine;pathology;magnetic resonance imaging;perfusion scanning;region of interest	HCI	20.055026159455263	-80.18826593294432	117043
4bd0f8cbef85d24fcc908fcd58f00aa6241027f7	impact of network topology on inference of synaptic connectivity from multi-neuronal spike data simulated by a large-scale cortical network model	synaptic connectivity;network topology;functional connections;connectivity inference;large-scale network simulation	Many mechanisms of neural processing rely critically upon the synaptic connectivity between neurons. As our ability to simultaneously record from large populations of neurons expands, the ability to infer network connectivity from this data has become a major goal of computational neuroscience. To address this issue, we employed several different methods to infer synaptic connections from simulated spike data from a realistic local cortical network model. This approach allowed us to directly compare the accuracy of different methods in predicting synaptic connectivity. We compared the performance of model-free (coherence measure and transfer entropy) and model-based (coupled escape rate model) methods of connectivity inference, applying those methods to the simulated spike data from the model networks with different network topologies. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the inferred connectivity was higher for highly clustered, near regular, or small-world networks, while accuracy was lower for random networks, irrespective of which analysis method was employed. Among the employed methods, the model-based method performed best. This model performed with higher accuracy, was less sensitive to threshold changes, and required less data to make an accurate assessment of connectivity. Given that cortical connectivity tends to be highly clustered, our results outline a powerful analytical tool for inferring local synaptic connectivity from observations of spontaneous activity.	anatomy, regional;cerebral cortex;computation;computational neuroscience;flow network;inference;network model;network topology;neural oscillation;numerous;population;spontaneous order;synaptic package manager;synaptic connectivity;transfer entropy	Ryota Kobayashi;Katsunori Kitano	2013	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1007/s10827-013-0443-y	computer science;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning	ML	21.974272270388898	-74.7698024102386	117240

Most researchers agree that the learned context guides attention to the target location and thus speeds subsequent target processing. Because in previous experiments one target location was uniquely associated with exactly one configuration, the context was highly predictive. In two experiments, the predictive value of the context was investigated by varying the number of possible target locations. We could show that even when the context was less predictive, it was learned and used to guide visual-spatial attention. However, the time course of learning differed significantly: learning was faster when the number of target locations was reduced. These results suggest that not an association of context and target is learned but that rather the precision of the attention shift improves.

It is said that the different color has been shown to have different associations within the cognitive domain. In this paper, we present the results of the subjects watching the colors under the brainwave bands analysis. A simple visual color stimulus is done with the dependence on frequency during subjects watching the stimuli for a long time. By analyzing data after 300ms during the stimuli happened for avoiding the effect of early response, we proposed that the subject could produce visual “synchronization” phenomenon like auditory synchronization.	color;experiment;neural oscillation;synchronization (computer science)	Huiran Zhang;Jiang Xie;Michael Marschollek;Mareike Schulze;Zheng Tang;Wu Zhang	2012	Proceedings of 2012 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics	10.1109/BHI.2012.6211646	psychology;computer vision;multimedia;communication	Robotics	14.191920658151291	-77.14521165547126	117430

A three-layer neural network was successfully trained, using back-prop, to take in oculocentric retinal error vectors and three-dimensional eye orientation and to generate the correct head-centric motor error vector within Listing's plane. Analysis of the hidden layer of trained networks showed that explicit representations of desired target direction and eye orientation were not employed. Instead, the hidden-layer units consistently divided themselves into four parallel modules: a dominant “vector-propagation” class (∼50% of units) with similar visual and motor tuning but negligible position sensitivity and three classes with specific spatial relations between position, visual, and motor tuning. Surprisingly, the vector-propagation units, and only these, formed a highly precise and consistent orthogonal coordinate system aligned with Listing's plane. Selective “lesions” confirmed that the vector-propagation module provided the main drive for saccade magnitude and direction, whereas a balance between activity in the other modules was required for the correct eye-position modulation. Thus, contrary to popular expectation, error-driven learning in itself was sufficient to produce a “neural” algorithm with discrete functional modules and explicit coordinate systems, much like those observed in the real saccade generator.	algorithm;alignment;artificial neural network;backpropagation;class;error-driven learning;modulation;multitier architecture;network model;retina;saccades;software propagation	Michael A.

Patients with focal epilepsy show reorganization or plasticity of brain networks involved in cognitive functions, inducing ‘atypical’ (compared to ‘typical’ in healthy people) brain profiles. Moreover, some of these patients suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy, and they undergo surgery to stop seizures. The neurosurgeon should only remove the zone generating seizures and must preserve cognitive functions to avoid deficits. To preserve functions, one should know how they are represented in the patient’s brain, which is in general different from that of healthy subjects. For this purpose, in the pre-surgical stage, robust and efficient methods are required to identify atypical from typical representations. Given the frequent location of regions generating seizures in the vicinity of language networks, one important function to be considered is language. The risk of language impairment after surgery is determined pre-surgically by mapping language networks. In clinical settings, cognitive mapping is classically performed with fMRI. The fMRI analyses allowing the identification of atypical patterns of language networks in patients are not sufficiently robust and require additional statistic approaches. In this study, we report the use of a statistical nonlinear machine learning classification, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, to identify atypical patterns and classify 55 participants as healthy subjects or patients with epilepsy. XGBoost analyses were based on neurophysiological features in five language regions (three frontal and two temporal) in both hemispheres and activated with fMRI for a phonological (PHONO) and a semantic (SEM) language task. These features were combined into 135 cognitively plausible subsets and further submitted to selection and binary classification. Classification performance was scored with the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Our results showed that the subset SEM_LH BA_47-21 (left fronto-temporal activation induced by the SEM task) provided the best discrimination between the two groups (AUC of 91 ± 5%). The results are discussed in the framework of the current debates of language reorganization in focal epilepsy.	algorithm;area under curve;binary classification;cognition disorders;cognitive map;conflict (psychology);epilepsies, partial;epilepsy;focal (programming language);gilles de la tourette syndrome;gradient boosting;language disorders;license;linear algebra;machine learning;missing data;nonlinear system;operative surgical procedures;patients;receiver operating characteristic;score;seizures;statistical classification;subgroup;xgboost;fmri;standards characteristics	L.

Mimicking experimental situations, we generate time series with finite length and varying frequency content but from independent stochastic processes. Using the correlation coefficient and the maximum cross-correlation, we estimate interdependencies between these time series. With clustering coefficient and average shortest path length, we observe unweighted interaction networks, derived via thresholding the values of interdependence, to possess non-trivial topologies as compared to Erdös-Rényi networks, which would indicate small-world characteristics. These topologies reflect the mostly unavoidable finiteness of the data, which limits the reliability of typically used estimators of signal interdependence. We propose random networks that are tailored to the way interaction networks are derived from empirical data. Through an exemplary investigation of multichannel electroencephalographic recordings of epileptic seizures--known for their complex spatial and temporal dynamics--we show that such random networks help to distinguish network properties of interdependence structures related to seizure dynamics from those spuriously induced by the applied methods of analysis.	clustering coefficient;cross-correlation;electroencephalography;epilepsy;flow network;interaction network;interdependence;neuroscience discipline;science;seizures;short;shortest path problem;stochastic processes;stochastic process;thresholding (image processing);time series;unavoidable pattern;statistical cluster	Stephan Bialonski;Martin Wendler;Klaus Lehnertz	2011		10.1371/journal.pone.0022826	interaction network;stochastic process;complex systems;dynamical systems theory;electroencephalography;network analysis;bioinformatics;time series;clustering coefficient;shortest path problem;generation time	ML	22.174144713147427	-76.52996177138776	118060

These studies have largely been limited to assessing heritability for single and mostly gross anatomical structures. To avoid this limitation, we developed a method using high-dimensional 3D nonlinear registration to apply an elastic deformation vector field in the cortical parameter space and assess regional cortical gray matter density on the entire cortical surface in healthy monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Once aligned across subjects, surface maps of gray matter density were subjected to variance component analyses. By fitting structural equation models, we generated cortical surface maps to reflect the regional percent variance explained by genetic, shared and unique environmental factors.

Even after transient, the output sequence is often aperiodic. In particular, it might happen that the output events are basically synchronized with the input events, but that some of them are randomly skipped from the output time series (imperfect phase synchronization [Zacks et al., 1999, 2000]). This phenomenon has been neatly observed by Schimz and Hildebrand [1992] in a rich series of experiments on the locomotor behavior of Halobacterium salinarium, where the input event was a light impulse and the output event was the reversal in the swimming direction of the bacterium. In this paper, we show that the same phenomenon occurs when classical, low dimensional chaotic oscillators are forced by a periodic sequence of impulses. This proves, on one side, that imperfect phase synchronization is a common phenomenon in chaotic oscillators subjected to periodic sequences of impulses, and, on the other side, that there are high chances that the locomotor behavior of Halobacterium salinarium can be modeled by a low dimensional deterministic model.	aperiodic graph;chaos theory;experiment;randomness;time series	Giancarlo Torri;Sergio Rinaldi;Carlo Piccardi	2003	I.

fc5bd6bb62d17392a86f984cf9f5f41b773c37ae	a simple model of attentional blink		The attentional blink (AB) effect is the reduced ability of subjects to report a second target stimuli (T2) among a rapidly presented series of non-target stimuli, when it appears within a time window of about 200-500 ms after a first target (T1). We present a simple dynamical systems model explaining the AB as resulting from the temporal response dynamics of a stochastic, linear system with threshold, whose output represents the amount of attentional resources allocated to the incoming sensory stimuli. The model postulates that the available attention capacity is limited by activity of the default mode network (DMN), a correlated set of brain regions related to task irrelevant processing which is known to exhibit reduced activation following mental training such as mindfulness meditation. The model provides a parsimonious account relating key findings from the AB, DMN and meditation research literature, and suggests some new testable predictions.	aharonov–bohm effect;blink;decision model and notation;dynamical system;linear system;occam's razor;relevance;scientific literature	Nadav Amir;Israel Nelken;Naftali Tishby	2016	CoRR		psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	ML	15.727271817595675	-75.78606555162635	118381
3df18492c4a4b91b28566d4fd6c88f5d97a52164	learning transformational invariants from natural movies		We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the first layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the first layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can influence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model.	encode;graphical model;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;statistical model;transformational grammar	Charles F.

Responses to such protocol often yield varying results, going from a depressing response to a facilitated one following the second pulse. Similarly, experimental results have shown that synaptic structures are dynamic and receptors move along the postsynaptic membrane. The present study provides insights on the impact of glutamatergic receptors localization with respect to the neurotransmitters release site on the postsynaptic currents measured; it also proposes an explanation on the diversity of responses observed experimentally. The platform we used is the EONS/RHENOMS modeling platform widely described in the literature, which encompasses a multitude of highly detailed subsynaptic elements to most faithfully replicate synaptic function.	experiment;internationalization and localization;postsynaptic current;postsynaptic membrane;self-replicating machine;synapse;synaptic package manager	Jean-Marie Bouteiller;Sushmita L.

Thus, the present study aimed at delineating relationships between interindividual differences in personality and hemodynamic responses evoked by emotional speech melody. To determine personality-dependent modulations of brain reactivity, fMRI activation patterns during the processing of emotional speech cues were acquired from 24 healthy volunteers and subsequently correlated with individual trait measures of extraversion and neuroticism obtained for each participant. Whereas correlation analysis did not indicate any link between brain activation and extraversion, strong positive correlations between measures of neuroticism and hemodynamic responses of the right amygdala, the left postcentral gyrus as well as medial frontal structures including the right anterior cingulate cortex emerged, suggesting that brain mechanisms mediating the decoding of emotional speech melody may vary depending on differences in neuroticism among individuals. Observed trait-specific modulations are discussed in the light of processing biases as well as differences in emotion control or task strategies which may be associated with the personality trait of neuroticism.	amygdaloid structure;cingulate cortex;extraversion (psychology);foremost;hemodynamics;medial graph;mood swings;neurobiology;semantic prosody;structure of postcentral gyrus;fmri	Carolin Brück;Benjamin Kreifelts;Evangelia Kaza;Martin Lotze;Dirk Wildgruber	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.005	psychology;cognitive psychology;trait theory;neuroticism;neuroscience;developmental psychology;extraversion and introversion;haemodynamic response;social psychology	NLP	16.00725302562645	-77.59899729712922	118973

Area P corresponds to the orientation-selective subsystem of the primary visual cortex, while the central visual area C is modeled as associative memory representing stimulus objects according to Hebbian learning. Without feedback from area C, a single stimulus results in relatively slow and irregular activity, synchronized only for neighboring patches (slow state), while in the complete model activity is faster with an enlarged synchronization range (fast state). When presenting a superposition of several stimulus objects, scene segmentation happens on a time scale of hundreds of milliseconds by alternating epochs of the slow and fast states, where neurons representing the same object are simultaneously in the fast state. Correlation analysis reveals synchronization on different time scales as found in experiments (designated as tower, castle, and hill peaks). On the fast time scale (tower peaks, gamma frequency range), recordings from two sites coding either different or the same object lead to correlograms that are either flat or exhibit oscillatory modulations with a central peak. This is in agreement with experimental findings, whereas standard phase-coding models would predict shifted peaks in the case of different objects.	area striata structure;content-addressable memory;enlargement procedure;experiment;frequency band;hebbian theory;neurons;physical object;spiking neural network;synchronization (computer science);visual cortex;biologic segmentation	Andreas Knoblauch;Günther Palm	2002	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-002-0331-4	psychology;computer vision;neuroscience;visual system;hebbian theory;experience design;computer science;machine learning;communication	ML	20.377925824888447	-68.6980913512979	119302

These circuits, like many oscillatory nonlinear circuits of sufficient complexity, are capable of multistability, that is, of generating different firing patterns distinguished by the phasic relationships between the firing in each circuit element (neuron). Moreover, a shift in firing pattern can be induced by a transient perturbation. A systematic approach, based on phase-response curve (PRC) theory, was used to determine the optimum timing for perturbations that induce a shift in the firing pattern. The first step was to visualize the solution space of the ring circuit, including the attractive basins for each stable firing pattern; this was possible using the relative phase of N−1 oscillators, with respect to an arbitrarily selected reference oscillator, as coordinate axes. The trajectories in this phase space were determined using an iterative mapping based only on the PRCs of the uncoupled component oscillators; this algorithm was called a circuit emulator. For an accurate mapping of the attractive basin of each pattern exhibited by the ring circuit, the emulator had to take into account the effect of a perturbation or input on the timing of two bursts following the onset of the perturbation, rather than just one. The visualization of the attractive basins for rings of two, three, and four oscillators enabled the accurate prediction of the amounts of phase resetting applied to up to N−1 oscillators within a cycle that would induce a transition from any pattern to any another pattern. Finally, the timing and synaptic characterization of an input called the switch signal was adjusted to produce the desired amount of phase resetting.	algorithm;central pattern generators;central pattern generator;electrical element;emulator;feasible region;imagery;iterative method;neuron;neurons;nonlinear system;onset (audio);oscillator (cellular automaton);oscillator device component;ring device;synaptic package manager	Carmen C.

The association between the level of cortical atrophy in the gray matter (GM) and corresponding degree of neuronal connectivity, however, has not systematically been presented. In this study, we aimed to provide anecdotal evidence that there would be a close link between the anatomical abnormality and corresponding functional aberrance associated with the neuropsychiatric condition (i.e. MCI). Firstly, the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis identified the medial temporal lobe and inferior parietal lobule as the regions with substantially decreased (i.e. atrophy) and increased GM concentrations, respectively. In the subsequent functional connectivity (FC) analysis via Pearson's correlation coefficients, the FC patterns using the regions with a decreased GM concentration showed increased FC patterns (i.e. hyper-connectivity) associated with the MCI. On the other hand, the FC patterns using the seed regions with an increased GM concentration have shown decreased FC (i.e. hypo-connectivity) with the MCI in the task anti-correlated regions including superior frontal gyrus (i.e. task-negative networks or default-mode networks). These results provide a supplemental information that there may be an compensatory mechanism in the human brain function, which potentially allow to diagnose early phase of the neuropsychiatric illnesses including the Alzheimer's diseases (AD).	morphometrics;voxel	JungHoe Kim;Jong-Hwan Lee	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-24955-6_37	voxel-based morphometry	NLP	20.30104672343069	-79.81156512641593	119725

In the present solution, the model uses a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to blend different sensory inputs into a single premotor intensionality vector. This is done isochronally, as the convergence time is independent of the number and type of parallel sensory inputs. This intensionality vector, generated based on “the sum over histories”[1], makes this implementation ideal to govern noncontinuous control systems. The rapid convergence of the SGD [2-7] is also used to compare with its biological equivalent in vertebrates -the superior tectumto evaluate limits of convergence, precision and variability. The overall findings indicate that mathematical modeling is effective in addressing multisensory transformations resembling biological systems.	algorithm;biological system;british informatics olympiad;control system;heart rate variability;intension;mathematical model;path integral formulation;stochastic gradient descent	Alex Porras;Rodolfo R.

We propose a learning algorithm based on the process of information maximization in a recurrent network, which we call recurrent infomax (RI). RI maximizes information retention and thereby minimizes information loss through time in a network. We find that feeding in external inputs consisting of information obtained from photographs of natural scenes into an RI-based model of a recurrent network results in the appearance of Gabor-like selectivity quite similar to that existing in simple cells of the primary visual cortex. We find that without external input, this network exhibits cell assemblylike and synfire chainlike spontaneous activity as well as a critical neuronal avalanche. In addition, we find that RI embeds externally input temporal firing patterns to the network so that it spontaneously reproduces these patterns after learning. RI provides a simple framework to explain a wide range of phenomena observed in in vivo and in vitro neuronal networks, and it will provide a novel understanding of experimental results for multineuronal activity and plasticity from an information-theoretic point of view.	adrenal cortex diseases;area striata structure;avalanches;cns disorder;exhibits as topic;expectation–maximization algorithm;hebbian theory;infomax;information theory;juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis;nervous system structure;neural oscillation;rs-232;recurrent neural network;selectivity (electronic);sensorineural hearing loss (disorder);spontaneous order;synchronization (computer science);video-in video-out;photograph;recurrent childhood supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors	Takuma Tanaka;Takeshi Kaneko;Toshio Aoyagi	2009	Neural Computation	10.1162/neco.2008.03-08-727	synchronization;neuroscience;information processing;information theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication;artificial neural network	ML	20.701898591562614	-70.59353310205606	119912
08e4788d660fe3832da33838c8b3d7862d78415c	a model of emergent category-specific activation in the posterior fusiform gyrus of sighted and congenitally blind populations		Theories about the neural bases of semantic knowledge tend between two poles, one proposing that distinct brain regions are innately dedicated to different conceptual domains and the other suggesting that all concepts are encoded within a single network. Category-sensitive functional activations in the fusiform cortex of the congenitally blind have been taken to support the former view but also raise several puzzles. We use neural network models to assess a hypothesis that spans the two poles: The interesting functional activation patterns reflect the base connectivity of a domain-general semantic network. Both similarities and differences between sighted and congenitally blind groups can emerge through learning in a neural network, but only in architectures adopting real anatomical constraints. Surprisingly, the same constraints suggest a novel account of a quite different phenomenon: the dyspraxia observed in patients with semantic impairments from anterior temporal pathology. From this work, we suggest that the cortical semantic network is wired not to encode knowledge of distinct conceptual domains but to promote learning about both conceptual and affordance structure in the environment.	apraxias;architecture as topic;articulation disorders;artificial neural network;base;biological neural networks;encode;emergent;knowledge acquisition;knowledge representation and reasoning;lateral occipitotemporal gyrus;network architecture;neural network simulation;patients;physiological sexual disorders;population;semantic network;visually impaired persons	Lang Chen;Timothy T.

We present a method called TimeScale Abstraction for structuring a complex system as a hierarchy of smaller, interacting equilibrium mechanisms. Within this hierarchy, a given mechanism views a slower one as being constant, and a faster one as being instantaneous. A perturbation to a fast mechanism may be seen by a slower mechanism as a displacement of a monotonic function constraint. We demonstrate the timescale abstraction hierarchy using the interaction between the water and sodium balance mechanisms in medical physiology, an example drawn from a larger, fully implemented, program. Where the structure of a large system permits decomposition by timescale , this abstraction method permits qualitative simulation of otherwise intractibly complex systems.	complex system;complex systems;displacement mapping;interaction;mit engineering systems division;simulation	Benjamin Kuipers	1988	AI in Engineering	10.1016/0954-1810(88)90012-X	simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;algorithm	AI	15.054021570284196	-70.50863971019116	120180

This phenomenon is called spike-frequency adaptation and is usually mediated by slow K+ currents, such as the M-type K+ current (I M ) or the Ca2+-activated K+ current (I AHP ). It is not clear how the detailed biophysical mechanisms regulate spike generation in a cortical neuron. In this study, we investigated the impact of slow K+ currents on spike generation mechanism by reducing a detailed conductance-based neuron model. We showed that the detailed model can be reduced to a multi-timescale adaptive threshold model, and derived the formulae that describe the relationship between slow K+ current parameters and reduced model parameters. Our analysis of the reduced model suggests that slow K+ currents have a differential effect on the noise tolerance in neural coding.	acclimatization;accountable health plans;action potential;biological neuron model;conductance (graph);neural coding;numerous;potassium;threshold model	Ryota Kobayashi;Katsunori Kitano	2016		10.1007/s10827-016-0601-0	simulation;telecommunications;computer science	ML	17.65976737440672	-71.96589045757266	120260
c6386a8e198ec9505609a67b294b1c8d4ae31071	shaun gallagher, how the body shapes the mind	body shape	and partial Coherent and holistic Distinguished from the environment In interaction with the environment Not involved in action, except in some cases Involved in action Deficits in personal neglect Deficits in deafferentation Despite their differences, the body image and the body schema share some common features. First, they are both multimodal. Gallagher underlines the importance of the interaction between vision, proprioception and touch in chapter three. The integration between interoception and exteroception plays an important role both for constructing the sense of ownership of one’s own body and for imitating the movements of other bodies. Second, body image and body schema are both partly innate, as indicated by the existence of phantom limbs in the congenital absence of limbs (ch. 4). Gallagher acknowledges the difficulty in interpreting aplasic phantom limbs, which could involve either an innate structural body image or innate hand-mouth coordination schemata. Gallagher has played an important role in clarifying the literature about the body with his distinction between the body image and the body schema. The distinction is PSYCHE: http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/ F. de Vignemont: Review of How the Body Shapes the Mind 3 mainly functional: the body schema is for action and the body image is for everything that is not action. However, further clarification can be achieved by disentangling the different components of each system. Indeed, each of the body systems is highly heterogeneous. According to Gallagher, the body image includes body percept, body concept and body affect. But why does he group all these in a single category? While the pragmatic function of the body schema is clear, the unitary function of the body image is far from obvious and it is not explicitly explained by Gallagher. This unifying criterion is all the more necessary because there is a competing line of thought that suggests that there are three kinds of body representation: sensori-motor (or body schema), visuo-spatial (or body surface) and semantic (or body image) (Head and Holmes, 1911; Sirigu et al., 1991, Schwoebel & Coslett, 2005). This distinction is founded on neuropsychological dissociations between spatial disorders of the body (such as autotopoagnosia) and semantic disorders of the body (such as body agnosia). There would be then not two but three body systems. However, this distinction leaves out the affective part of the body image. Does that mean that there would even be four kinds of body system? There may be a risk of an infinite multiplication of body representations, which would be pointless. The dual distinction as suggested by Gallagher remains a useful tool for designing experiments on the body. However, as long as Gallagher does not provide a systematic account of the function of the body image, he will not be able to argue for his view. The unity of the body schema is also problematic. The question this time does not so much concern the existence of a unifying function but the underlying abilities involved in a sensori-motor schema. One may first notice that Gallagher defines the body schema as a set of capabilities. I have some difficulties in understanding what these capabilities are and Gallagher does not provide any help on this topic. He remains very vague about the components of the body schema. According to his view, the body schema is not a representation of the body for action. However, it seems that we do need information about the state of our own body if we want to move. Furthermore, we may be mistaken about our bodily state, and such mistakes would have consequences for our actions. This argues in favor of the existence of pragmatic body representations for action. One example of such pragmatic body representations, which is mentioned by Gallagher himself, is the sensory feedback about one’s own body resulting from one’s own movements. However, this is far from being the only component of the body schema. Let’s go back to the example of deafferentation, which has been developed in detail by Gallagher (ch. 2). Gallagher describes mainly the single case of IW, a patient who following a neuropathy, has lost all proprioceptive and tactile information below the neck, but who is still able to move, walk, and behave almost as if nothing happened. However, his movements are no longer automatic and require him to carefully pay attention to all the details. His only source of information about his body is visual. When he cannot see his movements, he loses contact with his body and cannot monitor his movements. He does not even know where his body is or what the posture of his limbs is. Gallagher concludes that IW has lost his body schema, which has been imperfectly replaced by his body image. This conclusion may be too extreme. There is indeed a lack of internal sensory feedback in IW, which greatly impairs his ability to move. However, we cannot reduce the body schema solely to proprioceptive and tactile information. PSYCHE: http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/ PSYCHE 2006: VOLUME 12 ISSUE 1 4 Therefore, we cannot assume an almost complete loss of the body schema in deafferentation. There is more in the body schema and I would like now to analyze these further components. It is important to be explicit about what kind of information concerning the body that we need if we want to be able to move. In computational models of action (Wolpert, 1997), there is rarely any mention of the body per se. However, pragmatic representations of the body play a role at almost every stage of processing, and not only at the level of the sensory feedback. I would like to suggest the existence of two levels of pragmatic representation of the body, based on a distinction made by Jacob and Jeannerod (2003). Following the tradition opened by Milner and Goodale (1995), Jacob and Jeannerod distinguish semantic and pragmatic visual representations of a given object. In the latter case, the object is viewed as the goal of an action performed by an agent. There are two kinds of properties of the goal that may be represented for action. First, there are the basic perceptual features of the object such as its shape or its size (first-order pragmatic representation). Second, there is the function of the object, how to use a tool for instance (higher-order pragmatic representation). I would like to suggest that similarly we can draw a distinction between a first-order body schema and a second-order body schema. The first-order body schema represents the perceptual features of one’s own body that are necessary to know if one wants to move. It includes the posture of the body before and after the movement. It also includes the bodily posture predicted by the forward model, which can be compared to the final bodily posture in order to check whether the movement has been successful. It also includes some personal bodily constraints. The motor system needs to take into account the size of one’s own limbs and their strength in order to program adequately the movement to perform. However, there is more in the body schema. One question remains open: how to use the body. The higherorder body schema represents a functional map of the body. Performing an action requires one to program which body part and which muscles to use for this specific movement. It also requires taking into account the kinematic constraints of the body, like the degree of freedom of the joints. For instance, the best pathway between two bodily postures is not necessarily the shortest one, because it may be physically impossible. There are two further differences between these two kinds of body schema. First, one is a short-term representation, adjusting to each new posture, while the other is a long-term representation of the body. Second, the first-order body schema represents one’s own body, it is highly specific to the agent’s body. What is true of my bodily posture is not true of your bodily posture. In contrast, the higher-order body schema represents the human body in general, independently of whose body it is. What is true of my kinematic constraints is most of the time also true of your kinematic constraints. In deafferentation, only the first-order body schema would be impaired. However, I claim against Gallagher that there is a component of the body schema that is preserved, namely, the higher-order body schema. Deafferented patients do not know their posture if they close their eyes, but they still know the kinematic constraints of their body. The mirror phenomenon of deafferentation would be apraxia. People with apraxia no longer know how to use their body to execute actions, but they retain information about their bodily postures and the size of their limbs. Interestingly, people with aplasic phantom limb are sensitive to kinematic constraints (Funk, Shiffrar & Brugger, 2005). These PSYCHE: http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/ F. de Vignemont: Review of How the Body Shapes the Mind 5 results suggest that they have at least a higher-order body schema. Whether this schema would be innate or not it is difficult to decide. Indeed, the higher-order body schema in aplasic individuals may derive from observation of other people’s bodily movements. To sum up, Gallagher’s effort toward clarification in the study of the body and its disorders has played a central role recently in the literature. His distinction between the body schema and the body image provides a promising approach, which needs to be deepened in further details. With the help of his theory of the body, Gallagher is ready to develop a full-fleshed theory of embodied cognition. The structural role of the body Gallagher’s main goal in his book is to argue for a theory of embodied cognition. This trend has been recently promoted by several philosophers like Andy Clark (1997) and Alva Noë (2004) and by neuroscientists like Francesco Varela (1991) and Antonio Damasio (1994) among others.

We introduce one-and-two dimensional phase portraits to illustratethe behaviors, thus reducing the study of dynamical mechanisms to planar geometrical properties. We examined whether other mechanisms besides the escape and release mechanisms (Wang and Rinzel, 1992) might be needed for some cases of reciprocal inhibition, and show that, within the confines of a simple two-dimensional cell model, escape and releaseare sufficient for all cases. We divided the behaviors of a singlecell into six different types and examined the joint behaviors arising from every combination of pairs of cells with behaviors drawn from thesesix types. For the case of two quiescent cells or two cells eachhaving plateau potentials, bifurcation diagrams demonstrate therelations between synaptic threshold and synaptic strength necessaryfor oscillations by escape, oscillations by release, ornetwork-generated plateau potentials. Thus we clarify therelationship between plateau potentials and oscillations in a cell.Using the two dimensional cell model we examine 1:N beating betweencells and find that our simple model displays many of the essentialdynamical properties displayed by more sophisticated models, some ofwhich relate to thalamocortical spindling.	action potential;behavior;bifurcation diagram;bifurcation theory;dynamical system;neuron;neurons;plateau's problem;radiation of thalamus;spindling;synapses;synaptic package manager	Peter F.

Numerous volumetric, surface, regions of interest and voxelwise image processing techniques have been developed to statistically assess potential correlations between imaging and non-imaging metrices. Recently, biological parametric mapping has extended the widely popular statistical parametric mapping approach to enable application of the general linear model to multiple image modalities (both for regressors and regressands) along with scalar valued observations. This approach offers great promise for direct, voxelwise assessment of structural and functional relationships with multiple imaging modalities. However, as presented, the biological parametric mapping approach is not robust to outliers and may lead to invalid inferences (e.g., artifactual low p-values) due to slight mis-registration or variation in anatomy between subjects. To enable widespread application of this approach, we introduce robust regression and non-parametric regression in the neuroimaging context of application of the general linear model. Through simulation and empirical studies, we demonstrate that our robust approach reduces sensitivity to outliers without substantial degradation in power. The robust approach and associated software package provide a reliable way to quantitatively assess voxelwise correlations between structural and functional neuroimaging modalities.	anatomic structures;elegant degradation;functional gastrointestinal disorders;general linear model;image processing;neuroimaging;parametric polymorphism;region of interest;simulation;statistics, nonparametric	Xue Yang;Lori Beason-Held;Susan M.

There is however, a paucity of approaches that take into account more global holistic elements of the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism that augments the visual representation used to compute saliency. Inspired by research into biological vision, this strategy is one based on the role of recurrent computation in a visual processing hierarchy. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed model provides a manner of refining local saliency based computation based on the more global composition of a scene that is independent of semantic labeling or viewpoint. The results presented demonstrate that a fast recurrent mechanism significantly augments the determination of salient regions of interest as compared with a purely feed forward visual saliency architecture. This demonstration is applied to the problem of detecting targets of interest in various surveillance scenarios.	computation;holism;region of interest;sensor;visual hierarchy	Neil D. B.

The membrane depolarization in both models is described as a deterministic leaky integrator. Interspike intervals are identified with the periods between reset of the depolarization after firing and consecutive crossing of a fixed firing threshold. The two-point model has an input in the dendritic compartment and an output in the trigger-zone compartment. It is shown that the sensitivity threshold for the two-point model is shifted to the larger values of the input intensity with respect to the sensitivity threshold of its single-point counterpart. Further, its coding range is substantially larger than the coding range of the single-point model.	anatomical compartments;greater;large;multi-compartment model;neuron;membrane depolarization	Petr Lánský;Roger Rodriguez	1999	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s004220050552	psychology;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;control theory;mathematics;multi-compartment model	ML	18.21280464091396	-72.02561785561188	121428
0c22b0e06cf95f50636ca8c2d342d1bbb60ce39f	interactions between astrocytes and the reward-attention circuit: a model for attention focusing in the presence of nicotine		Abstract Recent studies in neurophysiology suggest that astrocytes—a specific type of glial cells in the central nervous system—perform dynamical signaling, integrating neural inputs and regulating synaptic transmissions. This work presents a mathematical model for bidirectional signaling between astrocytes and neurons, investigating the functional role of such glial cells in a neural network that simulates the influence of nicotine on attentional focus. Considering the neurons’ firing frequency as an indicator of analysis, our results indicate that the tripartite synaptic transmission substantially changes the network activity, in comparison to the bipartite synapse. In addition, we show that this effect occurs specifically due to inclusion of astrocytes, corroborating experimental findings that show astrocytes improve of transmission performance in neural networks. Moreover, our simulations contribute to a better understanding of the astrocytary role in brain function and of synaptic transmission in a neuroglia network.	interaction	Karine Guimarães;Daniele Q.

A feedforward–feedbackward architecture has been developed for recognising visual landmarks in real time. It integrates the theoretical concepts from the pre-attentive and attentive stages in the human visual system, the selective attention adaptive resonance theory neural network and its derivatives, and computational approaches towards object recognition in computer vision. The architecture mimics the pre-attentive and attentive stages in the context of object recognition, embedding neural network processing paradigm into a computational template-matching approach in computer vision. The real-time landmark recognition capability is achieved by mimicking the pre-attentive stage, where it models a selective attention mechanism for optimal computational resource allocation, focusing only on the regions of interest to address the computational restrictive nature of current computer processing power. Similarly, the recognition of visual landmarks in both clean and cluttered backgrounds is implemented in the attentive stage by developing a memory feedback modulation (MFM) mechanism that enables knowledge from the memory to interact and enhance the efficiency of earlier stages in the architecture. Furthermore, it also incorporates both top-down and bottom-up facilitatory and inhibition pathways between the memory and the earlier stages to enable the architecture to recognise a 2D landmark, which is partially occluded by adjacent features in the surroundings. The results show that the architecture is able to recognise objects in cluttered backgrounds using real-images in both indoor and outdoor scenes. Furthermore, the architecture application in autonomous robot navigation has been demonstrated through a number of real-time trials in both indoor and outdoor environments.	adaptive resonance theory;artificial neural network;autonomous robot;autonomy;clutter;computation;computational resource;computer vision;day and night (cellular automaton);embedded system;emulator;feedforward neural network;interaction;modulation;network processor;object-based language;outline of object recognition;programming paradigm;real-time clock;region of interest;robotic mapping;situated;top-down and bottom-up design;workspace	Quoc Do;Lakhmi C.

In the present work we develop the notion of “spatial” and “temporal interaction” which provides measures for statistical dependences in coupled stochastic processes like multiple unit spike trains. We show that the classical Willshaw network and Abeles’ synfire chain model both reveal a moderate spatial interaction, but only the synfire chain model reveals a positive temporal interaction, too. Systems that maximize temporal interaction are shown to be almost deterministic globally, but posses almost unpredictable firing behavior on the single unit level.	artificial neural network;computation;hebbian theory;information geometry;interaction;neural coding;observable;stochastic process;type signature	Thomas Wennekers;Nihat Ay	2003	Theory in Biosciences	10.1007/s12064-003-0034-y	stochastic process;information geometry;statistics	ML	21.56984788067116	-73.09306665594825	122063

Experimental research in novel and emerging computing paradigms and materials shows a great progress in designing laboratory prototypes of spatially extended computing devices. In these devices, computation is implemented by excitation waves and localisations in reaction-diffusion chemical media, geometrically constrained and compartmentalized excitable substrates, organic molecular assemblies, and gas-discharge systems. These unconventional computing substrates can be formally represented by Delaunay triangulations with excitable nodes. Thus, it is important to uncover most common types of excitation dynamics on the Delaunay diagrams. The purpose of this paper is to define excitable automata on Delaunay triangulation and demonstrate how to control a space-time dynamics of excitation on the triangulation using absolute and relative excitability thresholds. Design/methodology/approach – The paper modifies classical Greenberg-Hasting model to topology of Delaunay triangulations and considers not only a threshold of excitation but also a ratio of excited neighbours as an essential factor of nodes’ activation. Delaunay triangulations for various densities of nodes packaging are considered. Findings – The paper defines excitable automata on Delaunay triangulation and demonstrates how to control a space-time dynamics of excitation on the triangulation using absolute and relative excitability thresholds. The paper uncovers several interesting phenomena ranging from reaction of excitation waves by edge of triangulation to branching domains of activity guided by travelling localized excitations. Originality/value – The findings reported in the paper will contribute towards designs of novel computing substrates in non-crystalline structure. Also, automaton interpretation of activity dynamics on Delaunay triangulation can make a viable model of automaton-network approaches to design of nano-computing devices.	automaton;bernard greenberg;computation;computer;crystal structure;delaunay triangulation;discharger;excitable medium;gnu nano;unconventional computing;voronoi diagram	Andrew Adamatzky	2011	Kybernetes	10.1108/03684921111142278	discrete time and continuous time;combinatorics;delaunay triangulation;cybernetics;computer science;artificial intelligence;automation;geometry;algorithm	Networks	14.412034896667112	-71.69617058740457	122179

Recently, the location of the neural generators involved in increasing power within the beta (15-30 Hz) frequency band following movement (post-movement beta rebound, PMBR) has come into question [Parkes, L.M, Bastiaansen, M.C.M, Norris, D.G., 2006. Combining EEG and fMRI to investigate the post-movement beta rebound. NeuroImage 29, 685-696.]. We used the synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) spatial filtering method to identify the time course and location of oscillatory changes within the beta and mu (8-14 Hz) frequency bands during the performance of voluntary movements. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded from 10 adult subjects during abduction of the right index finger. Changes in beta and mu source power were calculated for periods during and following movement, relative to pre-movement baseline activity. Decreases in beta band activity (event-related desynchronization, ERD) were observed during movement, with a strong increase (PMBR) beginning 230+/-170 ms following movement, lasting for 680+/-170 ms. Mu band ERD was observed both during and following movement, with little to no post-movement rebound. Beta and mu ERD were localized bilaterally to the hand region of postcentral gyrus whereas PMBR was localized bilaterally to the hand region of precentral gyrus (motor cortex). Both PMBR and beta ERD were strongest contralateral to the side of movement. These results provide further evidence that movement influences independent cortical rhythms in sensorimotor areas, and confirm previous reports of precentral generators of PMBR in the region of motor cortex, with postcentral generators of beta and mu ERD during movement.	abductive reasoning;adrenergic beta-antagonists;aperture (software);bands;baseline (configuration management);cerebral cortex;electroencephalography;entity–relationship model;frequency band;hertz (hz);index finger;movement;precentral gyrus;sensorimotor cortex;structure of postcentral gyrus;synthetic intelligence	Michael T.

Models have attempted to operationalize interference in recognition memory as noise that accumulates over items in the study list, other contexts in which studied items have appeared, or a combination of both sources. Item noise models predict a list length effect. The list length effect has been eliminated in long-term recognition tasks. We demonstrate that the length effect may also be eliminated in short-term recognition (the Sternberg paradigm) if a filled delay is introduced. List length and recency effects were eliminated following an engaging 15 second distractor task.

The network has random and sparse connectivity, and we introduce a lateral inhibition via an anatomical constraint and synapse rein- forcement. The spiking dynamic follows the properties of Izhikevich spiking model. The learning involves association of a delayed stimulus pair to a re- sponse using reward modulated spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP). The proposed learning scheme has improved our initial work by allowing learning in a more dynamic and competitive environment. In this study, we show how a lateral inhibition between neuronal groups can be solved via synapse reinforcement based on reward modulated learning. Given a learn- ing setting with some degrees of correlation in spike patterns, during a response inter- val time, the proposed learning scheme first triggers the network inhibitory response groups to depress activations of their competitors, and then strengthens the connectiv- ity to its target excitatory response groups. The reinforcement signal is dependent on activation rate (i.e. firing activity) in response groups. The lateral inhibition results in stronger synapses in both target inhibitory and excitatory pathways.	lateral computing;lateral thinking;spiking neural network	Nooraini Yusoff;Farzana Kabir Ahmad	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-12637-1_41	random neural network;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	ML	18.972316121906434	-70.76556255758607	122646

In this article, we propose a novel plausible model, namely cellular Bayesian networks (CBNs), to model the process of visual perception. The new model takes advantage of both the low-level visual features, such as colors, textures, and shapes, of target objects and the interrelationship between the known objects, and integrates them into a Bayesian framework, which possesses both firm theoretical foundation and wide practical applications. The novel model successfully overcomes some weakness of traditional Bayesian Network (BN), which prohibits BN being applied to large-scale cognitive problem. The experimental simulation also demonstrates that the CBNs model outperforms purely Bottom-up strategy 6% or more in the task of shape recognition. Finally, although the CBNs model is designed for visual perception, it has great potential to be applied to other areas as well.

This interaction between the spatially local and global properties of visual stimulation underlies many of our visual capacities, and how this is achieved in the brain is a central question for visual and cognitive neuroscience. Here, we examine the sensitivity of regions of the posterior human brain to the global coordination of spatially displaced naturalistic image patches. We presented observers with image patches in two circular apertures to the left and right of central fixation, with the patches drawn from either the same (coherent condition) or different (noncoherent condition) extended image. Using fMRI at 7T (n = 5), we find that global coherence affected signal amplitude in regions of dorsal mid-level cortex. Furthermore, we find that extensive regions of mid-level visual cortex contained information in their local activity pattern that could discriminate coherent and noncoherent stimuli. These findings indicate that the global coordination of local naturalistic image information has important consequences for the processing in human mid-level visual cortex.	cerebral cortex;cognition disorders;coherence (physics);computational neuroscience;contain (action);neuroscience discipline;patch (computing);photic stimulation;fmri	Damien J.

However, recent studies suggest that at least part of this selectivity stems from low-level differences inherent to images of the different categories. For example, visual outdoor and indoor scenes as well as houses differ in spatial frequency, rectilinearity and obliqueness when compared to face or object images. Correspondingly, scene responsive para-hippocampal place area (PPA) showed strong preference to low-level properties of visual scenes also in the absence of high-level scene content. This raises the question whether all high-level responses in PPA, the fusiform face area (FFA), or the object-responsive lateral occipital compex (LOC) may actually be explained by systematic differences in low-level features. In the present study we contrasted two classes of simple stimuli consisting of ten rectangles each. While both were matched in visual low-level features only one class of rectangle arrangements gave rise to a percept compatible with a high-level 3D layout such as a scene or an object. We found that areas PPA, transverse occipital sulcus (TOS, also referred to as occipital place area, OPA), as well as FFA and LOC showed robust responses to the visual scene class compared to the low-level matched control. Our results suggest that visual category responsive regions are not purely driven by low-level visual features but also by the high-level perceptual stimulus interpretation.	altered level of consciousness;cdisc sdtm anatomical location terminology;categories;class;face;groove;hearing loss, high-frequency;high- and low-level;hypothalamic area, lateral;lateral computing;lateral thinking;nonesterified fatty acids;occipital lobe;opa;physical object;selectivity (electronic);source lines of code;thoracic outlet syndrome;transverse wave;transverse occipital sulcus (human only)	Andreas Schindler;Andreas Bartels	2016	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.03.011	psychology;computer vision;communication;social psychology	HCI	17.07120677315419	-75.88075059950842	123007

This specialization of function might be expected to lead to differences in the large-scale functional interactions of early cortical areas that represent central and peripheral visual space. Here, we characterize differences in whole-brain functional connectivity among sectors in primary visual cortex (V1) corresponding to central, near-peripheral, and far-peripheral vision during resting fixation. Importantly, our analyses reveal that eccentricity sectors in V1 have different functional connectivity with non-visual areas associated with large-scale brain networks. Regions associated with the fronto-parietal control network are most strongly connected with central sectors of V1, regions associated with the cingulo-opercular control network are most strongly connected with near-peripheral sectors of V1, and regions associated with the default mode and auditory networks are most strongly connected with far-peripheral sectors of V1. Additional analyses suggest that similar patterns are present during eyes-closed rest. These results suggest that different types of visual information may be prioritized by large-scale brain networks with distinct functional profiles, and provide insights into how the small-scale functional specialization within early visual regions such as V1 relates to the large-scale organization of functionally distinct whole-brain networks.	area striata structure;cerebral cortex;default;distance (graph theory);eye;interaction;large scale brain networks;partial template specialization;peripheral vision;rest;resting state fmri;strongly connected component	Joseph C.

5c715a5bfd6bf2c9dd82e058796cebff77685502	refining interaction search through signed iterative random forests		Advances in supervised learning have enabled accurate prediction in biological systems governed by complex interactions among biomolecules. However, state-of-the-art predictive algorithms are typically “black-boxes,” learning statistical interactions that are difficult to translate into testable hypotheses. The iterative Random Forest (iRF) algorithm took a step towards bridging this gap by providing a computationally tractable procedure to identify the stable, high-order feature interactions that drive the predictive accuracy of Random Forests (RF). Here we refine the interactions identified by iRF to explicitly map responses as a function of interacting features. Our method, signed iRF (s-iRF), describes “subsets” of rules that frequently occur on RF decision paths. We refer to these “rule subsets” as signed interactions. Signed interactions share not only the same set of interacting features but also exhibit similar thresholding behavior, and thus describe a consistent functional relationship between interacting features and responses. We describe stable and predictive importance metrics (SPIMs) to rank signed interactions in terms of their stability, predictive accuracy, and strength of interaction. For each SPIM, we define null importance metrics that characterize its expected behavior under known structure. We evaluate our proposed approach in biologically inspired simulations and two case studies: predicting enhancer activity and spatial gene expression patterns. In the case of enhancer activity, s-iRF recovers one of the few experimentally validated high-order interactions and suggests novel enhancer elements where this interaction may be active. In the case of spatial gene expression patterns, s-iRF recovers all 11 reported links in the gap gene network. By refining the process of interaction recovery, our approach has the potential to guide mechanistic inquiry into systems whose scale and complexity is beyond human comprehension.	algorithm;biological system;black box;bridging (networking);cobham's thesis;experiment;gene co-expression network;gene regulatory network;interaction;iterative method;list comprehension;radio frequency;random forest;spim;simulation;supervised learning;thresholding (image processing)	Karl Kumbier;Sumanta Basu;James B.

8ab84f139ba3a6139d18e667895cdf79ded29467	functional clustering of the human inferior parietal lobule by whole-brain connectivity mapping of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals	supramarginal gyrus;female;neural pathways;fmri;middle aged;adolescent;male;angular gyrus;rest;inferior parietal lobule;intraparietal sulcus;brain mapping;resting state functional connectivity;adult;magnetic resonance imaging;parietal lobe;nerve net;humans;young adult	The human inferior parietal lobule (IPL) comprised the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus, angular gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus, defined on the basis of anatomical landmarks and cytoarchitectural organization of neurons. However, it is not clear as to whether the three areas represent functional subregions within the IPL. For instance, imaging studies frequently identified clusters of activities that cut across areal boundaries. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to examine how individual voxels within the IPL are best clustered according to their connectivity to the whole brain. The results identified a best estimate of seven clusters that are hierarchically arranged as the anterior, middle, and posterior subregions. The anterior, middle, and posterior IPL are each significantly connected to the somatomotor areas, superior/middle/inferior frontal gyri, and regions of the default mode network. This functional segregation is supported by recent cytoarchitechtonics and tractography studies. IPL showed hemispheric differences in connectivity that accord with a predominantly left parietal role in tool use and language processing and a right parietal role in spatial attention and mathematical cognition. The functional clusters may also provide a more parsimonious and perhaps even accurate account of regional activations of the IPL during a variety of cognitive challenges, as reported in earlier fMRI studies.	angularjs;cognition;default;groove;inferior parietal lobule;interphase cell;lateral thinking;magnetic resonance imaging;mathematics;medical imaging;motor cortex;occam's razor;rest;structure of angular gyrus;structure of intraparietal sulcus;voxel;fmri;statistical cluster	Sheng Zhang;Chiang-shan Ray Li	2014	Brain connectivity	10.1089/brain.2013.0191	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;anatomy	AI	20.442842687771	-78.43725204378745	123394
afc65ac26b343ebceb71c229abf3f3864d7c99b9	pre-clinical characterization of [<ce:sup loc=pre>11</ce:sup>c]r05013853 as a novel radiotracer for imaging of the glycine transporter type 1 by positron emission tomography	bitopertin;pet;glycine transporter type 1 glyt1;autoradiography;schizophrenia;rg1678	A specific positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for the glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1) would constitute an imaging biomarker to investigate the distribution of GlyT1 in normal individuals and those with neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition it could demonstrate the ability of a novel drug to reach its target in the brain and enable receptor occupancy studies, thus facilitating drug development. In this article we describe the evaluation in non-human primates of two candidate PET radiotracers ([(11)C]RO5013852 and [(11)C]RO5013853) previously characterized in the rat. Both radiotracers showed acceptable uptake in the baboon brain and heterogeneous distribution consistent with that reported for GlyT1. In vivo blockade studies with two specific glycine reuptake inhibitors (GRIs), RO5013853 and bitopertin (RG1678, reduced uptake of both tracers to homogenous levels across brain regions and demonstrated specificity of the signal. [(11)C]RO5013853 showed a larger specific signal and slightly higher brain uptake and was therefore selected for further characterization. Quantitative compartmental analysis of PET data showed that the 2-tissue compartment model with 5 parameters was the most appropriate to describe the kinetics of [(11)C]RO5013853. Two additional methods were used: a) the Logan graphical analysis using plasma input and, b) a linear parametric imaging approach with the 2-tissue compartmental model. These produced VT estimates of comparable magnitude, namely, pons, thalamus and cerebellum>caudate, putamen and cortical regions. High resolution autoradiography with tritiated RO5013853 was used to confirm the binding pattern observed by PET. In vivo metabolism studies in the baboon demonstrated the formation of a single, radiolabeled metabolite more polar than the parent compound. Finally, [(11)C]RO5013853 was used to quantify the degree of cerebral GlyT1 occupancy observed in the baboon following oral administration of bitopertin, a selective GRI presently in Phase III clinical trial. Plasma concentrations of approximately 150-300 ng/mL were estimated to produce 50% GlyT1 occupancy in the thalamus, the cerebellum and the pons. [(11)C]RO5013853 is a promising radiotracer for in vivo imaging of the GlyT1. It can be easily radiolabeled, exhibits moderate metabolism, displays a good specific signal, and is suitable for receptor occupancy studies of therapeutic compounds that target the GlyT1. The successful characterization of [(11)C]RO5013853 in healthy volunteers is presented in this NeuroImage issue (Wong et al., 2013).	administration, oral;anatomical compartments;autoradiography;biological markers;ct scan;cerebellum;childhood cerebral astrocytoma;digital pet;emoticon;estimated;exhibits as topic;genetic heterogeneity;graphical user interface;gri;in vivo imaging;kinetics internet protocol;large;multi-compartment model;pet/ct scan;paper;papio;plasma active;polyethylene terephthalate;pontine structure;positron-emission tomography;positrons;rg 1678;slc6a9 gene;snap25 wt allele;schizophrenia;sensitivity and specificity;structure of putamen;thalamic structure;tomography, emission-computed;tracer;video-in video-out;bitopertin;drug development;glycine transporter;nervous system disorder;radiotracer	Edilio Borroni;Yun Zhou;Susanne Ostrowitzki;Daniela Alberati;Anil Kumar;Dominik Hainzl;Thomas Hartung;John Hilton;Robert F.

Hopfield & Herz showed that, with the assumption of instantaneous ignal transmission, locally connected networks converge to periodic, synchronized oscillations. We verify these results as well as study their robustness when signal transmission delays are introduced. Our simulation results are consistent with the theoretical work of Gerstner (1996) but the simulation studies offer intuitions not apparent in the theorems. In particular, the simulations reveal that volleys of synchronized firing travel across the network in waves.	artificial neural network;converge;emergence;hopfield network;simulation;transmission (bittorrent client);volley theory	Anthony S.

This processing requires mechanisms that can route neuronal activity across weakly connected cortical regions. Routing models proposed thus far are either limited to propagation of spiking activity across strongly connected networks or require distinct mechanisms that create local oscillations and establish their coherence between distant cortical areas. Here, we propose a novel mechanism which explains how synchronous spiking activity propagates across weakly connected brain areas supported by oscillations. In our model, oscillatory activity unleashes network resonance that amplifies feeble synchronous signals and promotes their propagation along weak connections (""""communication through resonance""""). The emergence of coherent oscillations is a natural consequence of synchronous activity propagation and therefore the assumption of different mechanisms that create oscillations and provide coherence is not necessary. Moreover, the phase-locking of oscillations is a side effect of communication rather than its requirement. Finally, we show how the state of ongoing activity could affect the communication through resonance and propose that modulations of the ongoing activity state could influence information processing in distributed cortical networks."""	coherence (physics);connectivity (graph theory);emergence;information processing;lock (computer science);neural oscillation;requirement;resonance;routing;software propagation;strongly connected component	Gerald Hahn;Alejandro F.

f63ee363ee2d6cf6dee2e316e5d9472bad4f9e21	reinforcement learning and dopamine in the striatum: a modeling perspective	basal ganglia;actor critic;dopamine;ltd;ltp	The recent research evidences show that dopamine (DA) system in the brain is involved in various functions like reward-related learning, exploration, preparation, and execution in goal directed behavior. It is suggested that dopaminergic neurons provide a prediction error akin to the error computed in the temporal difference learning (TDL) models of reinforcement learning (RL). Houk et al. (1995) proposed a biochemical model in the spine head of neurons at the striatum in the basal ganglia which generates and uses neural signals to predict reinforcement. The model explains how the DA neurons are able to predict reinforcement and how output from these neurons might then be used to reinforce the behaviors that lead to primary reinforcement. They proposed a scheme drawing parallels between actor-critic architecture and dopamine activity in the basal ganglia. Houk et al. (1995) also proposed a biochemical model of interactions between protein molecules which supports learning earlier predictions of reinforcement in the spine head of medium spiny neurons at the striatum. However, Houk’s proposed cellular model fails to account for the time delay between the dopaminergic and glutamatergic activity required for reward-related learning and also fails to explain the ‘eligibility trace’ condition needed in delayed tasks of associative conditioning in which a memory trace of the antecedent signal is needed at the time of a succeeding reward. In this article, we review various models of RL with an emphasis on the cellular models of RL. In particular, we emphasize biochemical models of RL, and point out the future directions.	basal (phylogenetics);broadcast delay;cellular model;dopamine;ganglia;interaction;modeling perspective;parallels desktop for mac;reinforcement learning;temporal difference learning	Shesharao M.

Using event-related potentials in a priming adaptation of a Piaget-like numerical task taken from developmental psychology, we report a negative priming effect in adults measured just after the cognitive inhibition of a misleading strategy, the visuospatial length-equals-number bias. This effect was determined in the N200 information processing stage through increased N200 amplitude. We show here that for accuracy in numerical quantification, the adult brain still had to control the childlike cognition biases that are stored in a kind of developmental memory.	acclimatization;cognition;erp;information processing;numerical analysis;numerical method;piaget's theory of cognitive development;priming exercise;psychology, developmental;quantitation;spatial–temporal reasoning	Elsa Daurignac;Olivier Houdé;Roland Jouvent	2006	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2006.18.5.730	psychology;mental chronometry;event-related potential;cognition;developmental psychology;response priming;information processing;central nervous system;communication;social psychology;priming;cognitive science	ML	16.63100805587232	-76.87636337790838	123853

Defects in axonal transport result in peripheral neuropathies, some of which are caused by mutations in KIF5A, a gene encoding one of the heavy chain isoforms of conventional kinesin-1. Some mutations in KIF5A also cause severe central nervous system defects in humans. While transport dynamics in the peripheral nervous system have been well characterized experimentally, transport in the central nervous system is less experimentally accessible and until now not well described. Here we apply manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance (MEMRI) to study transport dynamics within the central nervous system, focusing on the hippocampal-forebrain circuit, and comparing kinesin-1 light chain 1 knock-out (KLC-KO) mice with age-matched wild-type littermates. We injected Mn2+ into CA3 of the posterior hippocampus and imaged axonal transport in vivo by capturing whole-brain 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI) in living mice at discrete time-points after injection. Precise placement of the injection site was monitored in both MR images and in histologic sections. Mn2+-induced intensity progressed along fiber tracts (fimbria and fornix) in both genotypes to the medial septal nuclei (MSN), correlating in location with the traditional histologic tract tracer, rhodamine dextran. Pairwise statistical parametric mapping (SPM) comparing intensities at successive time-points within genotype revealed Mn2+-enhanced MR signal as it proceeded from the injection site into the forebrain, the expected projection from CA3. By region of interest (ROI) analysis of the MSN, wide variation between individuals in each genotype was found. Despite this statistically significant intensity increases in the MSN at 6h post-injection was found in both genotypes, albeit less so in the KLC-KO. While the average accumulation at 6h was less in the KLC-KO, the difference between genotypes did not reach significance. Projections of SPM T-maps for each genotype onto the same grayscale image revealed differences in the anatomical location of significant voxels. Although KLC-KO mice had smaller brains than wild-type, the gross anatomy was normal with no apparent loss of septal cholinergic neurons. Hence anatomy alone does not explain the differences in SPM maps. We conclude that kinesin-1 defects may have only a minor effect on the rate and distribution of transported Mn2+ within the living brain. This impairment is less than expected for this abundant microtubule-based motor, yet such defects could still be functionally significant, resulting in cognitive/emotional dysfunction due to decreased replenishments of synaptic vesicles or mitochondria during synaptic activity. This study demonstrates the power of MEMRI to observe and measure vesicular transport dynamics in the central nervous system that may result from or lead to brain pathology.	amomum tsao-ko;anatomic structures;axonal transport;basal (phylogenetics);basal forebrain;brain fornix;ca3 field;cdisc sdtm anatomical location terminology;cns disorder;cell body of neuron;cholinergic neurons;cognition disorders;dos;deletion mutation;dextrans;experiment;genes, vif;genotype;grayscale color map;kif5a gene;klc1 gene;klc1 wt allele;kinesin;medial graph;microtubules;neural tube defects;peripheral nervous system;peripheral neuropathy;projections and predictions;prosencephalon;protein isoforms;region of interest;resonance;slc3a2 gene;septal nuclei;small;super paper mario;synaptic vesicles;tissue fiber;tracer;tract (literature);tree accumulation;vesicle (morphologic abnormality);video-in video-out;voxel;nervous system disorder;rhodamine dextran	Christopher S.

Traditionally, these patterns of causality are inferred from brain recordings using either non-parametric, i.e., model-free, or parametric, i.e., model-based, approaches. The latter approaches, when based on biophysically plausible models, have the advantage that they may facilitate the interpretation of causality in terms of underlying neural mechanisms. Recent biophysically plausible neural network models of recurrent microcircuits have shown the ability to reproduce well the characteristics of real neural activity and can be applied to model interacting cortical circuits. Unfortunately, however, it is challenging to invert these models in order to estimate effective connectivity from observed data. Here, we propose to use a classification-based method to approximate the result of such complex model inversion. The classifier predicts the pattern of causal interactions given a multivariate timeseries as input. The classifier is trained on a large number of pairs of multivariate timeseries and the respective pattern of causal interactions, which are generated by simulation from the neural network model. In simulated experiments, we show that the proposed method is much more accurate in detecting the causal structure of timeseries than current best practice methods. Additionally, we present further results to characterize the validity of the neural network model and the ability of the classifier to adapt to the generative model of the data.	approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;best practice;bivariate data;causal filter;causality;entity name part qualifier - adopted;experiment;film-type patterned retarder;generative model;giant cell arteritis;greater than;inference;interaction;logistic regression;manuscripts;network model;neural network simulation;nonlinear system;sensor;structure of diencephalon;time complexity;time series;exponential	Emanuele Olivetti;Danilo Benozzo;Jan Bím;Stefano Panzeri;Paolo Avesani	2018		10.3389/fncom.2018.00038	time series;machine learning;artificial neural network;causal structure;network model;generative model;parametric statistics;multivariate statistics;artificial intelligence;causality;computer science	ML	22.071123965127452	-74.36929783629573	123967

They have been shown to act as stretch receptors in passive muscle, however, during active movements their behavior is less clear. In particular, spindle responses have been shown to be out-of-phase or phase advanced with respect to their expected muscle length-sensitivity. Whether this apparent discrepancy of spindle responses between passive and active movements is due to fusimotor (γ-drive) remains unresolved, since the activity of fusimotor neurons during voluntary non-locomotor movements are largely unknown. We developed a computational model to predict fusimotor activity and to investigate whether fusimotor activity could explain the empirically observed phase advance of spindle responses. The model links a biomechanical wrist model to length- and γ-drive-dependent transfer functions of type Ia and type II muscle spindle activity. Our simulations of two wrist-movement tasks suggest that (i) experimentally observed type Ia and type II activity profiles can to a large part be explained by appropriate, i.e. strongly modulated and task-dependent, γ-drive. That (ii) the empirically observed phase advance of type Ia or of type II profiles during active movement can be similarly explained by appropriate γ-drive. In summary, the simulation predicts that a highly task-modulated activation of the γ-system is instrumental in producing a large part of the empirically observed muscle spindle activity for voluntary wrist movements.	computation;computational model;diabetes mellitus, non-insulin-dependent;discrepancy function;experiment;hard disk drive;modulation;motor neurons, gamma;movement;muscle spindles;simulation;spindle;stretch receptors;transfer function;velocity (software development)	Bernard Grandjean;Marc A.

Antero-mesial temporal structures are the site of early pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease and have been shown to be critical for declarative memory. Our study aimed at exploring the functional impact of basal connectivity of an anterior temporal network (ATN) on declarative memory. A heterogeneous group of subjects with varying performance on tasks assessing memory was therefore selected, including healthy subjects and patients with isolated memory complaint, amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using Independent Component Analysis on resting-state fMRI, we extracted a relevant anterior temporal network (ATN) composed of the perirhinal and entorhinal cortex, the hippocampal head, the amygdala and the lateral temporal cortex extending to the temporal pole. A default mode network and an executive-control network were also selected to serve as control networks. We first compared basal functional connectivity of the ATN between patients and control subjects. Relative to controls, patients exhibited significantly increased functional connectivity in the ATN during rest. Specifically, voxel-based analysis revealed an increase within the inferior and superior temporal gyrus and the uncus. In the patient group, positive correlations between averaged connectivity values of ATN and performance on anterograde and retrograde object-based memory tasks were observed, while no correlation was found with other evaluated cognitive measures. These correlations were specific to the ATN, as no correlation between performance on memory tasks and the other selected networks was found. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that basal connectivity inside the ATN network has a functional role in object-related, context-free memory. They also suggest that increased connectivity at rest within the ATN could reflect compensatory mechanisms that occur in response to early pathological insult.	alzheimer's disease;amygdaloid structure;basal (phylogenetics);cell respiration;cerebral cortex;cognition disorders;coherence (physics);context-free language;default;dependent type;epilepsy, temporal lobe;extraction;genetic heterogeneity;hippocampus (brain);independent component analysis;interphase cell;lateral thinking;magnetic resonance imaging;memory disorders;object-based language;occur (action);pathological conditions, anatomical;patients;rest;resting state fmri;spontaneous order;superior temporal gyrus;voxel	Natalina Gour;Jean-Philippe Ranjeva;Mathieu Ceccaldi;Sylviane Confort-Gouny;Emmanuel J.

However, available maps from previous literature show a substantial overlap of cortical areas activated by these stimuli, and the region referred to as the """"secondary somatosensory area (SII)"""" is widely distributed in the parietal operculum. Differentiating SII from posterior insula cortex, which is anatomically contiguous, is not easy, explaining why the """"operculo-insular"""" label has been introduced to describe activations by somatosensory stimuli in this cortical region. Based on the recent cyto-architectural parcellation of the human insular/SII cortices (Eickhoff et al., 2006, Kurth et al., 2010), the present study investigates with functional MRI (fMRI), whether these structural subdivisions could subserve distinct aspects of discriminative somato-sensory functions, including pain. Responses to five types of stimuli applied on the left hand of 25 healthy volunteers were considered: i) tactile stimuli; ii) passive movements; iii) innocuous cold stimuli; iv) non-noxious warm and v) heat pain. Our results show different patterns of activation depending on the type of somato-sensory stimulation. The posterior part of SII (OP1 area), contralateral to stimuli, was the only sub-region activated by all type of stimuli and might therefore be considered as a common cortical target for different types of somato-sensory inputs. Proprioceptive stimulation by passive finger movements activated the posterior part of SII (OP1 sub-region) bilaterally and the contralateral median part of insula (PreCG and MSG). Innocuous cooling activated the contralateral posterior part of SII (OP1) and the dorsal posterior and median part of insula (OP2, PostCG). Pain stimuli induced the most widespread and intense activation that was bilateral in SII (OP1, OP4) and distributed to all sub-regions of contralateral insula (except OP2) and to the anterior part of the ipsilateral insula (PreCG, MSG, ASG). However, the posterior granular part of insula contralateral to stimulus (Ig area) and the anterior part of SII bilaterally (OP4) were specifically activated during pain stimulation. This raises the question whether these latter areas could be the anatomical substrate of the sensory-discriminative processing of thermal pain."""	asg software solutions;bilateral filter;cerebral cortex;chorea;computer cooling;cool - action;emoticon;esthesia;insula of reil;map;movement;pain;sodium glutamate;tcea1 gene;tcea1 wt allele;fmri	Laure Mazzola;Isabelle Faillenot;Fabrice-Guy Barral;François Mauguière;Roland Peyron	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.12.072	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;insula;communication	ML	18.350942420773947	-78.2784415934271	124320
4f40d2cbee7a5efc1a6e3d282bdd7effd1a760f3	modeling perceptual learning with deep networks		The mechanisms underlying perceptual learning–how our brain changes as we gain competence in a perceptual task– remain a heavily debated topic. Since the early 2000’s, a number of authors have proposed competing theories on the loci of change for visual perceptual learning, ranging from V1, V4, to areas beyond the visual cortex associated with decision making processes (Dosher and Lu, 1998; Schoups, Vogels, et al., 2001).Instead of positing one loci of change in the brain, we argue that gradient descent can serve as an explicit learning rule to determine the loci of change. We show that a deep neural network trained with error-correcting backpropagation can reproduce a variety of results from neurobiology experiments, explaining both the detailed changes in neural representations in each layer, and the relative magnitude of changes seen in different levels of the visual hierarchy.

4436c320d2fd73e8ec670acfcce5556cd0761a39	acceptance of evidence-supported hypotheses generates a stronger signal from an underlying functionally-connected network		Choosing one's preferred hypothesis requires multiple brain regions to work in concert as a functionally connected network. We predicted that a stronger network signal would underlie cognitive coherence between a hypothesis and the available evidence. In order to identify such functionally connected networks in magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, we first localized the generators of changes in oscillatory power within three frequency bands, namely alpha (7-13 Hz), beta (18-24 Hz), and theta (3-7 Hz), with a spatial resolution of 5mm and temporal resolution of 50 ms. We then used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify functionally connected networks reflecting co-varying post-stimulus changes in power. As predicted, PCA revealed a functionally connected network with a stronger signal when the evidence supported accepting the hypothesis being judged. This difference was driven by beta-band power decreases in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and midline occipital cortex.	bands;cingulate cortex;dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;frequency band;hertz (hz);magnetoencephalography;occipital lobe;portable c compiler;principal component analysis;ventromedial prefrontal cortex	J.

2453117e5e32d1fdad4e4b2e1df2ac1093e2198c	vanishing point attracts gaze in free-viewing and visual search tasks	gaze;attention;visual search;pixel	Several structural scene cues such as gist, layout, horizontal line, openness, and depth have been shown to guide scene perception (e.g., Oliva & Torralba, 2001); Ross & Oliva, 2009). Here, to investigate whether vanishing point (VP) plays a significant role in gaze guidance, we ran two experiments. In the first one, we recorded fixations of 10 observers (six male, four female; mean age 22; SD = 0.84) freely viewing 532 images, out of which 319 had a VP (shuffled presentation; each image for 4 s). We found that the average number of fixations at a local region (80 × 80 pixels) centered at the VP is significantly higher than the average fixations at random locations (t test; n = 319; p < 0.001). To address the confounding factor of saliency, we learned a combined model of bottom-up saliency and VP. The AUC (area under curve) score of our model (0.85; SD = 0.01) is significantly higher than the base saliency model (e.g., 0.8 using attention for information maximization (AIM) model by Bruce & Tsotsos, 2005, t test; p = 3.14e-16) and the VP-only model (0.64, t test; p < 0.001). In the second experiment, we asked 14 subjects (10 male, four female; mean age 23.07, SD = 1.26) to search for a target character (T or L) placed randomly on a 3 × 3 imaginary grid overlaid on top of an image. Subjects reported their answers by pressing one of the two keys. Stimuli consisted of 270 color images (180 with a single VP, 90 without). The target happened with equal probability inside each cell (15 times L, 15 times T). We found that subjects were significantly faster (and more accurate) when the target appeared inside the cell containing the VP compared to cells without the VP (median across 14 subjects 1.34 s vs. 1.96 s; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p = 0.0014). These findings support the hypothesis that vanishing point, similar to face, text (Cerf, Frady, & Koch, 2009), and gaze direction Borji, Parks, & Itti, 2014) guides attention in free-viewing and visual search tasks.	aim alliance;area under curve;color;eighty;expectation–maximization algorithm;experiment;fixation - action;gist;imaginary time;koch snowflake;occur (action);olivary nucleus;openness;physiological sexual disorders;pixel;randomness;vanishing point;t test	Ali Borji;Mengyang Feng;Huchuan Lu	2016	Journal of vision	10.1167/16.14.18	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;attention;visual search;communication;pixel	HCI	13.303678269266443	-76.12455531484619	124576

We begin by formally analyzing the stability of the proportional-derivative (PD) model of smooth pursuit eye movements using Pontryagin's theory. The PD model is the linearized version of the nonlinear Krauzlis-Lisberger (KL) model. We show that the PD model fails to account for the experimentally observed dependence of the eye velocity damping ratio and the oscillation period on the total delay in the feedback loop. To explain the data, a new ‘tachometer’ feedback model, based on an efference copy signal of eye acceleration, is proposed and analyzed by computer simulation. The model predicts some salient features of monkey pursuit data and suggests a functional role for the extraretinal input to the medial superior temporal area (MST).	computer simulation;epilepsy, temporal lobe;experiment;eye movements;feedback;ising model;medial graph;movement;nonlinear system;proportional hazards models;pursuit, smooth;tachometer;velocity (software development)	Dario L.

A large literature reports that motion processing and magnocellular visual function is selectively deficient in dyslexia. A smaller literature reports enhancements in such functions in deaf individuals. However, studies with dyslexic and deaf individuals have used different experimental paradigms to assess visual function, and no research has yet examined both sides of modifiability (i.e., enhancements and deficits) using the same experimental paradigm. In the present research, visual function was compared in dyslexic (n = 15), deaf (n = 17), and control adults by using automated peripheral kinetic and foveal static perimetry. In the kinetic perimetry task, the dyslexic group showed deficits ( p < .003), whereas the deaf group showed enhancements ( p < .001) for detecting moving light points in the periphery. In the foveal static perimetry task, neither the dyslexic ( p = .866) nor the deaf ( p = .632) group differed significantly from controls in foveal contrast sensitivity thresholds, and no group or individual approached ceiling performance on this task. Taken together, the present data bridge previous literatures and suggest that motion processing tasks are selectively modifiable, either to decrement or enhancement, whereas foveal contrast sensitivity does not differ in dyslexic or deaf groups.	developmental disabilities;dyslexia;experience;hearing impaired persons;increment and decrement operators;kinetic monte carlo;kinetics;language development disorders;literature;neuronal plasticity;perimetry;peripheral;programming paradigm;sensor;small;vision	Courtney Stevens;Helen J.

By combining parametric manipulation of a primary reward, medial forebrain bundle (MFB) microstimulation, with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) in rodents, we delineated a broad network of structures activated by behaviorally characterized levels of rewarding stimulation. Correlation of psychometric behavioral measurements with fMRI response magnitudes revealed regions whose activity corresponded closely to the subjective magnitude of rewards. The largest and most reliable focus of reward magnitude tracking was observed in the shell region of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Although the nonlinear nature of neurovascular coupling complicates interpretation of fMRI findings in precise neurophysiological terms, reward magnitude tracking was not observed in vascular compartments and could not be explained by saturation of region-specific hemodynamic responses. In addition, local pharmacological inactivation of NAc changed the profile of animals' responses to rewards of different magnitudes without altering mean reward response rates, further supporting a hypothesis that neural population activity in this region contributes to assessment of reward magnitudes.	anatomical compartments;hemodynamics;largest;medial graph;neostriatum;neural ensemble;neurovascular coupling;nonlinear system;nucleus accumbens;pharmacology;population;prosencephalon;rewards;rodent;structure of median forebrain bundle;ventral striatum;fmri	Ana M.

4e8e86d7be6c5d0754f67cb3190777c982fa477a	supermodeling in simulation of melanoma progression		Supermodeling is an interesting and non-standard concept used recently for simulation of complex and non-linear systems such as climate and weather dynamics. It consists in coupling of a few imperfect sub-models to create the superior supermodel. We discuss here the supermodeling strategy in the context of tumor growth simulation. To check its adaptive flexibility we have developed a basic, but still computationally complex, 3-D modeling framework of melanoma growth. The supermodel of melanoma consists of a few coupled sub-models, which differ in values of a parameter responsible for tumor cells and extracellular matrix interactions. We demonstrate that due to synchronization of submodels, the supermodel is able to simulate qualitatively different scenarios of cancer growth than those observed for sub-models when run separately. These scenarios correspond to the basic types of melanoma cancer. This property makes the supermodel very flexible to follow and to predict real cases of melanoma development through learning the coupling coefficients between sub-models from real data. On the basis of preliminary simulation results, we discuss the prospects of supermodeling strategy as a promising coupling factor between formal and data-based models of tumor.	3d modeling;coefficient;color gradient;interaction;linear system;nonlinear system;simulation	Witold Dzwinel;Adrian Klusek;Oleg V.

This response is so powerful that modulations in spatial attention can occur automatically without conscious awareness. Functional neuroimaging research suggests that the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) form a network involved in the rapid orienting of attention to threat. A hyper-responsive attention bias to threat is a common component of anxiety disorders. Yet, little is known of how individual differences in underlying brain morphometry relate to variability in attention bias to threat. Here, we performed two experiments using dot-probe tasks that measured individuals' attention bias to backward masked fearful faces. We collected whole-brain structural magnetic resonance images and used voxel-based morphometry to measure brain morphometry. We tested the hypothesis that reduced gray matter within the amygdala and ACC would be associated with reduced attention bias to threat. In Experiment 1, we found that backward masked fearful faces captured spatial attention and that elevated attention bias to masked threat was associated with greater ACC gray matter volumes. In Experiment 2, this association was replicated in a separate sample. Thus, we provide initial and replicating evidence that ACC gray matter volume is correlated with biased attention to threat. Importantly, we demonstrate that variability in affective attention bias within the healthy population is associated with ACC morphometry. This result opens the door for future research into the underlying brain morphometry associated with attention bias in clinically anxious populations.	allocation;amygdaloid structure;anxiety disorders;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;backward compatibility;backward masking;blinded;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;dna replication;experiment;face;fear (mental process);functional gastrointestinal disorders;gray matter;heart rate variability;hyperactive behavior;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;neuroimaging;population;resonance;spatial variability;threat (computer);voxel	Joshua M.

As the mutual interaction between the two processes, mechano-electrical feedback (MEF), mediated by stretch-activated ionic channels, is considered. Analyses of the models show that coordination of beats among myocardial cells is established by MEF even in the absence of electrical coupling. The coordination of heartbeats is found to show in-phase synchronization under normal conditions, while it is out of phase or irregular under mechanically abnormal conditions. It is concluded that coupling by MEF is important for the self-organization of heartbeats.	ion channel;ionic;organizing (structure);self-organization;ventricular fibrillation	Shohei Hori;Yoko Yamaguchi;Hiroshi Shimizu	1999	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s004220050500	electronic engineering;real-time computing;coupling;self-organization;phase synchronization;computer science;engineering;mathematics;communication	SE	16.568824379873753	-72.16031074521747	126166
2576353f276ea9a754e3e2023b73f758b37dbf62	a framework for mobile robot navigation using a temporal population code		Recently, we have proposed that the dense local and sparse long-range connectivity of the visual cortex accounts for the rapid and robust transformation of visual stimulus information into a temporal population code, or TPC. In this paper, we combine the canonical cortical computational principle of the TPC model with two other systems: an attention system and a hippocampus model. We evaluate whether the TPC encoding strategy can be efficiently used to generate a spatial representation of the environment. We benchmark our architecture using stimulus input from a real-world environment. We show that the mean correlation of the TPC representation in two different positions of the environment has a direct relationship with the distance between these locations. Furthermore, we show that this representation can lead to the formation of place cells. Our results suggest that TPC can be efficiently used in a high complexity task such as robot navigation.	benchmark (computing);ibm tivoli storage productivity center;mobile robot;neural coding;robotic mapping;sparse matrix	Andre L.

In the longterm however, using LFPs for decoding presents some major challenges like inherent instability and non-stationarity. Our approach to overcome this challenge bases around the hypothesis that each task has a signature source-location pattern. The methodology involves introduction of source localization, and tracking of sources over a period of time that enables us to decode movement direction in an eight-direction center-out-reach-task. We establish that such tracking can be used for long term decoding, with preliminary results indicating consistent patterns. In fact, tracking task related source locations render up to 66% accuracy in decoding movement direction one week after the decoding model was learnt.	base;instability;least fixed point;stationary process	Vijay Aditya Tadipatri;Ahmed H.

That is, as neural activity is recorded in a visual area ---for instance the primary visual cortex of primates--- only a few neurons are active at a given time with respect to the whole population. It is believed that such a property reflects the efficient match of the representation with the statistics of natural scenes. Applying such a paradigm to computer vision therefore seems a promising approach towards more biomimetic algorithms. Herein, we will describe a biologically-inspired approach to this problem. First, we will describe an unsupervised learning paradigm which is particularly adapted to the efficient coding of image patches. Then, we will outline a complete multi-scale framework ---SparseLets--- implementing a biologically inspired sparse representation of natural images. Finally, we will propose novel methods for integrating prior information into these algorithms and provide some preliminary experimental results. We will conclude by giving some perspective on applying such algorithms to computer vision. More specifically, we will propose that bio-inspired approaches may be applied to computer vision using predictive coding schemes, sparse models being one simple and efficient instance of such schemes.	algorithm;biomimetics;british informatics olympiad;cognitive dimensions of notations;computation;computer vision;contour line;inferential theory of learning;leon;map;neural coding;neuromorphic engineering;population;programming paradigm;scott continuity;sparse approximation;sparse matrix;unsupervised learning;word lists by frequency	Laurent Perrinet	2017	CoRR	10.1002/9783527680863.ch14	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;sparse approximation;neural coding	Vision	21.598661842738274	-67.42407831386733	126773

For training, we applied repetitive focal electrical stimulation delivered at a low rate (Lt1/s). Stimulation was withdrawn when a desired SR success ratio was achieved. It has been shown elsewhere, and we verified that this training algorithm, named conditional repetitive stimulation (CRS), can be used to strengthen an initially weak SR. So far, it remained unclear what the role of the rest of the network during learning was. We therefore studied the effect of CRS on spontaneously occurring network bursts. To this end, we made profiles of the firing rates within network bursts. We have earlier shown that these profiles change shape on a time base of several hours during spontaneous development. We show here that profiles of summed activity, called burst profiles, changed shape at an increased rate during CRS. This suggests that the whole network was involved in making the changes necessary to incorporate the desired SR relationship. However, a local (path-specific) component to learning was also found by analyzing profiles of single-electrode-activity phase profiles. Phase profiles that were not part of the SR relationship changed far less during CRS than the phase profiles of the electrodes that were part of the SR relationship. Finally, the manner in which phase profiles changed shape varied and could not be linked to the SR relationship.	craniosynostosis;cumulative trauma disorders;electric stimulation therapy;focal (programming language);functional electrical stimulation;name;spontaneous order;algorithm;electrode	Jan Stegenga;Joost le Feber;Enrico Marani;Wim L.

543461c9fd05a0257da6a519b097689398aec84d	exploring functional connectivities of the human brain using multivariate information analysis		In this study, we present a new method for establishing fMRI pattern-based functional connectivity between brain regions by estimating their multivariate mutual information. Recent advances in the numerical approximation of highdimensional probability distributions allow us to successfully estimate mutual information from scarce fMRI data. We also show that selecting voxels based on the multivariate mutual information of local activity patterns with respect to ground truth labels leads to higher decoding accuracy than established voxel selection methods. We validate our approach with a 6-way scene categorization fMRI experiment. Multivariate information analysis is able to find strong information sharing between PPA and RSC, consistent with existing neuroscience studies on scenes. Furthermore, an exploratory whole-brain analysis uncovered other brain regions that share information with the PPA-RSC scene network.	approximation;categorization;convolutional code;entropy estimation;experiment;ground truth;map;medial graph;microsoft research;multivariate mutual information;numerical analysis;resting state fmri;voxel	Barry Chai;Dirk Bernhardt-Walther;Diane M.

The approach is based on the use of mathematical neuron models consisting of stochastic HH-like circuit, where the impairment of the endogenous presynaptic inputs is described as a subthreshold injected current and the exogenous stimulation signal is a sinusoidal voltage perturbation across the membrane. Our results indicate that a correlated Gaussian noise, added to the sinusoidal signal can significantly increase the encoding properties of the impaired system, through the Stochastic Resonance (SR) phenomenon. These results suggest that an exogenous noise, suitably tailored, could improve the efficacy of those stimulation techniques used in neuronal systems, where the presynaptic sensory neurons are impaired and have to be artificially bypassed.	afferent neuron;biological neuron model;electric stimulation technique;functional electrical stimulation;mathematics;normal statistical distribution;stochastic resonance;tissue membrane;omacetaxine mepesuccinate;voltage	Alessandra Paffi;Francesca Camera;Francesca Apollonio;Guglielmo D'Inzeo;Micaela Liberti	2015		10.3389/fncom.2015.00042	text mining;neuroscience;speech recognition;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication;stochastic resonance;detection theory	ML	19.78737377307578	-72.99856053406917	126919

The proposed method uses diffusion MRI tractography and a data-driven approach to find fiber clusters corresponding to subdivisions of the white matter anatomy. Features extracted from each fiber cluster describe its diffusion properties and are used for machine learning. The method is demonstrated by application to a pediatric neuroimaging dataset from 149 individuals, including 70 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 79 typically developing controls (TDC). A classification accuracy of 78.33% is achieved in this cross-validation study. We investigate the discriminative diffusion features based on a two-tensor fiber tracking model. We observe that the mean fractional anisotropy from the second tensor (associated with crossing fibers) is most affected in ASD. We also find that local along-tract (central cores and endpoint regions) differences between ASD and TDC are helpful in differentiating the two groups. These altered diffusion properties in ASD are associated with multiple robustly discriminative fiber clusters, which belong to several major white matter tracts including the corpus callosum, arcuate fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus and aslant tract; and the white matter structures related to the cerebellum, brain stem, and ventral diencephalon. These discriminative fiber clusters, a small part of the whole brain tractography, represent the white matter connections that could be most affected in ASD. Our results indicate the potential of a machine learning pipeline based on white matter fiber clustering.	anatomic structures;autism spectrum disorders;autistic disorder;body of uterus;brain stem;cerebellum;cluster analysis;communication endpoint;corpus callosum;cross-validation (statistics);extraction;fascicle - nerve fibers;fractional anisotropy;machine learning;neuroimaging;optical fiber;structure of diencephalon;tissue fiber;tract (literature);white matter;statistical cluster;triangulation	Peter Savadjiev;Tom Weidong Cai;Yang Song;Yogesh Rathi;Birkan Tunç;Drew Parker;Tina Kapur;Robert T.

A large representative class of drugs are classically modelled by Hill equations, and a specific case is discussed in this paper. The proposed model is validated in simulation against a classical model of drug effect for a specific case of hypnotic drug used in general anaesthesia: Propofol. The results support the validity of the proposed model and allow further improvements in the current use of such models. An important property of the model is that it allows prediction of the patient's response to drug infusion dynamic profiles and allows a smoother control sequence of drug profiles, i.e. a more suitable approach for model based predictive control strategies. A manifold of 1000 Monte Carlo simulations from generated data in closed loop control indicate the suitability of the model for continuous infusion drug management during hypnosis.	level of detail;monte carlo method;simulation;system identification	Clara M.

Both models respond to the the rate (derivative) and the rate history of the carotid sinus arterial pressure. As a result both the rate and the relative level of the carotid sinus arterial pressure is sensed. Simulations with these models show that responses to step changes in pressure follow from the rate sensitivity as observed in experimental studies. Adaptation and asymmetric responses are a consequence of the memory encapsulated by the models, and the nonlinearity gives rise to sigmoidal response curves. The nonlinear afferent baroreceptor models are coupled with an effector model, and the coupled model has been used to predict baroreceptor feedback regulation of heart rate during postural change from sitting to standing and during head-up tilt. The efferent model couples the afferent nerve paths to the sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow, and subsequently predicts the build up of an action potential at the sinus knot of the heart. In this paper, we analyze the nonlinear afferent model and show that the coupled model is able to predict heart rate regulation using blood pressure data as an input.		Johnny T. Ottesen;Mette S.

We find that item and associative information are retrieved concurrently, with positive memory evidence arising from a holistic match between the test pair and the contents of memory, in which both item and associative matches are pooled together into a single source. This retrieval architecture is inconsistent with both strictly serial processing and independence of item and associative information. Pooling of item and associative matches implies that while item and associative information may be separable, they are not qualitatively different, nor are qualitatively different processes (e.g., familiarity vs. recollection) used to retrieve these kinds of information.	bayesian network;holism	Gregory Cox;Amy H.

Each of these families consists of submodels differing in complexity of dynamics formulation or anatomical/geometrical resolution. The interaction of model systems reveals qualitatively varying results depending on the complexity of the involved models.

In the experiment reported here, participants completed long sums either with hands down—the low interactivity condition—or by moving numbered tokens—the high interactivity condition—while they repeated ‘the’ continuously, loading the phonological loop, or not. As expected, articulatory suppression substantially affected performance, but more so in the low interactivity condition. Independent measures of basic arithmetic skill and mathematics anxiety moderated the impact of articulatory suppression on performance in the low but not in the high interactivity condition. These findings suggest that working memory resources are augmented with interactivity, underscoring the importance of characterizing the properties of the system as it is configured by the dynamic agent-environment coupling.	interactive media;interactivity;zero suppression	Frédéric Vallée-Tourangeau;Miroslav Sirota;Gaëlle Vallée-Tourangeau	2016			cognitive psychology;interactivity;articulatory suppression;psychology	HCI	14.045363161096045	-78.00635216323964	127642

In this paper, we place the anatomically defined concept of columns into a functional context. It is provided by a large-scale computational hypothesis on visual recognition, which includes both, rapid parallel forward recognition, independent of any feedback prediction, and a feedback controlled refinement system. Short epochs of periodic clocking define a global reference time and introduce a discrete time for cortical processing which enables the combination of parallel categorization and sequential refinement. The presented model differs significantly from conventional neural network architectures and suggests a novel interpretation of the role of gamma oscillations and cognitive binding.	architecture as topic;artificial neural network;categorization;clock rate;column (database);computation (action);digital physics;model of computation;neocortex;neural network simulation;refinement (computing)	Edgar Körner;Marc-Oliver Gewaltig;Ursula Körner;Andreas Richter;Tobias Rodemann	1999	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/S0893-6080(99)00049-0	model of computation;vision;electrophysiology;discrete time and continuous time;systems modeling;cognition;visual system;information processing;visual perception;artificial intelligence;central nervous system;mathematical model;perception;computational neuroscience;artificial neural network	ML	20.763303865115674	-70.16520787493207	127809
4071f47d2f093ebc0a87bdd6a5914145cb271aab	dynamic combination of sensory and reward information under time pressure		When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.	choice behavior;computation;computational model;experiment;maximal set;modulation;response time (technology);rewards;simulation	Shiva Farashahi;Chih-Chung Ting;Chang-Hao Kao;Shih-Wei Wu;Alireza Soltani	2018		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006070	bioinformatics;computational model;perception;experimental economics;machine learning;biology;response time;cost–benefit analysis;sensory system;artificial intelligence;metacognition	AI	14.100838220903945	-74.71129720685421	127831

Our key idea is that episodes are encoded in WM as prepared sensorimotor routines: i.e. as prepared sequences of attentional and motor operations. Our network reproduces several experimental findings about the representation of prepared sequences in prefrontal cortex. Interpreted as a model of WM episode representations, it has useful applications in an account of long-term memory for episodes and in accounts of sentence processing.	artificial neural network;network model	Martin Takác;Alistair Knott	2013			cognitive psychology;psychology;artificial neural network;social psychology;developmental psychology;prefrontal cortex;working memory;sentence processing	ML	16.664787810906393	-74.3711850336336	127872

In addition, an efference copy can be also used to compare it with the actual sensory feedback in order to suppress self-generated sensations. Based on these biological findings, we conduct here two experimental studies on our biped “RunBot” where such principles together with neural forward models are applied to RunBot’s dynamic locomotion control. The main purpose of this article is to present the modular design of RunBot’s control architecture and discuss how the inherent dynamic properties of the different modules lead to the required signal processing. We believe that the experimental studies pursued here will sharpen our understanding of how the efference copies influence dynamic locomotion control to the benefit of modern neural control strategies in robots.	feedback;modular design;robot;signal processing	Poramate Manoonpong;Florentin Wörgötter	2009	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	10.1016/j.robot.2009.06.007	internal model;computer science;recurrent neural network;central nervous system;machine learning;signal processing;modular design	Robotics	16.481337046375845	-67.29835425083702	127951

Here we used fMRI to investigate where and how contextually related multiple objects were represented in the human ventral visual pathway. Specifically, we measured the responses in face-selective and body-selective regions along the ventral pathway when faces and bodies were presented either simultaneously or in isolation. We found that, in the posterior regions, the response for the face and body pair was the weighted average response for faces and bodies presented in isolation. In contrast, the anterior regions encoded the face and body pair in a mutually facilitative fashion, with the response for the pair significantly higher than that for its constituent objects. Furthermore, in the right fusiform face area, the face and body pair was represented as one inseparable object, possibly to reduce perceptual load and increase representation efficiency. Therefore, our study suggests that the visual system uses a hierarchical representation scheme to process multiple objects in natural scenes: the average mechanism in posterior regions helps retaining information of individual objects in clutter, whereas the nonaverage mechanism in the anterior regions uses the contextual information to optimize the representation for multiple objects.	clutter;face;gene regulatory network;isolation (database systems);physical object;separable polynomial;visual pathways;fmri	Yiying Song;Yu L.

One particularly useful paradigm for investigating inhibitory motor control is the Stop-signal task, where already-initiated responses to Go-stimuli are to be inhibited upon the rapid subsequent presentation of a Stop-stimulus (yielding successful and unsuccessful Stop-trials). Despite the extensive use of this paradigm in functional neuroimaging, there is no consensus on which functional comparison to use to characterize response-inhibition-related brain activity. Here, we utilize conjunction analyses of successful and unsuccessful Stop-trials that are each contrasted against a reference condition. This conjunction approach identifies processes common to both Stop-trial types while excluding processes specific to either, thereby capitalizing on the presence of some response-inhibition-related activity in both conditions. Using this approach on fMRI data from human subjects, we identify a network of brain structures that was linked to both types of Stop-trials, including lateral-inferior frontal and medial frontal cortical areas and the caudate nucleus. In addition, comparisons with a reference condition matched for visual stimulation identified additional activity in the right inferior parietal cortex that may play a role in enhancing the processing of the Stop-stimuli. Finally, differences in stopping efficacy across subjects were associated with variations in activity in the left anterior insula. However, this region was also associated with general task accuracy (which furthermore correlated directly with stopping efficacy), suggesting that it might actually reflect a more general mechanism of performance control that supports response inhibition in a relatively nonspecific way.	caudate nucleus structure;cell nucleus;cerebral cortex;circumscribe (action);electroencephalography;fail-stop;functional gastrointestinal disorders;http public key pinning;inhibition;insula of reil;lateral thinking;medial graph;neuroimaging;parietal lobe;photic stimulation;programming paradigm;sensitivity and specificity;fmri	Carsten Nicolas Boehler;Lawrence G.

However, the behavioral significance of this spontaneous activity has only begun to be investigated. Our previous studies have demonstrated that successful memory formation requires coordinated neural activity in a distributed memory network including the hippocampus and posteromedial cortices, specifically the precuneus and posterior cingulate (PPC), thought to be integral nodes of the default network. In this study, we examined whether intrinsic connectivity during the resting state between the hippocampus and PPC can predict individual differences in the performance of an associative memory task among cognitively intact older individuals. The intrinsic connectivity, between regions within the hippocampus and PPC that were maximally engaged during a subsequent memory fMRI task, was measured during a period of rest prior to the performance of the memory paradigm. Stronger connectivity between the hippocampal and posteromedial regions during rest predicted better performance on the memory task. Furthermore, hippocampal-PPC intrinsic connectivity was also significantly correlated with episodic memory measures on neuropsychological tests, but not with performance in non-memory domains. Whole-brain exploratory analyses further confirmed the spatial specificity of the relationship between hippocampal-default network posteromedial cortical connectivity and memory performance in older subjects. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that one of the functions of this large-scale brain network is to subserve episodic memory processes. Research is ongoing to determine if impaired connectivity between these regions may serve as a predictor of memory decline related to early Alzheimer's disease.	alzheimer's disease;coherent;content-addressable memory;default;distributed memory;electroencephalography;graph (discrete mathematics);kerrison predictor;memory disorders;neural oscillation;neuropsychological tests;programming paradigm;rest;resting state fmri;sensitivity and specificity;spontaneous order;structure of precuneus;wakefulness	Liang Wang;Peter LaViolette;Kelly O'Keefe;Deepti Putcha;Akram Bakkour;Koene R.

f06f947cb6d96becea8994bb5fcf7be9e9935b1b	alpha-frequency rhythms desynchronize over long cortical distances: a modeling study	mathematical analysis;network model	Neocortical networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons can display alpha(α)-frequency rhythms when an animal is in a resting or unfocused state. Unlike some γ- and β-frequency rhythms, experimental observations in cats have shown that these α-frequency rhythms need not synchronize over long cortical distances. Here, we develop a network model of synaptically coupled excitatory and inhibitory cells to study this asynchrony. The cells of the local circuit are modeled on the neurons found in layer V of the neocortex where α-frequency rhythms are thought to originate. Cortical distance is represented by a pair of local circuits coupled with a delay in synaptic propagation. Mathematical analysis of this model reveals that the h and T currents present in layer V pyramidal (excitatory) cells not only produce and regulate the α-frequency rhythm but also lead to the occurrence of spatial asynchrony. In particular, these inward currents cause excitation and inhibition to have nonintuitive effects in the network, with excitation delaying and inhibition advancing the firing time of cells; these reversed effects create the asynchrony. Moreover, increased excitatory to excitatory connections can lead to further desynchronization. However, the local rhythms have the property that, in the absence of excitatory to excitatory connections, if the participating cells are brought close to synchrony (for example, by common input), they will remain close to synchrony for a substantial time.	asynchronous i/o;direct inward dial;distance;excitation;neocortex;network model;neural oscillation;neurons;rest;software propagation;synaptic package manager;synaptic weight	Stephanie R.

One of the most challenging examples of this is extracting information from advected chemical plumes, which are governed by naturally turbulent unsteady flow, one of the very few remaining macroscopic physical phenomena that cannot be described using deterministic Newtonian mechanics. We describe a “synthetic moth” robotic platform that incorporates a real-time neuromorphic model of early olfactory processing in the moth brain (the macroglomerular complex) for extracting ratiometric information from chemical plumes. Separate analysis has shown that our neuromorphic model achieves rapid and efficient classification of ratiometrically encoded chemical blends by exploiting early phase chemosensor array transients, with execution times well beyond biological timescales. Here, we test our neuromorphic synthetic moth in a naturally turbulent chemical plume and demonstrate robust ratiometric communication of infochemical information.		Timothy C.

A pattern classifier, applied to voxels across a broad range of ventral temporal areas, discriminated the brain activity maps elicited in response to Asian versus Caucasian faces in the brains of both Asians and Caucasians.

First, we propose a zero-phase whitening step of the images for illumination-invariant. Second, we developed a representation of face images based on principal component analysis(PCA) representation excluded the first 1 principle component as the features for facial expression recognition, regardless of neutral expression. The PCA basis vectors for this data set had reflected well the changes in facial expression. Finally, a neural network model for classification of facial expressions based on dimension model was created. The dimensional model recognizes not only six facial expressions related to six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, surprise, angry, fear, disgust), but also expressions of various internal states. PCA representations excluded the first 1 principle component and neural network model on the twodimensional structure of emotion have improved the limitation of expression recognition based on a small number of discrete categories of emotional expressions, and have overcome the problems of lighting sensitivity and dependence on cues such as a neutral expression.	basis (linear algebra);network model;neural networks;parsing expression grammar;principal component analysis;sadness;whitening transformation	Young-suk Shin	2005		10.1007/11559573_137	computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;lighting;artificial neural network	Vision	23.644500696045856	-68.27274716597927	128847
7bab62303fd73dc386e8eb84767b45989dcbfb84	distinct neurophysiological mechanisms mediate mixing costs and switch costs	task switching;event related potential erp;switching cost	Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we investigated the neural response associated with preparing to switch from one task to another. We used a cued task-switching paradigm in which the interval between the cue and the imperative stimulus was varied. The difference between response time (RT) to trials on which the task switched and trials on which the task repeated (switch cost) decreased as the interval between cue and target (CTI) was increased, demonstrating that subjects used the CTI to prepare for the forthcoming task. However, the RT on repeated-task trials in blocks during which the task could switch (mixed-task blocks) were never as short as RTs during single-task blocks (mixing cost). This replicates previous research. The ERPs in response to the cue were compared across three conditions: single-task trials, switch trials, and repeat trials. ERP topographic differences were found between single-task trials and mixed-task (switch and repeat) trials at ∼160 and ∼310 msec after the cue, indicative of changes in the underlying neural generator configuration as a basis for the mixing cost. In contrast, there were no topographic differences evident between switch and repeat trials during the CTI. Rather, the response of statistically indistinguishable generator configurations was stronger at ∼310 msec on switch than on repeat trials. By separating differences in ERP topography from differences in response strength, these results suggest that a reappraisal of previous research is appropriate.	computerized thermal imaging;erp;imperative programming;mental association;preparation;programming paradigm;response time (technology);topography	Glenn R.

(2007) replicated the well-known finding that stimuli at attended locations elicit enlarged early components in the averaged event-related potential (ERP), which were localized to extrastriate visual cortex. The mechanisms that underlie these attention-related ERP modulations in the latency range of 80-200 ms, however, remain unclear. The main question is whether attention produces increased ERP amplitudes in time-domain averages by augmenting stimulus-triggered neural activity, or alternatively, by increasing the phase-locking of ongoing EEG oscillations to the attended stimuli. We compared these alternative mechanisms using Morlet wavelet decompositions of event-related EEG changes. By analyzing single-trial spectral amplitudes in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands, which were the dominant frequencies of the early ERP components, it was found that stimuli at attended locations elicited enhanced neural responses in the theta band in the P1 (88-120 ms) and N1 (148-184 ms) latency ranges that were additive with the ongoing EEG. In the alpha band there was evidence for both increased additive neural activity and increased phase-synchronization of the EEG following attended stimuli, but systematic correlations between pre- and post-stimulus alpha activity were more consistent with an additive mechanism. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date in humans that short-latency neural activity elicited by stimuli within the spotlight of spatial attention is boosted or amplified at early stages of processing in extrastriate visual cortex.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;bands;cerebral cortex;dbpedia;erp;eighty;electroencephalography;enlargement procedure;hertz (hz);lock (computer science);morlet wavelet;utility functions on indivisible goods;whole earth 'lectronic link	Jyoti Mishra;Antígona Martínez;Charles E.

A mechanism previously proposed involves subthreshold calcium-dependent oscillations in all parts of the neuron. In that mechanism, the natural frequency of oscillation varies with diameter of cell processes, so there is a wide variation of natural frequencies on the cell, but strong voltage coupling enforces a single frequency of oscillation under resting conditions. In previous work, mathematical analysis of a simpler system of oscillators showed that the chain of oscillators could produce transient dynamics in which the frequency of the coupled system increased temporarily, as seen in a biophysical model of the dopaminergic neuron. The transient dynamics was shown to be consequence of a slow drift along an invariant subset of phase space, with rate of drift given by a Lyapunov function. In this paper, we show that the same mathematical structure exists for the full biophysical model, giving physiological meaning to the slow drift and the Lyapunov function, which is shown to describe differences in intracellular calcium concentration in different parts of the cell. The duration of transients was long, being comparable to the time constant of calcium disposition. These results indicate that brief changes in input to the dopaminergic neuron can produce long lasting firing rate transients whose form is determined by intrinsic cell properties.	calcium;diameter (qualifier value);dopamine;lyapunov fractal;mathematical structure;mathematics;midbrain structure;neuron;oscillator device component;rest;spontaneous order;subgroup;virtual synchrony;voltage	Georgi S.

Here we show that the above variety of approaches can all be unified into a single common principle, namely nonlinear Hebbian learning. When nonlinear Hebbian learning is applied to natural images, receptive field shapes were strongly constrained by the input statistics and preprocessing, but exhibited only modest variation across different choices of nonlinearities in neuron models or synaptic plasticity rules. Neither overcompleteness nor sparse network activity are necessary for the development of localized receptive fields. The analysis of alternative sensory modalities such as auditory models or V2 development lead to the same conclusions. In all examples, receptive fields can be predicted a priori by reformulating an abstract model as nonlinear Hebbian learning. Thus nonlinear Hebbian learning and natural statistics can account for many aspects of receptive field formation across models and sensory modalities.	bottom-up proteomics;consistency model;hebbian theory;independent component analysis;neural coding;neuron;neuronal plasticity;nonlinear system;preprocessor;rule (guideline);sparse matrix;synaptic package manager	Carlos S.

We observed a standard other-race effect, with more items recognised correctly, fewer false alarms, and reduced reaction time to same-race than other-race faces. Additionally, a differential pattern of eye movements between races emerged. During the study phase, samerace faces were fixated more than other-race faces, whilst other-race faces resulted in a greater proportion of fixations to internal face features than same-race faces. At test, whilst no differences between races emerged in the number of fixations or in the proportion of fixations made to internal features, a significantly greater level of fixations were made to the left hemispace for other-race faces for both previously studied and lure faces. These differences in the pattern of fixation plausibly reflect the greater effort in the processing of other-race than same-race faces.	cross-race effect;facial recognition system;while	Eve Klama;Fraser Milton	2012			eyewitness identification;fixation (psychology);eyewitness testimony;psychology;pupillary response;cognitive psychology;social psychology;perceptual learning;facial recognition system;eye tracking;eye movement	HCI	14.790110686348427	-76.34009093147489	130107

Although previous studies have demonstrated the importance of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in the retrieval of associations between these kinds of information, there is no evidence concerning whether the ATL region contributes to the encoding of this memory, and whether ATL roles are dissociable between different levels of association in this memory. Using fMRI, we investigated dissociable roles within the ATL during successful encoding of this memory. During encoding, participants viewed unfamiliar faces, each paired with a job title and name. During retrieval, each learned face was presented with two job titles or two names, and participants were required to choose the correct job title or name. Successful encoding conditions were categorized by subsequent retrieval conditions: successful encoding of names and job titles (HNJ), names (HN), and job titles (HJ). The study yielded three main findings. First, the dorsal ATL showed greater activations in HNJ than in HN or HJ. Second, ventral ATL activity was greater in HNJ and HJ than in HN. Third, functional connectivity between these regions was significant during successful encoding. The results are the first to demonstrate that the dorsal and ventral ATL roles are dissociable between two steps of association, associations of person-related semantics with name and with face, and a dorsal–ventral ATL interaction predicts subsequent retrieval success of memory for person identity information.	acoustic lobing;categorization;dicom;epilepsy, temporal lobe;face;heterojunction;job syndrome;mdf attribute type - name;mental association;person name;resting state fmri	Takashi Tsukiura;Yoko Mano;Atsushi Sekiguchi;Yukihito Yomogida;Kaori Hoshi;Toshimune Kambara;Hikaru Takeuchi;Motoaki Sugiura;Ryuta Kawashima	2010	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2009.21349	psychology;personal identity;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	Vision	16.52166216132393	-78.5262051445409	130187

This paper explores the possibility that increases in propagation delays of stimuli and the signals triggered by them, resulting from this overgrowth, may be conducive to the development of poorly structured cortical maps, which may in turn be associated with autistic characteristics. We use a framework based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). Unlike the conventional SOM model that assumes that all neurons in the neighborhood of the neuron closest to a stimulus instantaneously react to it and adjust their weights, we propose a more biologically realistic model that acknowledges delays inherent in the propagation of signals. We show that propagation delays can significantly affect the performance of SOMs. Coverage of stimuli is negatively affected by either an increase in the dilution factor (a parameter in the proposed model that controls the adjustment of responses to overlapping stimuli), or a decrease in propagation speed. For large dilution factors the topological structure of the maps is also compromised. We also demonstrate the model's robustness to different input stimuli layouts and distributions.	autistic disorder;map;neuron;neurons;overgrowth;population parameter;propagation delay;software propagation	Gerardo Noriega	2008	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2007.12.006	propagation delay;transmission time;autism;computer science;artificial intelligence;central nervous system;machine learning;cerebro;artificial neural network;robustness	ML	21.40555962281508	-70.38156932736013	130316

203fe65b6fe15b032546eb3a202b6ce2546cef02	evaluating network brain connectivity in alcohol postdependent state using network-based statistic		The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals has become an indispensable tool to investigate how brain regions interact and form long-range networks. Statistical dependency measures between brain regions obtained from BOLD signals can inform about brain functional states in longitudinal studies of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, its non-invasive nature allows comparable measurements in clinical and animal studies, providing excellent translational capabilities. In the present study, we apply Network-Based Statistic (NBS) to investigate alterations in the functional connectivity (FC) of the rat brain in a post-dependent (PD) state, an established animal model of clinical relevant features in alcoholism. In contrast to mass-univariate tests, in which comparisons are performed at single link-level, NBS enhances the statistical power by assuming that the connections comprising the effect of interest are interconnected. Brain-wide resting-state fMRI signals were collected in 14 controls and 13 PD rats, and Pearson correlations computed between 47 brain regions of interest (ROIs). The NBS analysis revealed statistically significant differences in a connected network of structures including hippocampus, amygdala, lateral hypothalamus and the raphe nucleus, all regions with known relevance for addictive behaviors. In contrast, no individual connection could be found significant by univariate comparisons with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Correlations between the structures in the identified subnetwork tend to decrease or become negative (anti-correlated) in the PD state compared to controls. We interpret this result as evidence for a disconnected subnetwork in the PD state.	addictive behavior;alcohol consumption;alcoholic intoxication, chronic;amygdaloid structure;cell nucleus;ethanol;false discovery rate;genetic translation process;hypothalamic area, lateral;hypothalamic structure;lateral thinking;mental disorders;netbeans ide;region of interest;relevance;resonance;rest;resting state fmri;spontaneous order;statistic (data);subnetwork;blood oxygen level dependent;emotional dependency;nervous system disorder;raphe nuclei	Antonio Díaz-Parra;Ursula Perez-Ramirez;Jesus Pacheco-Torres;Simone Pfarr;Wolfgang H.

When the head is free to move, visual orienting is often accomplished with coordinated movements of the eyes and head. A recent description of the temporal progression (i.e., kinematics) of these movements led to the hypothesis that eye and head control signals interact.

It is believed to be the neural substrate for working memory, and as such highly relevant for theories of cognition. The cortex is highly recurrent, mainly excitatory, and finding stable attractors for DA at low firing rates for realistic neuronal parameters has proven to be hard. Most models for DA use recurrent excitation. Here a model with recurrent disinhibition is presented, which is manifestly stable. This model requires a cortical circuit that is slightly more complex than circuits in models using recurrent excitation, but circuits of comparable complexity have been found in cortex. Since delay attractors can not be observed directly, it is important to consider all theoretical possibilities.	cognition;delay-gradient congestion control;theory	Marc de Kamps	2005		10.1007/11550822_37	cognition;artificial intelligence;machine learning;working memory;artificial neural network	ML	20.868084352736222	-70.5486468725415	130593

The study of the interactions of these systems during emotion regulation has been limited in human functional neuroimaging, despite its potential importance for physical health. We have previously reported that mental expertise in cultivation of compassion alters the activation of circuits linked with empathy and theory of mind in response to emotional stimuli. Guided by the finding that heart rate increases more during blocks of compassion meditation than neutral states, especially for experts, we examined the interaction between state (compassion vs. neutral) and group (novice, expert) on the relation between heart rate and BOLD signal during presentation of emotional sounds presented during each state. Our findings revealed that BOLD signal in the right middle insula showed a significant association with heart rate (HR) across state and group. This association was stronger in the left middle/posterior insula when experts were compared to novices. The positive coupling of HR and BOLD was higher within the compassion state than within the neutral state in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex for both groups, underlining the role of this region in the modulation of bodily arousal states. This state effect was stronger for experts than novices in somatosensory cortices and the right inferior parietal lobule (group by state interaction). These data confirm that compassion enhances the emotional and somatosensory brain representations of others' emotions, and that this effect is modulated by expertise. Future studies are needed to further investigate the impact of compassion training on these circuits.	arousal;cingulate cortex;emotions;empathy;guru meditation;half rate;individual physical condition;insula of reil;interaction;lobule;modulation;neuroimaging;sql	Antoine Lutz;Lawrence L.

The model provides geometric illustrations to many interesting phenomena occurring in biological neurons having subthreshold damped oscillations of membrane potential. For example, such neurons prefer a certain resonant frequency of the input that is nearly equal to their eigenfrequency, they can be excited or inhibited by a doublet (two pulses) depending on its interspike interval, and they can fire in response to an inhibitory input. All these properties could be observed in Hodgkin-Huxley-type models. We use the resonate-and-fire model to illustrate possible sensitivity of biological neurons to the fine temporal structure of the input spike train. Being an analogue of the integrate-and-fire model, the resonate-and-fire model is computationally efficient and suitable for simulations of large networks of spiking neurons.	action potential;algorithmic efficiency;analog;biological neuron model;hodgkin disease;huxley: the dystopia;membrane potentials;neurons;resonance;simulation;spike glycoprotein, coronavirus;units of information	Eugene M.

e760af1b186674c7b98b2d77648f386b4e5938e9	a perceptual-like population-coding mechanism of approximate numerical averaging		Humans possess a remarkable ability to rapidly form coarse estimations of numerical averages. This ability is important for making decisions that are based on streams of numerical or value-based information, as well as for preference formation. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying rapid approximate numerical averaging remains unknown, and several competing mechanism may account for it. Here, we tested the hypothesis that approximate numerical averaging relies on perceptual-like processes, instantiated by population coding. Participants were presented with rapid sequences of numerical values (four items per second) and were asked to convey the sequence average. We manipulated the sequences' length, variance, and mean magnitude and found that similar to perceptual averaging, the precision of the estimations improves with the length and deteriorates with (higher) variance or (higher) magnitude. To account for the results, we developed a biologically plausible population-coding model and showed that it is mathematically equivalent to a population vector. Using both quantitative and qualitative model comparison methods, we compared the population-coding model to several competing models, such as a step-by-step running average (based on leaky integration) and a midrange model. We found that the data support the population-coding model. We conclude that humans' ability to rapidly form estimations of numerical averages has many properties of the perceptual (intuitive) system rather than the arithmetic, linguistic-based (analytic) system and that population coding is likely to be its underlying mechanism.	approximation algorithm;humans;linguistics;model selection;neural coding;numerical analysis;population vector;sample variance	Noam Brezis;Zohar Z.

Physical demonstration of skills, on the other hand, is an approach with which humans are both competent and familiar. When following a programming-by-demonstration approach, the adaptiveness of a robot can be further increased by giving it the ability to compose novel skills from skills already acquired from demonstration. We have previously presented [1] an extension to the Piaget-inspired Constructivist Learning Architecture [2], featuring a hierarchical SOM-based algorithm that encodes skills as a hierarchy of fixed-length subsequences. At the core of the extended algorithm lies a novel principle for comparing long-term memory and short-term memory, represented as connection weights and decaying node activation values, respectively. In this article, we present an in-depth analysis of how this comparison, can provide a robot control algorithm that is both state-sensitive and goal oriented. We present results from experiments using an abstract chain walk problem that includes hidden states, to demonstrate how the algorithm disambiguates states and selects actions yielding higher rewards. Furthermore, we present results from an experiment where we use programming-by-demonstration to encode and reproduce a figure-8 gesture with a Nao humanoid robot. The results show that our algorithm is capable of identifying hidden states in both real and abstract problem domains.	abstract interpretation;algorithm;cobham's thesis;cognition;encode;experiment;humanoid robot;information processing;piaget's theory of cognitive development;problem domain;programming by demonstration;robot control	Georgios Pierris;Torbjørn S.

664e88b61b0b89042edef5bb459b1950201dfebf	why is the n170 enhanced for inverted faces? an erp competition experiment	face processing;time window	The amplitude of the ERP component N170 is larger in response to inverted than to upright faces. The current study tested two main hypotheses that have been suggested to explain this effect: according to the first hypothesis inverted faces lead to augmentation of activity of the same neural populations used for the processing of upright faces due to the increased processing difficulty that these stimuli impose; according to the second hypothesis the processing of inverted faces involves recruitment of additional neural mechanisms to those used for upright face processing. We employed an ERP competition paradigm in which the effect of a context stimulus on the ERP to a simultaneously presented target stimulus is measured. In Experiment 1, an upright target face was paired with an upright face, inverted face or a non-face context stimulus. ERPs time-locked to the presentation of the target showed reduced N170 amplitude when the context was an upright face more than in non-face context trials, replicating the ERP competition effect for faces. Interestingly, in contrast to the hypothesis that inverted faces recruit mechanisms used for upright faces to a greater extent, competition effects were similar in the context of inverted and upright faces. In Experiment 2, the target stimuli were inverted faces. This time, competition effect was larger in inverted than in upright face context. Taken together, these findings correspond with the hypothesis that inversion of the face leads to recruitment of additional mechanisms as early as at the N170 time-window.	auditory recruitment;erp;entity handling - upright;experiment;face;facial muscles;greater;inversion of nipple (disorder);large;neural oscillation;population;programming paradigm	Boaz Sadeh;Galit Yovel	2010	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.06.029	psychology;computer vision;communication;social psychology	ML	16.209732440714202	-77.40118933418017	131435

However, prior studies from our laboratory have found that processing of unattended auditory deviant tones in the auditory and frontal regions is modulated by top-down attentional demands and resource availability. Whether processing of unattended visual deviant stimuli is altered by the availability of attentional resources has not been established. The goal of the current study was to examine the automaticity of these activations, their modulation by attentional capacity, and the neuroanatomical distribution of any attentional effects upon visual deviance detection. We designed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study during which subjects performed a continuous perceptual-motor-visual tracking task whose difficulty was modulated by changing the control dynamics of a joystick. Changes in the anatomical localization, spatial distribution, and intensity of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response associated with unattended infrequent visual changes were examined during low- and high-difficulty tracking conditions of the primary visual task. Results revealed that the unattended deviants elicited BOLD activation in the visual, fusiform, and parietal regions. In these regions, the intensity and extent of the activation evoked by the deviants decreased as a function of the demands of the primary visual task. These findings suggest that processing of unattended visual deviant stimuli is restricted by the attentional demands of a primary task, as previously demonstrated for unattended auditory deviant tones.	area striata structure;auditory perceptual disorders;cell respiration;joystick device component;modulation;parietal lobe;resonance;top-down and bottom-up design;video tracking;fmri;frontal lobe	Gunes Yucel;Gregory McCarthy;Aysenil Belger	2007	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.08.050	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;eye tracking;visual n1;top-down and bottom-up design;posterior parietal cortex;communication;social psychology	ML	16.39677499658693	-77.28991219887098	131683

However, it is not yet clear how SEPs localization, shape and latency are modulated by different stimuli during mechanical tactile stimulation of fingertips. The aim of this work is thus to characterize SEPs generated by the tactile perception of gratings during dynamic passive stimulation of the dominant fingertip by means of a mechatronic platform. Results show that a random sequence of stimuli elicited SEPs with two long-latency components: (i) a negative deflection around 140 ms located in the frontal-central-parietal side in the contralateral hemisphere; (ii) a positive deflection around 250 ms located in the frontal-central midline. Time-frequency analysis revealed significant continuous bilateral desynchronization in the alpha band throughout the passive stimulation. These results are a fundamental step towards building a model of brain responses during perception of tactile stimuli for future benchmarking studies.	action potential;auditory evoked potentials;bilateral filter;electroencephalography phase synchronization;fingertip dosing unit;frequency analysis;mechatronics;modulation;somatosensory evoked potentials;touch perception	Clara Genna;Fiorenzo Artoni;Chiara Fanciullacci;Carmelo Chisari;Calogero Maria Oddo;Silvestro Micera	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591030	psychology;computer vision;somatosensory evoked potential;mechatronics;acoustics;electroencephalography;shape;mathematics;communication;surface;electric potential;encoding	Robotics	16.658084797382486	-77.14701564631798	131783

Their potential importance for human psychology and artificial intelligence is widely appreciated, but meaningful results can be obtained only if as much care is taken in designing neural networks as is normally taken for psychological experimentation. Used uncritically to produce results with a surface similarity to human psychological data, neural nets can be worse than wasted effort, because they suggest that there is empirical evidence where none exists and imply a computational precision that may be illusory. Kosslyn and colleagues have reported several experimental studies supporting a theoretical view (Kosslyn, 1987) on the specializations of the cerebral hemispheres in man.

The dorsal ‘where’ path is implemented in the model by feedforward and feedback connections between brain areas V1, V2 and a PP module. The ventral ‘what’ path is implemented in a physiologically plausible four-layer network, corresponding to brain areas V1, V2, V4 and IT, with convergence to each part of a layer from a small region of the preceding layer, with feature-based attentional feedback connections, and with local competition between the neurons within a layer implemented by local lateral inhibition. In particular, the model explains the gradually increasing magnitude of the attentional modulation that is found in fMRI experiments from earlier visual areas (V1, V2) to higher ventral visual areas (V4, IT). The model also shows how the effective size of the receptive fields of IT neurons becomes smaller in natural cluttered scenes.	experiment;feedforward neural network;lateral thinking;modulation;neural oscillation;neuron;outline of object recognition	Gustavo Deco;Edmund T.

Quantitative anatomical comparisons between controls and methamphetamine-dependent individuals have produced conflicting results. We examined local and global differences in brain structure in 61 abstinent methamphetamine-dependent individuals and 44 controls with voxel-based morphometry and tissue segmentation. We related regional differences in gray matter density and whole brain segmentation volumes to performance on a behavioral measure of impulsivity and group membership using multiple linear regression. Within the MA group, we related cortical and subcortical gray matter density to length of abstinence. Controls had greater density relative to MA in bilateral insula and left middle frontal gyrus. Impulsivity was higher in the MA group and, within all subjects, impulsivity was positively correlated with gray matter density in posterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum and negatively correlated in left superior frontal gyrus. Length of abstinence from MA was associated with greater amygdalar density. Earlier age of first use of MA (in subjects who initiated use before age 21) was associated with smaller intracranial volume. The findings are consistent with multiple possible mechanisms including neuroadaptations due to addictive behavior, neuroinflammation as well as dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotoxicity.	addictive behavior;bilateral filter;bilateral sound;cingulate cortex;cognition disorders;conflict (psychology);congenital abnormality;congenital neurologic anomalies;corpus striatum structure;dopamine hydrochloride;frontal lobe gyrus;impulsive behavior;insula of reil;methamphetamine;middle frontal gyrus structure;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;neurogenic inflammation;neurotoxicity syndromes;nevus sebaceous;small;subcortical gray matter;ventral striatum;voxel;biologic segmentation;brain segmentation	Daniel L.

Most current theories of shape representation are based on the idea of feature or part extraction. Compared with template matching and Fourier decomposition, parts-based mechanism is better adapted to the real-world difficulties of view-point transformations, partial occlusion and plastic deformation. We present in this paper a parts-based shape representation model inspired by the mammalian visual ventral pathway. With the sparse coding constraint, the computational model combines unsupervised representation in the feedforward stream with lateral interaction to achieve stable, efficient and natural representation of shapes. Further comparing the response properties of model cells to those of biological V4 cells, we find that model cells display same curvature and object centered tuning as the reported physiological measurements.	computational model;feedforward neural network;gene regulatory network;lateral thinking;machine perception;neural coding;sparse matrix;template matching;theory	Lei Yang;Marwan A.

In this pa per, a new method is presented for data-driven visualization of hi ghdensity EEG coherence, which strongly reduces clutter and i s referred to as functional unit (FU) map. Starting from an ini tial graph, with vertices representing electrodes and edge s representing significant coherences between electrode signal s, we define an FU as a set of electrodes represented by a clique consisting of spatially connected vertices. In an FU map, the sp atial relationship between electrodes is preserved, and all elec trodes in one FU are assigned an identical gray value. Adjacent FUs are visualized with different gray values and FUs are connec ted by a line if the average coherence between FUs exceeds a thres hold.

The community effect allows cell population to forge a common identity, that is, coordinated and sustained tissue-specific gene expression. The community effect was originally observed in muscle differentiation in Xenopus embryos, and is now thought to be a widespread phenomenon. From a modelling point of view, the community effect is the existence of a threshold size of cell populations, above which the probability of tissue-specific gene expression for a sustained period increases significantly. Below this threshold size, the cell population fails to maintain tissue-specific gene expression after the initial induction. In this work, we examine the dynamics of a community effect in space and investigate its roles in two other processes of self-organized patterning by diffusible factors: Turing’s reaction-diffusion system and embryonic induction by morphogens. Our major results are the following. First, we show that, starting from a one-dimensional space model with the simplest possible feedback loop, a community effect spreads in an unlimited manner in space. Second, this unrestricted expansion of a community effect can be avoided by additional negative feedback. In Turing’s reaction-diffusion system with a built-in community effect, if induction is localized, sustained activation also remains localized. Third, when a simple cross-repression gene circuitry is combined with a community effect loop, the system self-organizes. A gene expression pattern with a well-demarcated boundary appears in response to a transient morphogen gradient. Surprisingly, even when the morphogen distribution eventually becomes uniform, the system can maintain the pattern. The regulatory network thus confers memory of morphogen dynamics. ∗KB’s PhD project is co-funded by CNRS and the Conseil Régional Nord-Pas de Calais.

df5b9ca432222b322120f15248d72a284c82ae2e	neurophysiological signals of ignoring and attending are separable and related to performance during sustained intersensory attention		The ability to attend to an input selectively while ignoring distracting sensations is thought to depend on the coordination of two processes: enhancement of target signals and attenuation of distractor signals. This implies that attending and ignoring may be dissociable neural processes and that they make separable contributions to behavioral outcomes of attention. In this study, we tested these hypotheses in the context of sustained attention by measuring neurophysiological responses to attended and ignored stimuli in a noncued, continuous, audiovisual selective attention task. We compared these against responses during a passive control to quantify effects of attending and ignoring separately. In both sensory modalities, responses to ignored stimuli were attenuated relative to a passive control, whereas responses to attended stimuli were enhanced. The scalp topographies and brain activations of these modulatory effects were consistent with the sensory regions that process each modality. They also included parietal and prefrontal activations that suggest these effects arise from interactions between top–down and sensory cortices. Most importantly, we found that both attending and ignoring processes contributed to task accuracy and that these effects were not correlated—suggesting unique neural trajectories. This conclusion was supported by the novel observation that attending and ignoring differed in timing and in active cortical regions. The data provide direct evidence for the separable contributions of attending and ignoring to behavioral outcomes of attention control during sustained intersensory attention.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;esthesia;interaction;modality (human–computer interaction);paresthesia;topography	Agatha Lenartowicz;Gregory V.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that cerebral connectivity involving Wernicke's area and other important cortical language regions would differ between preterm (PT) and term (T) control school age children during performance of an auditory language task. Fifty-four PT children (600-1250 g birth weight) and 24 T controls were evaluated using an fMRI passive language task and neurodevelopmental assessments including: the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - III (WISC-III), the Peabody Individual Achievement Test - Revised (PIAT-R) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - Revised (PPVT-R) at 8 years of age. Neural activity was assessed for language processing and the data were evaluated for connectivity and correlations to cognitive outcomes. We found that PT subjects scored significantly lower on all components of the WISC-III (p<0.009), the PIAT-R Reading Comprehension test (p=0.013), and the PPVT-R (p=0.001) compared to term subjects. Connectivity analyses revealed significantly stronger neural circuits in PT children between Wernicke's area and the right inferior frontal gyrus (R IFG, Broca's area homologue) and both the left and the right supramarginal gyri (SMG) components of the inferior parietal lobules (p</=0.02 for all). We conclude that PT subjects employ neural systems for auditory language function at school age differently than T controls; these alterations may represent a delay in maturation of neural networks or the engagement of alternate circuits for language processing.	artificial neural network;biologic development;birth weight;broca aphasia;childhood brain anaplastic astrocytoma;convergence (action);evaluation procedure;frontal lobe gyrus;ifng wt allele;inferior frontal gyrus;jakobson's functions of language;list comprehension;lobule;magnetic resonance imaging;neural network simulation;parahippocampal gyrus;peabody award;pro tools;score;vocabulary;wernicke area;wernicke encephalopathy;wisconsin integrally synchronized computer;fmri	Yeisid Gozzo;Betty R.

c1a7921047613e286192e1a3f2321f30fc919c46	quantitative vascular neuroimaging of the rat brain using superparamagnetic nanoparticles: new insights on vascular organization and brain function	anesthesia;cerebral blood volume (cbv);ferumoxytol;magnetic resonance imaging (mri);perfusion reserve;ultra-short te (ute)	A method called Quantitative Ultra-Short Time-to-Echo Contrast Enhanced (QUTE-CE) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) which utilizes superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as a contrast agent to yield positive contrast angiograms with high clarity and definition is applied to the whole live rat brain. QUTE-CE MRI intensity data are particularly well suited for measuring quantitative cerebral blood volume (qCBV). A global map of qCBV in the awake resting-state with unprecedented detail was created via application of a 3D MRI rat brain atlas with 173 segmented and annotated brain areas. From this map we identified two distributed, integrated neural circuits showing the highest capillary densities in the brain. One is the neural circuitry involved with the primary senses of smell, hearing and vision and the other is the neural circuitry of memory. Under isoflurane anesthesia, these same circuits showed significant decreases in qCBV suggesting a role in consciousness. Neural circuits in the brainstem associated with the reticular activating system and the maintenance of respiration, body temperature and cardiovascular function showed an increase in qCBV with anesthesia. During awake CO2 challenge, 84 regions showed significant increases relative to an awake baseline state. This CO2 response provides a measure of cerebral vascular reactivity and regional perfusion reserve with the highest response measured in the somatosensory cortex. These results demonstrate the utility of QUTE-CE MRI for qCBV analysis and offer a new perspective on brain function and vascular organization.	artificial neural network;baseline (configuration management);blood capillaries;body temperature;brain stem;brain atlas;c little e ab:prthr:pt:ser/plas:ord;carbon dioxide;cerebral cortex;cervical atlas;consciousness;contrast media;electronic circuit;esthesia;isoflurane;magnetic resonance imaging;neuroimaging;rest;smell perception;angiogram;density;ferric oxide	Codi A.

The use of the MVPA approach for source-reconstructed MEG/EEG data is uncommon. For these data, we need to consider the source orientation information and the signal leakage among brain regions. In the present study, we evaluate the perspective of the MVPA approach in the context of source orientation information and signal leakage in source-reconstructed MEG data. We perform face vs. tool object category decoding (FvsT-OCD) of event-related responses from single or multiple voxels from a brain region using a univariate analysis approach and/or the MVPA approach. We also propose and perform symmetric signal leakage correction of source-reconstructed data using an independent component analysis-based approach. FvsT-OCD using single voxel information shows higher sensitivity for the MVPA approach than univariate analysis, as the MVPA approach efficiently utilizes information on all three dipole orientations and is less affected by inter-subject variability. The MVPA approach shows higher sensitivity for FvsT-OCD when considering information from multiple voxels than for a single voxel in a brain region. This finding suggests that the MVPA approach captures the latent multivoxel distributed pattern. However, the results may be partly or entirely attributable to signal leakage between brain regions, as the sensitivity is substantially reduced after signal leakage correction. A consideration of signal leakage is therefore essential during the evaluation of MVPA outcomes.

To compute the ILD of a sound, independent of overall loudness, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (encoding the left and right amplitudes) are hypothesized to compete in the neurons of the lateral superior olive. Interestingly, this neural model can also accept power-law compressed amplitudes that can allow a much larger range of input signal levels, a common limitation in neural coding. This work demonstrates the use of square-root and cube-root compression with a neuromorphic VLSI neuron to expand the range of distances over which ILD can be used to estimate echo direction in a sonar system based on echolocating bats.

In literature, the winner-take-all method is wildly used to simulate the controlling of the gaze movement. The winner-take-all is a type of single-cell coding method, which uses one cell (grandmother cell) or one response to represent an object. However, eye movement is affected by the visual context which includes more than one object in images, especially in target search. Therefore, we propose to use the population coding with more than one response rather than the single-cell coding on gaze movement control. The proposed method is supported by the theoretical analysis and experiments on a real image database which show the population-cell-coding improves the target locating accuracy by 44.4% only at the cost of coding 22.4% more information than that of single-cell-coding.	cell (microprocessor);experiment;grandmother cell;neural coding;simulation	Jun Miao;Laiyun Qing;Lijuan Duan;Baixian Zou	2009	2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178998	winner-take-all;computer vision;visualization;visual search;visual perception;feature extraction;computer science;artificial intelligence;neural coding;neurophysiology;pixel;encoding;eye movement	ML	22.023129103202454	-66.68603117978867	134524

The imaging agent evaluated for this purpose is a molecule that binds strongly and specifically to myelin basic protein. Physiology-based pharmacokinetic modeling combined with PET image simulation applied to a brain model was used to examine whether such an agent would allow the differentiation of artificial lesions 4-10 mm in diameter from the surrounding normal-looking white and gray matter. Furthermore, we examined how changes in agent properties, model parameters, and experimental conditions can influence imageability, identifying a set of conditions under which imaging of MS lesions might be feasible. Based on our results, we concluded that PET imaging has the potential to become a useful complementary method to MRI for MS diagnosis and therapy monitoring.	body dysmorphic disorders;diameter (qualifier value);gray matter;imaging agent;multiple sclerosis;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;simulation;physiological aspects	Maria I.

These studies suggest that the spatial ability of animals requires proper functioning of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC). The involvement of the hippocampus in spatial cognition has been extensively studied, both in animal as well as in theoretical studies, such as in the brain-based models by Edelman and colleagues. In this work, we extend these earlier models, with a particular focus on the spatial coding properties of the EC and how it functions as an interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex, as proposed by previous work. By realizing the cognitive memory and mapping functions of the hippocampus and the EC, respectively, we develop a neurobiologically-inspired system to enable a mobile robot to perform task-based navigation in a maze environment.	cerebral cortex;cognition disorders;inspiration function;l-epicatechin;mobile robot;navigation;neocortex;robot (device);robotic mapping;structure of entorhinal cortex	Huajin Tang;Weiwei Huang;Aditya Narayanamoorthy;Rui Yan	2017	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/j.neunet.2016.08.015	spatial memory;navigation;neurorobotics;hippocampus	Robotics	19.17336123567014	-67.87779145821808	134966

Neuronal response to electrical stimulation is an area of interest at the laboratory bench and in the clinic, given its wide application for remedying neurological disorders. Here we investigated the change in cortical network response over time to varied amounts of charge used for stimulation, which may lead to a phenomenon known as selective adaptation. There is a charge threshold that invokes a reverberating network response; when stimulating at 900 mV, five stimulation electrodes were required to elicit a response across the entire network. Stimulating with more charge leads to greater synaptic depression over time when constant periodic stimulation is applied. Stimulating with 5 electrodes led to a decrease in network response to stimulation, whereas stimulating with 12 electrodes led to an extinction of network response. The previously hypothesized selective adaptation mechanism was not observed, implying that our random cortical assemblies have homogeneous excitatory and inhibitory subnetworks.	acclimatization;depressive disorder;electric stimulation technique;electrophysiology (science);extinction, psychological;functional electrical stimulation;microelectrodes;stimulation (motivation);synaptic package manager;electrode;negative regulation of synaptic vesicle uncoating;nervous system disorder	Robert D.

This form of decision-making is referred to as delayed reward discounting (DRD) and the features of brain structure associated with DRD are not well understood. The current study characterized the relationship between gray matter volume (GMV) and DRD in a sample of 1038 healthy adults (54.7% female) using cortical parcellation, subcortical segmentation, and voxelwise cortical surface-based group analyses. The results indicate that steeper DRD was significantly associated with lower total cortical GMV, but not subcortical GMV. In parcellation analyses, less GMV in 20 discrete cortical regions was associated with steeper DRD. Of these regions, only GMV in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and entorhinal cortex (EC) were uniquely associated with DRD. Voxelwise surface-based analyses corroborated these findings, again revealing significant associations between steeper DRD and less GMV in the MTG and EC. To inform the roles of MTG and EC in DRD, connectivity analysis of resting state data (N = 1003) using seed regions from the structural findings was conducted. This revealed that spontaneous activity in the MTG and EC was correlated with activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule, regions associated with the default mode network, which involves prospection, self-reflective thinking and mental simulation. Furthermore, meta-analytic co-activation analysis using Neurosynth revealed a similar pattern across 11,406 task-fMRI studies. Collectively, these findings provide robust evidence that morphometric characteristics of the temporal lobe are associated with DRD preferences and suggest it may be because of their role in mental activities in common with default mode activity.	arm cortex-m;acoustic lobing;activation analysis;brain;central gray substance of midbrain;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;decision making;default;delayed reward discounting;dopa-responsive dystonia;foundations;gray matter;l-epicatechin;large;lobule;mental association;mental disorders;morphometrics;neural oscillation;prefrontal cortex;rest;resting state fmri;rewards;simulation;small;spontaneous order;structure of entorhinal cortex;structure of middle temporal gyrus;temporal lobe;biologic segmentation	Max M Owens;Joshua C.

Two varieties of ICA are employed to achieve maximal independence component in space or time yields for functional MRI (fMRI) analysis: spatial ICA (sICA) and temporal ICA (tICA). sICA is widely studied and used in signal separation of fMRI data. In this study, we compared the performance of sica and tICA to extract and separate signals with spatial and temporal independence based on simulated data. Our results reveal that sICA is able to extract and separate relatively highly independent signals. tICA can fulfill the separation of mutually independent component signal in time course and classify the temporally corresponding signal as one group in spite of having a spatially independent component. The results suggest that tICA can be applied to detect a special signal overlapping with the physiological signals by evoking other activations using the special signal.	blind signal separation;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;maximal set;source separation;temporal logic	Xin Gao;Tao Zhang;Jinhu Xiong	2011	2011 4th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics (BMEI)	10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098493	speech recognition;radiology;computer science;integrated circuit;magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;pattern recognition	ML	22.05701328047273	-77.58436612166103	135031

We hypothesized that premature excitation within the drug-altered vulnerable region, a region that trails each excitation wave, might be one mechanism for initiating re-entrant tachyarrhythmias that could lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. With numerical studies of a cardiac cell model, we probed the determinants of the vulnerable period. We found that antiarrhythmic drugs that block the sodium channel can increase the duration of the cardiac vulnerable period by both slowing conduction velocity and reducing the gradient of excitability. Coupling the dynamics of drug binding to ion channels with wave formation in a nonlinear excitable medium provides new insights into possible arrhythmogenic mechanisms.	excitable medium;excited state;gradient;nonlinear system;numerical analysis;velocity (software development)	C.

However, current CBMA methods do not conduct common voxelwise tests, but rather a test of convergence, which relies on some spatial assumptions that data may seldom meet, and has lower statistical power when there are multiple effects. Here we present a new algorithm that can use standard voxelwise tests and, importantly, conducts a standard permutation of subject images (PSI). Its main steps are: a) multiple imputation of study images; b) imputation of subject images; and c) subject-based permutation test to control the familywise error rate (FWER). The PSI algorithm is general and we believe that developers might implement it for several CBMA methods. We present here an implementation of PSI for seed-based d mapping (SDM) method, which additionally benefits from the use of effect sizes, random-effects models, Freedman-Lane-based permutations and threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) statistics, among others. Finally, we also provide an empirical validation of the control of the FWER in SDM-PSI, which showed that it might be too conservative. We hope that the neuroimaging meta-analytic community will welcome this new algorithm and method.

Here we propose a simple statistical scheme allowing analysis of the reactivation of firing rate modulations, with a well-defined null hypothesis. This method allowed reliable detection of ensemble reactivation across three experimental settings. Reactivation of firing rate modulations mirrors several properties of commonly studied reactivation measures: it is stronger during hippocampal sharp waves, and decays over a period of 10-20 min. Moreover, in some conditions, firing rate reactivation covaries with reactivation of cell pair cross-correlations, suggesting the two phenomena reflect similar processes. We propose an attractor network model, with pre-wired attractors, in which experience selects and primes some attractors.

The intermittent chaotic bursting manifested alternation between a phase of nearly period-3 bursting and another phase of irregular bursting, and exhibited a nonsmooth-like structure in the first return map of interspike interval (ISI) series. The chaotic spiking manifested a smooth structure. The intermittent chaotic bursting and spiking simulated in the Chay model were identified by the dissection of the fast-slow variables. The intermittent chaotic bursting manifested nonsmooth-like structures in the first return map of both ISI and slow variable, while spiking exhibited smooth structures. The intermittent chaotic bursting and spiking manifested different scale laws of the averaged length of periodic phase with respect to the changes of parameter value. The scale law of bursting was similar to those of both type V intermittent chaos generated in a nonsmooth map and type I in a smooth system, while that of spiking resembled type I more than type V. The results revealed the dynamics of intermittent chaotic firing patterns, the differences between the intermittent chaotic bursting and spiking patterns and the relationships to the smooth and nonsmooth-like characteristics, provided a deep understanding of intermittent chaotic firing patterns, and indicated different mechanisms of the adjustment of variables from slow to fast between bursting and spiking patterns.	action potential;artificial cardiac pacemaker;chaos theory;interval arithmetic;neural oscillation;poincaré plot;simulation	Huaguang Gu;Weiwei Xiao	2014	I.

72f2eeb465f02a16cdfce2f556d8fad28604dcd2	biological models of reinforcement learning		This review focuses on biological issues of reinforcement learning. Since the influential discovery of W. Schultz of an analogy between the reward prediction error signal of the temporal difference algorithm and the firing pattern of some dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain during classical conditioning, biological models have emerged that use computational reinforcement learning concepts to explain adaptative behavior. In particular, the basal ganglia has been proposed to implement among other things reinforcement learning for action selection, motor control or working memory. We discuss to which extent the analogy between the temporal difference algorithm and the firing of dopamine cells can be considered as valid. Our review then focuses on the basal ganglia, their anatomy and key computational properties as demonstrated by three recent, influential models.	action selection;algorithm;basal (phylogenetics);computation;dopamine;ganglia;longest common subsequence problem;reinforcement learning;temporal difference learning	Julien Vitay;Jérémy Fix;Fred Henrik Hamker;Henning Schroll;Frederik Beuth	2009	KI		machine learning;reinforcement learning;artificial intelligence;computer science	ML	16.376421449974554	-72.92166017029562	135502

The neural processes underlying exploratory decision-making have been mainly studied by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, overlooking any information about the time when decisions are made. Here, we carried out an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, in order to detect the time when the brain generators responsible for these decisions have been sufficiently activated to lead to the next decision. Our analyses, based on a classification scheme, extract time-unlocked voltage topographies during reward presentation and use them to predict the type of decisions made on the subsequent trial. Classification accuracy, measured as the area under the Receiver Operator's Characteristic curve was on average 0.65 across 7 subjects. Classification accuracy was above chance levels already after 516 ms on average, across subjects. We speculate that decisions were already made before this critical period, as confirmed by a positive correlation with reaction times across subjects. On an individual subject basis, distributed source estimations were performed on the extracted topographies to statistically evaluate the neural correlates of decision-making. For trials leading to exploration, there was significantly higher activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right supramarginal gyrus; areas responsible for modulating behavior under risk and deduction. No area was more active during exploitation. We show for the first time the temporal evolution of differential patterns of brain activation in an exploratory decision-making task on a single-trial basis.	cellular automaton;consciousness;decision making;electroencephalography phase synchronization;exploit (computer security);extraction;natural deduction;prefrontal cortex;resonance;topography;voltage	Athina Tzovara;Micah M.

0381b9cdc8d62b81376962adc23e4bceeee71b12	distractor-resistant short-term memory is supported by transient changes in neural stimulus representations		Goal-directed behavior in a complex world requires the maintenance of goal-relevant information despite multiple sources of distraction. However, the brain mechanisms underlying distractor-resistant working or short-term memory (STM) are not fully understood. Although early single-unit recordings in monkeys and fMRI studies in humans pointed to an involvement of lateral prefrontal cortices, more recent studies highlighted the importance of posterior cortices for the active maintenance of visual information also in the presence of distraction. Here, we used a delayed match-to-sample task and multivariate searchlight analyses of fMRI data to investigate STM maintenance across three extended delay phases. Participants maintained two samples (either faces or houses) across an unfilled pre-distractor delay, a distractor-filled delay, and an unfilled post-distractor delay. STM contents (faces vs. houses) could be decoded above-chance in all three delay phases from occipital, temporal, and posterior parietal areas. Classifiers trained to distinguish face versus house maintenance successfully generalized from pre- to post-distractor delays and vice versa, but not to the distractor delay period. Furthermore, classifier performance in all delay phases was correlated with behavioral performance in house, but not face, trials. Our results demonstrate the involvement of distributed posterior, but not lateral prefrontal, cortices in active maintenance during and after distraction. They also show that the neural code underlying STM maintenance is transiently changed in the presence of distractors and reinstated after distraction. The correlation with behavior suggests that active STM maintenance is particularly relevant in house trials, whereas face trials might rely more strongly on contributions from long-term memory.

A key component of these models is the appropriate description of structures involved in EC coupling, such as the sarcolemma and ion channels. This study aims at developing an approach for spatial reconstruction of these structures. We exemplified our approach by reconstructing clusters of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) together with the sarcolemma of rabbit ventricular myocytes. The reconstructions were based on dual labeling and three-dimensional (3D) confocal imaging of segments of fixed and permeabilized myocytes lying flat or on end. The imaging led to 3D stacks of cross-sections through myocytes. Methods of digital image processing were applied to deconvolve, filter and segment these stacks. Finally, we created point meshes representing RyR distributions together with volume and surface meshes of the sarcolemma. We suggest that these meshes are suitable for computational studies of structure-function relationships in EC coupling. We propose that this approach can be extended to reconstruct other structures and proteins involved in EC coupling.	cascade device component;computation;computational model;coupling (computer programming);digital image processing;dual;excitation;ion channel;ions;l-epicatechin;loose coupling;muscle cells;polygon mesh;proteins;ryanodine receptors;sarcolemma;sinoatrial node;uterine contraction;ryanodine receptor complex location;voltage	Frank B.

These methods allow the computation of jitter-corrected cross correlograms as well as statistically robust hypothesis testing to decide whether observed correlations at a given time scale are significant. Since currently used Monte Carlo methods are computationally costly, we propose to compute the distribution of the probability of observing a jittered spike train in closed form. We show that this distribution is obtained by computing the analytical solution for each jitter interval and then convolving the distributions of all intervals. For all mean firing rates tested, computing the convolutions in Fourier space rather than directly improves performance considerably without loss of accuracy. Performance increased with mean firing rates and length of spike trains. The method allows for rapid analysis of long spike trains with high accuracy.	action potential;computation;convolution;monte carlo method;resampling (statistics)	Daniel Jeck;Ernst Niebur	2015	2015 49th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS)	10.1109/CISS.2015.7086908	computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics	ML	20.879318197563652	-73.2298505918867	136015

Using the electrosensory system of gymnotiform weakly electric fish, we recorded the activities of pyramidal cell pairs within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) under spatially localized and diffuse stimulation. We found that both signal and noise correlations were markedly reduced (>40%) under the latter stimulation. Through a network model incorporating key anatomical features of the ELL, we reveal how activation of diffuse parallel fiber feedback from granule cells by spatially diffuse stimulation can explain both the reduction in signal as well as the reduction in noise correlations seen experimentally through independent mechanisms. First, we show that burst-timing dependent plasticity, which leads to a negative image of the stimulus and thereby reduces single neuron responses, decreases signal but not noise correlations. Second, we show trial-to-trial variability in the responses of single granule cells to sensory input reduces noise but not signal correlations. Thus, our model predicts that the same feedback pathway can simultaneously reduce both signal and noise correlations through independent mechanisms. To test this prediction experimentally, we pharmacologically inactivated parallel fiber feedback onto ELL pyramidal cells. In agreement with modeling predictions, we found that inactivation increased both signal and noise correlations but that there was no significant relationship between magnitude of the increase in signal correlations and the magnitude of the increase in noise correlations. The mechanisms reported in this study are expected to be generally applicable to the cerebellum as well as other cerebellum-like structures. We further discuss the implications of such decorrelation on the neural coding strategies used by the electrosensory and by other systems to process natural stimuli.	acoustic lobing;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;decorrelation;experiment;feedback;fishes;gene regulatory network;granule (oracle dbms);heart rate variability;lateral thinking;midclavicular line;network model;neural coding;neuron;neurons;pyramidal cells;rna polymerase ii elongation factor ell;calcium polycarbophil 625 mg oral tablet;electrosensory lateral line lobe;parallel fiber	Benjamin Simmonds;Maurice J.

We introduce the space-by-time M/EEG decomposition, based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which describes single-trial M/EEG signals using a set of non-negative spatial and temporal components that are linearly combined with signed scalar activation coefficients. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on an EEG dataset recorded during the performance of a visual categorization task. Our method extracts three temporal and two spatial functional components achieving a compact yet full representation of the underlying structure, which validates and summarizes succinctly results from previous studies. Furthermore, we introduce a decoding analysis that allows determining the distinct functional role of each component and relating them to experimental conditions and task parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that the presented stimulus and the task difficulty of each trial can be reliably decoded using specific combinations of components from the identified space-by-time representation. When comparing with a sliding-window linear discriminant algorithm, we show that our approach yields more robust decoding performance across participants. Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed space-by-time decomposition is a meaningful low-dimensional representation that carries the relevant information of single-trial M/EEG signals.	algorithm;categorization;coefficient;date and time representation by country;discriminant;electroencephalography;emoticon;neuroimaging;non-negative matrix factorization;relevance;signature;silo (dataset);decoding	Ioannis Delis;Arno Onken;Philippe G.

Functional connectivity measures based on partial correlation provide an estimate of the linear conditional dependence between brain regions after removing the linear influence of other regions. Estimation of partial correlations is, however, difficult when the number of regions is large, as is now increasingly the case with a growing number of large-scale brain connectivity studies. To address this problem, we develop novel methods for estimating sparse partial correlations between multiple regions in fMRI data using elastic net penalty (SPC-EN), which combines L1- and L2-norm regularization We show that L1-norm regularization in SPC-EN provides sparse interpretable solutions while L2-norm regularization improves the sensitivity of the method when the number of possible connections between regions is larger than the number of time points, and when pair-wise correlations between brain regions are high. An issue with regularization-based methods is choosing the regularization parameters which in turn determine the selection of connections between brain regions. To address this problem, we deploy novel stability selection methods to infer significant connections between brain regions. We also compare the performance of SPC-EN with existing methods which use only L1-norm regularization (SPC-L1) on simulated and experimental datasets. Detailed simulations show that the performance of SPC-EN, measured in terms of sensitivity and accuracy is superior to SPC-L1, especially at higher rates of feature prevalence. Application of our methods to resting-state fMRI data obtained from 22 healthy adults shows that SPC-EN reveals a modular architecture characterized by strong inter-hemispheric links, distinct ventral and dorsal stream pathways, and a major hub in the posterior medial cortex - features that were missed by conventional methods. Taken together, our findings suggest that SPC-EN provides a powerful tool for characterizing connectivity involving a large number of correlated regions that span the entire brain.	amazon elastic compute cloud (ec2);choose (action);elastic map;elastic net regularization;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;estimated;greater;inference;interaction;lasso;manifold regularization;matrix regularization;medial graph;rest;resting state fmri;simulation;solutions;span distance;sparse matrix;taxicab geometry;ucn3 gene;usb hub;medial cortex	Srikanth Ryali;Tianwen Chen;Kaustubh Supekar;Vinod Menon	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.11.054	psychology;regularization;mathematical optimization;young adult;partial correlation;magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;lasso;mathematics;elastic net regularization;statistics	ML	24.21530246364524	-77.64683959835415	136968

It simulates the signal flow in the layers I-IV of a set of model columns across three hierarchical cortical areas. It demonstrates the fast formation of an initial stimulus hypothesis, and its subsequent refinement by inter-columnar communication. In this prototype simulation, we implement word recognition from a string of characters. The three cortical areas represent letters, syllables, and words, used as a metaphor for visual stimuli. Focusing on the intra- and inter-columnar dynamics, we show how the different processing subsystems interact in order to switch off expected signals and accomplish symbolic recognition of words, and how representations for new words can be constructed based on old representations (self-reference).	computer simulation;function model	Rüdiger Kupper;Andreas Knoblauch;Marc-Oliver Gewaltig;Ursula Körner;Edgar Körner	2007	Neurocomputing	10.1016/j.neucom.2006.10.085	column generation;word recognition;computer science;function model;artificial intelligence;machine learning;column;cortex	EDA	20.344052437563885	-67.90253792321604	136976
ba47d63006637d460fcb5636f70bc72166bae162	why so gloomy? a bayesian explanation of human pessimism bias in the multi-armed bandit task		How humans make repeated choices among options with imperfectly known reward outcomes is an important problem in psychology and neuroscience. This is often studied using multi-armed bandits, which is also frequently studied in machine learning. We present data from a human stationary bandit experiment, in which we vary the average abundance and variability of reward availability (mean and variance of reward rate distributions). Surprisingly, we find subjects significantly underestimate prior mean of reward rates – based on their self-report, at the end of a game, on their reward expectation of non-chosen arms. Previously, human learning in the bandit task was found to be well captured by a Bayesian ideal learning model, the Dynamic Belief Model (DBM), albeit under an incorrect generative assumption of the temporal structure – humans assume reward rates can change over time even though they are truly fixed. We find that the “pessimism bias” in the bandit task is well captured by the prior mean of DBM when fitted to human choices; but it is poorly captured by the prior mean of the Fixed Belief Model (FBM), an alternative Bayesian model that (correctly) assumes reward rates to be constants. This pessimism bias is also incompletely captured by a simple reinforcement learning model (RL) commonly used in neuroscience and psychology, in terms of fitted initial Q-values. While it seems sub-optimal, and thus mysterious, that humans have an underestimated prior reward expectation, our simulations show that an underestimated prior mean helps to maximize long-term gain, if the observer assumes volatility when reward rates are stable and utilizes a softmax decision policy instead of the optimal one (obtainable by dynamic programming). This raises the intriguing possibility that the brain underestimates reward rates to compensate for the incorrect non-stationarity assumption in the generative model and a simplified decision policy.

For example, when a somatosensory (subthreshold) stimulus is delivered within a close spatiotemporal congruency, a visual (subthreshold) stimulus evokes a visual percept. Cross-modal enhancement of visual perception is maximal when the somatosensory stimulation precedes the visual one by tens of milliseconds. This rapid modulatory response would not be consistent with a top-down mechanism acting through higher-order multimodal cortical areas, but rather a direct interaction between lower-order unimodal areas. To elucidate the neuronal mechanisms of subthreshold cross-modal enhancement, we simulated a neural network model. In the model, lower unimodal (X, Y) and higher multimodal (M) networks are reciprocally connected by bottom-up and top-down axonal projections. The lower networks are laterally connected with each other. A pair of stimuli was presented to the lower networks, whose respective intensities were too weak to induce salient neuronal activity (population response) when presented alone. Neurons of the Y network were slightly depolarized below firing threshold when a cross-modal stimulus was presented alone to the X network. This allowed the Y network to make a rapid (within tens of milliseconds) population response when presented with a subsequent congruent stimulus. The reaction speed of the Y network was accelerated, provided that the top-down projections were strengthened. We suggest that a subthreshold (nonpopulation) response to a cross-modal stimulus, acting through interaction between lower (primary unisensory) areas, may be essential for a rapid suprathreshold (population) response to a congruent stimulus that follows. Top-down influences on cross-modal enhancement may be faster than expected, accelerating reaction speed to input, in which ongoing-spontaneous subthreshold excitation of lower-order unimodal cells by higher-order multimodal cells may play an active role.	area striata structure;artificial neural network;blurred vision;excitation;maximal set;modal logic;multimodal interaction;network model;olfaction disorders;population;projection defense mechanism;projections and predictions;smell perception;spontaneous order;taste perception;top-down and bottom-up design;transcranial magnetic stimulation;transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation	Osamu Hoshino	2011	Neural Computation	10.1162/NECO_a_00096	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;computer science;top-down and bottom-up design;communication;artificial neural network	ML	19.69424512339226	-71.13113564783681	137212
90edbfe1fbaf5587d9563708c3142bb3927678a2	holistic face processing of own- and other-age faces in young and older adults: erp evidence from the composite face task		Participants more accurately remember own-age relative to other-age faces (own-age bias, OAB). The present study tested whether this effect is related to more efficient holistic processing of own-age faces. Young adult and older participants performed a composite face task with young and old faces, in which they indicated whether the upper half of two subsequent composite faces was identical or not. The lower half of the second face was always different, and face halves were horizontally misaligned in 50% of the trials. Both participant groups were more efficient to correctly identify same upper halves in the misaligned relative to the aligned condition, and this composite face effect (CFE), a marker of holistic face processing, was stronger for young faces. Analysis of event-related potentials revealed strong misalignment effects in the N170, which were more pronounced for young faces in both groups. Critically, in the subsequent N250r a stronger misalignment effect for young faces was detected in young participants only. Since N250r may reflect the facilitated access of a perceptual representation of a previously presented face, this finding is interpreted to reflect young participants' more efficient representation of own-age faces as a whole, which may contribute to their OAB in memory.	alignment;common firmware environment;erp;face;holism;rasmussen subacute encephalitis;young adult	Holger Wiese;Ulrike Kachel;Stefan Robert Schweinberger	2013	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.02.051	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	HCI	14.192974952934906	-76.56958238776093	137352

A model for the local reflex is developed from anatomical experimental results and physiological data in the literature. Using this model, a systems-level analysis is conducted. Simulation results indicate that the neuromodulatory mechanism of the local reflex attenuates the nonlinearity of the relationship between cardiac vagal drive and arterial pressure. This behavior is characterized through coherence analysis. Furthermore, the modulation of phase-related characteristics of the cardiovascular system is suggested as a plausible mechanism for the nonlinear attenuation. Based on these results, it is plausible that the functional role of the local reflex is highly robust nonlinear compensation at the heart, which results in less complex dynamics in other parts of the reflex.	complex dynamics;hodgkin–huxley model;modulation;nonlinear system;reflex action;simulation	Rajanikanth Vadigepalli;Francis J.

While the output of recurrent network models can learn to perform various tasks, the possible range of recurrent dynamics that emerge after learning remains unknown. Here we show that modifying the recurrent connectivity with a recursive least squares algorithm provides sufficient flexibility for synaptic and spiking rate dynamics of spiking networks to produce a wide range of spatiotemporal activity. We apply the training method to learn arbitrary firing patterns, stabilize irregular spiking activity in a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons respecting Dale's law, and reproduce the heterogeneous spiking rate patterns of cortical neurons engaged in motor planning and movement. We identify sufficient conditions for successful learning, characterize two types of learning errors, and assess the network capacity. Our findings show that synaptically-coupled recurrent spiking networks possess a vast computational capability that can support the diverse activity patterns in the brain.	algorithm;artificial neural network;genetic heterogeneity;recurrent neural network;recursion;recursive least squares filter;spiking neural network;synaptic package manager;teaching method	Christopher Kim;Carson Chow	2018		10.7554/eLife.37124	cell biology;network model;machine learning;recursive least squares filter;motor planning;artificial intelligence;biology	ML	18.432102184313486	-69.43366783600759	138214
b91dc24804ce2f8bdd3c28ba3001744f9f327bd4	don't think, just feel the music: individuals with strong pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer effects rely less on model-based reinforcement learning		Behavioral choice can be characterized along two axes. One axis distinguishes reflexive, model-free systems that slowly accumulate values through experience and a model-based system that uses knowledge to reason prospectively. The second axis distinguishes Pavlovian valuation of stimuli from instrumental valuation of actions or stimulus–action pairs. This results in four values and many possible interactions between them, with important consequences for accounts of individual variation. We here explored whether individual variation along one axis was related to individual variation along the other. Specifically, we asked whether individuals' balance between model-based and model-free learning was related to their tendency to show Pavlovian interferences with instrumental decisions. In two independent samples with a total of 243 participants, Pavlovian–instrumental transfer effects were negatively correlated with the strength of model-based reasoning in a two-step task. This suggests a potential common underlying substrate predisposing individuals to both have strong Pavlovian interference and be less model-based and provides a framework within which to interpret the observation of both effects in addiction.	action potential;addictive behavior;apache axis;axis vertebra;catastrophic interference;experience;interaction;interference (communication);model-based reasoning;reinforcement learning;value (ethics)	Miriam Sebold;Daniel J.

This ability relies on flexible cognitive systems that adapt in order to encode temporary programs for processing non-automated tasks. Previous functional imaging studies have revealed distinct roles for the lateral frontal cortices (LFCs) and the ventral striatum in intentional learning processes. However, the human LFCs are complex; they house multiple distinct sub-regions, each of which co-activates with a different functional network. It remains unclear how these LFC networks differ in their functions and how they coordinate with each other, and the ventral striatum, to support intentional learning. Here, we apply a suite of fMRI connectivity methods to determine how LFC networks activate and interact at different stages of two novel tasks, in which arbitrary stimulus-response rules are learnt either from explicit instruction or by trial-and-error. We report that the networks activate en masse and in synchrony when novel rules are being learnt from instruction. However, these networks are not homogeneous in their functions; instead, the directed connectivities between them vary asymmetrically across the learning timecourse and they disengage from the task sequentially along a rostro-caudal axis. Furthermore, when negative feedback indicates the need to switch to alternative stimulus-response rules, there is additional input to the LFC networks from the ventral striatum. These results support the hypotheses that LFC networks interact as a hierarchical system during intentional learning and that signals from the ventral striatum have a driving influence on this system when the internal program for processing the task is updated.	abnormal behavior;apache axis;artificial intelligence;axis vertebra;brain injuries;caudal;cognition disorders;corpus striatum structure;encode;frontal solver;functional imaging;genetic translation process;hampshire pig;hypothalamic area, lateral;impacted tooth;impaired cognition;interaction;large;lateral computing;lateral thinking;learning disorders;medical imaging;negative feedback;neostriatum;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;population;resting state fmri;rule (guideline);sports;traumatic brain injury;ventral striatum;en masse movement;fmri;frontal lobe	Adam Hampshire;Peter Hellyer;Beth Parkin;Nole M.

Traditionally, functional neuroimaging studies examining episodic memory retrieval either have not made a distinction between these two phases or have focused on the initial search process. The current study used an extended retrieval trial to compare the neural correlates of search and elaboration and to examine the effects of emotion on each phase. Before scanning, participants encoded positive, negative, and neutral images paired with neutral titles. After a 30-min delay, participants engaged in a scanned recognition task in which they viewed the neutral titles and indicated whether the title had been presented with an image during the study phase. Retrieval was divided into an initial memory search and a subsequent 5-sec elaboration phase. The current study identified neural differences between the search and elaboration phases, with search being associated with widespread bilateral activations across the entire cortex and elaboration primarily being associated with increased activity in the medial pFC. The emotionality of the retrieval target was more influential during search relative to elaboration. However, valence influenced when the effect of emotion was greatest, with search engaging many more regions for positive events than negative ones, but elaboration engaging the dorsomedial pFC more for negative events than positive events.	bilateral filter;consciousness;functional gastrointestinal disorders;medial graph;memory disorders;neuroimaging;scanning	Jaclyn Hennessey Ford;John A.

620f479c2af57b6f41fc69ab186f3766929549ff	real-time decoding of arm kinematics during grasping based on f5 neural spike data		Several studies have shown that the information related to grip type, object identity and kinematics of monkey grasping actions is available in macaque cortical areas of F5, MI, and AIP. In particular, these studies show that the neural discharge patterns of the neuron populations from the aforementioned areas can be used for accurate decoding of action parameters. In this study, we focus on single neuron decoding capacity of neurons in a given region, F5, considering their functional classification, i.e. as to whether they show the mirror property or not. To this end, we recorded neural spike data and arm kinematics from a monkey that performed grasping actions. The spikes were then used as a regressor to predict the kinematic parameters. Results show that single neuron real-time decoding of the kinematics is not perfect, but reasonable performance can be achieved with selected neurons from both populations. Considering the neurons that we have studied (N:32), nonmirror neurons seem to act as better single-neuron decoders. Although it is clear that population-level activity is needed for robust decoding, single-neuron decoding capacity may be used as a quantitative means to classify neurons in a given region.	arm architecture;adaptive internet protocol;discharger;neural oscillation;neuron;population;real-time clock;real-time transcription	Narges Ashena;Vassilis Papadourakis;Vassilis Raos;Erhan Öztop	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-59072-1_31	image processing;machine learning;artificial intelligence;neural decoding;pattern recognition;decoding methods;computer science;neuron;kinematics	ML	17.216738911430138	-73.9654065551669	138646
ba86f5b6985b25a94c98c6abfce0333d9bfbf0bc	artificial inflation of a delinquency rate by a selection artifact		Cohorts of youths sentenced to a variety of correctional programs show substantial reductions in delinquent activity after leaving the programs compared to before sentencing. This paper develops models of delinquent activity and subsequent sentencing to a correctional program. We show how a population of youths, whose delinquent activity is represented by a stationary stochastic process, can be selected (using reasonable selection rules) to form a cohort which has an inflated rate of delinquent activity prior to selection. When the activity rate returns to its uninflated rate after the youths are released from the program, an apparent reduction results. Based on this analysis we conclude that the reductions noted in delinquent activity may be largely due to the way delinquents are selected for correction rather than to the effect of the programs.

The dynamics of DMPs are analyzed through the framework of contraction theory as networked hierarchies of contracting or transversely contracting systems.

4533fc6ddc0aeb440bdff9ac7764650833fcd282	simulations to benchmark time-varying connectivity methods for fmri		There is a current interest in quantifying time-varying connectivity (TVC) based on neuroimaging data such as fMRI. Many methods have been proposed, and are being applied, revealing new insight into the brain's dynamics. However, given that the ground truth for TVC in the brain is unknown, many concerns remain regarding the accuracy of proposed estimates. Since there exist many TVC methods it is difficult to assess differences in time-varying connectivity between studies. In this paper, we present tvc_benchmarker, which is a Python package containing four simulations to test TVC methods. Here, we evaluate five different methods that together represent a wide spectrum of current approaches to estimating TVC (sliding window, tapered sliding window, multiplication of temporal derivatives, spatial distance and jackknife correlation). These simulations were designed to test each method's ability to track changes in covariance over time, which is a key property in TVC analysis. We found that all tested methods correlated positively with each other, but there were large differences in the strength of the correlations between methods. To facilitate comparisons with future TVC methods, we propose that the described simulations can act as benchmark tests for evaluation of methods. Using tvc_benchmarker researchers can easily add, compare and submit their own TVC methods to evaluate its performance.	benchmark (computing);computer simulation;estimated;existential quantification;ground truth;multiplication;neuroimaging;python;tapering - action;tatsunoko vs. capcom:;fmri	William H.

Prominent in these are actor-critic models of basal ganglia functioning, which build on the strong resemblance between dopamine neuron activity and the temporal difference prediction error signal in the critic, and between dopamine-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum and learning guided by a prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively review several actor-critic models of the basal ganglia with an emphasis on two important aspects: the way in which models of the critic reproduce the temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the extent to which models of the actor take into account known basal ganglia anatomy and physiology. To complement the efforts to relate basal ganglia mechanisms to reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce an alternative approach to modeling a critic network, which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques to 'evolve' an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the evolved mechanism to the basic model of the critic. We conclude our discussion of models of the critic by a critical discussion of the anatomical plausibility of implementations of a critic in basal ganglia circuitry, and conclude that such implementations build on assumptions that are inconsistent with the known anatomy of the basal ganglia. We return to the actor component of the actor-critic model, which is usually modeled at the striatal level with very little detail. We describe an alternative model of the basal ganglia which takes into account several important, and previously neglected, anatomical and physiological characteristics of basal ganglia-thalamocortical connectivity and suggests that the basal ganglia performs reinforcement-biased dimensionality reduction of cortical inputs. We further suggest that since such selective encoding may bias the representation at the level of the frontal cortex towards the selection of rewarded plans and actions, the reinforcement-driven dimensionality reduction framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia actor models. We conclude with a short discussion of the dual role of the dopamine signal in RL and in behavioral switching.	actor model;algorithm;anatomic structures;andrew barto;architecture as topic;basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;complement system proteins;computation (action);computational model;dimensionality reduction;dopamine;dopamine;dual;electronic circuit;evolutionary computation;excitation;experiment;futures studies;generalization (psychology);generalized anxiety disorder;information processing;neostriatum;neuron;neuronal plasticity;nipah virus;plausibility structure;projection defense mechanism;reinforcement learning;rewards;synaptic package manager;temporal difference learning;wheeled stretchers;word lists by frequency;frontal lobe;physiological aspects	Daphna Joel;Yael Niv;Eytan Ruppin	2002	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/S0893-6080(02)00047-3	synaptic plasticity;dopamine;computer science;artificial intelligence;central nervous system;machine learning;neuromodulation;dimensionality reduction;evolutionary computation	ML	20.14860802567606	-70.11453521281143	139451

Here, based on some existing evidence, we propose a hypothesis about the potential adaptation mechanisms which may be employed in the brain based on the perturbation magnitude. In the following sections, we first briefly explain the proposed hypothesis. Then a short description about the resolution of hand proprioceptive sensory is presented. In this hypothesis, the size of error is assessed relative to the resolution of proprioceptive sensory. Next, the empirical evidence supporting the proposed hypothesis are shortly described.	acclimatization;perturbation theory;sensorimotor cortex	Fatemeh Yavari;Farzad Towhidkhah;Mohammad Darainy	2014		10.3389/fncom.2014.00028	psychology;neuroscience;internal model;developmental psychology;medicine;pathology;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;adaptation	AI	16.38074358149418	-74.86531128408444	139533

Cognitive film theory attributes this to the system of continuity editing, a system of editing guidelines outlining the effect of different cuts and edits on spectators. A major principle in this framework is the 180° rule, a rule recommendation that, to avoid spectators' attention to the editing, two edited shots of the same event or action should not be filmed from angles differing in a way that expectations of spatial continuity are strongly violated. In the present study, we used high-density EEG to explore the neural underpinnings of this rule. In particular, our analysis shows that cuts and edits in general elicit early ERP component indicating the registration of syntactic violations as known from language, music, and action processing. However, continuity edits and cuts-across the line differ from each other regarding later components likely to be indicating the differences in spatial remapping as well as in the degree of conscious awareness of one's own perception. Interestingly, a time-frequency analysis of the occipital alpha rhythm did not support the hypothesis that such differences in processing routes are mainly linked to visual attention. On the contrary, our study found specific modulations of the central mu rhythm ERD as an indicator of sensorimotor activity, suggesting that sensorimotor networks might play an important role. We think that these findings shed new light on current discussions about the role of attention and embodied perception in film perception and should be considered when explaining spectators' different experience of different kinds of cuts.

In this work, we proposed a novel multi-scale dynamic dictionary learning framework which decomposes the input fMRI signals into functional networks via sliding/growing time window network analysis approach based on a fast dictionary learning method. As the functional networks are obtained at every possible temporal position and multiple scales within the framework, links across functional networks are then defined by the direct or indirect correlations between their temporal variation patterns. The identified links between networks are then concatenated into network continuums, which are the dynamic combinations of functional networks at various temporal segments. By applying the proposed framework on the task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Q1 release, we have found that the network continuum has the capability of capturing the dynamic transition patterns of functional networks and providing an intuitive characterization of the network stationarity across time scales.	concatenation;dictionary;human connectome project;machine learning;stationary process;triune continuum paradigm	Xiang Li;Binbin Lin;Jinglei Lv;Jieping Ye;Tianming Liu	2016	2016 IEEE 13th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493212	computer science;dynamic network analysis;artificial intelligence;theoretical computer science;machine learning	Vision	22.068014685065005	-75.68630119216559	139908
5355cc25b60ba51fa6b9e3be26299b4739af937c	a general learning system based on neuron bursting and tonic firing		This paper proposes a theoretical framework for the biological learning mechanism as a general learning system. The proposal is as follows. The bursting and tonic modes of firing patterns found in many neuron types in the brain correspond to two separate modes of information processing, with one mode resulting in awareness, and another mode being subliminal. In such a coding scheme, a neuron in bursting state codes for the highest level of perceptual abstraction representing a pattern of sensory stimuli, or volitional abstraction representing a pattern of muscle contraction sequences. Within the 50-250 ms minimum integration time of experience, the bursting neurons form synchrony ensembles to allow for binding of related percepts. The degree which different bursting neurons can be merged into the same synchrony ensemble depends on the underlying cortical connections that represent the degree of perceptual similarity. These synchrony ensembles compete for selective attention to remain active. The dominant synchrony ensemble triggers episodic memory recall in the hippocampus, while forming new episodic memory with current sensory stimuli, resulting in a stream of thoughts. Neuromodulation modulates both top-down selection of synchrony ensembles, and memory formation. Episodic memory stored in the hippocampus is transferred to semantic and procedural memory in the cortex during rapid eye movement sleep, by updating cortical neuron synaptic weights with spike timing dependent plasticity. With the update of synaptic weights, new neurons become bursting while previous bursting neurons become tonic, allowing bursting neurons to move up to a higher level of perceptual abstraction. Finally, the proposed learning mechanism is compared with the backpropagation algorithm used in deep neural networks, and a proposal of how the credit assignment problem can be addressed by the current proposal is presented.	algorithm;artificial neural network;artificial neuron;assignment problem;backpropagation;code;deep learning;evolutionary algorithm;information processing;neuromodulation (medicine);semiconductor consolidation;synaptic package manager;synaptic weight;theory;top-down and bottom-up design;virtual synchrony	Xueqin Ding	2018	CoRR	10.1016/j.mehy.2018.12.001	neuroscience;procedural memory;bursting;subliminal stimuli;stimulus (physiology);episodic memory;recall;sensory system;spike-timing-dependent plasticity;endocrinology;internal medicine;biology	ML	18.073609838261323	-72.83759220230539	139943

In this work, we study the interface between these two distinct topics and obtain techniques to uncover hierarchical block structure in symmetric matrices &#x2013; an important aspect in the success of many vision problems. Our new algorithm, the incremental multiresolution matrix factorization, uncovers such structure one feature at a time, and hence scales well to large matrices. We describe how this multiscale analysis goes much farther than what a direct global factorization of the data can identify. We evaluate the efficacy of the resulting factorizations for relative leveraging within regression tasks using medical imaging data. We also use the factorization on representations learned by popular deep networks, providing evidence of their ability to infer semantic relationships even when they are not explicitly trained to do so. We show that this algorithm can be used as an exploratory tool to improve the network architecture, and within numerous other settings in vision.	algorithm;architecture as topic;computer vision;importance sampling;increment;inference;interface device component;medical imaging;multiresolution analysis;network architecture;sampling (signal processing)	Vamsi K.

After giving an outline of Brain Informatics methodology, we describe how to design cognitive experiments of mental arithmetic task with multiple difficulty levels for obtaining multiple EEG and fMRI data sources, and how to analyze such data for investigating the spatiotemporal characteristics and flow of human computation processing. Such an investigation can be regarded as a case study using Brain Informatics methodology. Experimental results show the usefulness of our approach.	human-based computation	Shinichi Motomura;Ning Zhong	2010	Cognitive Systems Research	10.1016/j.cogsys.2008.08.010	computer science;artificial intelligence;computational mechanics;data science;data mining;data analysis	Robotics	22.389008488350555	-76.63880511113743	140051

1f6699f14a7aa6da086f27cc4eb49965378fdb3e	generic decoding of seen and imagined objects using hierarchical visual features		Object recognition is a key function in both human and machine vision. While brain decoding of seen and imagined objects has been achieved, the prediction is limited to training examples. We present a decoding approach for arbitrary objects using the machine vision principle that an object category is represented by a set of features rendered invariant through hierarchical processing. We show that visual features, including those derived from a deep convolutional neural network, can be predicted from fMRI patterns, and that greater accuracy is achieved for low-/high-level features with lower-/higher-level visual areas, respectively. Predicted features are used to identify seen/imagined object categories (extending beyond decoder training) from a set of computed features for numerous object images. Furthermore, decoding of imagined objects reveals progressive recruitment of higher-to-lower visual representations. Our results demonstrate a homology between human and machine vision and its utility for brain-based information retrieval.	artificial neural network;biological neural networks;categories;convolutional neural network;decoder device component;homology (biology);information retrieval;machine vision;outline of object recognition;physical object;fmri	Tomoyasu Horikawa;Yukiyasu Kamitani	2017		10.1038/ncomms15037	artificial neural network;decoding methods;genetics;training set;machine learning;biology;artificial intelligence	Vision	21.17039966977105	-66.70481824253373	140223

The final objectives are the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the human brain, how to reproduce them in an artificial environment, and how drugs interact with them. Multiple neural models have been proposed, each with their peculiarities, from the very complex and biologically realistic Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to the very simple ``leaky integrate-and-fire'' neuron. However, despite numerous attempts to understand the learning behaviour of the synapses, few models have been proposed. Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is one of the most relevant and biologically plausible models, and some variants (such as the triplet-based STDP rule) have been proposed to accommodate all biological observations. The research presented in this thesis focuses on a novel learning rule, based on the spike-pair STDP algorithm, which provides a statistical approach with the advantage of being less computationally expensive than the standard STDP rule, and is therefore suitable for its implementation on stand-alone computational units. The environment in which this research work has been carried out is the SpiNNaker project, which aims to provide a massively parallel computational substrate for neural simulation. To support such research, two other topics have been addressed: the first is a way to inject spikes into the SpiNNaker system through a non-real-time channel such as the Ethernet link, synchronising with the timing of the SpiNNaker system. The second research topic is focused on a way to route spikes in the SpiNNaker system based on populations of neurons. The three topics are presented in sequence after a brief introduction to the SpiNNaker project. Future work could include structural plasticity (also known as synaptic rewiring); here, during the simulation of neural networks on the SpiNNaker system, axons, dendrites and synapses may be grown or pruned according to biological observations.	artificial neural network;spiking neural network	Sergio Davies	2013			simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;spiking neural network	ML	16.482559511921426	-68.32087544171976	140252

According to the efficient-coding hypothesis (Barlow, Sensory Comunication, MIT press, Cambridge, 1961), neurons are adapted to the statistical properties of the signals to which they are exposed. In this paper we employ methods of information theory to calculate, both exactly (numerically) and approximately, the ultimate limits on reliable information transmission for an empirical neuronal model. We couple information transfer with the metabolic cost of neuronal activity and determine the optimal information-to-metabolic cost ratios. We find that the optimal input distribution is discrete with only six points of support, both with and without a metabolic constraint. However, we also find that many different input distributions achieve mutual information close to capacity, which implies that the precise structure of the capacity-achieving input is of lesser importance than the value of capacity.	efficient coding hypothesis;information theory;metabolic process, cellular;mike lesser;mutual information;neuron;numerical analysis;published comment	Lubomir Kostal;Petr Lánský;Mark D.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether peripheral magnetic stimulation has similar effects on cortical excitability to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A magnetic stimulator with a flat figure-of-eight coil was used for both TMS, and peripheral magnetic stimulation applied to the bilateral forearms. TMS was performed on the left primary motor cortex to evaluate influence of the peripheral magnetic stimulation, and motor evoked potential (MEP) was measured from the right first dorsal interosseous. Peripheral magnetic stimulation was performed at a stimulus frequency of 1 Hz or 10 Hz, to the stimulus sites on the right and left supination of the forearm. The effects of peripheral magnetic stimulation were evaluated by comparing the mean MEP amplitude elicited by TMS before and after peripheral magnetic stimulation. We found that cortical excitability varied according to the stimulation site and frequency of the peripheral magnetic stimulation. The inhibition of cortical excitability was observed following 1 Hz peripheral magnetic stimulation over the right forearm (p<;0.001). In contrast, increased cortical excitability was observed using 1 Hz peripheral magnetic stimulation over the left forearm and 10 Hz stimulation over either the right or left forearms. We suggest that peripheral magnetic stimulation has a similar effect to TMS, and can induce both facilitation and inhibition of cortical excitability.	adrenal cortex diseases;area striata structure;bilateral filter;coil gene;cerebral cortex;cortical congenital hyperostosis;cortical excitability;evoked potentials;evoked potentials, motor;forearm;hertz (hz);media-embedded processor;modulation;peripheral;structure of cortex of kidney;supination;transcranial magnetic stimulation;facilitation	Aya Sato;Xiang-Qun Liu;Tetsuya Torii;Masakuni Iwahashi;Keiji Iramina	2016	2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2016.7592196	neuroscience;physical therapy;anatomy	ML	17.876266234648032	-79.63790954338535	140577
4e6c42ba4fd44a8baa4ba6f453d8051e914f7d42	bold responses to itch in the human spinal cord		Itch is an independent sensory modality and a very common symptom with manifold causes. However, the neuronal representation of itch perception in the central nervous system is not entirely understood and there is hardly any knowledge about neuronal correlates of itch in the human spinal cord. In the present study we aimed to identify itch-related neural activity in the cervical spinal cord in healthy volunteers employing high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We studied histamine-induced itch on the radial forearm and modulated itch intensity by non-noxious cooling. To control for effects of thermal stimulation (i.e., cooling), volunteers also underwent an identical session without histamine. We studied histamine-induced itch on the radial forearm, by using a block design with alternating blocks of non-noxious cooling separated by blocks of skin temperature. Non-noxious cooling of histamine-treated skin compared to cooling of non-treated skin led to a significant increase in itch perception. On the neural level, itch was paralleled by activation in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord at the transition between spinal segment C5 and C6, ipsilateral to the side of stimulation. These results suggest that itch-related neural activity can be assessed noninvasively in humans at the spinal cord.	cns disorder;cervical segment of spinal cord;computer cooling;cool - action;dermatologic disorders;experiment;forearm;histamine;image resolution;interaction;microneurography;modality (human–computer interaction);modulation;neck;pain;peripheral;pruritus;radial (radio);resonance;sensor;spinal cord posterior horn;structure of posterior gray horn of spinal cord;fmri;manifold	Missanga F. van de Sand;Christian Sprenger;Christian Büchel	2015	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.12.019	medicine;anesthesia;anatomy;surgery	ML	19.266345194225817	-79.14246501425026	140599

Therefore, it is worthwhile to analyze associative memory models with delayed synapses. Thus, a sequential associative memory model with delayed synapses is discussed, where a discrete synchronous updating rule and a correlation learning rule are employed. Its dynamic properties are analyzed by the statistical neurodynamics. In this paper, we first re-derive the Yanai-Kim theory, which involves macrodynamical equations for the dynamics of the network with serial delay elements. Since their theory needs a computational complexity of O(L4t) to obtain the macroscopic state at time step t where L is the length of delay, it is intractable to discuss the macroscopic properties for a large L limit. Thus, we derive steady state equations using the discrete Fourier transformation, where the computational complexity does not formally depend on L. We show that the storage capacity alphaC is in proportion to the delay length L with a large L limit, and the proportion constant is 0.195, i.e. alphaC=0.195L. These results are supported by computer simulations.	artificial neural network;autoassociative memory;computational complexity theory;computer simulation;content-addressable memory;discrete fourier transform;learning rule;neural network simulation;neural oscillation;recurrent neural network;statistical model;steady state;synapse;synapses	Seiji Miyoshi;Hiro-Fumi Yanai;Masato Okada	2004	Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society	10.1016/S0893-6080(03)00207-7	computer simulation;memory model;computer science;artificial intelligence;recurrent neural network;machine learning;discrete fourier transform;computational complexity theory;steady state;artificial neural network;algorithm	AI	21.044357852653835	-71.29015517764422	140664

Within the domain of categorization, at least two systems are thought to facilitate learning: an explicit (declarative) system depending largely on the prefrontal cortex, and a procedural (non-declarative) system depending on the basal ganglia. Substantial evidence suggests that each system is optimally suited to learn particular categorization tasks. However, it remains unknown precisely how these systems interact to produce optimal learning and behavior. In order to investigate this issue, the present research evaluated the progression of learning through simulation of categorization tasks using COVIS, a well-known model of human category learning that includes both explicit and procedural learning systems. Specifically, the model's parameter space was thoroughly explored in procedurally learned categorization tasks across a variety of conditions and architectures to identify plausible interaction architectures. The simulation results support the hypothesis that one-way interaction between the systems occurs such that the explicit system """"bootstraps"""" learning early on in the procedural system. Thus, the procedural system initially learns a suboptimal strategy employed by the explicit system and later refines its strategy. This bootstrapping could be from cortical-striatal projections that originate in premotor or motor regions of cortex, or possibly by the explicit system's control of motor responses through basal ganglia-mediated loops."""	architecture as topic;basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;categorization;color gradient;concept learning;learning disorders;learning to rank;machine learning;one-way function;population parameter;prefrontal cortex;projection defense mechanism;requirement;simulation	Erick J.

To investigate the neural mechanisms that suppress visual word interference, we used fMRI and a Stroop task, using a block design with an event-related analysis. Participants indicated with a finger press whether a visual stimulus was colored pink or blue. The stimulus was either the written word “BLUE,” the written word “PINK,” or a string of four Xs, with word interference introduced when the meaning of the word and its color were “incongruent” (e.g., BLUE in pink hue) relative to congruent (e.g., BLUE in blue) or neutral (e.g., XXXX in pink). The participants also made color decisions in the presence of spatial interference rather than word interference (i.e., the Simon task). By blocking incongruent, congruent, and neutral trials, we identified activation related to the mechanisms that suppress interference as that which was greater at the end relative to the start of incongruency. This highlighted the role of the left head of caudate in the control of word interference but not spatial interference. The response in the left head of caudate contrasted to bilateral inferior frontal activation that was greater at the start than at the end of incongruency, and to the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus which responded to a change in the motor response. Our study therefore provides novel insights into the role of the left head of caudate in the mechanisms that suppress word interference.	activation function;basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;bilateral filter;blocking (computing);computation;control system;down-regulation;face;frontal region;gyrus cinguli;interference (communication);overlearning;relevance;visual word;word lists by frequency;zero suppression;fmri;fangchinoline	Nilufa Ali;David W.

However, the relevant microstructural changes in the white matter of affected brain regions following this early insult remain unknown. This study assessed white matter integrity in the main hippocampal projections of adult macaque monkeys with neonatal hippocampal lesions, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Data analysis was performed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and compared with volume of interest statistics. Alterations of fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity indices were observed in fornix, temporal stem, ventromedial prefrontal cortex and optical radiations. To further validate the lesion effects on the prefrontal cortex, probabilistic diffusion tractography was used to examine the integrity of the fiber connections between hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and alterations were found in these connections. In addition, increased radial diffusivity in the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlated negatively with the severity of deficits in working memory in the same monkeys. The findings revealed microstructural changes due to neonatal hippocampal lesion, and confirmed that neonatal neurotoxic hippocampal lesions resulted in significant and enduring functional alterations in the hippocampal projection system.	brain fornix;ca4 region, hippocampal;cerebral cortex;diffusion tensor imaging;diffusion tractography;fractional anisotropy;macaca;map projection;medical imaging;memory disorders;monkeys;neurotoxicity syndromes;projections and predictions;radial (radio);radial basis function;radiation;region of interest;spatial analysis;stem of temporal lobe;tissue fiber;tract (literature);ventromedial prefrontal cortex;white matter	Yuguang Meng;Christa Payne;Longchuan Li;Xiaoping Hu;Xiaodong Zhang;Jocelyne Bachevalier	2014	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.08.059	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology	ML	19.839403625215684	-79.91128205541719	140989
564e6da4932ad4298f9199258d5b87017e6645f4	dissociating estimation from comparison and response eliminates parietal involvement in sequential numerosity perception		It has been widely debated whether the parietal cortex stores an abstract representation of numerosity that is activated for Arabic digits as well as for non-symbolic stimuli in a sensory modality independent fashion. Some studies suggest that numerical information in time-invariant (simultaneous) symbolic and non-symbolic visual stimuli is represented in the parietal cortex. In humans, whether the same representation is activated for time-variant (sequential) stimuli and for stimuli coming from different modalities has not been determined. To investigate this idea, we measured the brain activation of healthy adults performing estimation and/or comparison of sequential visual (series of dots) and auditory (series of beeps) numerosities. Our experimental design allowed us to separate numerosity estimation from comparison and response related factors. The BOLD response in the parietal cortex increased only when participants were engaged in the comparison of two consecutive numerosities that required a response. Using multivariate pattern analysis we trained a classifier to decode numerosity in various regions of interest (ROI). We failed to find any parietal ROI where the classifier could decode numerosities during the estimation phase. Rather, when participants were not engaged in comparison we were able to decode numerosity in an auditory cortex ROI for auditory stimuli and in a visual cortex ROI for visual stimuli. On the other hand, during the response period the classifier successfully decoded numerosity information in a parietal ROI for both visual and auditory numerosities. These results were further confirmed by support vector regression. In sum, our study does not support the involvement of the parietal cortex during estimation of sequential numerosity in the absence of an active task with a response requirement.	auditory area;cerebral cortex;design of experiments;digit structure;modality (human–computer interaction);numerical analysis;parietal lobe;pattern recognition;region of interest;support vector machine;time-invariant system;visual cortex	Seda Cavdaroglu;Curren Katz;André Knops	2015	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.019	psychology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	ML	15.918106101260017	-77.22991471286738	141281
ff34cb0fddd836a4a5a60b24d09c91661106272d	a neural mechanism of dynamic gating of task-relevant information by top-down influence in primary visual cortex	neural model;primary visual cortex;perceptual learning;top down influence	Visual recognition involves bidirectional information flow, which consists of bottom-up information coding from retina and top-down information coding from higher visual areas. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of early visual areas such as primary visual area (V1) in recognition and memory formation. V1 neurons are not passive transformers of sensory inputs but work as adaptive processor, changing their function according to behavioral context. Top-down signals affect tuning property of V1 neurons and contribute to the gating of sensory information relevant to behavior. However, little is known about the neuronal mechanism underlying the gating of task-relevant information in V1. To address this issue, we focus on task-dependent tuning modulations of V1 neurons in two tasks of perceptual learning. We develop a model of the V1, which receives feedforward input from lateral geniculate nucleus and top-down input from a higher visual area. We show here that the change in a balance between excitation and inhibition in V1 connectivity is necessary for gating task-relevant information in V1. The balance change well accounts for the modulations of tuning characteristic and temporal properties of V1 neuronal responses. We also show that the balance change of V1 connectivity is shaped by top-down signals with temporal correlations reflecting the perceptual strategies of the two tasks. We propose a learning mechanism by which synaptic balance is modulated. To conclude, top-down signal changes the synaptic balance between excitation and inhibition in V1 connectivity, enabling early visual area such as V1 to gate context-dependent information under multiple task performances.

We consider this new knowledge in relation to three factors proposed earlier to describe the rules for synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal pathway. These factors are a phasic increase in dopamine release, presynaptic activity and postsynaptic depolarisation. A function is proposed which relates the amount of dopamine release in the striatum to the modulation of corticostriatal synaptic efficacy. It is argued that this function, and the experimental data from which it arises, are compatible with existing models which associate the reward-related firing of dopamine neurons with changes in corticostriatal synaptic efficacy.	acetylcholine;activation action;average-case complexity;depressive disorder;dopamine;dopaminergic neurons;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;experiment;gene regulatory network;linux test project (ltp);long-term potentiation;long-term synaptic depression;mandatory - hl7definedroseproperty;modulation;neostriatum;neuronal plasticity;reinforcement learning;rule (guideline);synapse;synapses;synaptic package manager	John N.

We address the question of the relationship between the timing of the synaptic inputs and the output spikes. This requires an analysis of the interspike interval distribution of the output spikes, which is obtained in the gaussian approximation. The conditional output spike density in response to noisy periodic input is evaluated as a function of the initial phase of the inputs. This enables the phase transition matrix to be calculated, which relates the phase at which the output spike is generated to the initial phase of the inputs. The interspike interval histogram and the period histogram for the neural response to ongoing periodic input are then evaluated by using the leading eigenvector of this phase transition matrix. The synchronization index of the output spikes is found to increase sharply as the inputs become synchronized. This enhancement of synchronization is most pronounced for large numbers of inputs and lower frequencies of modulation and also for rates of input near the critical input rate. However, the mutual information between the input phase of the stimulus and the timing of output spikes is found to decrease at low input rates as the number of inputs increases. The results show close agreement with those obtained from numerical simulations for large numbers of inputs.	approximation;biological neuron model;computer simulation;modulation;mutual information;numerical analysis;stochastic matrix;synapse;synaptic package manager	Anthony N.

We introduced two different Simon tasks where subjects had to identify shapes on the basis of form-from-motion perception (FFMo) within a randomly moving dot field, while (1) motion direction (motion-based Simon task) or (2) stimulus location (location-based Simon task) had to be ignored. Behavioral data revealed that both types of Simon tasks induced highly significant interference effects. Using event-related fMRI, we could demonstrate that both tasks share a common cluster of activated brain regions during conflict resolution (pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), superior parietal lobule (SPL), and cuneus) but also show task-specific activation patterns (left superior temporal cortex in the motion-based, and the left fusiform gyrus in the location-based Simon task). Although motion-based and location-based Simon tasks are conceptually very similar (Type 3 stimulus-response ensembles according to the taxonomy of [Kornblum, S., Stevens, G. (2002).

Some evidence in experimental psychology has suggested that imagery ability is crucial for the correct understanding of social intention. The present study was conducted first to confirm that the nature of the motor intention leads to early modulations of movement kinematics. Secondly, we tested whether humans use imagery to read an agent’s intention when observing the very first element of a complex action sequence. Results revealed early variations in movement kinematics between three different social actions and further showed that human agents can use these early deviants to anticipate above chance level the end-result before seeing the second half of the sequence. Response times in the observation task were similar in duration to those measured in the true production task, suggesting the use of motor imagery for trial categorization. Nevertheless, in a third study, the use of an artificial (neural network) classifier demonstrated that classification within the first 500 ms is possible without cognitive imagery processing. Hence, our results suggest that low-level motor indices afford intention reading without need for motor imagery but that human agents may use imaging beyond simulation to create an embodied sense of interactivity.	artificial neural network;categorization;cognition;high- and low-level;intentionality;interaction;interactivity;simulation;theory;video clip	Daniel Lewkowicz;Yvonne Delevoye-Turrell;David Bailly;Pierre Andry;Philippe Gaussier	2013	Adaptive Behaviour	10.1177/1059712313501347	psychology;computer vision;kinematics;optimal control;classifier;artificial intelligence;communication;social psychology	ML	13.666890285774443	-74.7482831188533	141848

To test the hypotheses, the authors used event-related potentials (ERPs) technique to investigate the interaction pattern of emotion and working memory (WM) by typical WM n-back tasks with low and high cognitive loads. In the 0-back task, late ERP components for both spatial and verbal WM were affected by induced emotional states consistently. However, in the 2-back task, they could clearly observe that induced emotional states selectively affected ERPs for spatial WM, but not for verbal WM. These results suggested that the interactive pattern of emotion and WM was modulated by cognitive load. In the condition of low cognitive load, interaction of emotion and WM was similar and nonspecific. However, with the increasing of cognitive load, interaction of emotion and WM became specific and selective. ERP results suggested that attention resource competition could be the underlying neutral mechanism of the selective interactive pattern between emotion and WM.

As a result, there is a low efficiency of cognition in anxious individuals. WM refers to a system used for the temporary storage and manipulation of information, which is deemed necessary for a range of more complex cognitive activities (Baddeley, 1992). Baddeley (1992) has hypothesized that WM is composed of three major components that can work independently of one another: (i) a verbal WM system; (ii) a visuo-spatial WM system; (iii) a central executive that determines which information is made available for conscious processing by exerting control over voluntary action. The verbal WM system involves a phonological loop, and visuo-spatial WM is thought to involve a buffer responsible for the initial registration of non-verbal material called visuo-spatial sketchpad. However, more recent studies suggest that spatial and verbal WM may be differentially affected by affects in healthy people, and possibly spatial WM is more vulnerable to negative emotion (Lavric, Rippon, & Gray, 2003; Li, Chan, & Luo, 2010; Li, Li, & Luo, 2005b, 2006). This implies that the modulation of cognition by affect is not a global effect but may involve specific neurocognitive mechanisms. However, it is not known which neural mechanisms are involved in this selective modulation. Recently, Event-related potentials (ERPs) studies also found this selective effect between emotion and working memory and implied the underlying neural mechanism. ERPs are voltage fluctuations that are associated in time with some physical or mental occurrence. These potentials can be recorded from the human scalp and extracted from the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) by means of filtering and signal averaging. Because the temporal resolution of these measurements is on the order of milliseconds, ERPs can accurately measure when processing activities take place in the human brain. The spatial resolution of ERP measurements is limited both by theory and by our present technology, but multichannel recordings can allow us to estimate the intracerebral locations of these cerebral processes (Picton et al., 2000). When ERPs were first used to study issues in the domain of cognitive neuroscience, they were primarily used as an alternative to measurements of the speed and accuracy of motor responses in paradigms with discrete stimuli and responses. In this context, ERPs have two distinct advantages. First, an overt response reflects the output of a large number of individual cognitive processes, and variations in reaction time (RT) and accuracy are difficult to attribute to variations in a specific cognitive process. ERPs, in contrast, provide a continuous measure of processing between a stimulus and a response, making it possible to determine which stage or stages of processing are affected by a specific experimental manipulation. A second advantage of ERPs over behavioral measures is that they can provide an online measure of the processing of stimuli even when there is no behavioral response. Thus, the ability to covertly monitor the online processing of information is one of the greatest advantages of the ERP technique (Luck, 2005). For example, in Li et al.’s ERP study (2006), there wasn’t significant interaction effect between emotion and working memory type (spatial and verbal working memory) on accuracy and RT. However, they found that in the parietal cortex, P300 amplitudes of spatial WM tasks were reduced by the participants’ negative emotional states significantly. Whereas in verbal WM tasks, this kind of influence was absent, which was interpreted in term of the reliance of threat-evoked anxiety and spatial WM on a common visuo-spatial attention mechanism (Lavric et al., 2003; Li et al., 2006, 2010). Because negative affects automatically draw visuo-spatial attention (e.g., attention to threat) (Li, Li, & Luo, 2005a; Mathews, Mackintosh, & Fulcher, 1998; Mathews & Mackintosh, 1998), which most likely represents an exacerbation of the normal increase in visuospatial attention in the presence of an exogenous threat. Attention may well represent the point of overlap between anxiety and spatial WM, because there appear to be visuospatial attentional demands during spatial WM that are not present during verbal WM.

The aim is to understand the neural correlates of alpha rhythm slowing (decrease in mean frequency of oscillation), a hallmark in the EEG of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. The neural mass model used, referred to herein as the modARm, is a modified version of Lopes da Silva’s Alpha Rhythm model (ARm). Previously, the power spectral behaviour of the modARm was analysed in context to AD. In this work, we revisit the modARm to make a combined study of the dynamical behaviour of the model and its power spectral behaviour within the alpha band while simulating the hallmark neuropathological condition of ‘synaptic depletion’ in AD. The results show that the modARm exhibits two ‘operating modes’ in the time-domain i.e. a point attractor and a limit cycle mode; the ∗Corresponding author Email address: basab@ieee.org (Basabdatta Sen Bhattacharya ) Preprint submitted to Neurocomputing November 22, 2012 alpha rhythmic content in the model output is maximal at the vicinity of the point of bifurcation. Furthermore, the inhibitory synaptic connectivity from the cells of the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus to the Thalamo-Cortical Relay cells significantly influence bifurcation behaviour — while a decrease in the inhibition can induce limit-cycle behaviour corresponding to abnormal brain states such as seizures, an increase in inhibition in awake state corresponding to a point attractor mode may result in the slowing of the alpha rhythms as observed in AD. These observations help emphasise the importance of bifurcation analysis of model behaviour in inferring the biological relevance of results obtained from power-spectral analysis of the neural models in the context of understanding neurodegeneration.	bifurcation theory;consciousness;electroencephalography;email;limit cycle;maximal set;neurocomputing;relay;relevance;simulation;synaptic package manager	Basabdatta Sen Bhattacharya;Yuksel Cakir;Neslihan Serap Sengör;Liam P.

Among other things, the FAS have a significant impact on spike-train encodings that propagate through the affected neurons, leading to compromised signal processing on a neuronal network level. This work merges, for the first time, three fields of study: (i) signal processing in excitatory-inhibitory (EI) networks of neurons via population codes, (ii) decision-making theory driven by the production of evidence from stimulus, and (iii) compromised spike-train propagation through FAS. As such, we demonstrate a mathematical architecture capable of characterizing compromised decision-making driven by cellular mechanisms. The computational model also leads to several novel predictions and diagnostics for understanding injury level and cognitive deficits, including a key finding that decision-making reaction times, rather than accuracy, are indicative of network level damage. The results have a number of translational implications, including that the level of network damage can be characterized by the reaction times in simple cognitive and motor tests.	action potential;binary prefix;brain injuries;code;cognition disorders;computation;computational model;decision making;diagnostic factor;excitatory amino acids;focal (programming language);giant axonal neuropathy 1;genetic translation process;mathematics;signal processing;software propagation;spike glycoprotein, coronavirus;traumatic brain injury;traumatic injury;nervous system disorder	Pedro D.

The dynamics are represented via an astrocytic response function that approximates the effects of astrocytic activity, including delay between neural activity and hemodynamic response. The astrocytic response function is incorporated into a spatiotemporal hemodynamic model to predict the BOLD response measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Adding astrocytic dynamics is shown to significantly improve the ability of the model to robustly reproduce the spatiotemporal properties of the experimental data such as characteristic frequency and time-to-peak. Moreover, the results are consistent across different astrocytic response functions, thus a simple impulsive form suffices to model the effective time delay of astrocytic responses. Finally, the results yield improved estimates of previously reported hemodynamic parameters, such as natural frequency and decay rate of the flow signal, which are consistent with experimentally verified physiological limits. The techniques developed in this study will contribute to improved analysis of BOLD-fMRI data.	broadcast delay;estimated;experiment;frequency response;hemodynamics;magnetic resonance imaging;normal mode;oxygen;resting state fmri;modeling	J.

Scales in both space and time that must be considered when integrating across hierarchies of the nervous system are sufficiently great as to have impeded the development of routine multilevel modeling methodologies. Complex molecular interactions at the level of receptors and channels regulate activity at the level of neurons; interactions between multiple populations of neurons ultimately give rise to complex neural systems function and behavior. This spatial complexity takes place in the context of a composite temporal integration of multiple, different events unfolding at the millisecond, second, minute, hour, and longer time scales. In this study, we present a multiscale modeling methodology that integrates synaptic models into single neuron, and multineuron, network models. We have applied this approach to the specific problem of how changes at the level of kinetic parameters of a receptor-channel model are translated into changes in the temporal firing pattern of a single neuron, and ultimately, changes in the spatiotemporal activity of a network of neurons. These results demonstrate how this powerful methodology can be applied to understand the effects of a given local process within multiple hierarchical levels of the nervous system.	ampa receptors;cns disorder;channel (communications);interaction;kinetics;modulation;modulator device component;multilevel model;multiscale modeling;neuron;neurons;population;synaptic package manager;unfolding (dsp implementation)	Jean-Marie Bouteiller;Sushmita L.

It can be implemented with a compact circuitry. This is because we designed its phase portrait structure utilizing the curves native to the MOSFET circuitries. Bifurcation theory is applied to tune the characteristics of the circuitry. Biological neurons can be divided into two main classes based on their responses to sustained current stimuli: classes I and II. At the onset of firing, the firing frequency of class I neurons is asymptotically zero, while that of class II neurons is nonzero. It is generally accepted that classes I and II excitabilities are produced by a saddle-node bifurcation and a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, respectively. Class I* neurons, which belong to a subclass of class I, are characterized by a phase plane structure called a narrow channel. By changing a few circuit parameters, our circuitry can achieve class I without a narrow channel, class I*, and class II. The proposed circuitry is compatible with standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processes. Hence, it can be easily implemented in an analog very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuit; further, large networks can be constructed by using this circuitry. We implemented and tested our circuitry, that was constructed using discrete components. We analyzed the responses to singlet, doublet, periodic pulses, and sustained current stimuli; further, we demonstrated that our circuitry inherited three critical properties of biological neurons: (a) the fundamental abilities of excitable cells, (b) neural excitability such as of classes I and II, and (c) an ability to generate chaotic responses to periodic pulse stimuli. We then applied the bifurcation theory to our circuitry and verified its mathematical structure using XPPAUT software. Furthermore, the simulation results on a gap junction (GJ)-coupled network comprising class I* neurons revealed the genesis of itinerant dynamics similar to that found by Fujii et al..	biological neuron model	Takashi Takemoto;Takashi Kohno;Kazuyuki Aihara	2007	I.

9d905313e4874ef6ea62c5c5a3e5903114dd3067	when left feels right: asymmetry in the affordance effect		Previous research has demonstrated the existence of the so-called affordance effect (faster response when the visual affordance of a graspable object (e.g., a pan) corresponds to the response location). It has been argued that the effect is due to abstract spatial coding of the position of the handle relative to the object instead of the grasping affordance. Our experiment tested the hypothesis that the affordance effect is not caused solely by abstract spatial coding but also by specific motor activation in response to the visual affordance. We assumed that, in the case of abstract spatial codes, response location and not hand distinction would be the critical factor for producing an affordance effect. In our experiment, bi-manual crossed/uncrossed responses to left/right symbols superimposed on a picture of a pan were used. The task was to attend to the symbol and to press a corresponding left/right button. Affordances of the pan were manipulated. A three-way interaction between side of affordance (left/right), mode of response (crossed/uncrossed hands), and response–affordance correspondence (corresponding/non-corresponding) showed a correspondence effect in the right affordance condition with hands uncrossed and no correspondence effect with hands crossed. The correspondence effect was obtained in the left affordance condition across hand positions that differed only by their magnitude. Overall, the results suggest that both mechanisms (grasping affordance and spatial codes) differentially contribute to the processing of an object with a graspable handle, depending on the affordance side and response hand.	area striata structure;assumed;code;emotions;pointing device	Armina Janyan;Gergana V.

It is concluded that: 1. For fast handwriting the principle of position feedback does not hold; 2. There is physiological evidence for resolving the writing movements into two more or less perpendicular directions; 3. The shape of a word is determined by the timing of the muscle contractions and not by the magnitude of the forces used; 4.

The CLM uses cooperative and competitive interactions to pa rtition a set of input features into groups by energy minimization. As we show, the stable attractors of the CLM provide consistent and unambiguous labelings in t he sense of RL and we give an efficient stochastic simulation procedure for their identification. In addition to binding the CLM exhibits contextual activity modulation to represent stimulus salience. We incorporate deterministic an ne ling for avoidance of local minima and show how figure-ground segmentation and g rouping can be combined for the CLM application of contour grouping on a rea l image.

In this study, in order to better understand the neurobiological processes underlying social dysfunction in schizophrenia, we investigated regional structural brain abnormalities and emotion-attribution abilities in these patients. Twenty schizophrenic patients and 20 group-matched healthy comparison participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were examined for emotion-attribution abilities by using the Perception of Affect Task (PAT). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was applied to investigate regional brain structural alterations. Relative to the healthy participants, the schizophrenic patients exhibited reduced gray matter concentrations in the left superior temporal gyrus, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), right anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and right insula. The schizophrenic patients performed poorly on emotion-attribution tasks. Importantly, poor performance on emotion attribution to protagonists in social situations was found to be associated with reductions in gray matter in the MPFC of the patient group. This preliminary result suggests that in schizophrenia, difficulties in understanding the emotional experiences of others are possible manifestations of structural abnormalities in the MPFC. This study provides the neurobiological correlates of social dysfunction in schizophrenia and links structural abnormalities with impaired social cognitive abilities.	acoustic lobing;bilateral filter;cerebral cortex;cognition disorders;congenital abnormality;erectile dysfunction;experience;gray matter;gyrus cinguli;insula of reil;magnetic resonance imaging;medial graph;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;patients;prefrontal cortex;schizophrenia;social cognition;superior temporal gyrus;temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome;voxel;attribution;frontal lobe	Makiko Yamada;Kazuyuki Hirao;Chihiro Namiki;Takashi Hanakawa;Hidenao Fukuyama;Takuji Hayashi;Toshiya Murai	2007	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.10.046	psychology;cognitive psychology;social cognition;neuroscience;developmental psychology;radiology;magnetic resonance imaging;schizophrenia;emotional lateralization	HCI	19.09325497806894	-79.36353020650321	143724

Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is an emerging functional neuroimaging technique with the advantages, relative to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), of portability and the ability to simultaneously measure both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. Previous optical studies have evaluated the temporal features of spontaneous resting brain signals. Herein, we develop techniques for spatially mapping functional connectivity with DOT (fc-DOT). Simultaneous imaging over the motor and visual cortices yielded robust correlation maps reproducing the expected functional neural architecture. The localization of the maps was confirmed with task-response studies and with subject-matched fc-MRI. These fc-DOT methods provide a task-less approach to mapping brain function in populations that were previously difficult to research. Our advances may permit new studies of early childhood development and of unconscious patients. In addition, the comprehensive hemoglobin contrasts of fc-DOT enable innovative studies of the biophysical origin of the functional connectivity signal.	child development;deoxyhemoglobin;diffuse optical tomography;interphase cell;magnetic resonance imaging;map;neuroimaging;neuroscience discipline;patients;population;rest;resting state fmri;spontaneous order;tomography, optical;unconscious personality factor;physiological aspects	Brian R.

This fact leads, in experiments as well as in theoretical studies, to construction of so-called transfer functions, where the output firing frequency is plotted against the input intensity. The term firing frequency can be understood differently in different contexts. Basically, it means that the number of spikes over an interval of preselected length is counted and then divided by the length of the interval, but due to the obvious limitations, the length of observation cannot be arbitrarily long. Then firing frequency is defined as reciprocal to the mean interspike interval. In parallel, an instantaneous firing frequency can be defined as reciprocal to the length of current interspike interval, and by taking a mean of these, the definition can be extended to introduce the mean instantaneous firing frequency. All of these definitions of firing frequency are compared in an effort to contribute to a better understanding of the input-output properties of a neuron.	action potential;booth's multiplication algorithm;confidence intervals;experiment;large;neuron;software bug;transfer function	Petr Lánský;Roger Rodriguez;Laura Sacerdote	2004	Neural Computation	10.1162/089976604772744875	ornstein–uhlenbeck process;input/output;econometrics;poisson process;computer science;stochastic modelling;frequency;calculus;difference in differences;mathematics;transfer function;coding;artificial neural network;statistics;models of neural computation	AI	21.17021834143932	-71.72854163190466	144003
8057fdbe7f7e5c23975f2960923980ed10eed713	mediofrontal negativity signals unexpected timing of salient outcomes		The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ACC have been consistently implicated in learning predictions of future outcomes and signaling prediction errors (i.e., unexpected deviations from such predictions). A computational model of ACC/mPFC posits that these prediction errors should be modulated by outcomes occurring at unexpected times, even if the outcomes themselves are predicted. However, unexpectedness per se is not the only variable that modulates ACC/mPFC activity, as studies reported its sensitivity to the salience of outcomes. In this study, mediofrontal negativity, a component of the event-related brain potential generated in ACC/mPFC and coding for prediction errors, was measured in 48 participants performing a Pavlovian aversive conditioning task, during which aversive (thus salient) and neutral outcomes were unexpectedly shifted (i.e., anticipated or delayed) in time. Mediofrontal ERP signals of prediction error were observed for outcomes occurring at unexpected times but were specific for salient (shock-associated), as compared with neutral, outcomes. These findings have important implications for the theoretical accounts of ACC/mPFC and suggest a critical role of timing and salience information in prediction error signaling.	cerebral cortex;computation;computational model;conditioning (psychology);erp;medial graph;modulation;negativity (quantum mechanics);prefrontal cortex;protein structure prediction;shock;status epilepticus	Sara Garofalo;Christopher Timmermann;Simone Battaglia;Martin E.

We hypothesized that segregation of location vs. identity information in touch would be evident if texture is the relevant property for stimulus identity, given the salience of texture for touch. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether the pathways for haptic and visual processing of location and texture are segregated, and the extent of bisensory convergence. Haptic texture-selectivity was found in the parietal operculum and posterior visual cortex bilaterally, and in parts of left inferior frontal cortex. There was bisensory texture-selectivity at some of these sites in posterior visual and left inferior frontal cortex. Connectivity analyses demonstrated, in each modality, flow of information from unisensory non-selective areas to modality-specific texture-selective areas and further to bisensory texture-selective areas. Location-selectivity was mostly bisensory, occurring in dorsal areas, including the frontal eye fields and multiple regions around the intraparietal sulcus bilaterally. Many of these regions received input from unisensory areas in both modalities. Together with earlier studies, the activation and connectivity analyses of the present study establish that somatosensory processing flows into segregated pathways for location and object identity information. The location-selective somatosensory pathway converges with its visual counterpart in dorsal frontoparietal cortex, while the texture-selective somatosensory pathway runs through the parietal operculum before converging with its visual counterpart in visual and frontal cortex. Both segregation of sensory processing according to object property and multisensory convergence appear to be universal organizing principles.	cerebral cortex;convergence (action);dual;flow;gene regulatory network;groove;haptic device component;haptic technology;magnetic resonance imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);organizing (structure);selectivity (electronic);sensory process;structure of intraparietal sulcus;vision;visual cortex;fmri;frontal lobe	Krish Sathian;Simon Lacey;Randall Stilla;Gregory O.

Developmental stuttering usually manifests between 6 and 9 years of age and may persist in adulthood. At present, the exact etiology of developmental stuttering is not fully clear. Besides, the dopaminergic neurological component is likely to have a causal role in the manifestation of stuttering behaviors. Actually, some studies seem to confirm the efficacy of antidopaminergic drugs (haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine, among others) in controlling stuttering behaviors. We present a case of persistent developmental stuttering in a 24-year-old adult male who was able to control his symptoms to a significant extent after administration of risperidone, an antidopaminergic drug. Our findings show that the pharmacological intervention helped the patient improve on a set of fluency tasks but especially when the tasks involved the uttering of content words. Our results are discussed against the current theories on the cognitive and neurological basis of developmental stuttering.	causality;denial-of-service attack;developmental robotics;theory	Pierpaolo Busan;Giovanna Pelamatti;Alessandro Tavano;Michele Grassi;Franco Fabbro	2005			psychology;cognitive psychology;psychiatry;developmental psychology	HCI	17.68532599960263	-79.02348319789562	144398

Mouse models provide opportunities to study characteristics of AD in well-controlled environments that can help facilitate development of early interventions. The CVN-AD mouse model replicates multiple AD hallmark pathologies, and we identified multivariate biomarkers characterizing a brain circuit disruption predictive of cognitive decline. In vivo and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that CVN-AD mice replicate the hippocampal atrophy (6%), characteristic of humans with AD, and also present changes in subcortical areas. The largest effect was in the fornix (23% smaller), which connects the septum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. In characterizing the fornix with diffusion tensor imaging, fractional anisotropy was most sensitive (20% reduction), followed by radial (15%) and axial diffusivity (2%), in detecting pathological changes. These findings were strengthened by optical microscopy and ultrastructural analyses. Ultrastructual analysis provided estimates of axonal density, diameters, and myelination-through the g-ratio, defined as the ratio between the axonal diameter, and the diameter of the axon plus the myelin sheath. The fornix had reduced axonal density (47% fewer), axonal degeneration (13% larger axons), and abnormal myelination (1.5% smaller g-ratios). CD68 staining showed that white matter pathology could be secondary to neuronal degeneration, or due to direct microglial attack. In conclusion, these findings strengthen the hypothesis that the fornix plays a role in AD, and can be used as a disease biomarker and as a target for therapy.	abbreviations;alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;anterior cerebellar commissure;arginine vasopressin-neurophysin ii preproprotein;atrophic;axon;biological markers;body of uterus;brain fornix;card security code;caudal;cell nucleus;cerebellar diseases;cerebellar nuclei;cerebellum;cerebral peduncle;cerebral ventricles;cerebral cortex;certified vascular nurse;coefficient;cognition disorders;column (database);congenital abnormality;corpora quadrigemina, superior colliculus;corpus callosum;cytoplasm of axon;denial-of-service attack;diameter (qualifier value);diffusion tensor imaging;diffusion weighted imaging;emoticon;enlargement procedure;estimated;expectation propagation;fascicle - nerve fibers;fractional anisotropy;globus pallidus;hepatolenticular degeneration;herpes zoster disease;hippocampal replay;hypertrophy;hypothalamic structure;internal capsule of brain;iodine i 124 pu-ad;juvenile spinal muscular atrophy;large;largest;lateral computing;lateral lemniscus;lateral thinking;lateral ventricle structure;logical volume management;magnetic resonance imaging;midbrain raphe nuclei;midbrain structure;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;myelin sheath;myelinolysis, central pontine;neocortex;neostriatum;peduncle - plant part;pontine structure;pyramid (geometry);radial (radio);radial basis function;red nucleus structure;ruby document format;slc12a2 wt allele;sp5 gene;schisandra chinensis;self-replicating machine;sensor;septum - general anatomical term;small;spatial variability;spinocerebellar tracts;staining method;structure of anterior commissure;structure of middle cerebellar peduncle;structure of putamen;structure of zona incerta;substantia nigra structure;tegmentum mesencephali;tellurium;teniposide;test engineer;thalamic nuclei;thalamic structure;tract (literature);transmission electron microscopy;trigeminal nerve structure;upper arm;vtn gene;ventral nuclear group;ventral tegmental area;video-in video-out;voxel;white matter;dinoflagellate cingulum	Alexandra Badea;Lauren Kane;Robert J.

The neural mechanisms involved in sleep-dependent consolidation, however, are largely unknown. Here, we used a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging, polysomnography and a face-location associative memory task to target neural connectivity of a face sensitive area during an afternoon nap. Fusiform connectivity was substantially greater during sleep stage 1 than in wake in a network extending from early visual areas bilaterally to the fusiform gyrus, ventrally and into the posterior parietal cortices, dorsally. In sleep stage 2, fusiform connectivity was found to be larger in the precuneus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex. Specific functional connectivity increases observed during light sleep were positively correlated with memory performance for face-location associations. A distinction could be made between fusiform-medial prefrontal connectivity during sleep stage 1 and 2 that was positively correlated with retention of associations learned prior to sleep and fusiform-hippocampal connectivity during sleep stage 1 that was correlated with better acquisition of new associations learned after sleep. Our results suggest that fusiform-medial prefrontal connectivity during sleep has a stabilizing effect on recently learned associative memories, possibly due to the existence of a task-related schema that allows rapid consolidation of related information. Our data further indicate that sleep-dependent connectivity between the fusiform gyrus and hippocampus correlated with new learning after sleep. Thus, our study provides correlational evidence for the behavioral relevance of specific medial prefrontal and hippocampal interactions with the fusiform gyrus during light sleep.	associative aphasia;bilateral filter;content-addressable memory;interaction;large;lateral occipitotemporal gyrus;lung consolidation;magnetic resonance imaging;medial graph;memory disorders;mental association;online and offline;parietal lobe;prefrontal cortex;relevance;representation (action);resting state fmri;semiconductor consolidation;sleep stages;sleep mode;stage level 1;stage level 2;structure of middle temporal gyrus;structure of precuneus;proteasome storage granule	Eelco V. van Dongen;Atsuko Takashima;Markus Barth;Guillén Fernández	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.04.019	psychology;cognitive psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance;memory consolidation;hippocampus;sleep;declarative memory	ML	17.706710601463705	-77.65580183510308	144744

Comparing the experimentally measured tuning properties with predictions from the two models we find a better agreement for the norm-referenced encoding model.

Does the action of Midazolam on the hippocampus cause less storage, or less accurate storage, of information in episodic long-term memory? We used a simple variant of the REM model [18] to fit data collected by Hirshman, Fisher, Henthorn, Arndt, and Passannante [9] on the effects of Midazolam, study time, and normative word-frequency on both yes-no and remember-know recognition memory. That a simple strength model fit well was contrary to the expectations of Hirshman et al. More important, within the Bayesian based REM modeling framework, the data were consistent with the view that Midazolam causes less accurate storage, rather than less storage, of information in episodic memory.	amnesia: the dark descent	Kenneth J.

Grouping image sequences into blocks has been shown by others to improve agreement between experiments and theory. We have studied the effect of temporal convolution on the formation of spatiotemporal filters—that is, the analogues of receptive fields—since this temporal feature is characteristic to the response function of lagged and nonlagged cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Concatenated input sequences were used to learn the linear transformation that maximizes the information transfer. Learning was accomplished by means of principal component analysis and independent component analysis. Properties of the emerging spatiotemporal filters closely resemble the three major types of V1 cells: simple cells with separable receptive field, simple cells with nonseparable receptive field, and complex cells.	area striata structure;cell nucleus;cellular phone;cerebral cortex;concatenation;convolution;entropy maximization;experiment;frequency response;geniculate body structure;independent component analysis;lateral computing;lateral thinking;principal component analysis;lateral geniculate complex;lateral geniculate nucleus;recurrent childhood visual pathway glioma	Botond Szatmáry;András Lörincz	2001	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1023/A:1013723131070	psychology;independent component analysis;computer vision;neuroscience;information transfer;computer science;machine learning;mathematics;linear map;communication;receptive field;principal component analysis	ML	20.66940558652386	-68.6539751353967	144814

Data from eye-tracked participants was subjected to a fixation by fixation analysis to pinpoint why participants tended to make fewer fixations than would be expected by chance. The goal of this paper is to present a computational model that performs visual search as efficiently as humans. The model varied several components that may have aided visual search: memory, search strategy, and degree of parafoveal vision. Two dependent measures were used to evaluate the model: number of fixations to find the target and the distribution of saccade amplitudes. The best fitting model suggested that the biggest contribution to efficient search came from larger parafoveal vision. Search strategy, however, accounted for the distribution of saccade amplitudes.	computation;computational model;humans;probability amplitude;randomness	Bella Veksler;Wayne D.

Neuroimaging methods such as diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography, which probe the connectivity of neural networks, show significant promise. We present a machine learning approach to classify TBI participants primarily with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on altered structural connectivity patterns derived through the network based statistical analysis of structural connectomes generated from TBI and age-matched control groups. In this approach, higher order diffusion models were used to map white matter connections between 116 cortical and subcortical regions. Tracts between these regions were generated using probabilistic tracking and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) measures along these connections were encoded in the connectivity matrices. Network-based statistical analysis of the connectivity matrices was performed to identify the network differences between a representative subset of the two groups. The affected network connections provided the feature vectors for principal component analysis and subsequent classification by random forest. The validity of the approach was tested using data acquired from a total of 179 TBI patients and 146 controls participants. The analysis revealed altered connectivity within a number of intra- and inter-hemispheric white matter pathways associated with DAI, in consensus with existing literature. A mean classification accuracy of 68.16%±1.81% and mean sensitivity of 80.0%±2.36% were achieved in correctly classifying the TBI patients evaluated on the subset of the participants that was not used for the statistical analysis, in a 10-fold cross-validation framework. These results highlight the potential for statistical machine learning approaches applied to structural connectomes to identify patients with diffusive axonal injury.	artificial neural network;basal ganglia diseases;brain injuries;classification;connectome;cross reactions;cross-validation (statistics);diffuse axonal injury;feature vector;fractional anisotropy;machine learning;mild traumatic brain injury;neural network simulation;neuroimaging;patients;principal component analysis;random forest;subgroup;white matter	Jhimli Mitra;Kai-Kai Shen;Soumya Ghose;Pierrick Bourgeat;Jurgen Fripp;Olivier Salvado;Kerstin Pannek;D.

6dc139e58b5b114419695758d09bfe2f30c80423	modeling the effect of evaluative conditioning on implicit attitude acquisition and performance on the implicit association test	social and behavioral sciences	Using a previously proposed computational model of human performance on the Implicit Associations Test (IAT), we explore how evaluative conditioning could inform attitude acquisition and formation of automatic associations in memory, and demonstrate the effects of such learning on implicit task performance on the test. This is achieved by augmenting the model with a learning mechanism based on a modified Hebbian learning rule that adapts associative strengths between concepts depending on the temporal proximity of their activation. By manipulating the frequencies at which different stimuli are paired and presented as input to the network, we demonstrate how virtual subjects could acquire associative strengths that were subsequently reflected in simulated IATs as stronger relative preferences in favor of targets that were more frequently presented with positively-valenced stimuli. The model predicts that associations that are already strong have limited prospects for continued reinforcement.	algorithm;computation;computational model;connectionism;continuation;emergence;hebbian theory;human reliability;learning rule;machine learning;plausibility structure;simulation;turing test	Boon-Kiat Quek;Andrew Ortony	2012			psychology;cognitive psychology;implicit attitude;developmental psychology;social psychology	ML	14.258539550064448	-74.48419686485202	145590

However, neurophysiological studies in vivo often rather measure the mass activity of neuronal microcircuits with the local field potential (LFP). Given that LFPs are generated by spatially separated currents across the neuronal membrane, they cannot be computed directly from quantities defined in models of point-like LIF neurons. Here, we explore the best approximation for predicting the LFP based on standard output from point-neuron LIF networks. To search for this best """"LFP proxy"""", we compared LFP predictions from candidate proxies based on LIF network output (e.g, firing rates, membrane potentials, synaptic currents) with """"ground-truth"""" LFP obtained when the LIF network synaptic input currents were injected into an analogous three-dimensional (3D) network model of multi-compartmental neurons with realistic morphology, spatial distributions of somata and synapses. We found that a specific fixed linear combination of the LIF synaptic currents provided an accurate LFP proxy, accounting for most of the variance of the LFP time course observed in the 3D network for all recording locations. This proxy performed well over a broad set of conditions, including substantial variations of the neuronal morphologies. Our results provide a simple formula for estimating the time course of the LFP from LIF network simulations in cases where a single pyramidal population dominates the LFP generation, and thereby facilitate quantitative comparison between computational models and experimental LFP recordings in vivo."""	advance directive - proxy;approximation;artificial neural network;basal ganglia diseases;bayesian information criterion;biological neuron model;coefficient;computation;computational model;encapsulated postscript;equivalent weight;estimated;ground truth;international conference on functional programming;least fixed point;low insertion force;mathematical morphology;membrane potentials;modulation;network model;neural network simulation;neurons;numerous;quantity;sample variance;standard streams;subscript;synapses;synaptic package manager;tissue membrane;video-in video-out;xfig;gamma-aminobutyric acid;imidazole mustard	Alberto Mazzoni;Henrik Lindén;Hermann Cuntz;Anders Lansner;Stefano Panzeri;Gaute T.

The model replicates some fundamental phenomena associated with instrumental learning in animals, and allows an RWI B21 robot to learn several distinct tasks derived from the same innate behavior.	approximation;computation;computational model;mobile robot;noise shaping	Lisa M.

However, the biophysical mechanisms that modulate these correlations are poorly understood. With a combined theoretical and experimental approach, we show that the rate of balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input modulates the magnitude and timescale of pairwise spike train correlation. High rate synaptic inputs promote spike time synchrony rather than long timescale spike rate correlations, while low rate synaptic inputs produce opposite results. This correlation shaping is due to a combination of enhanced high frequency input transfer and reduced firing rate gain in the high input rate state compared to the low state. Our study extends neural modulation from single neuron responses to population activity, a necessary step in understanding how the dynamics and processing of neural activity change across distinct brain states.	action potential;modulation;neural oscillation;neuron;neurons;noise shaping;spike glycoprotein, coronavirus;synapse;synaptic package manager;the spike (1997)	Ashok Litwin-Kumar;Anne-Marie M.

e78b28100b1c120f94d72585d3326aff7824be1d	cortical representations sensitive to the number of perceived auditory objects emerge between 2 and 4 months of age: electrophysiological evidence		Sound waves emitted by two or more simultaneous sources reach the ear as one complex waveform. Auditory scene analysis involves parsing a complex waveform into separate perceptual representations of the sound sources [Bregman, A. S. Auditory scene analysis: The perceptual organization of sounds. London: MIT Press, 1990]. Harmonicity provides an important cue for auditory scene analysis. Normally, harmonics at integer multiples of a fundamental frequency are perceived as one sound with a pitch corresponding to the fundamental frequency. However, when one harmonic in such a complex, pitch-evoking sound is sufficiently mistuned, that harmonic emerges from the complex tone and is perceived as a separate auditory object. Previous work has shown that the percept of two objects is indexed in both children and adults by the object-related negativity component of the ERP derived from EEG recordings [Alain, C., Arnott, S. T., & Picton, T. W. Bottom–up and top–down influences on auditory scene analysis: Evidence from event-related brain potentials. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 27, 1072–1089, 2001]. Here we examine the emergence of object-related responses to an 8% harmonic mistuning in infants between 2 and 12 months of age. Two-month-old infants showed no significant object-related response. However, in 4- to 12-month-old infants, a significant frontally positive component was present, and by 8–12 months, a significant frontocentral object-related negativity was present, similar to that seen in older children and adults. This is in accordance with previous research demonstrating that infants younger than 4 months of age do not integrate harmonic information to perceive pitch when the fundamental is missing [He, C., Hotson, L., & Trainor, L. J. Maturation of cortical mismatch mismatch responses to occasional pitch change in early infancy: Effects of presentation rate and magnitude of change. Neuropsychologia, 47, 218–229, 2009]. The results indicate that the ability to use harmonic information to segregate simultaneous sounds emerges at the cortical level between 2 and 4 months of age.	bregman divergence;cerebral cortex;codependency (psychology);erp;electroencephalography;emergence;emergentism;index;integer (number);negativity (quantum mechanics);parsing;physical object;pitch (music);sound - physical agent;speech sound disorders;waveform	Nicole A.

It is thus fundamental to understand the neural mechanisms involved in performing it. To this end, we have developed a Bayesian detection system and small integrate-and-fire neural networks, which modeled sensory and motor circuits, respectively, and optimized them to perform the Posner task under different cue type proportions and noise levels. In doing so, main findings of experimental research on RT were replicated: the relative frequency effect, suboptimal RTs and significant error rates due to noise and invalid cues, slower RT for choice RT tasks than for simple RT tasks, fastest RTs for valid cues and slowest RTs for invalid cues. Analysis of the optimized systems revealed that the employed mechanisms were consistent with related findings in neurophysiology. Our models predict that (1) the results of a Posner task may be affected by the relative frequency of valid and neutral trials, (2) in simple RT tasks, input from multiple locations are added together to compose a stronger signal, and (3) the cue affects motor circuits more strongly in choice RT tasks than in simple RT tasks. In discussing the computational demands of the Posner task, attention has often been described as a filter that protects the nervous system, whose capacity is limited, from information overload. Our models, however, reveal that the main problems that must be overcome to perform the Posner task effectively are distinguishing signal from external noise and selecting the appropriate response in the presence of internal noise."""	artificial neural network;biological neuron model;cns disorder;computation;computational model;experiment;fastest;information overload;neural network simulation	Carolina Feher da Silva;Marcus Vinícius Chrysóstomo Baldo	2015		10.3389/fncom.2015.00081	psychology;mental chronometry;simulation;attention;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication;bayesian inference;artificial neural network;statistics	ML	15.99142399010535	-75.18037381494356	146474

They are used in fuzzy cognitive maps which is an artificial neural network structure that creates models as collections of concepts – neurons and the various causal relationships – weighted arcs that exist between them. An experimental study of the certainty neuron fuzzy cognitive maps (CNFCMs) dynamical behaviour is presented as this appears through simulations. Two control parameters are used: the symmetry of the system's weight matrix and the strength of the decay mechanism. The values of these two parameters can lead the system to exhibit stable fixed point behaviour, limit cycle behaviour or to collapse. The ways that the two control parameters cause the change of the system's dynamical behaviour from fixed point to limit cycle are also presented. The areas where the systems exhibit specific dynamical behaviour are identified.	blind signal separation;neural networks	Athanasios K. Tsadiras;Konstantinos G.

One such study has been recently used as the basis of a probabilistic amygdala map, to enable in vivo identification of specifically located functions within the amygdala and connections to it. The involvement of the amygdala in cognition, emotion and action, which may underlie several psychiatric disorders, points to a need for discrimination of these nuclei in living human brains using different techniques. Structural MRI scans of the human amygdala at standard field strengths (≤3 T) have shown a region of generally featureless gray matter. Apparently homogeneous regions may reveal internal structure, however, when improved imaging strategies and better SNR are available. The goal of this study is the in vivo anatomical segmentation of the amygdala using high resolution structural MR data. The use of different MRI tissue contrast mechanisms at high field strengths has been little explored so far. Combining two different contrasts, and using cutting-edge image analysis, the following study provides a robust clustering of three amygdala components in vivo using 7 T structural imaging.	amygdaloid structure;brain;cluster analysis;cognition;gray matter;image analysis;image resolution;mental disorders;signal-to-noise ratio;spinal cord lateral horn;uniform memory access;video-in video-out;biologic segmentation;statistical cluster	Eugenia Solano-Castiella;Andreas Schaefer;Enrico Reimer;Erik Türke;Thomas Pröger;Gabriele Lohmann;Robert Trampel;Robert Turner	2011	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.047	psychology;neuroscience;image analysis;developmental psychology;image resolution;communication;segmentation	Vision	21.20313727373312	-79.20552735987748	147057
670db35f75455cef75db06e75003a14b40cfcaf8	bold changes occur prior to epileptic spikes seen on scalp eeg		This study examined BOLD changes prior to interictal discharges in the EEG of patients with epilepsy. From a database of 143 EEG-fMRI studies, we selected the 16 data sets that showed both strong fMRI activation in the original analysis and only a single spike type in the EEG. Scans were then analyzed using seven model HRFs, peaking 3 or 1 s before the event, or 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 s after it. An HRF was calculated using a deconvolution method for all activations seen in each analysis. The results showed that seven data sets had HRFs that peaked 1 s after the event or earlier, indicating a BOLD change starting prior to the spike seen on the scalp EEG. This is surprising since the BOLD change is expected to result from the spike. For most of the data sets with early peaking HRFs, the maximum activation in all of the statistical maps was when the model HRF peaked 1 s after the event, suggesting that the early activation was at least as important as any later activation. We suggest that this early activity is the result of neuronal changes occurring several seconds prior to a surface EEG event, but that these changes are not visible on the scalp. This is the first report of a BOLD response occurring several seconds prior to an interictal event seen on the scalp and could have important implications for our understanding of the generation of epileptic discharges.	body fluid discharge;deconvolution;electroencephalography;epilepsy;microtubule-associated proteins;patients;the spike (1997);fmri	Colin Hawco;Andrew P.

Collinear edge detectors in V1, for instance, mutually enhance each other to improve the perception of lines against a noisy background. The same pre-wiring that facilitates line extraction, however, is detrimental when subjects have to discriminate the brightness of different line segments. How is it possible to improve in one task by unsupervised practicing, without getting worse in the other task? The classical view of perceptual learning is that practicing modulates the feedforward input stream through synaptic modifications onto or within V1. However, any rewiring of V1 would deteriorate other perceptual abilities different from the trained one. We propose a general neuronal model showing that perceptual learning can modulate top-down input to V1 in a task-specific way while feedforward and lateral pathways remain intact. Consistent with biological data, the model explains how context-dependent brightness discrimination is improved by a top-down recruitment of recurrent inhibition and a top-down induced increase of the neuronal gain within V1. Both the top-down modulation of inhibition and of neuronal gain are suggested to be universal features of cortical microcircuits which enable perceptual learning.	area striata structure;cerebral cortex;context-sensitive language;detectors;edge detection;feedforward neural network;lateral thinking;modulation;neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses;recurrent neural network;stream (computing);synaptic package manager;top-down and bottom-up design;unsupervised learning;wiring;brightness	Roland Schäfer;Eleni Vasilaki;Walter Senn	2007	PLoS Computational Biology	10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030165	computer vision;electrophysiology;neuroscience;visual system;visual perception;machine learning;top-down and bottom-up design;perceptual learning;feedback	ML	17.678737874501532	-74.74145197809419	147242
427e49bbc72bd862c8727f3c483eead6621d038b	identification of asymptomatic plants infected with citrus tristeza virus from a time series of leaf spectral characteristics		Abstract Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) affects citrus crops with differing severity, depending on the viral strain, the citrus cultivar and the scion/rootstock combinations. In this study we address the problem of identifying asymptomatic infected plants using reflectance spectra of the leaves in the visible/near infrared region. Sixteen young citrus plants (8 Citrus  ×  clementina hort. ex Tanaka ‘Fina’ and 8 Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck ‘Valencia Late’) were split into control and T318 A isolate infected groups. Measurements of reflectance in the 400–1100 nm range, in two leaves per plant, were performed monthly over 6 months and the presence of the virus was confirmed by IC/RT-PCR and real-time PCR. The spectra acquired in a single day of measurements was inconsistent for inoculated and control plants. However, by monitoring the same leaves over 6 months it was possible to identify infected plants on the basis of the spectra time evolution. In order to achieve this a simple unfolding implementation of 3-way PCA was applied such that group separation in the scores plot was spontaneous and not forced by any a priori assumption. The model was tested through leave-one-out cross validation with a good rate of correct classification for the left out sample. A real situation was simulated by applying the NPCA algorithm to healthy plants only and checking if the infected ones would be projected on the model scores plot as outliers. Again, a good rate of classification was obtained. Finally, we discuss the spectral features that may be associated with the clustering obtained through NPCA and their physiological significance. Reflectance measurements between infected and healthy samples of two citrus cultivars and their correlation with real-time PCR results for the presence of CTV suggest reflectance spectra of the leaves in the visible/near infrared region is a promising tool for plant stress monitoring linked to the presence of CTV infection prior to symptom expression.	time series	Andreia M.

Pictures of five different categories (baby, flower, erotic, fear and disgust) were presented each being associated with five different odour conditions [no odour, low and high concentrations of phenylethyl alcohol (positive odour) and low and high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide (negative odour)]. Study participants had to rate the emotional content of each picture with respect to valence and intensity while brain activities were recorded with a whole-cortex magnetoencephalograph (MEG). A significant interaction between odour condition and picture category with respect to rating performance was found. In particular, positive valence intensity ratings related to flowers were increased in positive and negative odour conditions. Negative valence intensity ratings related to disgusting pictures were also increased in positive and negative odour conditions. The only decrease was found in the baby category in the high concentration negative odour condition. No behavioural effects were found for the categories erotic and fear. Around 300 ms after stimulus onset odour-related brain activity effects were found for all picture categories. On the other hand, around 700 ms after stimulus onset odour-related brain activity effects occurred only in the flower, fear and disgust picture categories. We interpret that early information processing demonstrates more pronounced olfactory and visually induced emotion interaction than later information processing. Since the early time window more likely reflects subconscious information processing we interpret that interaction between olfaction and visually induced emotion mostly occurs below the level of consciousness. Later, rather conscious information processing, seems to be differently influenced by simultaneous olfaction depending on the kind of emotion elicited through the sense of vision.	altered level of consciousness;categories;drug interactions;electroencephalography;emotions;eroticism;hydrogen sulfide;image;information processing;magnetoencephalography;neuroimaging;odors;onset (audio);performance rating;phenylethyl alcohol;smell perception;sulfides;flower allergenic extracts	Peter Walla;Lüder Deecke	2010		10.3390/s100908185	emotion;olfaction;neuroimaging	HCI	14.606072515727428	-77.20291811186584	147538
e8f062dec80a76bf2d38bbe6b4fabc491eb1ee8e	an image representation of infrastructure based on non-classical receptive field	early vision;bio inspired model;image representation;neural network	Biological vision systems have become highly optimized over millions of years of evolution, developing complex neural structures to represent and process stimuli. Moreover, biological systems of vision are typically far more efficient than current human-made machine vision systems. The present report describes a non-task-dependent image representation schema that simulates the early phase of a biological neural vision mechanism. We designed a neural model involving multiple types of computational units to simulate ganglion cells and their non-classical receptive fields, local feedback control circuits and receptive field dynamic self-adjustment mechanisms in the retina. We found that, beyond the pixel level, our model was able to represent images self-adaptively and rapidly. A series of statistical analyses revealed that this model not only produces compact and abstract approximations of images, but also retains their primary visual features. In addition, the improved representation was found to substantially facilitate contour detection and image segmentation. We propose that this improvement arose because ganglion cells can resize their receptive fields, enabling multi-scale analysis functionality, a neighborhood referring function and a localized synthesis function. The ganglion cell layer is the starting point of subsequent diverse visual processing. The universality of this cell type and its functional mechanisms suggests that it will be useful for designing image processing algorithms in future.	algorithm;approximation;basis function;biological system;brainfuck;computation;computer vision;concept learning;experiment;feedback;image processing;image segmentation;internationalization and localization;low-pass filter;machine vision;neural coding;pixel;radio frequency;scale-invariant feature transform;simulation;sparse matrix;statistical model;universal turing machine	Hui Wei;Bo Lang;Qingsong Zuo	2014	Soft Comput.	10.1007/s00500-013-1038-2	computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;artificial neural network	ML	22.020327465550228	-66.81521766345585	147625

We performed whole-brain tractography based on the orientation distribution functions. Connectivity matrices were compiled, representing the proportion of detected fibers interconnecting 68 cortical regions. We found clear disease effects on anatomical network topology in the structural backbone – the so-called ‘kcore’ – of the anatomical network, defined by varying the nodal degree threshold, k. However, the thresholding of the structural networks – based on their nodal degree – affected the pattern and interpretation of network differences discovered between patients and controls.	alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;compiler;internet backbone;network topology;thresholding (image processing)	Madelaine Daianu;Emily L.

Performance-monitoring systems that act by detecting conflict in stimulus and response processing have been hypothesized to influence cortical control systems to adjust and improve performance. Here we used fMRI to investigate the neural mechanisms of conflict monitoring and resolution during voluntary spatial attention. We tested the hypothesis that the ACC would be sensitive to conflict during attentional orienting and influence activity in the frontoparietal attentional control network that selectively modulates visual information processing. We found that activity in ACC increased monotonically with increasing attentional conflict. This increased conflict detection activity was correlated with both increased activity in the attentional control network and improved speed and accuracy from one trial to the next. These results establish a long hypothesized interaction between conflict detection systems and neural systems supporting voluntary control of visual attention.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;control system;file synchronization;information processing;modulation;sensor;fmri	Bong J.

The main motivation of this paper is to evaluate a simplified bio-mimetic approach in the framework of a manipulation task. More concretely, the paper focuses on how the model inference process takes place within a feedforward control loop based on the cerebellar structure and on how these internal models are built up by means of biologically plausible synaptic adaptation mechanisms. This kind of investigation may provide clues on how biology achieves accurate control of non-stiff-joint robot with low-power actuators which involve controlling systems with high inertial components. This paper studies how a basic temporal-correlation kernel including long-term depression (LTD) and a constant long-term potentiation (LTP) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses can effectively infer corrective models. We evaluate how this spike-timing-dependent plasticity correlates sensorimotor activity arriving through the parallel fibers with teaching signals (dependent on error estimates) arriving through the climbing fibers from the inferior olive. This paper addresses the study of how these LTD and LTP components need to be well balanced with each other to achieve accurate learning. This is of interest to evaluate the relevant role of homeostatic mechanisms in biological systems where adaptation occurs in a distributed manner. Furthermore, we illustrate how the temporal-correlation kernel can also work in the presence of transmission delays in sensorimotor pathways. We use a cerebellumlike spiking neural network which stores the corrective models as well-structured weight patterns distributed among the parallel fibers to Purkinje cell connections.	acclimatization;addresses (publication format);artificial neural network;biological neural networks;biological system;british informatics olympiad;cellular phone;control system;depressive disorder;estimated;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;homeostasis;inference engine;kernel (operating system);long-term potentiation;long-term synaptic depression;low-power broadcasting;physical object;robot;spiking neural network;synapses;synaptic package manager;tissue fiber;chemosensitization/potentiation;parallel fiber	Niceto R.

3bcf5b79a330f7f21562de075953fd5fd2e988f5	uncertainty and expectancy deviations require cortico-subcortical cooperation	basal ganglia;probabilistic inferential learning;flexible cognitive control;red nucleus;thalamus;7t fmri	In a dynamic and uncertain environment it is beneficial to learn the causal structure of the environment in order to minimize uncertainty. This requires determining estimates of probable outcomes, which will guide expectations about incoming information. One key factor in this learning process is to detect whether an unexpected event constitutes a low probability, but valid outcome, or an outright error. The present 7T-fMRI study investigated the role of subcortical structures in regulating this probabilistic inferential learning process. A new task was designed, in which participants learned to calculate the value, and therefore to anticipate the outcome of different visual sequences. Three types of sequences provided unambiguous, ambiguous, and incongruent contextual evidence and each sequence had two outcomes, which differed in their probability of occurrence. We hypothesized that subcortical regions are necessary when expectations are violated, and that their involvement will depend on the nature of the unexpected event. The results show increased dorsomedial striatal and thalamic activation for less probable sequences; in addition, ambiguous sequences also display larger activation in the red nuclei. Incongruent sequences displayed a pattern of subcortical activation restricted to the dorsolateral and the posterior dorsomedial striatum. These results confirm that different subcortical structures regulate uncertainty and expectancy deviations; this is crucial not only for learning to predict events in the environment, but also for flexible cognitive control in general.

This study aimed to identify handedness-dependent organizational patterns of (lateralized and non-lateralized) functional subunits within the human vestibular cortex areas. 60 healthy volunteers (30 left-handed and 30 right-handed) were examined on a 3T MR scanner using resting state functional MRI (fMRI). The data was analyzed in four major steps using a functional connectivity based parcellation (fCBP) approach: (1) independent component analysis (ICA) on a whole brain level to identify different resting state networks (RSN); (2) creation of a vestibular informed mask from four whole brain ICs that included reference coordinates of the vestibular network extracted from meta-analyses of vestibular neuroimaging experiments; (3) Re-ICA confined to the vestibular informed mask; (4) cross-correlation of the activated voxels within the vestibular subunits (parcels) to each other (P-to-P) and to the whole-brain RSN (P-to-RSN). This approach disclosed handedness-dependency, inter-hemispheric symmetry, the scale of connectedness to major whole brain RSN and the grade of spatial overlap of voxels within parcels (common/unique) as meaningful discriminatory organizational categories within the vestibular cortex areas. This network consists of multiple inter-hemisphere symmetric (not lateralized), well-connected (many RSN-assignments) multisensory areas (or hubs; e.g., superior temporal gyrus, temporo-parietal intersection) organized around an asymmetric (lateralized, """"dominant"""") and functionally more specialized (few RSN-assignments) core region in the parieto-insular cortex. The latter is in the middle, posterior and inferior insula. In conclusion, the bilateral cortical vestibular network contains not only a handedness-dependent lateralized central region concentrated in the right hemisphere in right-handers and left hemisphere in left-handers, but also surrounding inter-hemisphere symmetric multisensory vestibular areas that seem to be functionally influenced by their neighboring sensory systems (e.g., temporo-parietal intersection by the visual system). One may speculate that the development of an asymmetrical organized vestibular subsystem reflects a more recent phylogenetic evolution of various multisensory vestibular functions. The right hemispheric dominance of spatial orientation and its disorders, spatial neglect and pusher syndrome, may serve as examples."""	area striata structure;bilateral filter;clip1 gene;categories;cross-correlation;experiment;extraction;handedness;ieee 802.11i-2004;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;insula of reil;interphase cell;intersection of set of elements;meta analysis (statistical procedure);neuroimaging;phylogenetics;post-traumatic vegetative state;pusher device component;resting state fmri;scanner device component;space perception;superior temporal gyrus;voxel;emotional dependency;pusher syndrome	Valerie Kirsch;Rainer Boegle;Daniel Keeser;E.

However the validity of fNIRS-based RSFC has rarely been studied. In the present study, fNIRS and fMRI data were simultaneously acquired from 21 subjects during the resting state. After the spatial correspondence was established between the two imaging modalities by transforming the fMRI data into fNIRS measurements space, the index of Between-Modality-Similarity (BMS) of RSFC was evaluated across multiple spatial scales. First, the RSFC between the bilateral primary motor ROI was quite similar between fNIRS and fMRI for all the subjects (BMS(ROI) = 0.95 ± 0.04 for HbO and BMS(ROI) = 0.86 ± 0.13 for HbR). Second, group-level sensorimotor RSFC maps (0.79 for HbO and 0.74 for HbR) showed higher between-modality similarity than individual-level RSFC maps (0.48 ± 0.16 for HbO and 0.41 ± 0.15 for HbR). Finally, for the first time, we combined fNIRS and graph theory to investigate topological properties of resting-state brain networks. The clustering coefficient (C(p)) and characteristic path length (L(p)) which are the most important network topological parameters, both showed high between-modality similarities (BMS(Cp) = 0.90 ± 0.03 for HbO and 0.90 ± 0.06 for HbR; BMS(Lp) = 0.92 ± 0.04 for HbO and 0.91 ± 0.05 for HbR). In summary, the converged results across all the spatial scales demonstrated that fNIRS is capable of providing comparable RSFC measures to fMRI, and thus provide direct evidence for the validity of the optical brain connectivity and the optical brain network approaches to functional brain integration during resting state.	battery management system;bilateral filter;clustering coefficient;graph theory;map;modality (human–computer interaction);region of interest;rest;resting state fmri;spatial scale;spectroscopy, near-infrared;statistical cluster	Lian Duan;Yu-Jin Zhang;Chaozhe Zhu	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.02.014	psychology;neuroscience;speech recognition;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;artificial intelligence;graph theory;communication;validity	ML	20.779709477574713	-77.4265353066818	148528

Here we investigated whether modulations of the occipital alpha rhythm triggered by the involuntary orienting of attention to a salient but spatially non-predictive sound would similarly influence perception of a subsequent visual target. Target discrimination was more accurate when a sound preceded the target at the same location (validly cued trials) than when the sound was on the side opposite to the target (invalidly cued trials). This behavioral effect was accompanied by a sound-induced desynchronization of the alpha rhythm over the lateral occipital scalp. The magnitude of alpha desynchronization over the hemisphere contralateral to the sound predicted correct discriminations of validly cued targets but not of invalidly cued targets. These results support the conclusion that cue-induced alpha desynchronization over the occipital cortex is a manifestation of a general priming mechanism that improves visual processing and that this mechanism can be activated either by the voluntary or involuntary orienting of attention. Further, the observed pattern of alpha modulations preceding correct and incorrect discriminations of valid and invalid targets suggests that involuntary orienting to the non-predictive sound has a rapid and purely facilitatory influence on processing targets on the cued side, with no inhibitory influence on targets on the opposite side.	alpha rhythm;cerebral cortex;lateral thinking;occipital part of scalp;priming exercise;vision;alpha-mannosidosis	Wenfeng Feng;Viola S.

53f1b72b06ad838b04f807c7afd5d7fa63e7aefa	depressive symptomatology should be systematically controlled for in neuroticism research		In a recent fMRI study, Everaerd et al. (2015) examined the relationship between (experimentally induced) stress, (personality trait) neuroticism, and amygdala responsivity to emotional information. The authors found that neuroticism selectively enhanced amygdalian response to potential threat in the stress induction condition. While the sophistication and ambition of Everaerd et al.’s (2015) study should be underlined, we are concernedwith the fact that the authors did not statistically control for depressive symptomswhen analyzing the effects of neuroticism. The authors assesseddepressive symptomsusing theBeckDepression Inventory and found a strong correlation between depressive symptoms and neuroticism (ρ=0.729, p b 0.001). Such an association suggests that depressive symptoms constitute a key potential confounding variable in the relationship between neuroticism and the other variables under study. However, the authors did not introduce depressive symptoms as a covariate in their analyses of neuroticism—while they did so with blood pressure, a variable whose correlation with neuroticism was much weaker (ρ = 0.248, p b 0.01). This state of affairs is problematic in that it prevents clear conclusions on the role of neuroticism from being drawn. Put differently, the effects imputed to neuroticism in this	amygdaloid structure;antisocial personality disorder;depressive disorder;experiment;neuroticism;statistical imputation;stress ball	Renzo Bianchi;Eric Laurent	2016	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.07.088	psychology;psychiatry;psychotherapist;clinical psychology	AI	12.664942862465367	-77.83867704336275	148682

Although the specific role of these oscillations has yet to be determined, it is clear that neuronal oscillations are abundant in the central nervous system. This raises the question of the origin of these oscillations: are the mechanisms for generating these oscillations genetically hard-wired or can they be acquired via a learning process? Here, we study the conditions under which oscillatory activity emerges through a process of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in a feed-forward architecture. First, we analyze the effect of oscillations on STDP-driven synaptic dynamics of a single synapse, and study how the parameters that characterize the STDP rule and the oscillations affect the resultant synaptic weight. Next, we analyze STDP-driven synaptic dynamics of a pre-synaptic population of neurons onto a single post-synaptic cell. The pre-synaptic neural population is assumed to be oscillating at the same frequency, albeit with different phases, such that the net activity of the pre-synaptic population is constant in time. Thus, in the homogeneous case in which all synapses are equal, the post-synaptic neuron receives constant input and hence does not oscillate. To investigate the transition to oscillatory activity, we develop a mean-field Fokker-Planck approximation of the synaptic dynamics. We analyze the conditions causing the homogeneous solution to lose its stability. The findings show that oscillatory activity appears through a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in the general case the homogeneous solution is unstable, and the synaptic dynamics does not converge to a different fixed point, but rather to a limit cycle. We show how the temporal structure of the STDP rule determines the stability of the homogeneous solution and the drift velocity of the limit cycle.	approximation;assumed;cns disorder;cognition;control theory;converge;dependent ml;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point number;limit cycle;neural ensemble;neural oscillation;neuron;neurons;numerical stability;post–turing machine;resultant;rule 90;spontaneous order;synapse;symmetry breaking;synapses;synaptic weight;unstable medical device problem;velocity (software development)	Yotam Luz;Maoz Shamir	2016		10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004878	synaptic plasticity;neuroplasticity;neuroscience;membrane potential;synapse;artificial intelligence;population dynamics;action potential	ML	17.994184581892906	-70.9346511688016	149104

Random walks or diffusions are commonly used to model these processes; in such models, a spike corresponds to the first passage of the diffusion to a boundary, or firing threshold. An important first step in such a study is to fit families of densities to the trains' interspike interval histograms; the estimated parameters, and the families' goodness of fit can then provide information about the process leading to the spikes. In this paper, we propose the generalized inverse Gaussian family because its members arise as first passage time distributions of certain diffusions to a constant boundary. We provide some theoretical support for the use of these diffusions in neural firing models. We compare this family with the lognormal family, using spike trains from retinal ganglion cells of goldfish, and simulations from an integrate-and-fire and a dynamical model for generating spikes. We show that the generalized inverse Gaussian family is closer to the true model in all these cases.	action potential;benign rolandic epilepsy;biological neuron model;diffusion;dynamical system;first-hitting-time model;ganglia;goldfish;interval arithmetic;normal statistical distribution;retina;retinal ganglion cells;simulation;density	Satish Iyengar;Qiming Liao	1997	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s004220050390	normal distribution;econometrics;combinatorics;generalized inverse;first-hitting-time model;mathematics;goodness of fit;random walk;statistics	ML	20.816501536285383	-72.58888295002298	149655

Before computational network metrics from the human connectome can be applied in a clinical setting, their precision and their normative intersubject variation must be understood to guide the study design and the interpretation of longitudinal data. In this work, the reproducibility of commonly used graph theoretic measures is investigated, as applied to the structural connectome of healthy adult volunteers. Two datasets are examined, one consisting of 10 subjects scanned twice at one MRI facility and one consisting of five subjects scanned once each at two different facilities using the same imaging platform. Global graph metrics are calculated for unweighed and weighed connectomes, and two levels of granularity of the connectome are evaluated: one based on the 82-node cortical and subcortical parcellation from FreeSurfer and one based on an atlas-free parcellation of the gray-white matter boundary consisting of 1000 cortical nodes. The consistency of the unweighed and weighed edges and the module assignments are also computed for the 82-node connectomes. Overall, the results demonstrate good-to-excellent test-retest reliability for the entire connectome-processing pipeline, including the graph analytics, in both the intrasite and intersite datasets. These findings indicate that measurements of computational network metrics derived from the structural connectome have sufficient precision to be tested as potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of interventions in neurological and psychiatric diseases.	artificial neural network;biological markers;cdisc sdtm respiratory test name terminology;cervical atlas;color gradient;connectome;connectomics;forecast of outcome;freesurfer;graph - visual representation;mental disorders;neurodegenerative disorders;one thousand;population;resonance;scanning;test-retest reliability;theory;white matter	Julia P.

1ec25d3fd63d0cbef87041763c75b3c68d748e05	where does the population vector of motor cortical cells point during reaching movements?	motor cortical cells point;population vector;neural network;self organization	Visually-guided arm reaching movements are produced by distributed neural networks within parietal and frontal regions of the cerebral cortex. Experimental data indicate that (I) single neurons in these regions are broadly tuned to parameters of movement; (2) appropriate commands are elaborated by populations of neurons; (3) the coordinated action of neurons can be visualized using a neuronal population vector (NPV). However, the NPV provides only a rough estimate of movement parameters (direction, velocity) and may even fail to reflect the parameters of movement when arm posture is changed. We designed a model of the cortical motor command to investigate the relation between the desired direction of the movement, the actual direction of movement and the direction of the NPV in motor cortex. The model is a two-layer self-organizing neural network which combines broadly-tuned (muscular) proprioceptive and (cartesian) visual information to calculate (angular) motor commands for the initial part of the movement of a two-link arm. The network was trained by motor babbling in 5 positions. Simulations showed that (1) the network produced appropriate movement direction over a large part of the workspace; (2) small deviations of the actual trajectory from the desired trajectory existed at the extremities of the workspace; (3) these deviations were accompanied by large deviations of the NPV from both trajectories. These results suggest the NPV does not give a faithful image of cortical processing during arm reaching movements. • to whom correspondence should be addressed 84 P. Baraduc, E. Guigon and Y.

This endeavor has been greatly facilitated by the appearance of a number of innovative methodologies for the examination of neurophysiological and neuroimaging data. The aim of this article is to present an overview of dynamical measures of interdependence and contrast these with statistical measures that have been more widely employed. We first review the motivation, conceptual basis, and experimental approach of dynamical measures of interdependence and their application to the study of neural systems. A consideration of boot-strap “surrogate data” techniques, which facilitate hypothesis testing of dynamical measures, is then used to clarify the difference between dynamical and statistical measures of interdependence. An overview of some of the most active research areas—such as the study of the “synchronization manifold,” dynamical interdependence in neurophysiology data and the putative role of nonlinear desynchronization—is then given. We conclude by suggesting that techniques based on dynamical interdependence—or “dynamical connectivity”—show significant potential for extracting meaningful information from functional neuroimaging data.	dynamical system;interdependence;nonlinear system;surrogate data	Michael Breakspear	2004	Neuroinformatics	10.1385/NI:2:2:205	psychology;statistical hypothesis testing;neuroscience;functional neuroimaging;surrogate data;artificial intelligence;machine learning;management science;social psychology	ML	21.413819540016977	-76.6752117228237	149947

We examined the role of number representations, showing theoretically and experimentally that cardinal number representations (e.g., numerosity) are superior to symbolic and ordinal representations w.r.t. learnability and cognitive plausibility. Only the network trained on numerosities exhibited the problem-size effect, the core phenomenon in human behavioral studies. These results urge a reevaluation of current cognitive models of mental arithmetic. 1 Simple Mental Arithmetic Research on mental number processing has revealed a specific substrate for number representations in the inferior parietal cortex of the human brain, where numbers are thought to be encoded in a number-line (NL) format (Fig.2a,b) [1]. Simple mental arithmetic, however, is thought to be based on an associative network storing arithmetic facts in a verbal (symbolic) format [2]. Psychometric studies show that in production or verification of single-digit arithmetic problems (e.g., addition or multiplication), reaction times (RTs) and errors increase as a function of the size of the problem (problem-size effect) [3]. Problem size can be indexed by some function of the two operands, such as their sum or the square of their sum. The latter is the best predictor of the reaction time data for simple addition problems [4]. The first connectionist attempt to model simple multiplication was based on the autoassociative Brain-State-in-a-Box (BSB) network [5]. Numbers were represented jointly as NL and symbolic codes. Learning performance was far from optimal, in spite of the fact that the problem was simplified to computing “approximate” multiplication (to reduce the computational load). A later model of simple multiplication was MATHNET [6]. This model used NL representations and was implemented with a Boltzmann Machine (BM) [7]. The network was exposed to the arithmetic problems according to a schedule that roughly followed the experience of children when learning arithmetic, i.e., facts with small operands came before larger facts. However, fact frequency was manipulated in a way that did not reflect the real distribution: small facts were presented up to seven times as often as large problems. Therefore, MATHNET exhibited a (weak) problem-size effect, which was entirely produced by the specific training schedule and by the implausible frequency manipulation. In the present study, we used mean-field BMs trained with the contrastive divergence learning algorithm [8] to model the simple addition task and to contrast three different hypotheses about the representation of numbers. We found that numerositybased representations facilitate learning and provide the best match to human reaction times. We conclude that the traditional view of symbolic mental arithmetic should be reevaluated and that number representations for arithmetic should incorporate the basic property of cardinal meaning. Figure 1. BMs for Mental Arithmetic. Patterns are encoded at the visible layer. To recall a fact, its two arguments are fixed at the visible layer and the network iterates until convergence. 2 Mean-Field BMs with Contrastive Divergence Learning In line with previous connectionist attempts to model mental arithmetic, we assume that arithmetic facts are learned and stored in an associative NN. One typical associative network is the Boltzmann Machine, consisting of binary neurons with stochastic dynamics, fully connected with symmetric weights that store correlations of activations between connected units [7]. Data are encoded by visible neurons, whereas hidden neurons capture high-order statistics (Fig.1). BMs recall stored patterns by synchronous or asynchronous iterations, starting from initial activations representing partial patterns. Learning derives from the probabilistic law governing the net freerunning state and targets a weight set W resulting in free-running distribution PBM(s) similar to the data distribution PBM(s) = Q(s). The learning procedure minimizes the Kullback-Liebler divergence between the distributions at time zero and equilibrium by computing derivatives w.r.t. the weights and applying gradient descent: ∆wij = η ( <si sj> <si sj>) (1) The update of a weight connecting two units is proportional to the difference between the average of the correlations between these two units, computed at time 0 (positive, or fixed phase) and after reconstructing the pattern (negative, or free-running phase). Since the stochastic BM is computationally intractable, [9] replaced the correlations <si sj> with mean field approximation: <si sj>= mi mj , where mi is the mean field activity of neuron i and is given by the solution of a set of n coupled mean-field equations (2). Such an approximation turns the stochastic BM into a discrete NN since we can operate entirely with mean-field values, which also allows graded values. mi = σ ( Σj wij mj + θj) (2) Hinton [10] replaced the correlations computed in the free-running phase with correlations computed after one-step data reconstruction (contrastive divergence learning), which was shown also to drive the weights toward a state in which the data will be reproduced according to their distribution. This was followed by the fast Contrastive Divergence Mean-Field learning (3) [8], that we use for our simulations. ∆wij = η ( mi mj mi mj) (3) To learn a set of patterns, the learning algorithm presents them to the network in batches. For each pattern, the network performs a positive (wake) phase, when only the hidden layer settles, and a negative (sleep) phase, in which the network further reconstructs the visible pattern and then once again settles the hidden layer. After each phase, statistics for the corellations between the activations of each pair of connected neurons is collected. The weights can either be updated after each pattern or at the end of a batch. Here we used batch learning. The network recalls patterns by initializing the visible layer with a part of a pattern and iterating by consequent updating of the hidden and the visible layer until convergence. The number of steps to converge corresponds to RTs.

This information can be acquired either directly or indirectly, i.e., by observing emotional facial expressions (EFE) or indirectly by inferring emotions through cognitive perspective taking. Therefore, it is of great interest how the function of the cortical ToM network and the limbic system in affective ToM depends on the presence of facial expressions. We addressed this question in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. The experimental paradigm applied a well-established ToM cartoon task to test functional effects of EFE on the activation of the amygdala and the anterior ToM network during affective ToM judgments. During the task, 22 healthy participants had to judge the changes of the emotional state of the stories protagonist in the presence or absence of EFE. After quality control, 21 data sets entered the final analyses. The presence of EFE during affective ToM judgments was associated with shorter reaction times as well as increased activation of the right amygdala, most probably located in the basolateral nucleus (BLA), coincident with reduced activation of ToM-related regions of the prefrontal cortex. Psychophysiological interactions (PPI) revealed EFE-dependent modulation of connectivity between the right BLA and the contralateral ToM network regions. In combination with the functional interaction of EFE and affective ToM in the right amygdala, our data suggest a complementary but parallel organization of EFE processing and affective ToM. In this framework, the amygdala seems to act as an EFE detector when affective ToM judgments are demanded. Additionally, the facts that EFE induced exclusively right-sided amygdala activation and modulated the connectivity with the contralateral ToM network support the idea of a functional lateralization of stimulus driven components of affective ToM.	amygdaloid structure;biologics license application;cell nucleus;detectors;emotions;endocardial fibroelastosis;expression (computer science);facial nerve diseases;interaction;judgment;limbic system;magnetic resonance imaging;modulation;nucleus rtos;pixel density;prefrontal cortex;programming paradigm;dorsal raphe nucleus;fmri	Mike M.

968dce175ccb3aab157582cc30a7d686e107e1ae	discrimination among temporal patterns of stimulation in a computer model of a coelenterate nerve net	pattern recognition;nervous system;computer model	A simulation study is reported of the spread of excitation in a digital computer model based quite realistically on a coelenterate nerve net. The question posed is whether an elementary nervous system with randomly distributed properties can discriminate between time patterns of stimuli at the same average frequency. Forty-four temporal patterns of stimulation, each composed of seven stimuli in the same total period of time were applied to each of nine simulated nerve nets with each of eleven different distributions of four rates of decay of facilitation. The results may be summarized as follows: 1. The simulated nerve nets used were able reliably to discriminate between many of the time patterns used. The factors entering into range and acuity of pattern discrimination by the net are identified. 2. The simulated nerve nets tended to support a greater spread of excitation in response to even temporal distribution of stimuli than in response to clustered distributions of stimuli under certain conditions. These conditions are specified. 3. The response measure which was used (“final spread”) is shown to give different results in some cases than either of two other measures (“average” spread for the seven stimuli and “maximum spread”). 4. The simulated nerve nets were able to produce reliable differences in the spread of excitation between certain patterns and their temporally mirror-image counterparts. The necessary conditions for such pattern recognition are described. The simulated nerve nets used were able reliably to discriminate between many of the time patterns used. The factors entering into range and acuity of pattern discrimination by the net are identified. The simulated nerve nets tended to support a greater spread of excitation in response to even temporal distribution of stimuli than in response to clustered distributions of stimuli under certain conditions.

The simulated nerve nets were able to produce reliable differences in the spread of excitation between certain patterns and their temporally mirror-image counterparts. The necessary conditions for such pattern recognition are described. The relationships among the principal variables, namely the temporal distribution of stimuli, the specific sequence of junction decay rates, the magnitudes of facilitation decay rates, and their relative frequency distributions are described as they affect the spread of excitation in the nerve net. The overall finding that the net is able to discriminate between some temporal patterns gathers significance in that it represents an ability of the net to translate temporally coded information into spatial form. Thus, it is shown that already at the level of a simplified model of a coelenterate nervous system, the requisites for temporal to spatial translation are met.	abducens nerve diseases;cns disorder;computer simulation;elementary;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;excitation;genetic translation process;nerve net;numerical weather prediction;pattern recognition;randomness;sacral nerve stimulation;facilitation	Lester G.

However, it is a challenging problem that there are few effective diagnosis methods based on sensor data fusion for atrial hypertrophy disease. In this article, we propose a novel multi-sensor data fusion method for atrial hypertrophy diagnosis, namely, characterized support vector hyperspheres (CSVH). Instead of constructing a hyperplane, as a traditional support vector machine does, the proposed method generates """"hyperspheres"""" to collect the discriminative medical information, since a hypersphere is more powerful for data description than a hyperplane. In detail, CSVH constructs two characterized hyperspheres for the classes of patient and healthy subject, respectively. The hypersphere for the patient class is developed in a weighted version so as to take the diversity of patient instances into consideration. The hypersphere for the class of healthy people keeps furthest away from the patient class in order to achieve maximum separation from the patient class. A query is labelled by membership functions defined based on the two hyperspheres. If the query is rejected by the two classes, the angle information of the query to outliers and overlapping-region data is investigated to provide the final decision. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method achieves the highest diagnosis accuracy among the state-of-the-art methods."""	atrial septal defects;bayesian network;class;concentrate dosage form;confusion;heart atrium;matthews correlation coefficient;numerous;paget's disease, mammary;patients;question (inquiry);sensor;support vector machine;atrial hypertrophy	Yungang Zhu;Dayou Liu;Radu Grosu;Xinhua Wang;Hongying Duan;Guodong Wang	2017		10.3390/s17092049	discriminative model;hyperplane;support vector machine;computer-aided diagnosis;engineering;data mining;hypersphere;outlier;sensor fusion;atrial hypertrophy	AI	10.74754831549448	-72.75766609979759	150437
21dd75589be8075c9673a26f5e0bafdc03bb5c2e	identification of an integrated mathematical model of standard oral glucose tolerance test for characterization of insulin potentiation in health	oral glucose absorption;glucose insulin system;gastric emptying;parameter estimation;glp 1;incretin effect;gip	Two new formulations, respectively denominated INT_M1 and INT_M2, of an integrated mathematical model to describe the glycemic and insulinemic responses to a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are proposed and compared. The INT_M1 assumes a single compartment for the intestine and the derivative of a power exponential function for the gastric emptying rate, while, in the INT_M2, a nonlinear three-compartment system model is adopted to produce a more realistic, multiphase gastric emptying rate. Both models were implemented in a Matlab-based, two-step procedure for estimation of seven adjustable coefficients characterizing the gastric emptying rate and the incretin, insulin and glucose kinetics. Model behaviour was tested vs. mean plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucose and insulin measurements from two different laboratories, where glycemic profiles observed during a 75 g OGTT were matched in healthy subjects (HC1- and HC2-group, respectively) by means of an isoglycemic intravenous glucose (I-IVG) infusion. Under the hypothesis of an additive effect of GLP-1 and GIP on insulin potentiation, our results demonstrated a substantial equivalence of the two models in matching the data. Model parameter estimates showed to be suitable markers of differences observed in the OGTT and matched I-IVG responses from the HC1-group compared to the HC2-group. Model implementation in our two-step parameter estimation procedure enhances the possibility of a prospective application for individualization of the incretin effect in a single subject, when his/her data are plugged in.	anatomical compartments;coefficient;dependent ml;entity name part qualifier - adopted;estimated;estimation theory;gcg gene;gip gene;gastric emptying;glucagon;glucagon-like peptides;immune tolerance;incretins;intestinal wall tissue;kinetics internet protocol;laboratory;matching;matlab;mathematical model;mathematics;multi-compartment model;multiphase particle-in-cell method;nonlinear system;oral glucose tolerance test;peptide phi;plasma active;polypeptides;population parameter;prospective search;time complexity;turing completeness;utility functions on indivisible goods;chemosensitization/potentiation	Roberto Burattini;Micaela Morettini	2012	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	10.1016/j.cmpb.2011.07.002	endocrinology;mathematics;estimation theory;diabetes mellitus;statistics	ML	10.27504299183229	-69.86484568313662	150581

Is the neural system involved in this capacity also important in inferring another person's motor intentions toward an object from their eye gaze? In real-life situations, humans use eye movements to catch and direct the attention of others, often without any accompanying hand movements or speech. In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study, subjects observed videos showing a human model either grasping a target object (grasping condition) or simply gazing (gaze condition) at the same object. These two conditions were contrasted with each other and against a control condition in which the human model was standing behind the object without performing any gazing or grasping action. The results revealed activations within the dorsal premotor cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus, the inferior parietal lobule, and the superior temporal sulcus in both grasping and gaze conditions. These findings suggest that signaling the presence of an object through gaze elicits in an observer a similar neural response to that elicited by the observation of a reach-to-grasp action performed on the same object.	area striata structure;auditory recruitment;diabetes insipidus;email;execution;eye movements;frontal lobe gyrus;groove;humans;inferior frontal gyrus;intention - mental process;jaishankar menon;lobule;matching;marco corbetta;movement;parietal lobe;pointing device;real life;resonance;saccades;signal transduction;stanley (vehicle);structure of superior temporal sulcus;word lists by frequency;fmri;videocassette	Andrea C.

The current study explores the nature of the relationship between sleep and off-line improvement in three tasks for measuring different aspects of skill learning: the serial reaction time (SRT) task, which is a motor sequence learning task; the artificial grammar learning (AGL) task, testing abstract verbal sequence learning; and the weather prediction (WP) task, which is a non-sequential categorization task. Each participant was tested on one of the three tasks twice, either in a Wake condition (with a 12-h off-line period without sleep), or in a Sleep condition (with sleep). Results showed no sleep-related off-line improvement throughout the three tasks in a two-session re-learning design, but a sleep-independent time-based effect was found on the SRT task. No performance boost was observed in the WP and AGL tasks. Performance on the SRT showed a time of the day effect: the Sleep group outperforming the Wake group; however, this effect was restricted to overall response latencies. Taken together, no evidence was found in favor of sleep-dependent off-line enhancement in skill learning, but methodological concerns warrant further investigations.	artificial grammar learning;biologic preservation;categorization;clinical prediction rule;division algorithm;epilepsy, partial, motor;machine learning;motor neuron disease;online and offline;sleep;skill learning	Ferenc Kemény;Ágnes Lukács	2016	Cognitive Processing	10.1007/s10339-016-0750-0	psychology;simulation;artificial intelligence;communication	HCI	15.701177516313294	-79.112506349912	150800

0066d5ff3cee6b574e76db44b07e80a12472b3d0	extracting latent structure from multiple interacting neural populations		Developments in neural recording technology are rapidly enabling the recording of populations of neurons in multiple brain areas simultaneously, as well as the identification of the types of neurons being recorded (e.g., excitatory vs. inhibitory). There is a growing need for statistical methods to study the interaction among multiple, labeled populations of neurons. Rather than attempting to identify direct interactions between neurons (where the number of interactions grows with the number of neurons squared), we propose to extract a smaller number of latent variables from each population and study how these latent variables interact. Specifically, we propose extensions to probabilistic canonical correlation analysis (pCCA) to capture the temporal structure of the latent variables, as well as to distinguish within-population dynamics from across-population interactions (termed Group Latent Auto-Regressive Analysis, gLARA). We then applied these methods to populations of neurons recorded simultaneously in visual areas V1 and V2, and found that gLARA provides a better description of the recordings than pCCA. This work provides a foundation for studying how multiple populations of neurons interact and how this interaction supports brain function.	interaction;latent variable;neural oscillation;neuron;population dynamics	João D.

2f51f07fdd00833476316305155fbfbe1240de03	discovering the wiring diagram of the brain		he brain, the seat of our cognitive abilities, is perhaps the most complex puzzle in all of biology. Every second in the human brain, billions of cortical nerve cells transmit billions of messages and perform extraordinarily complex computations. How the brain works—how its function follows from its structure—remains a mystery. The brain's vast numbers of nerve cells are interconnected at synapses in circuits of unimaginable complexity. It is largely assumed that the specificity of these interconnections underlies our ability to perceive and classify objects, our behaviors both learned (such as playing the piano) and intrinsic (such as walking), and our memories—not to mention controlling lower-level functions such as maintaining posture and even breathing. At the highest level, our emotions, our sense of self, our very consciousness are entirely the result of activities in the nervous system. At a macro level, human brains have been mapped into regions that can be roughly associated with specific types of activities. However, even this building-block approach is fraught with complexity because often many parts of the brain participate in completing a task. This complexity arises especially because most behaviors begin with sensory input and are followed by analysis, decision making, and finally a motor output or action.

Inconsistencies may arise from averaging heterogeneous groups of patients. Here we investigate whether SZ is a heterogeneous group of disorders distinguished by distinct patterns of FA reductions. We developed a Generalized Factorization Method (GFM) to identify biclusters (i.e., subsets of subjects associated with a subset of particular characteristics, such as low FA in specific regions). GFM appropriately assembles a collection of unsupervised techniques with Non-negative Matrix Factorization to generate biclusters, rather than averaging across all subjects and all their characteristics. DTI tract-based spatial statistics images, which output is the locally maximal FA projected onto the group white matter skeleton, were analyzed in 47 SZ and 36 healthy subjects, identifying 8 biclusters. The mean FA of the voxels of each bicluster was significantly different from those of other SZ subjects or 36 healthy controls. The eight biclusters were organized into four more general patterns of low FA in specific regions: 1) genu of corpus callosum (GCC), 2) fornix (FX)+external capsule (EC), 3) splenium of CC (SCC)+retrolenticular limb (RLIC)+posterior limb (PLIC) of the internal capsule, and 4) anterior limb of the internal capsule. These patterns were significantly associated with particular clinical features: Pattern 1 (GCC) with bizarre behavior, pattern 2 (FX+EC) with prominent delusions, and pattern 3 (SCC+RLIC+PLIC) with negative symptoms including disorganized speech. The uncovered patterns suggest that SZ is a heterogeneous group of disorders that can be distinguished by different patterns of FA reductions associated with distinct clinical features.	biclustering;body of uterus;brain fornix;chaos theory;congenital abnormality;corpus callosum;delusions;diffusion anisotropy;diffusion tensor imaging;fanconi anemia;folic acid;fractional anisotropy;gucy2c wt allele;genetic heterogeneity;internal capsule of brain;latent dirichlet allocation;low back pain;maximal set;non-negative matrix factorization;norm (social);patients;projections and predictions;schizophrenia;spatial analysis;subgroup;tract (literature);unsupervised learning;voxel;white matter	Javier Arnedo;Daniel Mamah;David A A Baranger;Michael P.

9bb99a18e7170dc9c50b104c7b44ee8d894d114d	novel brain complexity measures based on information theory		Brain networks are widely used models to understand the topology and organization of the brain. These networks can be represented by a graph, where nodes correspond to brain regions and edges to structural or functional connections. Several measures have been proposed to describe the topological features of these networks, but unfortunately, it is still unclear which measures give the best representation of the brain. In this paper, we propose a new set of measures based on information theory. Our approach interprets the brain network as a stochastic process where impulses are modeled as a random walk on the graph nodes. This new interpretation provides a solid theoretical framework from which several global and local measures are derived. Global measures provide quantitative values for the whole brain network characterization and include entropy, mutual information, and erasure mutual information. The latter is a new measure based on mutual information and erasure entropy. On the other hand, local measures are based on different decompositions of the global measures and provide different properties of the nodes. Local measures include entropic surprise, mutual surprise, mutual predictability, and erasure surprise. The proposed approach is evaluated using synthetic model networks and structural and functional human networks at different scales. Results demonstrate that the global measures can characterize new properties of the topology of a brain network and, in addition, for a given number of nodes, an optimal number of edges is found for small-world networks. Local measures show different properties of the nodes such as the uncertainty associated to the node, or the uniqueness of the path that the node belongs. Finally, the consistency of the results across healthy subjects demonstrates the robustness of the proposed measures.	blueprint;cluster analysis;consortium;data erasure;entropic vector;entropy (information theory);experiment;global optimization;graph (discrete mathematics);human connectome project;information theory;mathematical model;music visualization;mutual information;stochastic process;strongly connected component;synthetic intelligence;systems neuroscience	Ester Bonmati;Anton Bardera;Miquel Feixas;Imma Boada	2018	Entropy	10.3390/e20070491	mathematical optimization;management science;human connectome project;graph theory;mathematics;systems neuroscience;blueprint for neuroscience;information theory;catalan;government	ML	22.62397193615311	-77.5520916561866	151681

Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) is a powerful technique for probing microstructure, yet its information arises from the ubiquitous, non-specific water signal. By contrast, diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (DW-MRS) allows specific characterizations of tissues such as brain and muscle in vivo by quantifying the diffusion properties of MR-observable metabolites. Many brain metabolites are predominantly intracellular, and some of them are preferentially localized in specific brain cell populations, e.g., neurons and glia. Given the microstructural sensitivity of diffusion-encoding filters, investigation of metabolite diffusion properties using DW-MRS can thus provide exclusive cell and compartment-specific information. Furthermore, since many models and assumptions are used for quantification of water diffusion, metabolite diffusion may serve to generate a-priori information for model selection in DW-MRI. However, DW-MRS measurements are extremely challenging, from the acquisition to the accurate and correct analysis and quantification stages. In this review, we survey the state-of-the-art methods that have been developed for the robust acquisition, quantification and analysis of DW-MRS data and discuss the potential relevance of DW-MRS for elucidating brain microstructure in vivo. The review highlights that when accurate data on the diffusion of multiple metabolites is combined with accurate computational and geometrical modeling, DW-MRS can provide unique cell-specific information on the intracellular structure of brain tissue, in health and disease, which could serve as incentives for further application in vivo in human research and clinical MRI.	anatomical compartments;body tissue;magnetic resonance spectroscopy;model selection;multi-compartment model;muscle;neuroglia;observable;pathologic processes;population;quantitation;relevance;video-in video-out;brain cell;nervous system disorder	Marco Palombo;Noam Shemesh;Itamar Ronen;Julien Valette	2018	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.028		ML	13.103743422434553	-70.43677933953974	151750
e6f7c013b23e462f6348ddd65f64fddab7d4e64c	classification of propofol-induced sedation states using brain connectivity analysis		connectivity measurements can provide key information about ongoing brain processes. In this paper, we propose to investigate the performance of the binary classification of Propofol-induced sedation states using partial granger causality analysis. Based on the brain connectivity measurements obtained from EEG signals in a database that contains four sedation states: baseline, mild, moderate, and recovery, we consider eight sensors and evaluate the area under the ROC curve with five classifiers: the k-nearest neighbor (density method), support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, Bayesian discriminant analysis, and a model based on extreme learning machine. The results support the conclusion that the different Propofol-induced sedation states can be identified with an AUC of around 0.75, by considering signal segments of only 4 second. These results highlight the discriminant power that can be obtained from scalp level connectivity measures for online brain monitoring.	area under curve;baseline (configuration management);bayesian network;binary classification;causality;electroencephalography;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;linear discriminant analysis;neural oscillation;propofol;receiver operating characteristic;sedation procedure;sensor;single linkage cluster analysis;support vector machine	Dheeraj Rathee;Hubert Cecotti;Girijesh Prasad	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512275	support vector machine;propofol;computer vision;granger causality;sedation;binary classification;electroencephalography;linear discriminant analysis;discriminant;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence;computer science	ML	23.404265391481992	-78.93649676557266	151787

Participants were presented with composite stimuli consisting of neutral and fearful faces upon which semi-transparent words were superimposed. This manipulation held stimulus-driven features constant across multiple levels of processing load. Participants made either (1) gender discriminations based on the face; (2) case judgments based on the words; or (3) syllable number judgments based on the words. A significant main effect for processing load was revealed in prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, visual processing areas, and amygdala. Critically, enhanced activity in the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex seen during gender discriminations was significantly reduced during the linguistic task conditions. A connectivity analysis conducted to investigate theories of cognitive modulation of emotion showed that activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was inversely related to activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Together, the data suggest that the processing of task-irrelevant emotional information, like neutral information, is subject to the effects of processing load and is under top-down control.	amygdaloid structure;cerebral cortex;face;judgment;linguistics;medial graph;modulation;prefrontal cortex;relevance;semiconductor industry;syllable;theory;top-down and bottom-up design;fmri	Derek G.

Basic experimental practices and emerging results from this field imply that two common assertions by philosophers and cognitive scientists are false: (1) that we do not know much about how the brain works, and (2) that lower-level neuroscience cannot explain cognition and complex behavior directly. These experimental practices involve intervening directly with molecular components of sub-cellular and gene expression pathways in neurons and then measuring specific behaviors. These behaviors are tracked using tests that are widely accepted by experimental psychologists to study the psychological phenomenon at issue (e.g., memory, attention, and perception). Here I illustrate these practices and their importance for explanation and reduction in current mainstream neuroscience by describing recent work on social recognition memory in mammals.	cognition;cognitive science;computer memory;philosophy of mind;reductionism	John Bickle	2006	Synthese	10.1007/s11229-006-9015-2	gene expression;philosophy of mind;memory consolidation;philosophy;molecular mechanics;epistemology;long-term potentiation	ML	15.039432807341806	-72.59237191976939	151998

This function is expressed through a complex array of dynamic and adaptive characteristics whose essential physiological basis is a disynaptic arc. We present a model of normal VOR function using a simple neural network architecture constrained by the physiological and anatomical characteristics of this disynaptic reflex arc. When tuned using a method of global optimization, this network is capable of exhibiting the broadband response characteristics observed in behavioral tests of VOR function. Examination of the internal units in the network show that this performance is achieved by rediscovering the solution to VOR processing first proposed by Skavenski and Robinson (1973). Type I units at the intermediate level of the network possess activation characteristics associated with either pure position or pure velocity. When the network is made more complex either through adding more pairs of internal units or an additional level of units, the characteristic division of unit activation properties into position and velocity types remains unchanged. Although simple in nature, the results of our simulations reinforce the validity of bottom-up approaches to modeling of neutral function. In addition, the architecture of the network is consistent with current ideas on the characteristics and site of adaptation of the reflex and should be compatible with current theories regarding learning rules for synaptic modification during VOR adaptation.	acclimatization;artificial neural network;biological neural networks;bottom-up parsing;digital single-lens reflex camera;exhibits as topic;experiment;global optimization;head movements;mathematical optimization;movement;network architecture;neural network simulation;palmar reflex;reflex action;reflex, vestibulo-ocular;retina;rule (guideline);synaptic package manager;theory;top-down and bottom-up design;unit;velocity (software development)	K.

The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of sonicatedly decellularized tissue to repopulate VSMCs after 6 days of cell-seeding. In this study, sample of aorta tissues are decellularized by sonication treatment in 0.1% and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) detergent for 10 hours. It was followed by washing process with PBS solution for 5 days. Decellularized aorta tissues are then cell seeded with VSMCs by static seeding in 96-well plate containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) at 37°C. The infiltrations of VSMCs onto decellularized tissues are evaluated by comparison of Hematoxylin-Eosin (H-E) staining at 0 and 6 days of cell-seeding. The histological results of cell-seeding showed that VSMCs are able to infiltrate onto the decellularized tissues. From the results, sonicatedly decellularized tissue treated in 0.1% and 2% SDS, seeded with VSMCs showed infiltration depth of 0.43 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively. Hence, a sonicated decellularized tissue treated with 0.1% and 2% SDS was shown to support the repopulation of VSMCs.	portable batch system	N. Syazwani;T. Ushida;A.

We consider Chua’s circuit when it exhibits a chaotic attractor and apply a single pulse stimulus. It is shown that under certain conditions the system displays self-referential phase reset (SPR) phenomenon. This is a case when the reset phase of the chaotic oscillation is independent on the initial phase, hence on the time moment when the stimulus has been applied. In an ensemble of chaotic oscillators simultaneously stimulated, the SPR yields mutual phase coherence or synchronization between the units. We describe basic dynamical mechanisms of the effect and show how it can be used for controllable cluster formation and for the control of chaotic dynamics.	chaos theory;chua's circuit;dynamical system;self-reference;synchronization (computer science);tree rearrangement	V.

We applied the method to simultaneously recorded motor cortical neurons in behaving monkeys and examined the occurrence of /nely timed synchrony between neuron pairs. Evidence was found for millisecond synchrony that could only be accounted for by assuming /ne temporal structure in the constituent neurons’ spike trains.

However, the degree to which object representations are sensitive to object viewpoint is unknown. Using fMRI we employed a parametric approach to examine the sensitivity to object view as a function of rotation (0 degrees-180 degrees ), category (animal/vehicle) and fMRI-adaptation paradigm (short or long-lagged). For both categories and fMRI-adaptation paradigms, object-selective regions recovered from adaptation when a rotated view of an object was shown after adaptation to a specific view of that object, suggesting that representations are sensitive to object rotation. However, we found evidence for differential representations across categories and ventral stream regions. Rotation cross-adaptation was larger for animals than vehicles, suggesting higher sensitivity to vehicle than animal rotation, and was largest in the left fusiform/occipito-temporal sulcus (pFUS/OTS), suggesting that this region has low sensitivity to rotation. Moreover, right pFUS/OTS and FFA responded more strongly to front than back views of animals (without adaptation) and rotation cross-adaptation depended both on the level of rotation and the adapting view. This result suggests a prevalence of neurons that prefer frontal views of animals in fusiform regions. Using a computational model of view-tuned neurons, we demonstrate that differential neural view tuning widths and relative distributions of neural-tuned populations in fMRI voxels can explain the fMRI results. Overall, our findings underscore the utility of parametric approaches for studying the neural basis of object invariance and suggest that there is no complete invariance to object view in the human ventral stream.	acclimatization;categories;computation;computational model;content adaptation;drug vehicle;large;largest;nonesterified fatty acids;outline of object recognition;population;programming paradigm;published comment;temporal sulcus;visual cortex;voxel;dinoflagellate sulcus;fmri	David R.

Although these electrophysiological responses are highly specific for the location and timing of cortical processing and in animal recordings are highly correlated with increased population firing rates, there has been little direct empirical evidence for causal interactions between different recording sites at high gamma frequencies. Such causal interactions are hypothesized to occur during cognitive tasks that activate multiple brain regions. To determine whether such causal interactions occur at high gamma frequencies and to investigate their functional significance, we used event-related causality (ERC) analysis to estimate the dynamics, directionality, and magnitude of event-related causal interactions using subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) recorded during two word production tasks: picture naming and auditory word repetition. A clinical subject who had normal hearing but was skilled in American Signed Language (ASL) provided a unique opportunity to test our hypothesis with reference to a predictable pattern of causal interactions, i.e. that language cortex interacts with different areas of sensorimotor cortex during spoken vs. signed responses. Our ERC analyses confirmed this prediction. During word production with spoken responses, perisylvian language sites had prominent causal interactions with mouth/tongue areas of motor cortex, and when responses were gestured in sign language, the most prominent interactions involved hand and arm areas of motor cortex. Furthermore, we found that the sites from which the most numerous and prominent causal interactions originated, i.e. sites with a pattern of ERC """"divergence"""", were also sites where high gamma power increases were most prominent and where electrocortical stimulation mapping interfered with word production. These findings suggest that the number, strength and directionality of event-related causal interactions may help identify network nodes that are not only activated by a task but are critical to its performance."""	activation action;adrenal cortex diseases;arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging;causality;cerebral cortex;direct electrocortical stimulation;electrocorticography;electroencephalography;endoscopic retrograde cholangiography;interaction;jakobson's functions of language;language development disorders;languages;programming paradigm;signature;speech repetition;subdural space;primary motor cortex;recycling endosome	Anna Korzeniewska;Piotr J.

RTs also got faster as a function of foreperiod in the neutral, but not temporal, condition, reflecting the evolving temporal predictability of the hazard function. We confirmed that left inferior parietal cortex was preferentially activated by the fixed temporal predictability of temporal (versus neutral) cues. Then, by directly comparing how activity varied as a function of foreperiod in the neutral versus time conditions, we identified the neural substrates of the changes in temporal probability defined by the hazard function, while simultaneously controlling for changes related simply to the elapse of time itself. Whole-brain fMRI analyses (independently confirmed by anatomically guided ROI analyses) showed that activity in left inferior parietal cortex tracked the evolving temporal probabilities of the hazard function. ROI analysis further revealed a similar role for right inferior frontal cortex. Our data highlight a key role for left parietal cortex in instantiating the behavioural benefits of temporal predictability, whether predictions are fixed or dynamically evolving."""	aspartate transaminase;cerebral cortex;failure rate;neutral monism;parietal lobe;probability;programming paradigm;region of interest;benefit;fmri;frontal lobe	Jennifer T.

95459f3c9d19842b8be171f8972cf57490012c8c	bayesian switching factor analysis for estimating time-varying functional connectivity in fmri	hidden markov model;bayesian inference;dynamic functional networks;resting state fmri;factor analysis	Abstract There is growing interest in understanding the dynamical properties of functional interactions between distributed brain regions. However, robust estimation of temporal dynamics from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains challenging due to limitations in extant multivariate methods for modeling time-varying functional interactions between multiple brain areas. Here, we develop a Bayesian generative model for fMRI time-series within the framework of hidden Markov models (HMMs). The model is a dynamic variant of the static factor analysis model ( Ghahramani and Beal, 2000 ). We refer to this model as Bayesian switching factor analysis (BSFA) as it integrates factor analysis into a generative HMM in a unified Bayesian framework. In BSFA, brain dynamic functional networks are represented by latent states which are learnt from the data. Crucially, BSFA is a generative model which estimates the temporal evolution of brain states and transition probabilities between states as a function of time. An attractive feature of BSFA is the automatic determination of the number of latent states via Bayesian model selection arising from penalization of excessively complex models. Key features of BSFA are validated using extensive simulations on carefully designed synthetic data. We further validate BSFA using fingerprint analysis of multisession resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our results show that modeling temporal dependencies in the generative model of BSFA results in improved fingerprinting of individual participants. Finally, we apply BSFA to elucidate the dynamic functional organization of the salience, central-executive, and default mode networks—three core neurocognitive systems with central role in cognitive and affective information processing ( Menon, 2011 ). Across two HCP sessions, we demonstrate a high level of dynamic interactions between these networks and determine that the salience network has the highest temporal flexibility among the three networks. Our proposed methods provide a novel and powerful generative model for investigating dynamic brain connectivity.	bayes factor;bayesian network;brain implant;default;estimated;factor analysis;fingerprint (computing);generative model;hidden markov model;high-level programming language;human connectome project;information processing;interaction;jaishankar menon;magnetic resonance imaging;markov chain;model selection;optical disc authoring;penalty method;probability;rest;resting state fmri;simulation;static program analysis;synthetic data;time series;neurocognitive	Jalil Taghia;Srikanth Ryali;Tianwen Chen;Kaustubh Supekar;Tom Weidong Cai;Vinod Menon	2017	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.02.083	information processing;human connectome project;generative model;resting state fmri;hidden markov model;salience (neuroscience);machine learning;multivariate statistics;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;computer science;bayesian inference	ML	22.020236231366283	-74.80030075541463	152683
d3df28d52f2df2d8bb255e8e7928443fcf24fbed	differentiating the functional contributions of resting connectivity networks to memory decision-making: fmri support for multistage control processes	journal article;bf psychology	Neural substrates of memory control are engaged when participants encounter unexpected mnemonic stimuli (e.g., a new word when told to expect an old word). The present fMRI study (n = 18) employed the likelihood cueing recognition task to elucidate the role of functional connectivity (fcMRI) networks in supporting memory control processes engaged by these unexpected events. Conventional task-evoked BOLD analyses recovered a memory control network similar to that previously reported, comprising medial prefrontal, lateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal regions. These were split by their differential affiliation to distinct fcMRI networks (“conflict detection” and “confirmatory retrieval” networks). Subsequent ROI analyses clarified the functional significance of this connectivity differentiation, with “conflict” network-affiliated regions specifically sensitive to cue strength, but not to response confidence, and “retrieval” network-affiliated regions showing the opposite pattern. BOLD time course analyses corroborated the segregation of memory control regions into “early” conflict detection and “late” retrieval analysis, with both processes underlying the allocation of memory control. Response specificity and time course findings were generalized beyond task-recruited ROIs to clusters within the large-scale fcMRI networks, suggesting that this connectivity architecture could underlie efficient processing of distinct processes within cognitive tasks. The findings raise important parallels between prevailing theories of memory and cognitive control.	clarify;file synchronization;functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging;information retrieval;lateral thinking;medial graph;multistage amplifier;parallels desktop for mac;parietal lobe;protologism;region of interest;rest;resting state fmri;risk management;sensitivity and specificity;theory	Ravi D.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the memory impairment features in verbal serial list learning measured by Auditory Verbal Learning Test WHO/UCLA version in aMCI in depth. The results indicated that aMCI patients had a shallower learning curve than normal older adults. However, aMCI patients showed normal retentions, normal proactive and retroactive interference, as well as normal serial position effect. Those results contribute to deeper understanding of memory impairment features in aMCI and indicate areas that can be targeted for intervention.	statistical interference	Pengyun Wang;Juan Li	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-38786-9_19	psychology;cognitive psychology;developmental psychology;social psychology	NLP	15.611798077542941	-80.089174181848	152824

In this modeling study, we demonstrate that in a network of spiking neurons organized according to spike-timing-dependent plasticity, an increase in the degree of synchrony of a uniform input can cause transitions between memorized activity patterns in the order presented during learning. Furthermore, context-dependent transitions from a single pattern to multiple patterns can be induced under appropriate learning conditions. These findings suggest one possible functional role of neuronal synchrony in controlling the flow of information by altering the dynamics of the network.	context-sensitive language;experiment;population;synchronization (computer science);virtual synchrony	Takaaki Aoki;Toshio Aoyagi	2007	Neural Computation	10.1162/neco.2007.19.10.2720	synchronization;neuroscience;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication;artificial neural network	ML	20.618380415980134	-70.49267555228357	152833

Gaze behaviour has been found to be an indicator of information gathering, and therefore could be used to derive information about the driver's next planned objective in order to identify intended manoeuvres without relying solely on car data. Previous work has shown that significantly distinct gaze patterns precede each of the driving manoeuvres analysed indicating that eye movement data might be used as input to ADAS supplementing sensors, such as CAN-Bus, laser, or radar in order to recognise intended driving manoeuvres. Drivers' gaze behaviour was measured prior to and during the execution of different driving manoeuvres performed in a dynamic driving simulator. The efficacy of Artificial Neural Network models in learning to predict the occurrence of certain driving manoeuvres using both car and gaze data was investigated, which could successfully be demonstrated with real traffic data [1]. Issues considered included the amount of data prior to the manoeuvre to use, the relative difficulty of predicting different manoeuvres, and the accuracy of the models at different pre-manoeuvre times.	pattern recognition	Firas Lethaus;Martin R.

It is proposed that belief bias is caused by the believability of a conclusion in working memory which influences its activation level, determining its likelihood of retrieval and therefore its effect on the reasoning process. This theory explores two main influences of belief on the activation levels of these conclusions. First, believable conclusions have higher activation levels and so are more likely to be recalled during the evaluation of reasoning problems than unbelievable conclusions, and therefore, they have a greater influence on the reasoning process. Secondly, prior beliefs about the conclusion have a base level of activation and may be retrieved when logically irrelevant, influencing the evaluation of the problem. The theory of activation and memory is derived from the Atomic Components of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture and so this account is formalized in an ACT-R cognitive model. Two experiments were conducted to test predictions of this model. Experiment 1 tested strength of belief and Experiment 2 tested the impact of a concurrent working memory load. Both of these manipulations increased the main effect of belief overall and in particular raised belief-based responding in indeterminately invalid problems. These effects support the idea that the activation level of conclusions formed during reasoning influences belief bias. This theory adds to current explanations of belief bias by providing a detailed specification of the role of working memory and how it is influenced by prior knowledge.	act-r;automated reasoning;belief revision;cognitive architecture;cognitive model;experiment;memory disorders;reasoning - publishing subsection;relevance;specification;explanation	Adrian P.

We study theoretically a setup in which one signal is transmitted via facilitating synapses (F signal) and another via depressing synapses (D signal). When both signals are present, the postsynaptic cell preferentially encodes information about slow components of the F signal and fast components of the D signal, whereas for a single signal, transmission is broadband. We also show that, in the fluctuation-driven regime, the rate of information transmission may be increased through stochastic resonance (SR). Remarkably, the role of the beneficial noise is played by another signal, which is itself represented in the spike train of the postsynaptic cell.	action potential;converge;genetic heterogeneity;neuron;preparation;quantum fluctuation;spike glycoprotein, coronavirus;stochastic resonance;synapse;synapses;the spike (1997);disease transmission	Felix Droste;Tilo Schwalger;Benjamin Lindner	2013		10.3389/fncom.2013.00086	psychology;biology;neuroscience;medicine;pathology;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication;stochastic resonance	ML	18.660874456101098	-72.06826865747185	153168

METHODS Functional imaging with a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance scanner was performed on 18 patients and 17 controls during non-symptom producing tasks requiring right-handed individuated or coupled finger control. A global linear model and psychophysiologic interaction model compared individuated to coupled tasks for patients and controls separately, and the results were submitted to a group analysis. The sensorimotor (posterior) and associative (anterior) parts of the putamen were considered as seed regions for the connectivity analysis.   RESULTS Compared to controls, patients had significant differences in activations and connectivity during individuated compared to coupled tasks: (i) decreased activations in the bilateral postcentral gyri, right associative posterior parietal areas, right cerebellum and left posterior putamen, while activations in the left anterior putamen were not different; (ii) increased connectivity of the left posterior putamen with the left cerebellum and left sensorimotor cortex; and (iii) increased connectivity of the left anterior putamen with bilateral supplementary motor areas, the left premotor cortex, and left cerebellum.   INTERPRETATION Decreased activations in the sensorimotor putamen and cerebellum controlling the affected hand might underlie low levels of surround inhibition during individuated tasks. For identical motor performance in both groups, increased connectivity of sensorimotor and associative striato-cortical circuits in FHD suggests that both affected and unaffected territories of the striatum participate in compensatory processes.	area striata structure;bilateral filter;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;dystonia;focal (programming language);familial hdl deficiency;large;linear model;motor cortex;muscle cramp;neostriatum;neurodegenerative disorders;operator associativity;patients;resonance;scanning systems;structure of putamen;fmri	Ryan D.

62316090daac38058ccf5c07fae14d2f9e9b27cc	dopamine alters the fidelity of working memory representations according to attentional demands		Capacity limitations in working memory (WM) necessitate the need to effectively control its contents. Here, we examined the effect of cabergoline, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, on WM using a continuous report paradigm that allowed us to assess the fidelity with which items are stored. We assessed recall performance under three different gating conditions: remembering only one item, being cued to remember one target among distractors, and having to remember all items. Cabergoline had differential effects on recall performance according to whether distractors had to be ignored and whether mnemonic resources could be deployed exclusively to the target. Compared with placebo, cabergoline improved mnemonic performance when there were no distractors but significantly reduced performance when distractors were presented in a precue condition. No significant difference in performance was observed under cabergoline when all items had to be remembered. By applying a stochastic model of response selection, we established that the causes of drug-induced changes in performance were due to changes in the precision with which items were stored in WM. However, there was no change in the extent to which distractors were mistaken for targets. Thus, D2 agonism causes changes in the fidelity of mnemonic representations without altering interference between memoranda.	dopamine d2 receptor;interference (communication);memorandum;memory disorders;memory, short-term;mental recall;programming paradigm;cabergoline;contents - htmllinktype	Sean James Fallon;Nahid Zokaei;Agnes Norbury;Sanjay G.

7e5f1e002319ea2fb1cd80cbadd7d50443f6e169	unconscious automatic brain activation of acoustic and action-related conceptual features during masked repetition priming		Classical theories of semantic memory assume that concepts are represented in a unitary amodal memory system. In challenging this classical view, pure or hybrid modality-specific theories propose that conceptual representations are grounded in the sensory–motor brain areas, which typically process sensory and action-related information. Although neuroimaging studies provided evidence for a functional–anatomical link between conceptual processing of sensory or action-related features and the sensory–motor brain systems, it has been argued that aspects of such sensory–motor activation may not directly reflect conceptual processing but rather strategic imagery or postconceptual elaboration. In the present ERP study, we investigated masked effects of acoustic and action-related conceptual features to probe unconscious automatic conceptual processing in isolation. Subliminal feature-specific ERP effects at frontocentral electrodes were observed, which differed with regard to polarity, topography, and underlying brain electrical sources in congruency with earlier findings under conscious viewing conditions. These findings suggest that conceptual acoustic and action representations can also be unconsciously accessed, thereby excluding any postconceptual strategic processes. This study therefore further substantiates a grounding of conceptual and semantic processing in action and perception.	acoustic cryptanalysis;blinded;cumulative trauma disorders;erp;modality (human–computer interaction);neuroimaging;priming exercise;theory;topography;unconscious personality factor;electrode;polarity	Natalie M.

Previous studies reported the implication of inferior frontal cortex in musical structure processing. However - due to the strong musical manipulations - activations might be explained by sensory deviance detection or repetition priming. Our present study investigated neural correlates of musical structure processing with subtle musical violations in a musical priming paradigm. Instrumental and sung sequences ended on related and less-related musical targets. The material controlled sensory priming components, and differences in target processing required listeners' knowledge on musical structures. Participants were scanned with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while performing speeded phoneme and timbre identification judgments on the targets. Behavioral results acquired in the scanner replicated the facilitation effect of related over less-related targets. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal linked to target processing revealed activation of right inferior frontal areas (i.e., inferior frontal gyrus, frontal operculum, anterior insula) that was stronger for less-related than for related targets, and this was independent of the material carrying the musical structures. This outcome points to the implication of inferior frontal cortex in the processing of syntactic relations also for musical material and to its role in the processing and integration of sequential information over time. In addition to inferior frontal activation, increased activation was observed in orbital gyrus, temporal areas (anterior superior temporal gyrus, posterior superior temporal gyrus and sulcus, posterior middle temporal gyrus) and supramarginal gyrus.	acoustic cryptanalysis;c6orf15 gene;cerebral cortex;consciousness;cumulative trauma disorders;erp;frontal lobe gyrus;ifng gene;inferior frontal gyrus;instrument - device;insula of reil;judgment;lichen sclerosus et atrophicus;linguistics;molecular orbital;oxygen;parallels desktop for mac;patients;phoneme;priming exercise;programming paradigm;resonance;resting state fmri;scanner device component;scanning;star trek generations;structure of middle temporal gyrus;superior temporal gyrus;syllable;unidentified flying oddball;zero suppression;dinoflagellate sulcus;explanation;facilitation	Barbara Tillmann;Stefan Koelsch;Nicolas Escoffier;Emmanuel Bigand;Philippe Lalitte;Angela D.

Using geometrically based approaches to movement segmentation, it is shown that the hand trajectories are composed of elementary segments that are primarily parabolic in shape. The segments could be categorized into a small number of classes on the basis of decreasing intra-class variance over the course of training. A separate classification of the neural data employing a hidden Markov model showed a coincidence of the neural states with the behavioral categories. An additional analysis of both types of data by a data mining method provided evidence that the neural activity patterns underlying the behavioral primitives were formed by sets of specific and precise spike patterns.

In this model the statistical properties of the signal and noise components are stored in the intrinsic horizontal connectivity pattern, which is used aspriori knowledge to extract the signal from noisy input. The method of the Wiener filter, or the least-squares filter, is applied to the activity pattern of the model complex cells, and the optimal horizontal connectivity pattern for estimating the signal is derived. As a simple but important example, the model horizontal connections required to extract oriented features such as lines or edges are calculated. The results of numerical simulations show that the model horizontal connections can, as expected, extract the local features from degraded input. The obtained model horizontal connectivity is, in accord with experimental observations by Ts'o, Gilbert & Wiesel [Journal of Neuroscience,  6 ,  1160 (1986) ], highly specific in connecting cells having similar orientation selectivity.

Each pattern comprises two vectors: a primary vector and a collateral vector. Examples of such patterns include annotated images and magnitudes with articulated numerical labels. Our modular system is trained using an unsupervised learning algorithm. One component learns to classify the patterns using the primary vectors and another classifies the same patterns using the collateral vectors. The third combiner network correlates the primary with the collateral. The primary and collateral vectors are mapped on a Kohonen selforganising feature map (SOM), with the combiner based on a variant of Hebbian networks. The classification results appear encouraging in our attempts to classify a set of scene-of-crime images and in our attempts to investigate how pre-school infants relate magnitude to articulated numerical quantities. Certain features of SOM’s, namely the topological neighbourhoods of specific nodes, allow for one to many mappings between the primary and collateral maps, hence establishing a broader association between the two vectors when compared with the association due to synchrony in a conventional Hebbian association.	algorithm;artificial neural network;diplexer;display resolution;hebbian theory;information system;linkage (software);map;modular neural network;neural oscillation;numerical analysis;occam's razor;power dividers and directional couplers;programming paradigm;simulation;supervised learning;teuvo kohonen;unity;unsupervised learning	Khurshid Ahmad;Matthew C.

26245a31ccc5be92f0e5d26081551536fa96169e	cytoarchitectonic mapping of attentional selection and reorienting in parietal cortex		Selection and reorienting are two fundamental aspects of spatial attention. By means of event-related fMRI in a total of 26 subjects, we localized these two processes within a same experiment applying a probabilistic cytoarchitectonic reference frame. In a classical spatial cueing paradigm, the target was presented at the cued location either alone (60% of trials) or in combination with a contralateral distracter ('competition trials', 20% of trials), or at a location opposite to the cued location ('invalidly cued trials', 20% of trials). In a sensory control experiment we differentiated between the attentional and the sensory effects of the distracter. In areas hIP1 and hIP3, competition trials exerted a significantly stronger attentional effect than invalidity trials. Conversely, area PF in the right hemisphere showed an invalidity effect in the absence of competition effect. A third type of response was found in areas PFm and PGa which showed both an invalidity and a competition effect. The combined study of selection and reorienting using a cytoarchitectonic reference frame enabled us to resolve the wide between-study variance in temporoparietal coordinates associated with the invalidity effect. Furthermore, the study demonstrated within a same experiment a functional dissociation between reorienting and selection in parietal cortex.	cell differentiation process;contralateral prophylactic mastectomy;genetic selection;hip1 gene;hip1r gene;parietal lobe;programming paradigm;prostaglandins a;reference frame (video);sample variance;fmri;physical hard work	Céline R.

c407dcbe944b3013d9012ce4ed2ac4ae2f399b32	how a population-based representation of binocular visual signal can intrinsically mediate autonomous learning of vergence control		Designing an active visual system, able to autonomously learn its behavior, implies to make the learning controller independent of an external signal (e.g. the error between the actual and the desired vergence angle) or of perceptual decisions about disparity (e.g. from the response of a previously trained network). The proposed approach is based on a direct use of a computational substrate of modeled V1 complex cells that provide a distributed representation of binocular disparity information. The design strategies of the cortical-like architecture, including uniform coverage in feature space and divisive normalization mechanisms, allow the global energy of the population to effectively mediate the learning process towards the proper motor control. Since the learning controller is based on an intrinsic representation of the visual signal, it comes to overlap and coincide with the system that is learning the behaviour, thus closing at an inner cycle the perception-action loop necessary for learning. Experimental tests proved that the control architecture is both able to learn an effective vergence behavior, and to exploit it to fixate static and moving visual targets. c © 2012 The Authors.

One treatment for this disease is a rate-responsive pacemaker that stimulates the heart at a rate proportional to an exertion-related variable derived from an implemented sensor (e.g., ventilation). The atrio-ventricular conduction time (AVCT), which can act as such a sensor, corresponds to a well-defined interval in the intracardial electrogram. The AVCT is coupled to the sympathetic/parasympathetic activity of the autonomous nervous system (dromotropic effect), leading to a shortening of AVCT during exercise. We found that AVCT is also sensitive to the pacing frequency (pf). Hence, an AVCT-based pacemaker always constitutes a closed-loop system. General design rules for an AVCT pacemaker have been developed from our experimental results and a system-theoretical treatment with reasonable assumptions. Problems addressed were uncertainties concerning the AVCT dynamics and disturbances in the signal. The following rules for the controller design have been derived: 1) The controller gain strongly depends on the therapeutic range of the pf, which is set by the medical doctor; 2) the closed-loop bandwidth of the system should be smaller than the respiratory frequency; and 3) a robust control strategy, capable of guaranteeing stability for a certain set of plant models, should be applied.	artificial cardiac pacemaker;autonomic nervous system;autonomic networking;autonomous robot;cns disorder;control system;control theory;controllers;discrepancy function;hearing loss, high-frequency;patients;respiration;respiratory rate;rest;robust control;rule (guideline);physical hard work	Martin Hexamer;Mathias Meine;Axel Kloppe;Jürgen Werner	2002	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/10.983452	robust control;electrophysiology;electronic engineering;neuroscience;index term;engineering;adaptive response;control theory;biological pest control;thermal conduction;neurophysiology;heart;surgery	Robotics	11.992738338468904	-72.54229017765974	154530

The novel method estimates the autocorrelation structure in a nonparametric and subject-specific manner, and estimates the variance due to the heterogeneity using iterative least squares. We apply the new model to a resting-state fMRI study to compare the functional connectivity networks in both typical and reading impaired young adults in order to characterize the resting state networks that are related to reading processes. We also compare the performance of our model to other methods of statistical inference on functional connectivity networks that do not account for the temporal autocorrelation or heterogeneity across the subjects using simulated data, and show that by accounting for these sources of variation and covariation results in more powerful tests for statistical inference.	appendix;autocorrelation;autoregressive model;bartlett's bisection theorem;bivariate data;c++;cross-correlation;dimensions;estimated;gpr17 protein, human;gpr17 wt allele;health services;heart rate variability;heuristic;heuristics;inference;iterative method;large;least squares;magnetic resonance imaging;natural science disciplines;patients;platoon (automobile);r language;random effects model;rest;resting state fmri;stmn1 gene;sample size;sample variance;simulation;temporal logic;the greek seaman;time series;version;white noise;saw (device)	Mark Fiecas;Ivor Cribben;Reyhaneh Bahktiari;Jacqueline Cummine	2017	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.051	psychology;dyslexia;econometrics;neuroscience;computer science;machine learning;resting state fmri;statistics	ML	23.95551605273622	-75.73517647776775	154762
c0a84a11c1b61f35cc0156779e3e0f68d9f35659	a novel meta-analytic approach: mining frequent co-activation patterns in neuroimaging databases	gaussian mixture modeling;coordinate-based meta-analysis;pamini;brainmap database;association analysis	"""In recent years, coordinate-based meta-analyses have become a powerful and widely used tool to study co-activity across neuroimaging experiments, a development that was supported by the emergence of large-scale neuroimaging databases like BrainMap. However, the evaluation of co-activation patterns is constrained by the fact that previous coordinate-based meta-analysis techniques like Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) and Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) reveal all brain regions that show convergent activity within a dataset without taking into account actual within-experiment co-occurrence patterns. To overcome this issue we here propose a novel meta-analytic approach named PaMiNI that utilizes a combination of two well-established data-mining techniques, Gaussian mixture modeling and the Apriori algorithm. By this, PaMiNI enables a data-driven detection of frequent co-activation patterns within neuroimaging datasets. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by means of several analyses on simulated data as well as a real application. The analyses of the simulated data show that PaMiNI identifies the brain regions underlying the simulated activation foci and perfectly separates the co-activation patterns of the experiments in the simulations. Furthermore, PaMiNI still yields good results when activation foci of distinct brain regions become closer together or if they are non-Gaussian distributed. For the further evaluation, a real dataset on working memory experiments is used, which was previously examined in an ALE meta-analysis and hence allows a cross-validation of both methods. In this latter analysis, PaMiNI revealed a fronto-parietal """"core"""" network of working memory and furthermore indicates a left-lateralization in this network. Finally, to encourage a widespread usage of this new method, the PaMiNI approach was implemented into a publicly available software system."""	3-iodobenzylguanidine;apriori algorithm;cross-validation (statistics);data mining;emergence;experiment;memory disorders;name;neuroimaging;normal statistical distribution;published database;silo (dataset);simulation;software system;triangulation	Julian Caspers;Karl Zilles;Christoph Beierle;Claudia Rottschy;Simon B.

279247b7d21ae73d7a47bd3cdc78a537be6616af	dynamic neural fields with intrinsic plasticity	adaptation;dynamic neural fields;dynamics;intrinsic plasticity	Dynamic neural fields (DNFs) are dynamical systems models that approximate the activity of large, homogeneous, and recurrently connected neural networks based on a mean field approach. Within dynamic field theory, the DNFs have been used as building blocks in architectures to model sensorimotor embedding of cognitive processes. Typically, the parameters of a DNF in an architecture are manually tuned in order to achieve a specific dynamic behavior (e.g., decision making, selection, or working memory) for a given input pattern. This manual parameters search requires expert knowledge and time to find and verify a suited set of parameters. The DNF parametrization may be particular challenging if the input distribution is not known in advance, e.g., when processing sensory information. In this paper, we propose the autonomous adaptation of the DNF resting level and gain by a learning mechanism of intrinsic plasticity (IP). To enable this adaptation, an input and output measure for the DNF are introduced, together with a hyper parameter to define the desired output distribution. The online adaptation by IP gives the possibility to pre-define the DNF output statistics without knowledge of the input distribution and thus, also to compensate for changes in it. The capabilities and limitations of this approach are evaluated in a number of experiments.	acclimatization;approximation algorithm;architecture as topic;artificial neural network;autonomous robot;decision making;dynamical system;embedding;experiment;hyperactive behavior;input/output;intrinsic dimension;memory disorders;neural network simulation;population parameter;quantum field theory;rest;negative regulation of hydrogen peroxide-induced neuron intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway	Claudius Strub;Gregor Schöner;Florentin Wörgötter;Yulia Sandamirskaya	2017		10.3389/fncom.2017.00074	architecture;machine learning;dynamical systems theory;artificial intelligence;hyperparameter;parametrization;artificial neural network;mean field theory;input/output;cognition;computer science	ML	18.042118254316993	-68.61504350918129	155021

Recent functional MRI (fMRI) studies have provided clues that the aCIN initiates activity changes in the FPN. However, when and how often these networks interact remains largely unknown to date. Here, we systematically examined the oscillatory interactions between the aCIN and the FPN by using the spectral Granger causality analysis of reconstructed brain source signals from the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from human participants performing a face-house perceptual categorization task. We investigated how the aCIN and the FPN interact, what the temporal sequence of events in these nodes is, and what frequency bands of information flow bind these nodes in networks. We found that beta band (13-30Hz) and gamma (30-100Hz) bands of interactions are involved between the aCIN and the FPN during decision-making tasks. In gamma band, the aCIN initiated the Granger causal control over the FPN in 25-225 ms timeframe. In beta band, the FPN achieved a control over the aCIN in 225-425 ms timeframe. These band-specific time-dependent Granger causal controls of the aCIN and the FPN were retained for behaviorally harder decision-making tasks. These findings of times and frequencies of oscillatory interactions in the aCIN and FPN provide us new insights into the general neural mechanisms for sensory information-guided, goal-directed behaviors, including perceptual decision-making processes.	anal canal squamous intraepithelial neoplasia;bands;behavior;categorization;causality;decision making;electroencephalography phase synchronization;fixed-pattern noise;frequency band;information flow (information theory);information processing;insula of reil;interaction;large scale brain networks;parietal lobe;structure of anterior hypothalamic nucleus;fmri	Ganesh B.

More specifically, it enhances reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity with eligibility trace when used in spiking neural networks, as shown by the results when tested in the simple benchmark problem of XOR, as well as in a complex multiagent setting task.	agent-based model;artificial neural network;benchmark (computing);biological neuron model;diploid cell;eligibility determination;exclusive or;learning disorders;modulation;neural network simulation;spiking neural network	Chris Christodoulou;Aristodemos Cleanthous	2011	Neural Computation	10.1162/NECO_a_00090	neuroscience;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;spiking neural network	ML	18.41088080959898	-69.905012442812	155244

By applying a utility function to the temporal difference (TD) error, nonlinear transformations are effectively applied not only to the received rewards but also to the true transition probabilities of the underlying Markov decision process. When appropriate utility functions are chosen, the agents’ behaviors express key features of human behavior as predicted by prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), for example, different risk preferences for gains and losses, as well as the shape of subjective probability curves. We derive a risk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm, which is necessary for modeling human behavior when transition probabilities are unknown, and prove its convergence. As a proof of principle for the applicability of the new framework, we apply it to quantify human behavior in a sequential investment task. We find that the risk-sensitive variant provides a significantly better fit to the behavioral data and that it leads to an interpretation of the subject's responses that is indeed consistent with prospect theory. The analysis of simultaneously measured fMRI signals shows a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive TD error with BOLD signal change in the ventral striatum. In addition we find a significant correlation of the risk-sensitive Q-values with neural activity in the striatum, cingulate cortex, and insula that is not present if standard Q-values are used.	algorithm;behavior;cingulate cortex;convergence (action);decision making;epilepsy, temporal lobe;insula of reil;markov chain;markov decision process;mutual information;neostriatum;nonlinear system;probability;q-learning;reinforcement learning;rewards;risk aversion;temporal difference learning;utility;ventral striatum;cell transformation;fmri	Yun Shen;Michael J.

This study aimed to understand the common points and differences as well as the underlying neural substrates between addition and subtraction through the analysis on the data derived from magnetic resonance imaging measurement. Three kinds of tasks: addition task (AT), subtraction task (ST) and memory task (MT) were solved by seventeen adults. Our results revealed that simple addition also induced the activation in intraparietal sulcus (IPS); activation in hippocampal areas responsible for retrieval was discovered during subtraction calculation; subtraction showed stronger activation in Broca's Area when compared with addition. The findings suggest that calculation strategy is not the key point for distinguishing addition and subtraction, the activation in Broca's Area indicates the differences between the two operations may concern grammar and language expression.

We have previously shown that performance in this task relies on sensitivity to accumulating negative outcomes in ventromedial PFC and dorsolateral PFC. Here, we further formalize outcome evaluation (as driven by prediction errors [PE], using a reinforcement learning model) and examine its development. Task performance improved significantly during adolescence, stabilizing in adulthood. Performance relied on greater impact of negative compared with positive PEs, the relative impact of which matured from adolescence into adulthood. Adolescents also showed increased exploratory behavior, expressed as a propensity to shift responding between options independently of outcome quality, whereas adults showed no systematic shifting patterns. The correlation between PE representation and improved performance strengthened with age for activation in ventral and dorsal PFC, ventral striatum, and temporal and parietal cortices. There was a medial-lateral distinction in the prefrontal substrates of effective PE utilization between adults and adolescents: Increased utilization of negative PEs, a hallmark of successful performance in the task, was associated with increased activation in ventromedial PFC in adults, but decreased activation in ventrolateral PFC and striatum in adolescents. These results suggest that adults and adolescents engage qualitatively distinct neural and psychological processes during decision-making, the development of which is not exclusively dependent on reward-processing maturation.	adolescent (age group);anatomical maturation;biologic development;cfp gene;cfp wt allele;decision making;gambling;lateral thinking;medial graph;neostriatum;penk wt allele;parietal lobe;powerbuilder foundation classes;rem sleep behavior disorder;reinforcement learning;structure of ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus;ventral striatum;fmri	Anastasia Christakou;Samuel J Gershman;Yael Niv;Andrew Simmons;Michael J.

Here, we propose a data-driven approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) to reveal hidden patterns of coherent FC dynamics across multiple subjects. We demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of this new approach by examining the differences in dynamic FC between 13 healthy control subjects and 15 minimally disabled relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis patients. We estimated whole-brain dynamic FC of regionally-averaged BOLD activity using sliding time windows. We then used PCA to identify FC patterns, termed """"eigenconnectivities"""", that reflect meaningful patterns in FC fluctuations.

These areas often have a specific function. A lot of communication takes place between, and also within, these areas. The total set of interactions between and within the different brain areas is the """"architecture of the visual system"""". Although a lot is known about the visual system's architecture from histological research, there is still much unknown about the functional architecture (about how the interactions actually work). In the first part of the thesis, I have investigated functional architecture underlying human perception of motion, and in particular the speed of motion. In the second part, I have researched the human perception in circumstances in which a large conflict exists between the inputs in the two eyes (a circumstance in which binocular rivalry results). Motion consists of two components: a direction and a speed. It is generally accepted that the direction-component is processed by a single system (that is, a collection of interconnected brain areas). However, for the speed of motion no such general agreement exists. It has often been proposed that speed-processing is supported by two (or more) systems: one for low speeds and one for high speeds. In this thesis I have proposed that the data know up to now also permit a simpler explanation, namely that a single system processes the entire range of visible speeds. I have tested this prediction with computational models and experiments. The results point out that a single speed-sensitive system indeed may explain the data in the literature and the newly-obtained data of this thesis. Binocular rivalry results when our two eyes receive conflicting images. In stead seeing an average of the two images, we see a continuing alternation of the images. The images fight, as is were, for dominance, hence the name binocular rivalry. It has been well-studied how spatial aspects of stimulation influence the rivalry behaviour. However, temporal aspects are not so well-studied. In this thesis I started the investigation on the influence of temporal aspects of stimulation on binocular rivalry. Remarkably, binocular rivalry is quite insensitive to a temporary blanking of the stimulation. The two images need not even be presented simultaneously to obtain rivalry, a long as they are repeatedly shown within 350 milliseconds. This temporal limit to rivalry is dependent on form information and independent of motion information, and is even found when the two images are shown to a single eye. The experiments add to the discussion on how rivalry takes place; one theory says that rivalry takes place between the neurons specific to information from different eyes, while another theory says that the rivalry takes place between neurons coding for different patterns. The data in this thesis are mainly support for the second theory. The data provide new insights into the architecture of the visual system. Firstly, the thesis shows that a single system suffices for human speed perception, opposing theories that claim that at least two systems are necessary. Secondly, the thesis strongly suggests that binocular rivalry is dependent on pattern-based competition and not eye-based competition, and therefore probably takes place at a level within the visual system where eye-specific information is lost."""	binocular vision	Jeroen J.

As a key problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, this concept is increasingly becoming a focus of consciousness study. This paper first introduced the concept, characteristics, and biological basis of feature binding. Then, this paper illustrated three feature binding theories namely feature integration theory, synchronous neural activation theory, and neural network model of feature binding, and then reviewed the advantages and disadvantages of these three feature binding theories. To demonstrate why feature binding indeed exists, we reviewed works on the functions of feature binding observed in perceptual learning. Conclusions were reached that feature binding exists in many processes of perception. This paper also suggested future research in this area should focus on systematic study of bundled brain mechanisms.	artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;binding problem;cognition;cognitive science;computer scientist;consciousness;dna binding site;declaration (computer programming);experiment;feature integration theory;free variables and bound variables;language binding;machine perception;name binding;network model;neural binding;neuron;pdf/a;speculative execution	Shifei Ding;Lingheng Meng;Youzhen Han	2016	Cognitive Computation	10.1007/s12559-016-9446-0	psychology;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;communication	AI	15.625370200666373	-72.45299680221191	156088
62debb31ac8836b7a048c6b406ee227aabf06e60	basic level category structure emerges gradually across human ventral visual cortex		Objects can be simultaneously categorized at multiple levels of specificity ranging from very broad (“natural object”) to very distinct (“Mr. Woof”), with a mid-level of generality (basic level: “dog”) often providing the most cognitively useful distinction between categories. It is unknown, however, how this hierarchical representation is achieved in the brain. Using multivoxel pattern analyses, we examined how well each taxonomic level (superordinate, basic, and subordinate) of real-world object categories is represented across occipitotemporal cortex. We found that, although in early visual cortex objects are best represented at the subordinate level (an effect mostly driven by low-level feature overlap between objects in the same category), this advantage diminishes compared to the basic level as we move up the visual hierarchy, disappearing in object-selective regions of occipitotemporal cortex. This pattern stems from a combined increase in within-category similarity (category cohesion) and between-category dissimilarity (category distinctiveness) of neural activity patterns at the basic level, relative to both subordinate and superordinate levels, suggesting that successive visual areas may be optimizing basic level representations.	categories;categorization;cerebral cortex;high- and low-level;physical object;sensitivity and specificity;visual hierarchy;woof (software)	Marius Catalin Iordan;Michelle R.

This paper presents a general and novel statistical framework for robust and more complete estimation of brain functional connectivity from fMRI based on correlation analyses and hypothesis testing. In addition to the ability of examining the correlations with each individual seed as in the standard and existing methods, the proposed framework can detect functional interactions by simultaneously examining multiseed correlations via multiple correlation coefficients. Spatially structured noise in fMRI is also taken into account during the identification of functional interconnection networks through noncentral F hypothesis tests. The associated issues for the multiple testing and the effective degrees-of-freedom are considered as well. Furthermore, partial multiple correlations are introduced and formulated to measure any additional task-induced but not stimulus-locked relation over brain regions so that we can take the analysis of functional connectivity closer to the characterization of direct functional interactions of the brain. Evaluation for accuracy and advantages, and comparisons of the new approaches in the presented general framework are performed using both realistic synthetic data and in vivo fMRI data.	coefficient;interaction;interconnection;magnetic resonance imaging;neuroimaging;resting state fmri;synthetic data;video-in video-out	Yongmei Michelle Wang;Jing Xia	2009	IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging	10.1109/TMI.2009.2014863	computer simulation;econometrics;statistical hypothesis testing;magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;mathematics;neurophysiology;statistics	Vision	23.014252325937054	-77.56176570575013	156284

University students studied a map from a single orientation (with north at the top). In a subsequent two-choice reaction time task, the students’ spatial knowledge of the map was assessed employing spatial left/right judgments, which were made from imagined perspectives that were either north-aligned or south-aligned. Data showed a standard alignment effect, favoring north- over south-aligned trials. To examine the locus of this effect, data were fit using the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) model of speeded decisions (Brown u0026 Heathcote, 2008). Of interest were three model parameters: drift rate, the speed at which evidence accumulates toward a response; response threshold, the amount of evidence demanded from the decision maker before selecting a response; and non-decision time, the time consumed by pre- and postdecisional processes.

It has been proposed that the DLPFC is dynamically recruited depending on task demands. By this view, high DLPFC recruitment for low-demanding tasks along with weak DLPFC upregulation at higher task demands reflects low efficiency. Here, the fMRI BOLD signal during working memory maintenance and manipulation was examined in relation to aging and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met status in a large representative sample (n = 287). The efficiency hypothesis predicts a weaker DLPFC response during manipulation, along with a stronger response during maintenance for older adults and COMT Val carriers compared with younger adults and COMT Met carriers. Consistent with the hypothesis, younger adults and met carriers showed maximal DLPFC BOLD response during manipulation, whereas older adults and val carriers displayed elevated DLPFC responses during the less demanding maintenance condition. The observed inverted relations support a link between dopamine and DLPFC efficiency.	acetylserotonin n-methyltransferase;auditory recruitment;catechol o-methyltransferase;cerebral cortex;dopamine;dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;maximal set;memory disorders;methyltransferase;modulation;powerbuilder foundation classes;fmri	Lars Nyberg;Micael Andersson;Karolina Kauppi;Anders Lundquist;Jonas Persson;Sara Pudas;Lars-Göran Nilsson	2014	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00521	psychology;neurology;developmental psychology;communication;social psychology	HCI	16.44541237584481	-77.8680618898893	156853

The method is tested on fMRI data collected from eight healthy subjects performing a bulb-squeezing motor task with their right-hand at various frequencies. Multiple brain regions including the left cerebellum, both primary motor cortices (MI), both supplementary motor areas (SMA), left prefrontal cortex (PFC), and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) demonstrate significant task-related changes. Furthermore, our method is able to discriminate differences in activation patterns at the various task frequencies, whereas using a traditional intensity based method, no significant activation difference is detected. This suggests that temporal dynamics of the spatial distribution of BOLD signal provide additional information regarding task-related activation thus complementing conventional intensity-based approaches.	cerebellum;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;complement system proteins;direct extension;magnetic resonance imaging;modulation;motor neuron disease;oxygen;powerbuilder foundation classes;prefrontal cortex;region of interest;resting state fmri;primary motor cortex;supplemental motor area proper	Bernard Ng;Rafeef Abugharbieh;Samantha J.

38b49b521b562f5f24213b2f0fe08f3bfe5de52d	double-well dynamics of noise-driven control activation in human intermittent control: the case of stick balancing		When facing a task of balancing a dynamic system near an unstable equilibrium, humans often adopt intermittent control strategy: Instead of continuously controlling the system, they repeatedly switch the control on and off. Paradigmatic example of such a task is stick balancing. Despite the simplicity of the task itself, the complexity of human intermittent control dynamics in stick balancing still puzzles researchers in motor control. Here we attempt to model one of the key mechanisms of human intermittent control, control activation, using as an example the task of overdamped stick balancing. In doing so, we focus on the concept of noise-driven activation, a more general alternative to the conventional threshold-driven activation. We describe control activation as a random walk in an energy potential, which changes in response to the state of the controlled system. By way of numerical simulations, we show that the developed model captures the core properties of human control activation observed previously in the experiments on overdamped stick balancing. Our results demonstrate that the double-well potential model provides tractable mathematical description of human control activation at least in the considered task and suggest that the adopted approach can potentially aid in understanding human intermittent control in more complex processes.	activation function;analog stick;cobham's thesis;control theory;double-well potential;dynamical system;entity name part qualifier - adopted;equilibrium;experiment;mathematics;numerical analysis;pointing stick;simulation;unstable medical device problem	Arkady Zgonnikov;Ihor Lubashevsky	2015	Cognitive Processing	10.1007/s10339-015-0653-5	simulation;communication	Robotics	15.384765260325484	-70.88079777567076	157052

We recorded the resting FMRI signal from 16 patients and 22 controls. We used seed-based functional correlation analyses to calculate partial correlations of all voxels in the hippocampus relative to characteristic regional signal changes in the thalamus, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), while controlling for ventricular CSF and white matter signals. Group comparisons were carried out controlling for age, gender, hippocampal volume and brain volume. The strength of functional connectivity in each region also was correlated with neuropsychological measures. We found that the hippocampus can be segmented into three distinct functional subregions (head, body, and tail), according to the relative connectivity with PFC, PCC and thalamus, respectively. The AD group showed stronger hippocampus-PFC and weaker hippocampus-PCC functional connectivity, the magnitudes of which correlated with MMSE in both cases. The results are consistent with an adaptive role of the PFC in the context of progression of dysfunction in PCC during earlier stages of AD. Extension of our approach could integrate regional volume measures for the hippocampus with their functional connectivity patterns in ways that should increase sensitivity for assessment of AD onset and progression.	alzheimer's disease;brain implant;cfp gene;cfp wt allele;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;color gradient;onset (audio);patients;portable c compiler;powerbuilder foundation classes;prefrontal cortex;resonance;rest;resting state fmri;thalamic structure;voxel;white matter;biologic segmentation	Mojtaba Zarei;Christian F.

Although the clinical effects of DRD4 are the focus of much work, this gene may not necessarily serve as a “risk” gene for attentional deficits, but as a plasticity gene where attention is heightened for priority items in the environment and impaired for minor items. Here we examine the role of DRD4 in two tasks that benefit from selective attention to high-priority information. We examine a category learning task where performance is supported by focusing on features and updating verbal rules. Here, selective attention to the most salient features is associated with good performance. In addition, we examine the Operation Span (OSPAN) task, a working memory capacity task that relies on selective attention to update and maintain items in memory while also performing a secondary task. Long DRD4 carriers show superior performance relative to short DRD4 homozygotes (six or less tandem repeats) in both the category learning and OSPAN tasks. These results suggest that DRD4 may serve as a “plasticity” gene where individuals with the long allele show heightened selective attention to high-priority items in the environment, which can be beneficial in the appropriate context.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;auditory processing disorder;concept learning;drd4 gene;gulf war;homozygote;humans;hyperactive behavior;memory disorders;operation payback;rem sleep behavior disorder;rule (guideline);span and div	Marissa A.

In vitro autoradiography on rat brain slices resulted in a heterogeneous and displaceable binding to mGluR5-rich brain regions. [(18)F]-FDEGPECO showed high stability in rat plasma and brain homogenate as well as in human plasma and microsomes. Good blood-brain barrier passage was predicted from an in vitro transport assay with P-glycoprotein-transfected hMDR1-MDCK cells. In vivo PET imaging on rats revealed specific uptake of radioactivity in the mGluR5-rich brain regions such as hippocampus, striatum and cortex while the cerebellum, a region with low mGluR5-expression, showed negligible uptake. Blockade experiments by co-injection of [(18)F]-FDEGPECO and M-MPEP (6mg/kg), an antagonist for mGluR5, reduced the level of radioactivity in mGluR5-regions to that of the cerebellum, pointing to an effective blockade of specifically bound [(18)F]-FDEGPECO. Postmortem biodistribution studies at 15min p.i. confirmed the distribution pattern observed in PET. HPLC analysis of rat brain extracts indicated that 98.5% and 91% of the total radioactivity were parent compound at 5min and 17min p.i., respectively. Taken together, the high affinity and the high in vivo specificity of [(18)F]-FDEGPECO for mGluR5 in the rat brain as well as the lack of in vivo defluorination make this new [(18)F]-labeled ABP688 derivative a suitable ligand for the preclinical PET imaging of mGluR5. These favorable characteristics warrant further evaluation in humans.	6-methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine;autopsy;autoradiography;blood - brain barrier anatomy;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;experiment;genetic heterogeneity;glutamate receptor;glutamic acid;homogenate;imaging agent;ligands;microsomes;neostriatum;oximes;parathyroid hormone receptor;plasma active;polyethylene terephthalate;processor affinity;radioactivity;receptors, metabotropic glutamate;snap25 wt allele;sensitivity and specificity;tracer;video-in video-out;fluoroethyl-desmethyl-abp688	Cindy A.

This study examines the role of the action observation network (AON) and the mentalising network (MZN) in the perception of rational and irrational actions. Past studies in this area report mixed results, so the present paper uses new stimuli which precisely control motion path, the social form of the actor and the rationality of the action. A cluster in medial prefrontal cortex and a large cluster in the right inferior parietal lobule extending to the temporoparietal junction distinguished observation of irrational from rational actions. Activity within the temporoparietal region also correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with each participant's judgement of action rationality. These findings demonstrate that observation of another person performing an irrational action engages both action observation and mentalising networks. Our results advance current theories of action comprehension and the roles of action observation and mentalising networks in this process.	inference;judgment;lobule;medial graph;motivation;prefrontal cortex;rationality;regional lockout;theory	Lauren E.

Here we argue that cosine tuning minimizes expected errors in force production, which makes it a natural choice for activating muscles and neurons in the final stages of motor processing. Our results are based on the empirically observed scaling of neuromotor noise, whose standard deviation is a linear function of the mean. Such scaling predicts a reduction of net force errors when redundant actuators pull in the same direction. We confirm this prediction by comparing forces produced with one versus two hands and generalize it across directions. Under the resulting neuromotor noise model, we prove that the optimal activation profile is a (possibly truncated) cosinefor arbitrary dimensionality of the workspace, distribution of force directions, correlated or uncorrelated noise, with or without a separate cocontraction command. The model predicts a negative force bias, truncated cosine tuning at low muscle cocontraction levels, and misalignment of preferred directions and lines of action for nonuniform muscle distributions. All predictions are supported by experimental data.	activating function;ephrin type-b receptor 1, human;image scaling;linear function;modified discrete cosine transform;motor neuron disease;muscle;performance tuning;standard deviation;test scaling;tom clancy's net force;white noise;workspace	Emanuel Todorov	2002	Neural Computation	10.1162/089976602753712918	motor control;minimisation;mathematical optimization;constrained optimization;artificial intelligence;discrete cosine transform;motor system;control theory;mathematics;standard deviation;statistics;satisfiability	ML	15.791824726462162	-73.72352776698163	157646

These oscillations originate in the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG) and couple with the respiratory oscillations generated by the interacting neural populations of the Bötzinger (BötC) and pre-Bötzinger (pre-BötC) complexes, representing the kernel of the respiratory central pattern generator. Recently, we analyzed experimental data on the generation of late-E oscillations and proposed a large-scale computational model that simulates the possible interactions between the BötC/pre-BötC and RTN/pFRG oscillations under different conditions. Here we describe a reduced model that maintains the essential features and architecture of the large-scale model, but relies on simplified activity-based descriptions of neural populations. This simplification allowed us to use methods of dynamical systems theory, such as fast-slow decomposition, bifurcation analysis, and phase plane analysis, to elucidate the mechanisms and dynamics of synchronization between the RTN/pFRG and BötC/pre-BötC oscillations. Three physiologically relevant behaviors have been analyzed: emergence and quantal acceleration of late-E oscillations during hypercapnia, transformation of the late-E activity into a biphasic-E activity during hypercapnic hypoxia, and quantal slowing of BötC/pre-BötC oscillations with the reduction of pre-BötC excitability. Each behavior is elicited by gradual changes in excitatory drives or other model parameters, reflecting specific changes in metabolic and/or physiological conditions. Our results provide important theoretical insights into interactions between RTN/pFRG and BötC/pre-BötC oscillations and the role of these interactions in the control of breathing under different metabolic conditions.	bifurcation theory;cell nucleus;central pattern generator;computation;computational model;description;dynamical systems theory;emergence;expiration, function;hypoxia;inspiration function;interaction;intrinsic drive;mammals;metabolic process, cellular;neural oscillation;population;quantum;text simplification	Jonathan E.

In particular, learned rules can quickly be used in new contexts or applied to new stimuli (which confers an advantage over restricting learning to perceptual - motor associations). Here, we propose a new neurocomputational model of automaticity in rule-guided behavior. The proposed model assumes two parallel neural pathways corresponding to “naïve” and “expert” rule use. The development of automaticity is characterized by a transfer of control of rule-guided behavior from a pathway mediated by the prefrontal cortex to a direct parietal - premotor pathway. The model includes differential equations that describe voltage changes in the relevant brain areas and difference equations that describe the Hebbian learning. A simulation shows that the model accounts for some critical single-cell recording data from several key brain areas as well as some important behavioral results.	cognition;gene regulatory network;hebbian theory;logic programming;naivety;recurrence relation;simulation	Sébastien Hélie;F.

While modeling studies could potentially shed light on the critical role played by inhibition in cortical computation, there is a gap between the simplicity of many models of sensory coding and the biological complexity of the inhibitory subpopulation. In particular, many models do not respect that inhibition must be implemented in a separate subpopulation, with those inhibitory interneurons having a diversity of tuning properties and characteristic E/I cell ratios. In this study we demonstrate a computational framework for implementing inhibition in dynamical systems models that better respects these biophysical observations about inhibitory interneurons. The main approach leverages recent work related to decomposing matrices into low-rank and sparse components via convex optimization, and explicitly exploits the fact that models and input statistics often have low-dimensional structure that can be exploited for efficient implementations. While this approach is applicable to a wide range of sensory coding models (including a family of models based on Bayesian inference in a linear generative model), for concreteness we demonstrate the approach on a network implementing sparse coding. We show that the resulting implementation stays faithful to the original coding goals while using inhibitory interneurons that are much more biophysically plausible.	cell signaling;computation (action);convex optimization;dynamical system;generative model;inference;interneurons;low-rank approximation;mathematical optimization;neural coding;sparse matrix;sensory cortex	Mengchen Zhu;Christopher J.

Using a mean-field of technique, we analyzed the equilibrium states of neural networks with dynamic synaptic connections and found a class of bistable networks. For this class of networks, one of the stable equilibrium states shows strong connectivity and coherent responses to external input. In the other stable equilibrium, the network is loosely connected and responds non coherently to external input. Transitions between the two states can be achieved by positively or negatively correlated external inputs. Such networks can therefore switch between their phases according to the statistical properties of the external input. Non-coherent input can only “rcad” the state of the network, while a correlated one can change its state. We speculate that this property, specific for plastic neural networks, can give a clue to understand fully unsupervised learning models.	artificial neural network;bistability;coherence (physics);depressive disorder;kind of quantity - equilibrium;network topology;neural network simulation;neuronal plasticity;synaptic package manager;unsupervised learning;chemosensitization/potentiation	Stiliyan Kalitzin;Bob W. van Dijk;Henk Spekreijse	2000	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s004220000157	synaptic plasticity;unsupervised learning;self-organization;thermodynamic equilibrium;computer science;artificial intelligence;mean field theory;machine learning;communication;artificial neural network	ML	17.99167625883532	-70.46395278521393	158218

Future progress in understanding brain function using these methods will require addressing a number of key methodological and interpretive challenges. Because these challenges often remain unseen and metaphorically """"haunt"""" our efforts to use these methods to understand the brain, we refer to them as """"ghosts"""". In this paper, we describe three such ghosts, situate them within a more general framework from philosophy of science, and then describe steps to address them. The first ghost arises from difficulties in determining what information machine learning classifiers use for decoding. The second ghost arises from the interplay of experimental design and the structure of information in the brain - that is, our methods embody implicit assumptions about information processing in the brain, and it is often difficult to determine if those assumptions are satisfied. The third ghost emerges from our limited ability to distinguish information that is merely decodable from the brain from information that is represented and used by the brain. Each of the three ghosts place limits on the interpretability of decoding research in cognitive neuroscience. There are no easy solutions, but facing these issues squarely will provide a clearer path to understanding the nature of representation and computation in the human brain."""	cognition disorders;cognitive tutor;computation (action);computational neuroscience;design of experiments;ghost;information processing;machine learning;neuroimaging;neuroscience discipline;situated cognition	Thomas A.

1286c5a04ded8646e832664d4a5e1c23aafe8220	prefrontal hemodynamics of physical activity and environmental complexity during cognitive work		OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess performance and cognitive states during cognitive work in the presence of physical work and in natural settings.   BACKGROUND Authors of previous studies have examined the interaction between cognitive and physical work, finding performance decrements in working memory. Neuroimaging has revealed increases and decreases in prefrontal oxygenated hemoglobin during the interaction of cognitive and physical work. The effect of environment on cognitive-physical dual tasking has not been previously considered.   METHOD Thirteen participants were monitored with wireless functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as they performed an auditory 1-back task while sitting, walking indoors, and walking outdoors.   RESULTS Relative to sitting and walking indoors, auditory working memory performance declined when participants were walking outdoors. Sitting during the auditory 1-back task increased oxygenated hemoglobin and decreased deoxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral prefrontal cortex. Walking reduced the total hemoglobin available to bilateral prefrontal cortex. An increase in environmental complexity reduced oxygenated hemoglobin and increased deoxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral prefrontal cortex.   CONCLUSION Wireless fNIRS is capable of monitoring cognitive states in naturalistic environments. Selective attention and physical work compete with executive processing. During executive processing loading of selective attention and physical work results in deactivation of bilateral prefrontal cortex and degraded working memory performance, indicating that physical work and concomitant selective attention may supersede executive processing in the distribution of mental resources.   APPLICATION This research informs decision-making procedures in work where working memory, physical activity, and attention interact. Where working memory is paramount, precautions should be taken to eliminate competition from physical work and selective attention.		Ryan McKendrick;Ranjana K. Mehta;Hasan Ayaz;Melissa R.

The analysis found that canonical variates (patterns of cortical thickness) correlated with each of these variables. The diagnosis- and age-by-diagnosis-related canonical variates showed thinner cortex for participants with ASD, which is consistent with previous studies using a univariate analysis. In addition, the multivariate statistics found larger affected regions with higher sensitivity than those found using univariate analysis. An IQ-related effect was also found with the multivariate analysis. The effects of IQ and age-by-IQ interaction on cortical thickness differed between the diagnostic groups. For typically developing adolescents, IQ was positively correlated with cortical thickness in orbitofrontal, postcentral and superior temporal regions, and greater thinning with age was seen in dorsal frontal areas in the superior IQ (>120) group. These associations between IQ and cortical thickness were not seen in the ASD group. Differing relationships between IQ and cortical thickness implies independent associations between measures of intelligence and brain structure in ASD versus typically developing controls. We discuss these findings vis-à-vis prior results obtained utilizing univariate methods.	adolescent (age group);autism spectrum disorders;autistic disorder;brain;cortical implant;dyskinesia, drug-induced;finite thickness;full scale;generalization (psychology);intellectual disability;interaction;large;mental association;temporal lobe;thickness (graph theory);thinning;visual instruction set	Masaya Misaki;Gregory L.

Recently, using a metric for analyzing local variation of interspike intervals, researchers have found that individual neurons express specific patterns in generating spikes, which may symbolically be termed regular, random, or bursty, rather invariantly in time. In order to study the dynamics of firing patterns in greater detail, we propose here a Bayesian method for estimating firing irregularity and the firing rate simultaneously for a given spike sequence, and we implement an algorithm that may render the empirical Bayesian estimation practicable for data comprising a large number of spikes. Application of this method to electrophysiological data revealed a subtle correlation between the degree of firing irregularity and the firing rate for individual neurons. Irregularity of firing did not deviate greatly around the low degree of dependence on the firing rate and remained practically unchanged for individual neurons in the cortical areas V1 and MT, whereas it fluctuated greatly in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. This indicates the presence and absence of autocontrolling mechanisms for maintaining patterns of firing in the cortex and thalamus, respectively.	bayesian network;cell nucleus;cultured neuronal network;estimated;geniculate body structure;instantaneous phase;lateral thinking;master of theology;thalamic structure;video-in video-out;algorithm;lateral geniculate complex	Takeaki Shimokawa;Shigeru Shinomoto	2009	Neural Computation	10.1162/neco.2009.08-08-841	econometrics;dynamics;law of large numbers;metric;bayesian probability;computer science;artificial intelligence;mathematics;implementation;correlation;artificial neural network;electric generator;statistics;models of neural computation	ML	21.12154731526823	-71.50701560186334	159120

A young barn owl can adapt to imposed environmental changes, such as artificial visual distortion caused by wearing a prism. This adjustment process has been modeled mathematically and the model replicates the sensory map realignment of barn owl superior colliculus (SC) through axonogenesis and synaptogenesis. This allows the biological mechanism to be transferred to an artificial computing system and thereby imbue it with a new form of adaptability to the environment. The model is demonstrated in a real-time robot environment. Results of the experiments are compared with and without prism distortion of vision, and show improved adaptability for the robot. However, the computation speed of the embedded system in the robot is slow. A digital and analog mixed signal very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuit has been fabricated to implement adaptive sensory pathway changes derived from the SC model at higher speed. VLSI experimental results are consistent with simulation results.	acclimatization;adaptability;analog;artificial intelligence;artificial neural network;axon;biological neural networks;british informatics olympiad;computation (action);computational model;computer program;computer software;corpora quadrigemina, superior colliculus;distortion;embedded system;embedding;escuela superior latinoamericana de informática;experiment;gene regulatory network;inferior colliculus;inspiration function;map;midbrain structure;mixed-signal integrated circuit;neural network simulation;neuromorphic engineering;pervasive informatics;real-time clock;real-time transcription;robot;robot (device);silicon;simulation;strigiformes;very-large-scale integration;axonogenesis;synaptogenesis	Juan Huo;Alan F.

A renormalized density in phase space and a renormalized differential density were defined and substituted for the Lerner density, which we used previously. Fluctuations in electropathophysiological activity, consisting of periods of high activity recorded from both depth and scalp electrodes in six presurgical patients, were characterized on different time scales. Extension in space of the fluctuations was characterized by observing their synchronous occurrence in different areas of the brain. By simultaneously establishing the fluctuations’ criticality, we were observing “synchronous instabilities”. Criticality followed from characterizing the time course of the synchronously arising fluctuations, when approaching seizure onset (i) by their slowing, for the longer-lasting ones (up to about 2 min), and (ii) by their increase in rate of production, for those of shorter duration (up to 20–30 s). Critical behavior may be displayed in favorable cases over more than 1 h prior to seizure onset. Other effects are also described that in some cases may interfere with the simple time course of fluctuations and must be given further consideration, particularly with a view to application to seizure anticipation. Because periods of high activity are involved, any marker of increased electropathophysiological activity in the brain may, in principle, play the role of an order parameter or of an approximate order parameter, e.g., a signal’s root-mean-square amplitude, or its excess energy content. Such markers may be put to use for the fluctuations they display or merely for their average time evolution prior to seizure onset. We compared the time evolution, prior to onset, of the excess production rate of synchronies and of the signals’ excess energy content, both averaged over signal sections of a chosen duration. In view of potential noninvasive applications, those scalp electrodes showing effects similar to the observations we made at the epileptogenic focus were identified, and the time course of their order parameters prior to seizure onset was analyzed.	anticipation (artificial intelligence);approximation algorithm;complex systems;electroencephalography;epilepsy;in-phase and quadrature components;maxima and minima;offset binary;onset (audio);patients;population parameter;seizures;self-organization;self-organized criticality;electrode	Roger Cerf;El Hassan El Ouasdad;Philippe Kahane	2004	Biological Cybernetics	10.1007/s00422-004-0463-9	psychology;complex systems;neuroscience;self-organization;developmental psychology;root mean square;nonlinear system;electrode;artificial intelligence;phase space;brain mapping;communication;physics;quantum mechanics	ML	18.976423294323304	-73.8889066247732	159404

The description is based on the spike-response model and includes three different time constants: the passive membrane time constant, a recovery time of the input conductance after each spike, and a time constant of the spike afterpotential. The effect of stochastic background input on the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) response to spike input is calculated analytically. Model results are compared with the experimental data of Poliakov et al. (1996). The linearized theory shows that the PSTH response to an input spike is proportional to a filtered version of the postsynaptic potential generated by the input spike. The shape of the filter depends on the background activity. The full nonlinear theory is in close agreement with simulated PSTH data.	acclimatization;appendix;biological neuron model;cell body of neuron;conductance (graph);dendrites;equivalent weight;experiment;input impedance;ionic;motor neurons;noise (electronics);nonlinear system;population dynamics;quantum fluctuation;the spike (1997);tissue membrane;word lists by frequency	Alix Herrmann;Wulfram Gerstner	2002	Journal of Computational Neuroscience	10.1023/A:1015739523224	simulation;computer science;machine learning;time constant	ML	19.519843783038844	-72.44904479913966	159554

Specifically, 32 healthy subjects (16 females) interacted with a haptic device able to convey caress-like stimuli while varying force and velocity of the device itself. More specifically, 2 values of force (i.e., “strength of the caress”) and 3 velocity levels (i.e. “velocity of the caress”) were combined to control the device during the experiment. Subjects were also asked to self-assess the haptic stimuli in terms of arousal (activation/ deactivation) and valence (pleasure/displeasure) scores. Results, shown in terms of p-values topographic maps, revealed a suppression of the oscillations over the controlateral somatosensory cortex, during caresses performed with the lowest force (2N) and the highest velocity (65 mm/s). This occurred in all of the frequency bands considered, α, β, and γ. Lower velocities (9.4 mm/s and 37 mm/s) did not significantly modify EEG reactivity in such bands. Concerning caresses administered at high force (6N), there was a significant decrease of EEG oscillatory activity focused on mid-frontal electrodes, in all of the considered frequency bands, when the velocity of the caresses was the lowest one. Significant sparse decrease of EEG power spectra, in all of the considered frequency bands, occurred at higher strength and velocity of the caress.	arousal;bands;electroencephalography;frequency band;haptic device component;haptic technology;map;millimeter per second;somatosensory cortex;sparse matrix;topography;velocity (software development);zero suppression;electrode	Gaetano Valenza;Alberto Greco;Mimma Nardelli;Matteo Bianchi;Antonio Lanata;Simone Rossi;Enzo Pasquale Scilingo	2015	2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319451	psychology;text mining;neuroscience;medical research;computer science;artificial intelligence;communication	Robotics	17.244486882971042	-79.87753936686302	159582

This hypothesis was tested in 115 physical science students and 155 social science students from a university in the Netherlands. The students completed visuospatial tests and the systemizing quotient-revised (SQ-R) as measures for systemizing, and a Cartoon Prediction test and the empathy quotient (EQ) as measures for empathizing. Independent of sex, the physical science students scored significantly lower than social science students on EQ (with large effect size) and ‘brain type’ that represents the standardized difference score between EQ and SQ-R (with large effect size). Physical science students, furthermore, scored significantly higher on the Cartoon Prediction task and one of the visuospatial tasks; however, these effects were only small of size. Unlike the scores on the SQ-R and the performance tests, the ‘brain type’ score of the EQ and SQ-R questionnaires was a good predictor of entry into social or physical sciences. Interestingly, the typical sex differences in more empathizing and less systemizing in females compared to males were only small for EQ and ‘brain type’, and absent for the SQ-R and the performance tests. This study only partially confirms the E–S theory, because typical sex differences were only minor in this selective sample and only the self-report measures predicted academic area in the absence of a role for sex.	amendment;cognition disorders;declaration (computer programming);difference quotient;empathy;futures studies;health services;helsinki declaration;kerrison predictor;microtrauma, physical;physical sciences;relational operator;revision procedure;science;score;sex characteristics;social sciences;sound quality;spatial–temporal reasoning;standards characteristics	Yvonne Groen;A.

For neural systems, scientists have studied this problem under the paradigm of feedforward networks for decades. In most models of feedforward networks, activity is exclusively driven by excitatory neurons and the wiring patterns between them, while inhibitory neurons play only a stabilizing role for the network dynamics. Motivated by recent experimental discoveries of hippocampal circuitry, cortical circuitry, and the diversity of inhibitory neurons throughout the brain, here we illustrate that one can construct such networks even if the connectivity between the excitatory units in the system remains random. This is achieved by endowing inhibitory nodes with a more active role in the network. Our findings demonstrate that apparent feedforward activity can be caused by a much broader network-architectural basis than often assumed.	anatomic node;architecture as topic;assumed;biological system;electronic circuit;feed forward (control);feedforward neural network;interaction;neurons;programming paradigm;wiring	Yazan N.

An understudied question is how far results are influenced by interindividual differences in central nervous arousal as assessed with electroencephalogram (EEG-vigilance) during the PET recording. Building upon previous neuroimaging studies, we supposed an association between EEG-vigilance and normalized brain [(18)F]FDG-uptake (nFDGu) as measured by [(18)F]FDG-PET. For the first time, the present study exploratively investigated this association in a routine diagnostic work-up.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Simultaneous 31-channel EEG and [(18)F]FDG-PET under resting conditions were acquired from 14 patients with depressive episode or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). EEG-vigilance was automatically classified by using the VIGALL algorithm (Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig). A nonparametric voxelwise simple linear regression with vigilance measure as predictor and nFDGu as criterion was performed using the Statistical nonParametric Mapping toolbox.   RESULTS The main finding was a significant negative correlation between vigilance measure and nFDGu in bilateral frontal and temporal regions, bilateral cingulate gyrus and right thalamus with vigilance-related changes of nFDGu between 17.1 and 44.4%.   DISCUSSION Simultaneous EEG and [(18)F]FDG-PET under resting conditions revealed that brain regions associated with EEG-vigilance partly overlapped with regions of impaired nFDGu in depression and MCI, as reported by previous studies. Vigilance-related changes of nFDGu were about the same magnitude as disease-related metabolic changes in patients with affective disorder or memory impairment as reported in previous studies. Therefore, our data suggest that differences in EEG-vigilance might influence alterations of nFDGu in disorders such as depression or MCI. Whether this possible impact of vigilance on nFDGu should be taken into account during the routine diagnostic application of [(18)F]FDG-PET has to be explored in future studies with larger patient groups.	arousal;auditory processing disorder;bilateral filter;brain neoplasms;c little e ag:prthr:pt:rbc^donor:ord;childhood cerebral astrocytoma;classification;cognition disorders;correction of hearing impairment;depressive disorder;electroencephalography;fluorodeoxyglucose f18;futures studies;gyrus cinguli;kerrison predictor;large;memory disorders;metabolic process, cellular;mild cognitive disorder;mood disorders;neuroimaging;patients;polyethylene terephthalate;positron-emission tomography;positrons;prospective search;rest;snap25 wt allele;switch statement;temporal lobe;thalamic structure;algorithm;glucose metabolism;glucose uptake;nervous system disorder;work up	Thomas Günther;Peter Schönknecht;Georg A.

5bcba8f110d1f5262be60eaed11f31a949199d3c	a brief review on the history of human functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs) development and fields of application	hemodynamic response;cortical activation;functional near infrared spectroscopy;functional near infrared topography;optical imaging	This review is aimed at celebrating the upcoming 20th anniversary of the birth of human functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). After the discovery in 1992 that the functional activation of the human cerebral cortex (due to oxygenation and hemodynamic changes) can be explored by NIRS, human functional brain mapping research has gained a new dimension. fNIRS or optical topography, or near-infrared imaging or diffuse optical imaging is used mainly to detect simultaneous changes in optical properties of the human cortex from multiple measurement sites and displays the results in the form of a map or image over a specific area. In order to place current fNIRS research in its proper context, this paper presents a brief historical overview of the events that have shaped the present status of fNIRS. In particular, technological progresses of fNIRS are highlighted (i.e., from single-site to multi-site functional cortical measurements (images)), introduction of the commercial multi-channel systems, recent commercial wireless instrumentation and more advanced prototypes.	brain mapping;cell respiration;cerebral cortex;diffuse optical imaging;gain;hemodynamics;instrument - device;magnetic resonance imaging;numerous;spectroscopy, near-infrared;topography	Marco Ferrari;Valentina Quaresima	2012	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.03.049	psychology;computer vision;neuroscience;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;optical imaging;haemodynamic response	HCI	21.902421861936997	-80.20837608259102	159784

How this mechanism operates and what factors influence a decision to act or not act remain relatively unexplored. We used EEG readiness potentials (RPs) to examine preparatory activity before each action of an ongoing sequence, in which one action was occasionally omitted. We compared RPs between sequences in which omissions were instructed by a rule (e.g., “omit every fourth action”) and sequences in which the participant themselves freely decided which action to omit. RP amplitude was reduced for actions that immediately preceded a voluntary omission but not a rule-based omission. We also used the regular temporal pattern of the action sequences to explore brain processes linked to omitting an action by time-locking EEG averages to the inferred time when an action would have occurred had it not been omitted. When omissions were instructed by a rule, there was a negative-going trend in the EEG, recalling the rising ramp of an RP. No such component was found for voluntary omissions. The results are consistent with a model in which spontaneously fluctuating activity in motor areas of the brain could bias “free” decisions to act or not.	bloc1s3 gene;bereitschaftspotential;electroencephalography;inference;lock (computer science);logic programming;mental recall;motor cortex;ramp simulation software for modelling reliability, availability and maintainability;rp (complexity)	Erman Misirlisoy;Patrick Haggard	2014	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00479	psychology;neuroscience;suicide prevention;human factors and ergonomics;injury prevention	ML	16.07219952008275	-78.42888937433715	159821
29bf90c4c24284fa8d4ad7130abfc8cbe629bfab	interaction among ocularity, retinotopy and on-center/off-center pathways		The development of projections from the retinas to the cortex is mathematically analyzed according to the previously proposed thermodynamic formulation of the self-organization of neural networks. Three types of submodality included in the visual afferent pathways are assumed in two models: model (A), in which the ocularity and retinotopy are considered separately, and model (B), in which on-center/off-center pathways are considered in addition to ocularity and retinotopy. Model (A) shows striped ocular dominance spatial patterns and, in ocular dominance histograms, reveals a dip in the binocular bin. Model (B) displays spatially modulated irregular patterns and shows single-peak behavior in the histograms. When we compare the simulated results with the observed results, it is evident that the ocular dominance spatial patterns and histograms for models (A) and (B) agree very closely with those seen in monkeys and cats.	artificial neural network;binocular vision;emoticon;experiment;gene regulatory network;modulation;self-organization;terminate (software)	Shigeru Tanaka	1990			machine learning;artificial intelligence;computer science;retinotopy	ML	19.192956848034544	-71.61626592885237	160095

In this paper, we present a class of memristor-based neural circuits comprising leaky integrate-and-fire (I & F) neurons and memristor-based learning synapses. Employing these neuron circuits and corresponding SPICE models, the properties of a two neurons network are shown to be similar to biology. During correlated spiking of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons, the strength of the synaptic connection increases. Conversely, it is diminished when the spiking is uncorrelated. This synaptic plasticity and associative learning is essential for performing useful computation and adaptation in large scale artificial neural networks. Finally, future circuit design and consideration are discussed with the memristor-based neural networks.	artificial neural network;biological neuron model;circuit design;computation;conductance (graph);memristor;modulation;spice;synapse;synaptic package manager	Shiping Wen;Zhigang Zeng;Tingwen Huang	2012	Neural Processing Letters	10.1007/s11063-012-9263-8	winner-take-all;synaptic weight;memristor;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;physical neural network;artificial neural network;spiking neural network	ML	19.02594832261355	-69.89264265502946	160430

Studies on the spike volley (a pulse packet) propagating through a homogeneous feedforward network have demonstrated its capability of generating spike patterns with millisecond fidelity. This model is called the synfire chain and suggests a possible mechanism for generating repeated spike patterns (RSPs). The propagation speed of the pulse packet determines the temporal property of RSPs. However, the relationship between propagation speed and network structure is not well understood. We studied a feedforward network with Mexican-hat connectivity by using the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model and analyzed the network dynamics with the Fokker-Planck equation. We examined the effect of the spatial pattern of pulse packets on RSPs in the network with multistability. Pulse packets can take spatially uniform or localized shapes in a multistable regime, and they propagate with different speeds. These distinct pulse packets generate RSPs with different timescales, but the order of spikes and the ratios between interspike intervals are preserved. This result indicates that the RSPs can be transformed into the same template pattern through the expanding or contracting operation of the timescale.	biologic preservation;biological neuron model;clinical use template;contract agreement;design pattern;feedforward neural network;greater than;in vitro [publication type];mexican hat wavelet;network packet;perseveration;software propagation;spatiotemporal pattern;template method pattern;the spike (1997);video-in video-out;volley theory	Kosuke Hamaguchi;Masato Okada;Kazuyuki Aihara	2007	Neural Computation	10.1162/neco.2007.19.9.2468	template;common spatial pattern;simulation;computer science;convection–diffusion equation;artificial intelligence;connectivity;network dynamics;machine learning;fokker–planck equation;mathematics;feed forward;artificial neural network;models of neural computation	ML	17.458994969755395	-71.14508983715837	160458

We manipulated the coherence of randomly moving dots to create different levels of 3D perception and investigated the associated changes in brain activity. Results of the fMRI analysis were used to impose plausible constraints on the MEG inverse calculation to improve spatial resolution of the spatiotemporal activity estimates. Time-frequency analysis was also employed to elucidate spatiotemporal dynamic changes in the spontaneous brain activities. MEG-fMRI combined analysis showed that the activities the posterior infero-temporal (pIT), parieto-occipital (PO), and intra-parietal (IP) regions were increased at different latencies during highly coherent motion conditions in which subjects perceived a robust 3D object. Results of the time-frequency analysis indicated the suppression of alpha- and beta-band activities in these regions which reflect the commitment of these areas in the perception of 3D-SFM. Current results suggest that the interactions between the dorsal and ventral visual subsystems are crucial for the perception of 3D object from 2D optic flow.	brownian motion;coherence (physics);dna integration;electroencephalography;epilepsy, temporal lobe;estimated;frequency analysis;image processing;information processing;interaction;intra-frame coding;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetoencephalography;nevus sebaceous;occipital lobe;optic flow;outline of object recognition;parietal lobe;perception;randomness;scanning probe microscopes (device);spontaneous order;time–frequency analysis;zero suppression;fmri	Sunao Iwaki;Giorgio Bonmassar;John W.

d0b096df8dcf5da1c12fffd1891f8c9f69fa3a9e	learning and development of embodied numerosity		Recent empirical evidence indicates that seemingly abstract numerical cognitions are rooted in sensory and bodily experiences. In particular in finger counting finger-based representations reflect a specific case of embodied cognition, we termed embodied numerosity. Furthermore, we suggest that finger-based representations should be considered a distinct representation of number (magnitude) and argue that this representation is activated automatically whenever we encounter a number. We discuss in what way such a theoretical framework can account for the associations of fingers and numbers observed so far. In the final part, we evaluate whether the concept of embodied numerosity should be generalized beyond finger-based representations with particular focus on whether bodily-sensory experiences (such as moving the whole body along the mental number line) may corroborate numerical capabilities. In a series of intervention studies, we consistently observed more pronounced training effects for our embodied numerosity trainings for different age groups, different digital media, different number ranges, and different control conditions. Taken together, we conclude that embodied representations of number (magnitude) exist, are not limited to finger-based representations, and influence number processing in a systematic and functional way that can be used to foster the efficiency of numerical trainings.	digit structure;digital media;embodied cognition;experience;mental association;movement;numerical analysis	Korbinian Moeller;Ursula Fischer;Tanja Link;Mirjam Wasner;Stefan Huber;Ulrike Cress;Hans-Christoph Nuerk	2012	Cognitive Processing	10.1007/s10339-012-0457-9	psychology;cognitive psychology;developmental psychology;numerosity adaptation effect;communication;social psychology	HCI	15.069997327553672	-77.27685083906898	160563
8435f76c34995499690f37d546bb61638e029c7d	cortical functional reorganization in response to intact forelimb stimulation from acute to chronic stage in rodent amputation model		Brain plasticity after amputation is related to the short-term unmasking of latent synapses as well as the long-term reorganization due to the sprouting new synaptic connections. The cortical functional reorganization has been reported along the intact somatosensory pathway after unilateral deafferentation. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) change serves as an important biomarker of the functional reorganization of brain. Using laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) technology, we performed a longitudinal study to unveil the cortical functional reorganization after forelimb amputation in rodent model, particularly along the intact somatosensory pathway. Our results showed that the CBF response to electrical stimulation of the intact forepaw increased significantly at 9 hours after amputation in acute stage. While in chronic stage (>14 days), the CBF response showed a pattern similar to the control group. The results showed the dynamic brain functional response along the intact somatosensory pathway at different stages after amputation and indicated that cortical functional reorganization occurred within the acute stage. Our work provided additional insights in understanding the inter-hemispheric functional changes from acute to chronic stages of amputation.	amputation;biological markers;deafferentation procedure;electric stimulation technique;functional electrical stimulation;functional response;gene regulatory network;laser speckle imaging;synapses;synaptic package manager;upper extremity	Yuanqi Li;Yao Li;Daryl Omire-Mayor;Bin Bo;Hangdao Li;Shanbao Tong	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512218	forelimb;computer vision;synapse;cerebral blood flow;neuroscience;functional response;amputation;artificial intelligence;hemodynamics;neuroplasticity;computer science;stimulation	Visualization	19.435074456987152	-79.6900115562405	160712

Despite the fact that a number of algorithms have been suggested to increase the accuracy of microarray gene expression data, it is necessary to obtain reliable microarray images by improving wet-lab experiments. As the first step of a cDNA microarray experiment, spotting cDNA probes is critical to determining the quality of spot images. We developed a governing equation of cDNA deposition during evaporation of a drop in the microarray spotting process. The governing equation included four parameters: the surface site density on the support, the extrapolated equilibrium constant for the binding of cDNA molecules with surface sites on glass slides, the macromolecular interaction factor, and the volume constant of a drop of cDNA solution. We simulated cDNA deposition from the single model equation by varying the value of the parameters. The morphology of the resulting cDNA deposit can be classified into three types: a doughnut shape, a peak shape, and a volcano shape. The spot morphology can be changed into a flat shape by varying the experimental conditions while considering the parameters of the governing equation of cDNA deposition. The four parameters were estimated by fitting the governing equation to the real microarray images. With the results of the simulation and the parameter estimation, the phenomenon of the formation of cDNA deposits in each type was investigated. This study explains how various spot shapes can exist and suggests which parameters are to be adjusted for obtaining a good spot. This system is able to explore the cDNA microarray spotting process in a predictable, manageable and descriptive manner. We hope it can provide a way to predict the incidents that can occur during a real cDNA microarray experiment, and produce useful data for several research applications involving cDNA microarrays.	algorithm;chemical vapor deposition;dna microarray;dna, complementary;description;equilibrium;estimation theory;evaporation;exanthema;experiment;extrapolation;galaxy morphological classification;gene expression;gene regulatory network;mathematical model;mathematical morphology;metrorrhagia;physical vapor deposition;population parameter;simulation;slide (glass microscope);volcano	Hye Young Kim;Seo Eun Lee;Min Jung Kim;Jin Il Han;Bo Kyung Kim;Yong-Sung Lee;Young Seek Lee;Jin Hyuk Kim	2007	BMC Bioinformatics	10.1186/1471-2105-8-485	computer simulation;biology;gene regulatory network;molecular biology;microfluidics;dna microarray;computer science;bioinformatics;mathematical model;equilibrium constant;estimation theory;microarray databases;genetics	Vision	10.297663051086339	-66.86330917598775	160846

While preclinical experiments suggest that adolescent-onset exposure to ADHD medication is an important factor in the development of substance use disorder (SUD) phenotypes in adulthood, the long-term impact of ADHD medication initiated during adolescence has been largely unexplored in humans. Our analysis of 11,624 adolescent ADHD patients in the Truven database indicates that temporal medication features are the important factors on the health consequences related to SUD and ADHD medication initiation during adolescence.	auditory processing disorder;experiment;onset (audio)	Sajjad Fouladvand;Emily R.

e1d4b52ddf94afc90c10216552a2d556d0314056	learning stage-dependent effect of m1 disruption on value-based motor decisions		The present study aimed at characterizing the impact of M1 disruption on the implementation of implicit value information in motor decisions, at both early stages (during reinforcement learning) and late stages (after consolidation) of action value encoding. Fifty subjects performed, over three consecutive days, a task that required them to select between two finger responses according to the color (instruction) and to the shape (implicit, undisclosed rule) of an imperative signal: considering the implicit rule in addition to the instruction allowed subjects to earn more money. We investigated the functional contribution of M1 to the implementation of the implicit rule in subjects' motor decisions. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) was applied over M1 either on Day 1 or on Day 3, producing a temporary lesion either during reinforcement learning (cTBSLearning group) or after consolidation of the implicit rule, during decision-making (cTBSDecision group), respectively. Interestingly, disrupting M1 activity on Day 1 improved the reliance on the implicit rule, plausibly because M1 cTBS increased dopamine release in the putamen in an indirect way. This finding corroborates the view that cTBS may affect activity in unstimulated areas, such as the basal ganglia. Notably, this effect was short-lasting; it did not persist overnight, suggesting that the functional integrity of M1 during learning is a prerequisite for the consolidation of implicit value information to occur. Besides, cTBS over M1 did not impact the use of the implicit rule when applied on Day 3, although it did so when applied on Day 2 in a recent study where the reliance on the implicit rule declined following cTBS (Derosiere et al., 2017). Overall, these findings indicate that the human M1 is functionally involved in the consolidation and implementation of implicit value information underlying motor decisions. However, M1 contribution seems to vanish as subjects become more experienced in using the implicit value information to make their motor decisions.	basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;decision making;denial-of-service attack;dopamine;imperative programming;lung consolidation;reinforcement learning;rule 90;semiconductor consolidation;transcranial magnetic stimulation	Gérard Derosière;Pierre Vassiliadis;Sophie Demaret;Alexandre Zénon;Julie Duque	2017	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.08.075	developmental psychology;psychology;cognitive psychology;basal ganglia;putamen;encoding (memory);reinforcement learning;stimulation;ctbs	HCI	17.363511519249908	-78.71801338869896	161379

By introducing the concept of equivalent quantities a simulation of various physiological phenomena is possible. This includes the steady state as well as various complex transient phenomena. This paper describes the use of an equivalent electronic circuit in simulating the cardiovascular system. It allows a stepwise upgrading. The first step is a one-ventricle circuit similar to the Starling heart-lung preparation. The final step is an equivalent circuit allowing simulation of various normal as well as pathological states (e.g. effects of heart rate, negative intrathoracic pressure, exercise, hemorrhage, heart failure, and hypertension). The degree of disturbance can be set by adjusting the value of single components. Following this, the optimal type of compensation (e.g. the increase in blood volume in failure of the right ventricle; systemic venoconstriction in failure of the left ventricle) of the basic disturbance can be searched for, activated and the consequences studied. The described approach has been found a useful tool in teaching physiology and pathophysiology for postgraduate medical students.	cardiovascular diseases;electronic circuit;equivalent circuit;heart ventricle;heart failure;hemorrhage;hypertensive disease;left ventricular structure;physiological phenomena;quantity;right ventricular structure;simulation;starling;steady state;stepwise regression;structure of parenchyma of lung;physiological aspects	Marjan Rupnik;Franc Runovc;D.

5c9c25e8b4f1e63f2787799921eff2942c21b9e4	resting eeg features and their application in depressive disorders		This research is aimed to analysis the resting EEG features in depression and the application in clinic. Sixteen patients with depression and sixteen healthy controls were involved in this study. Both features from the alpha and beta frequency bands were selected to analysis in this study. First the features' sensitivity to the group-difference and the correlation to the clinical HAMD scale score were analyzed, and then the classification method was used to further test the role of the resting EEG features in depression. The results showed that the difference between depression and healthy controls in the absolute power of beta band in the left prefrontal lobe was significant. And the alpha left-right asymmetry in the prefrontal cortex had a correlation with HAMD scale score. In addition, the classification based on the features showed that there was a relative higher accuracy rate to identify the depressions than to identify the healthy controls. Specifically, the classification based on alpha asymmetry was higher than that based on beta asymmetry, and the absolute power in beta band was higher than that in alpha band. Alpha asymmetry is a traditional sensitive resting EEG features for depression, this study provide new evidence to support the view. The findings here further suggest that absolute power in beta band would be important biomarker in depression.

The model consists of three layers of pulse-coupled leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. Features are encoded by the location of sustained activity in the subordinate layers. The feature layers are excitatorily coupled to a superordinate layer that represents combinations of features by means of an oscillatory dynamics (cf. [1]). The model accounts for effects such as the memorization of an object that was perceived only for a short period, illusory binding of simultaneous stimuli, and the limit of attentional capacity. We discuss conditions for localized excitations in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons and considers the application to a dynamic link architecture.	biological neuron model;layers (digital image editing);neural binding	Hecke Schrobsdorff;J.

09c914400dd6628a2971b6134523f3b3cedddb2e	developmental trajectory of face processing revealed by integrative dynamics		Given their unique connectivity, a primary function of brain networks must be to transfer and integrate information. Therefore, the way in which information is integrated by individual nodes of the network may be an informative aspect of cognitive processing. Here we present a method inspired by telecommunications research that utilizes time–frequency fluctuations of neural activity to infer how information is integrated by individual nodes of the network. We use a queueing theoretical model to interpret empirical data in terms of information processing and integration. In particular, we demonstrate, in participants aged from 6 to 41 years, that the well-known face inversion phenomenon may be explained in terms of information integration. Our model suggests that inverted faces may be associated with shorter and more frequent neural integrative stages, indicating fractured processing and consistent with the notion that inverted faces are perceived by parts. Conversely, our model suggests that upright faces may be associated with a smaller number of sustained episodes of integration, indicating more involved processing, akin to holistic and configural processing. These differences in how upright and inverted faces are processed became more pronounced during development, indicating a gradual specialization for face perception. These effects were robustly expressed in the right fusiform gyrus (all groups), as well as right parahippocampal gyrus (children and adolescents only) and left inferior temporal cortex (adults only).	acute erythroblastic leukemia;adolescent (age group);cognition;email;entity handling - upright;face perception;fracture;holism;inference;information processing;inspiration function;inversion of nipple (disorder);lateral occipitotemporal gyrus;maxima and minima;maximum;mental processes;parahippocampal gyrus;partial template specialization;robustness (computer science);scaleogram;small;stochastic processes;stochastic process;temporal lobe;theory;whole earth 'lectronic link	Bratislav Misic;Travis Mills;Vasily A.

As a first step to explore this complex neural system and focus on the effects of the feedback on the bursting behavior, a simple loop structure delayed in time and scaled by a coupling strength is added to a recent mean-field model of bursting neurons. Depending on the coupling strength and delay time, the modeled neurons show two distinct response patterns: one entrained to the unperturbed bursting frequency of the neurons and one entrained to the resonant frequency of the loop structure. Transitions between these two patterns are explored in the model’s parameter space via extensive numerical simulations. It is found that at a fixed loop delay, there is a critical coupling strength at which the dominant response frequency switches from the unperturbed bursting frequency to the loop-induced one. Furthermore, alternating occurrence of these two response frequencies is observed when the delay varies at fixed coupling strength. The results demonstrate that bursting is coupled with feedback to yield new dynamics, which will provide insights into such effects in more complex neural systems.	artificial neuron;behavior;coupling constant;feedback;genesis;modulation;network switch;numerical analysis;population parameter;resonance;simulation;switch device component;thalamic structure	Hui-Ying Wu;Peter A.

18438fb8e5d968a3a2e608398782af67aef42ef8	transcranial direct current stimulation targeting primary motor versus dorsolateral prefrontal cortices: proof-of-concept study investigating functional connectivity of thalamocortical networks specific to sensory-affective information processing	motor cortex;functional connectivity;resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging r fmri;pain;thalamus	The pain matrix is comprised of an extensive network of brain structures involved in sensory and/or affective information processing. The thalamus is a key structure constituting the pain matrix. The thalamus serves as a relay center receiving information from multiple ascending pathways and relating information to and from multiple cortical areas. However, it is unknown how thalamocortical networks specific to sensory-affective information processing are functionally integrated. Here, in a proof-of-concept study in healthy humans, we aimed to understand this connectivity using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting primary motor (M1) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). We compared changes in functional connectivity (FC) with DLPFC tDCS to changes in FC with M1 tDCS. FC changes were also compared to further investigate its relation with individual's baseline experience of pain. We hypothesized that resting-state FC would change based on tDCS location and would represent known thalamocortical networks. Ten right-handed individuals received a single application of anodal tDCS (1 mA, 20 min) to right M1 and DLPFC in a single-blind, sham-controlled crossover study. FC changes were studied between ventroposterolateral (VPL), the sensory nucleus of thalamus, and cortical areas involved in sensory information processing and between medial dorsal (MD), the affective nucleus, and cortical areas involved in affective information processing. Individual's perception of pain at baseline was assessed using cutaneous heat pain stimuli. We found that anodal M1 tDCS and anodal DLPFC tDCS both increased FC between VPL and sensorimotor cortices, although FC effects were greater with M1 tDCS. Similarly, anodal M1 tDCS and anodal DLPFC tDCS both increased FC between MD and motor cortices, but only DLPFC tDCS modulated FC between MD and affective cortices, like DLPFC. Our findings suggest that M1 stimulation primarily modulates FC of sensory networks, whereas DLPFC stimulation modulates FC of both sensory and affective networks. Our findings when replicated in a larger group of individuals could provide useful evidence that may inform future studies on pain to differentiate between effects of M1 and DLPFC stimulation. Notably, our finding that individuals with high baseline pain thresholds experience greater FC changes with DLPFC tDCS implies the role of DLPFC in pain modulation, particularly pain tolerance.

1af83f967756d142b429af07c0850d77fb5006ba	apparent diffusion coefficient changes in human brain during sleep – does it inform on the existence of a glymphatic system?		The role of sleep in brain physiology is poorly understood. Recently rodent studies have shown that the glymphatic system clears waste products from brain more efficiently during sleep compared to wakefulness due to the expansion of the interstitial fluid space facilitating entry of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the brain. Here, we studied water diffusivity in the brain during sleep and awake conditions, hypothesizing that an increase in water diffusivity during sleep would occur concomitantly with an expansion of CSF volume - an effect that we predicted based on preclinical findings would be most prominent in cerebellum. We used MRI to measure slow and fast components of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water in the brain in 50 healthy participants, in 30 of whom we compared awake versus sleep conditions and in 20 of whom we compared rested-wakefulness versus wakefulness following one night of sleep-deprivation. Sleep compared to wakefulness was associated with increases in slow-ADC in cerebellum and left temporal pole and with decreases in fast-ADC in thalamus, insula, parahippocampus and striatal regions, and the density of sleep arousals was inversely associated with ADC changes. The CSF volume was also increased during sleep and was associated with sleep-induced changes in ADCs in cerebellum. There were no differences in ADCs with wakefulness following sleep deprivation compared to rested-wakefulness. Although we hypothesized increases in ADC with sleep, our findings uncovered both increases in slow ADC (mostly in cerebellum) as well as decreases in fast ADC, which could reflect the distinct biological significance of fast- and slow-ADC values in relation to sleep. While preliminary, our findings suggest a more complex sleep-related glymphatic function in the human brain compared to rodents. On the other hand, our findings of sleep-induced changes in CSF volume provide preliminary evidence that is consistent with a glymphatic transport process in the human brain.	alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive cdisc version questionnaire;arousal;cerebellum;cerebrospinal fluid;coefficient;diffusion magnetic resonance imaging;insula of reil;interstitial fluid;molecular transport;rest;rodent;thalamic structure;thyroid hormone receptor alpha;wakefulness;physiological aspects	Sükrü Baris Demiral;Dardo Tomasi;Joelle E.

Here, we examined neural activity during empathy for social exclusion and assessed how empathy-related neural processes might relate to subsequent prosocial behavior toward the excluded victim. During an fMRI scan, participants observed one person being excluded by two others, and afterwards sent emails to each of these 'people.' Later, a group of raters assessed how prosocial (e.g., helpful, comforting) the emails were. Observing exclusion (vs. inclusion) activated regions associated with mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus), and highly empathic individuals activated both mentalizing regions and social pain-related regions (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Additionally, the empathy-related activity in the anterior insula and medial prefrontal cortex was associated with later prosocial behavior toward the victim, and exploratory mediation analyses indicated that medial prefrontal cortex activity, in particular, may support the link between trait empathy and prosocial behavior. Overall, findings suggest that empathy-related neural responses to social experiences may promote spontaneous prosocial treatment of those in need.	ct scan;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;email;empathy;exclusion;experience;insula of reil;interaction;medial graph;mediation (statistics);neuroimaging;pain;prefrontal cortex;promotion (action);rem sleep behavior disorder;sickle cell trait;social characteristics;spontaneous order;structure of precuneus;fmri	Carrie L.

fe4b6ccc38b8944c993458c7d998d1b6b5bea416	applications of the phase transition theory in visual recognition and classifications	phase transition	"""Abstract   Total discrimination is a measure of information defined by Kullback. It has been shown that total discrimination is useful in measurements of performance and optimization of classifications in visual recognition. Using the Monte Carlo numerical simulation method, we studied some of these behaviors in a system of data, which were generated from visual diagnoses of cell preparations in medicine, of different sample sizes  N . The processes categorize cell abnormalities into  m  classes. Our study suggests that there is a """"data structural change"""" or possibly a """"phase transition"""" in the data system, as the number of classes  m  in the classification changes through the previously identified optimal classification number  m  C . We found that the total discrimination peaked at  m  C  and seemed to diverge at the optimization point as  N  → ∞, based on finite-size scaling analysis technique from the phase transition theory. Using the finite-size analysis method, we calculated the """"thermal"""" exponent  v  for the data system and the """"critical"""" exponent φ for total discrimination, and the calculation gave  v  = 3.33 ± 1.00 and φ = 0.40 ± 0.10. An order parameter 〈 n 〉 which differentiated an """"ordered"""" phase (below  m  C ) from a """"disordered"""" phase (above  m  C  ) was also defined. The behaviors of 〈 n 〉 near  m  C  supports the hypothesis that there is a possible """"phase transition"""" of the system taking place. Therefore,  m  C  is both an optimization point in visual classification and a """"critical point"""" in the context of the theory of phase transition. The connection of these two will not only provide the theoretical basis in the optimization in visual classification, but also widen the applications of the theory of phase transitions."""

Several studies have adopted the three water-pool compartment model to study white matter brain regions, associating individual compartments with myelin, axonal and extracellular water. However, the number and identifiability of GRE-MRI signal compartments has not been fully explored. We undertook this task for human brain imaging data. Multiple echo time GRE-MRI data were acquired in five healthy participants, specific anatomical structures were segmented in each dataset (substantia nigra, caudate, insula, putamen, thalamus, fornix, internal capsule, corpus callosum and cerebrospinal fluid), and the signal fitted with models comprising one to six signal compartments using a complex-valued plane wave formulation. Information criteria and cluster analysis methods were used to ascertain the number of distinct compartments within the signal from each structure and to determine their respective frequency shifts. We identified five principal signal compartments with different relative contributions to each structure's signal. Voxel-based maps of the volume fraction of each of these compartments were generated and demonstrated spatial correlation with brain anatomy.	anatomic structures;anatomical compartments;body of uterus;brain fornix;cerebrospinal fluid;cluster analysis;corpus callosum;entity name part qualifier - adopted;gradient;insula of reil;internal capsule of brain;magnetic resonance imaging;map;multi-compartment model;myelin;numerous;seizures;silo (dataset);substantia nigra structure;thalamic structure;volume fraction;voxel;white matter	Shrinath Kadamangudi;David C.

The primary focus of neuroimaging studies to date in dyslexia has been on cortical regions; however, subcortical regions may also be important for explaining this disability. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging to examine the association between thalamo-cortical connectivity and children's reading ability in 20 children with typically developed reading ability (age range 8-17/10-17 years old from two imaging centers) and 19 children with developmental dyslexia (DYS) (age range 9-17/9-16 years old). To measure thalamo-cortical connections, the structural images were segmented into cortical and subcortical anatomical regions that were used as target and seed regions in the probabilistic tractography analysis. Abnormal thalamic connectivity was found in the dyslexic group in the sensorimotor and lateral prefrontal cortices. These results suggest that the thalamus may play a key role in reading behavior by mediating the functions of task-specific cortical regions; such findings lay the foundation for future studies to investigate further neurobiological anomalies in the development of thalamo-cortical connectivity in DYS.

ce39bc9ae65fdb768f93343ef55f99651e7f30ad	relationships of peripheral igf-1, vegf and bdnf levels to exercise-related changes in memory, hippocampal perfusion and volumes in older adults	vascular plasticity;exercise;neurotrophic factors;hippocampus;aging	Animal models point towards a key role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in mediating exercise-induced structural and functional changes in the hippocampus. Recently, also platelet derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C) has been shown to promote blood vessel growth and neuronal survival. Moreover, reductions of these neurotrophic and angiogenic factors in old age have been related to hippocampal atrophy, decreased vascularization and cognitive decline. In a 3-month aerobic exercise study, forty healthy older humans (60 to 77years) were pseudo-randomly assigned to either an aerobic exercise group (indoor treadmill, n=21) or to a control group (indoor progressive-muscle relaxation/stretching, n=19). As reported recently, we found evidence for fitness-related perfusion changes of the aged human hippocampus that were closely linked to changes in episodic memory function. Here, we test whether peripheral levels of BDNF, IGF-I, VEGF or PDGF-C are related to changes in hippocampal blood flow, volume and memory performance. Growth factor levels were not significantly affected by exercise, and their changes were not related to changes in fitness or perfusion. However, changes in IGF-I levels were positively correlated with hippocampal volume changes (derived by manual volumetry and voxel-based morphometry) and late verbal recall performance, a relationship that seemed to be independent of fitness, perfusion or their changes over time. These preliminary findings link IGF-I levels to hippocampal volume changes and putatively hippocampus-dependent memory changes that seem to occur over time independently of exercise. We discuss methodological shortcomings of our study and potential differences in the temporal dynamics of how IGF-1, VEGF and BDNF may be affected by exercise and to what extent these differences may have led to the negative findings reported here.	angiogenic process;atrophic;bdnf gene;blood platelets;blood vessel;cognition disorders;endothelial growth factors;exercise, aerobic;humans;identity governance framework;juvenile spinal muscular atrophy;linear programming relaxation;memory disorders;memory bound function;morphometric analysis;morphometrics;parasitic diseases, animal;pathologic neovascularization;peripheral vascular diseases;personnameuse - assigned;platelet-derived growth factor receptor;pseudo brand of pseudoephedrine;randomness;somatomedins;treadmill, device;voxel	Anne Maass;Sandra Düzel;Tanja Brigadski;Monique Goerke;Andreas Becke;Uwe Sobieray;Katja Neumann;Martin Lövdén;Ulman Lindenberger;Lars Bäckman;Rüdiger Braun-Dullaeus;Dörte Ahrens;Hans-Jochen Heinze;Notger G.

480ab754ad2de5bdd54907b45442835d7f012d80	prestimulus interhemispheric coupling of brain rhythms predicts cognitive–motor performance in healthy humans	settore med 26 neurologia;med 26 neurologia;neuroimaging;physiological	Physiological and neuroimaging studies suggest that human actions are characterized by time-varying engagement of functional distributed networks within the brain. In this study, we investigated whether specific prestimulus interhemispheric connectivity, as a measure of synchronized network between the two hemispheres, could lead to a better performance (as revealed by RT) in a simple visuomotor task. Eighteen healthy adults underwent EEG recording during a visual go/no-go task. In the go/no-go task, a central fixation stimulus was followed by a green (50% of probability) or red visual stimulus. Participants had to press the mouse button after the green stimuli (go trials). Interhemispheric coupling was evaluated by the spectral coherence among all the electrodes covering one hemisphere and matched with those on the other. The frequency bands of interest were delta (2–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha 1 (8–10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5–13 Hz), beta 1 (13–20 Hz), beta 2 (20–30 Hz), and gamma (30–40 Hz). The task-related results showed that interhemispheric connectivity decreased in delta and increased in alpha band. Furthermore, we observed positive delta and negative alpha correlations with the RT; namely, the faster the RT, the lower delta and the higher alpha connection between the two hemispheres. These results suggested that the best performance is anticipated by the better functional coupling of cortical circuits involved during the processing of the sensorimotor information, occurring between the two hemispheres pending cognitive go/no-go task.	area striata structure;bands;coherence (physics);electroencephalography;electroencephalography;frequency band;hertz (hz);humans;mouse button;neuroimaging;spatial variability;confirmation - responselevel;electrode;nervous system disorder	Fabrizio Vecchio;Giordano Lacidogna;Francesca Miraglia;Placido Bramanti;Florinda Ferreri;Paolo Maria Rossini	2014	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn_a_00615	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;communication;neuroimaging	HCI	17.552208547370803	-78.91869915939121	164116

bbdc2dd695e2140761e4bc3f06456ee96bf4dcbe	structural connectome of the human vestibular, pre-motor, and navigation network *		The aim of this study is to characterize modules and hubs within the multimodal vestibular system and, particularly, to test the centrality of posterior peri-sylvian regions. Structural connectivity matrices from 50 unrelated healthy right-handed subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database were analyzed using multishell diffusion-weighted data, probabilistic tractography (constrained spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms) in combination with subject-specific grey matter parcellations. Network nodes included parcellated regions within the vestibular, pre-motor and navigation system. Module calculation produced two and three modules in the right and left hemisphere, respectively. On the right, regions were grouped into a vestibular and pre-motor module, and into a visual-navigation module. On the left this last module was split into an inferior and superior component. In the thalamus, a region comprising the mediodorsal and anterior complex, and lateral and inferior pulvinar, was included in the ipsilateral navigation module, while the remaining thalamus was clustered with the ipsilateral vestibular pre-motor module. Hubs were located bilaterally in regions encompassing the inferior parietal cortex and the precuneus. This analysis revealed a dorso-lateral path within the multi-modal vestibular system related to vestibular / motor control, and a ventro-medial path related to spatial orientation / navigation. Posterior peri-sylvian regions may represent the main hubs of the whole modular network.	bilateral filter;centrality;deconvolution;gray matter;human connectome project;information flow (information theory);lateral thinking;medial graph;modal logic;monkeys;multimodal interaction;navigation;numerous;parietal lobe;pulvinar structure;space perception;structure of precuneus;thalamic structure;usb hub	Iole Indovina;R.

This article leverages a key advantage of CCN-namely, that it should be possible to interface different CCN models in a plug-and-play fashion-to produce a new and biologically detailed model of perceptual category learning. The new model was created from two existing CCN models: the HMAX model of visual object processing and the COVIS model of category learning. Using bitmap images as inputs and by adjusting only a couple of learning-rate parameters, the new HMAX/COVIS model provides impressively good fits to human category-learning data from two qualitatively different experiments that used different types of category structures and different types of visual stimuli. Overall, the model provides a comprehensive neural and behavioral account of basal ganglia-mediated learning.	basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;bitmap;cognition disorders;computation (action);computational model;computational neuroscience;concept learning;cyclomatic complexity;experiment;fits;learning disorders;neuroscience discipline;plug (physical object);plug and play	George Cantwell;Maximilian Riesenhuber;Jessica L.

The characteristic responses of these neurons (linearly approximated by their spectro-temporal receptive fields, or STRFs) suggest that auditory representations are formed, as early as in the inferior colliculi, on the basis of a time, frequency, rate (temporal modulations) and scale (spectral modulations) analysis of sound. However, how these four dimensions are integrated and processed in subsequent neural networks remains unclear. In this work, we present a new methodology to generate computational insights into the functional organization of such processes. We first propose a systematic framework to explore more than a hundred different computational strategies proposed in the literature to process the output of a generic STRF model. We then evaluate these strategies on their ability to compute perceptual distances between pairs of environmental sounds. Finally, we conduct a meta-analysis of the dataset of all these algorithms' accuracies to examine whether certain combinations of dimensions and certain ways to treat such dimensions are, on the whole, more computationally effective than others. We present an application of this methodology to a dataset of ten environmental sound categories, in which the analysis reveals that (1) models are most effective when they organize STRF data into frequency groupings-which is consistent with the known tonotopic organization of receptive fields in auditory structures -, and that (2) models that treat STRF data as time series are no more effective than models that rely only on summary statistics along time-which corroborates recent experimental evidence on texture discrimination by summary statistics.	acoustic cryptanalysis;approximation algorithm;artificial neural network;auditory system;cns disorder;categories;computation;dimensions;distance;generic drugs;greater than;inferior colliculus;mammals;neural network simulation;pattern recognition;silo (dataset);time series	Edgar Hemery;Jean-Julien Aucouturier	2015		10.3389/fncom.2015.00080	psychology;text mining;neuroscience;meta-analysis;speech recognition;computer science;bioinformatics;machine learning;data mining;communication	ML	21.22966497933173	-76.08658150275045	164379

However, another important goal of cognitive neuroscience is to understand the ways in which individuals differ from one another and the significance of these differences. This latter goal is given special weight by the recent reconceptualization of neurological disorders where sharp boundaries are no longer drawn either between health and neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, or among different disorders (e.g., Insel et al., 2010). Consequently, even the variability in the healthy population can inform our understanding of brain disorders. However, because the use of functional neural markers is still in its infancy, no consensus presently exists about which measures (e.g., effect size?, extent of activation?, degree of lateralization?) are the best ones to use. We here attempt to address this question with respect to one large-scale neural system: the set of brain regions in the frontal and temporal cortices that jointly support high-level linguistic processing (e.g., Binder et al., 1997; Fedorenko, Hsieh, Nieto-Castanon, Whitfield-Gabrieli, & Kanwisher, 2010). In particular, using data from 150 individuals all of whom had performed a language """"localizer"""" task contrasting sentences and nonword sequences (Fedorenko et al., 2010), we: a) characterize the distributions of the values for four key neural measures of language activity (region effect sizes, region volumes, lateralization based on effect sizes, and lateralization based on volumes); b) test the reliability of these measures in a subset of 32 individuals who were scanned across two sessions; c) evaluate the relationship among the different regions of the language system; and d) evaluate the relationship among the different neural measures. Based on our results, we provide some recommendations for future studies of brain-behavior and brain-genes relationships. Although some of our conclusions are specific to the language system, others (e.g., the fact that effect-size-based measures tend to be more reliable than volume-based measures) are likely to generalize to the rest of the brain."""

6bceb4a62d970a59d48c933853fe9bbb048d0e08	spiking neural networks enable two-dimensional neurons and unsupervised multi-timescale learning		The capabilities of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are limited by the operations possible at their individual neurons and synapses. For instance, each neuron’s activation only represents a single scalar variable. In addition, because neuronal activations may be dominated by a single timescale in the synaptic input, unsupervised learning from data with multiple timescales has not been generally possible. Here we address these by exploiting the continuous-time and asynchronous operation of spiking neural networks (SNNs), i.e. a biologically-inspired type of ANNs. First, we demonstrate how input neurons can be two-dimensional (2D), i.e. each represent two variables. Second, we show unsupervised learning from multiple timescales simultaneously. 2D neurons operate by allocating each variable to a different timescale in their activation, i.e. one variable corresponds to the timing of individual spikes, and another to the spike rate. We show how these can be modulated separately but simultaneously, and we apply this mixed coding technique to encoding images with two modalities, namely, colour and brightness. Unsupervised multi-timescale learning is achieved by synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity, combined with varying degrees of short-term plasticity. We demonstrate the successful application of this learning scheme on the unsupervised classification of bimodal pictures encoded by our 2D neurons. Taken together, our results show that SNNs are capable of increasing both the information content of each neuron and the exploitable data in the input. We suggest that through these unique features, SNNs may increase the performance and broaden the applicability of ANNs.	modulation;neural networks;neuron;self-information;spiking neural network;synapse;the spike (1997);unsupervised learning;variable (computer science)	Timoleon Moraitis;Abu Sebastian;Evangelos Eleftheriou	2018	2018 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489218	synapse;pattern recognition;machine learning;spiking neural network;unsupervised learning;encoding (memory);variable (computer science);artificial neural network;asynchronous operation;artificial intelligence;computer science;neuron	ML	19.013921543523306	-69.10504233343129	164535

Negative urgency represents the dispositional tendency to experience such self-control failure in response to negative affect. Neither the neural underpinnings of negative urgency nor the more general phenomenon of self-control failure in response to negative emotions are fully understood. Previous theorizing suggests that an insufficient, inhibitory response from the prefrontal cortex may be the culprit behind such self-control failure. However, we entertained an alternative hypothesis: negative emotions lead to self-control failure because they excessively tax inhibitory regions of the prefrontal cortex. Using fMRI, we compared the neural activity of people high in negative urgency with controls on an emotional, inhibitory Go/No-Go task. While experiencing negative (but not positive or neutral) emotions, participants high in negative urgency showed greater recruitment of inhibitory brain regions than controls. Suggesting a compensatory function, inhibitory accuracy among participants high in negative urgency was associated with greater prefrontal recruitment. Greater activity in the anterior insula on negatively-valenced, inhibitory trials predicted greater substance abuse one month and one year after the MRI scan among individuals high in negative urgency. These results suggest that, among people whose negative emotions often lead to self-control failure, excessive reactivity of the brain's regulatory resources may be the culprit.	auditory recruitment;control flow;emotions;insula of reil;prefrontal cortex;self-control as a personality trait;substance abuse problem;substance-related disorders;fmri	David S.

In this study, we describe a generalization of the leaky integrate-and-fire model that produces a wide variety of spiking behaviors while still being analytically solvable between firings. For different parameter values, the model produces spiking or bursting, tonic, phasic or adapting responses, depolarizing or hyperpolarizing after potentials and so forth. The model consists of a diagonalizable set of linear differential equations describing the time evolution of membrane potential, a variable threshold, and an arbitrary number of firing-induced currents. Each of these variables is modified by an update rule when the potential reaches threshold. The variables used are intuitive and have biological significance. The model's rich behavior does not come from the differential equations, which are linear, but rather from complex update rules. This single-neuron model can be implemented using algorithms similar to the standard integrate-and-fire model. It is a natural match with event-driven algorithms for which the firing times are obtained as a solution of a polynomial equation.	action potential;algebraic equation;algorithm;artificial neural network;biological neuron model;decision problem;event-driven programming;generalization (psychology);illness behavior;membrane potentials;neural network simulation;neurons;polynomial;population parameter;rule (guideline)	Stefan Mihalas;Ernst Niebur	2009	Neural Computation	10.1162/neco.2008.12-07-680	computer science;artificial intelligence;calculus;linear model;mathematics;artificial neural network;algorithm	ML	20.736433290673986	-70.77872038227628	164719

Because of the law's sensitivity to the procedure used to collect its data, its failure to manifest itself at the individual level, its manifestation in non-sensory modalities, and the difficulty associated with rating stimuli on a ratio scale, many have speculated that the power law is a product of the experimental procedure Stevens used. This work tested this hypothesis by reproducing one of Stevens' original power law experiments (using different pressure levels of a 1 kHz tone) in which 52 data series were generated from a computerized process that simulated Stevens' experimental procedure. However, instead of generating ratio data for each magnitude estimate, random ordinal data were generated. When a power function was fitted to these data using the same procedure utilized by Stevens, it fit with an adjusted R2 of 0.997, while generating the same psychophysical model. This indicates that Stevens' assumption that participants make magnitude estimates on a ratio scale is not necessary to collect power law data. Thus, Stevens' power law is likely a product of Stevens' experimental procedure.	coefficient of determination;emergence;experiment;level of measurement;ordinal data;simulation	Matthew L.

cfceabead1d753d4913ccd53dda35ea4db0ff325	ica on sensor or source data: a comparison study in deriving resting state networks from eeg		Resting state networks (RSNs) are human brain networks formed by spontaneous activity fluctuations in distributed brain regions when people are in task-free and awake state. RSNs have been so far extensively studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Recently, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have also been used to derive RSNs, in which independent component analysis (ICA) is the key step. In these studies, ICA has been either directly applied to recorded data at sensors (sensor-space ICA) or estimated source data from sensors using inverse source imaging techniques (source-space ICA). Both sensor-space and source-space ICAs have demonstrated the capability in finding RSNs from EEG/MEG data and their results showed strong correlations to fMRI RSNs. However, their performance was hardly compared even differences have been observed in their results. In the present study, we compared the source-space and sensor-space ICAs in reconstructing spatial, temporal and spectral features of RSNs in both simulated and real EEG data. Results from simulated data indicated that the source-space ICA has better performance in reconstructing spatial, temporal, and spectral feature of RSNs. Results from resting-sate EEG data in seven healthy participants also showed the difference between two procedures and, through the comparison with RSN templates constructed from fMRI data, the source-space ICA indicated relatively better performance than the sensor-space ICA.	clip1 gene;clinical use template;electroencephalography;ieee 802.11i-2004;imaging techniques;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetoencephalography;neural oscillation;persistent vegetative state;rest;resting state fmri;source data;splenic hypoplasia;spontaneous order;sensor (device)	Chuang Li;Han Yuan;Diamond Urbano;Yoon-Hee Cha;Lei Ding	2017	2017 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037637	magnetoencephalography;source data;electroencephalography;machine learning;resting state fmri;independent component analysis;human brain;functional magnetic resonance imaging;computer science;artificial intelligence	ML	20.885351168858026	-77.64647732716833	164961
290c45d4c5d4e624a851b70afd18fb747efd977b	a scalable parallel algorithm for the simulation of structural plasticity in the brain		The neural network in the brain is not hard-wired. Even in the maturernbrain, new connections between neurons are formed and existing ones arerndeleted, which is called structural plasticity. The dynamics of thernconnectome is key to understanding how learning, memory, and healing afterrnlesions such as stroke work. However, with current experimental techniquesrneven the creation of an exact static connectivity map, which is requiredrnfor various brain simulations, is very difficult. rnrnOne alternative is to use simulation based on network models to predict thernevolution of synapses between neurons based on their specified activityrntargets. This is particularly useful as experimental measurements of thernspiking frequency of neurons are more easily accessible and reliable thanrnbiological connectivity data. The Model of Structural Plasticity (MSP) byrnButz and van Ooyen is an example of this approach. In traditional models,rnconnectivity between neurons is fixed while plasticity merely arises fromrnchanges in the strength of existing synapses, typically modeled as weightrnfactors. MSP, in contrast, models a synapse as a connection between anrnaxonal plug and a socket. These synaptic elements grow andrnshrink independently on each neuron. When an axonal element of one neuronrnconnects to the dendritic element of another neuron, a new synapse isrnformed. Conversely, when a synaptic element bound in a synapse retracts,rnthe corresponding synapse is removed. The governing idea of the model isrnthat plasticity in cortical networks is driven by the need of individualrnneurons to homeostatically maintain their average electrical activity. rnrnHowever, to predict which neurons connect to each other, the current MSPrnmodel computes probabilities for all pairs of neurons, resulting in arncomplexity O(n^2). To enable large-scale simulations with millions ofrnneurons and beyond, this quadratic term is prohibitive. Inspired byrnhierarchical methods for solving n-body problems in particle physics, thisrndissertation presents a scalable approximation algorithm for simulatingrnstructural plasticity based on MSP. rnrnTo scale MSP to millions of neurons, we adapt the Barnes-Hut algorithm asrnused in gravitational particle simulations to a scalable solution for thernsimulation of structural plasticity in the brain with a time complexity ofrnO(n log^2 n) instead of O(n^2). Then, we show through experimentalrnvalidation that the approximation underlying the algorithm does notrnadversely affect the quality of the results. For this purpose, we comparernneural networks created by the original MSP with those created by ourrnapproximation of it using graph metrics.rnrnFinally, we prove that our scalable approximation algorithm can simulaternthe dynamics of the connectome with 10^9 neurons - four orders ofrnmagnitude more than the naive O(n^2) version, and two orders lessrnthan the human brain. We present an MPI-based scalable implementation ofrnthe scalable algorithm and our performance extrapolations predict that,rngiven sufficient compute resources, even with todayu0027s technology arnfull-scale simulation of the human brain with 10^11 neurons is possible rnin principle.rnrnUntil now, the scale of the largest structural plasticity simulations ofrnMSP in terms of the number of neurons corresponded to that of a fruit fly.rnOur approximation algorithm goes a significant step further, reaching arnscale similar to that of a galago primate. Additionally, large-scale brainrnconnectivity maps can now be grown from scratch and their evolution afterrndestructive events such as stroke can be simulated.

71421e3118f516df65f3584aba2875e04097b96f	remodeling of sensorimotor brain connectivity in gpr88-deficient mice	gpr88;default mode network;mouse brain functional connectivity	Recent studies have demonstrated that orchestrated gene activity and expression support synchronous activity of brain networks. However, there is a paucity of information on the consequences of single gene function on overall brain functional organization and connectivity and how this translates at the behavioral level. In this study, we combined mouse mutagenesis with functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine whether targeted inactivation of a single gene would modify whole-brain connectivity in live animals. The targeted gene encodes GPR88 (G protein-coupled receptor 88), an orphan G protein-coupled receptor enriched in the striatum and previously linked to behavioral traits relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. Connectivity analysis of Gpr88-deficient mice revealed extensive remodeling of intracortical and cortico-subcortical networks. Most prominent modifications were observed at the level of retrosplenial cortex connectivity, central to the default mode network (DMN) whose alteration is considered a hallmark of many psychiatric conditions. Next, somatosensory and motor cortical networks were most affected. These modifications directly relate to sensorimotor gating deficiency reported in mutant animals and also likely underlie their hyperactivity phenotype. Finally, we identified alterations within hippocampal and dorsal striatum functional connectivity, most relevant to a specific learning deficit that we previously reported in Gpr88-/- animals. In addition, amygdala connectivity with cortex and striatum was weakened, perhaps underlying the risk-taking behavior of these animals. This is the first evidence demonstrating that GPR88 activity shapes the mouse brain functional and structural connectome. The concordance between connectivity alterations and behavior deficits observed in Gpr88-deficient mice suggests a role for GPR88 in brain communication.		Tanzil Mahmud Arefin;Anna E.

98e55a0f756ce8dbc074200eb95396605a66c148	modes of operation: a topographic neural gradient supporting stimulus dependent and independent cognition		Human cognition is flexible - drawing on both sensory input, and representations from memory, to successfully navigate complex environments. Contemporary accounts suggest this flexibility is possible because neural function is organized into a hierarchy. Neural regions are organized along a macroscale gradient, anchored at one end by unimodal systems involved with perception and action, and at the other by transmodal systems, including the default mode network, supporting cognition less directly tied to immediate stimulus input. The current study tested whether this cortical hierarchy captures modes of behaviour that depend on immediate input, as well as those that depend on representations from memory. Participants made decisions regarding the location or identity of shapes using information in the environment (0-back) or from a prior trial (1-back). Using task based imaging we established that, regardless of the nature of the decision, medial and lateral visual cortex were recruited when decisions rely on immediate input, while transmodal regions were recruited when judgments depend on information from the prior trial. Using principal components analysis, we demonstrated that shifting decision-making from perception to memory altered the focus of neural activity from unimodal to transmodal regions (and vice versa). Notably, the more pronounced these shifts in neural activity from unimodal to transmodal regions when decisions relied on memory, the more efficiently individuals performed this task. These data illustrate how the macroscale organization of neural function into a hierarchy allows cognition to rely on input, or information from memory, in a flexible and efficient manner.

A challenge-skill balance manipulation was applied to self-paced netball and basketball shooting tasks, with point of gaze recorded through mobile eye tracking. Quiet eye was used to index optimal control of visual attention. While the experimental manipulation was found to have no effect, quiet eye was associated with the experience of flow. Furthermore, mediation revealed an indirect effect of quiet eye on performance through flow experience. This study provides initial evidence that flow may be preceded by changes in visual attention, suggesting that further investigation of visual attention may elucidate the cognitive mechanisms behind flow experience.	attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;conflict (psychology);eye tracking;flow;harris affine region detector;optimal control;query expansion;s-adenosylmethionine;samsn1 gene;vine, bach flower essence;netball;standards characteristics	David J.

111d34b3fb3f55bb4938ad5ed369472da219dae5	brain connectivity during encoding and retrieval of spatial information: individual differences in navigation skills	brain connectivity;graph theory;reference frame proclivity;spatial memory;spatial navigation	Emerging evidence suggests that the variations in the ability to navigate through any real or virtual environment are accompanied by distinct underlying cortical activations in multiple regions of the brain. These activations may appear due to the use of different frame of reference (FOR) for representing an environment. The present study investigated the brain dynamics in the good and bad navigators using Graph Theoretical analysis applied to low-density electroencephalography (EEG) data. Individual navigation skills were rated according to the performance in a virtual reality (VR)-based navigation task and the effect of navigator's proclivity towards a particular FOR on the navigation performance was explored. Participants were introduced to a novel virtual environment that they learned from a first-person or an aerial perspective and were subsequently assessed on the basis of efficiency with which they learnt and recalled. The graph theoretical parameters, path length (PL), global efficiency (GE), and clustering coefficient (CC) were computed for the functional connectivity network in the theta and alpha frequency bands. During acquisition of the spatial information, good navigators were distinguished by a lower degree of dispersion in the functional connectivity compared to the bad navigators. Within the groups of good and bad navigators, better performers were characterised by the formation of multiple hubs at various sites and the percentage of connectivity or small world index. The proclivity towards a specific FOR during exploration of a new environment was not found to have any bearing on the spatial learning. These findings may have wider implications for how the functional connectivity in the good and bad navigators differs during spatial information acquisition and retrieval in the domains of rescue operations and defence systems.

Such decoding involves integrating noisy neural responses into a more reliable representation of the likelihood that the stimuli under consideration evoked the observed responses. Importantly, an ideal observer must be able to evaluate likelihood with high precision and only consider the likelihood of the two relevant stimuli involved in the discrimination task. We report a new perceptual bias suggesting that observers read out the likelihood representation with remarkably low precision when discriminating grating spatial frequencies. Using spectrally filtered noise, we induced an asymmetry in the likelihood function of spatial frequency. This manipulation mainly affects the likelihood of spatial frequencies that are irrelevant to the task at hand. Nevertheless, we find a significant shift in perceived grating frequency, indicating that observers evaluate likelihoods of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of stimulus alternatives when performing two-alternative discrimination.	area striata structure;hearing loss, high-frequency;relevance;spatial frequency;observers	Tom Putzeys;Matthias Bethge;Felix A.

In particular we are interested in the way that white blood cells such as neutrophils migrate during episodes of inflammation which are important events in the working of the innate immune system. Migration of populations of many kinds can be modelled using drift-diffusion models by drawing analogies between the individual agents and the molecules in a fluid. It is challenging to arrive at a data-driven estimate of the parameters of this kind of process, particularly so if the individual agents have time varying properties that are not uniform over the population. In this paper, we offer a novel framework to estimate migration dynamics in this context. It makes use of the Approximate Bayesian Computation approach for parameter estimation and model selection. The Framework is applied to zebrafish neutrophil dynamics but is applicable for general migration scenarios.	cell signaling;computation;estimation theory;immune system;leukocytes;migration, cell;model selection;organism;population parameter;zebrafish	Geoffrey R.

The reverberating activity evoked by the interplay between these two streams has been hypothesized to form the trace of the low-level computational operations written on the """"high resolution buffer"""" of primary cortical areas [1]. In vivo intracellular electrophysiology in V1 offers the unique possibility of listening to the synaptic echoes of the effective perceptual network at work. On the basis of the comparison between functional synaptic imaging and voltage sensitive dye imaging, I will show that the emergence of macroscopic features of perception (Gestalt and motion flow related percepts) in early sensory cortical areas can be predicted from the read-out of analog graded events (synaptic potentials) operating at a more microscopic integration level."""	synaptic package manager	Yves Frégnac	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-33863-2_50	computer vision	ML	17.922639277315994	-73.90421601305539	167002
2972a08359f4cb12df648c4b85f4d529be45a575	probabilistic versus incremental presynaptic learning in biologically plausible synapses	nmda channel;metaplasticity;abs rule;medicina;bcm rule	In this paper, the presynaptic rule, a classical rule for hebbian learning, is revisited. It is shown that the presynaptic rule exhibits relevant synaptic properties like synaptic directionality, and LTP metaplasticity (long-term potentiation threshold metaplasticity). With slight modifications, the presynaptic model also exhibits metaplasticity of the long-term depression threshold, being also consistent with Artola, Brocher and Singer's (ABS) influential model. Two asymptotically equivalent versions of the presynaptic rule were adopted for this analysis: the first one uses an incremental equation while the second, conditional probabilities. Despite their simplicity, both types of presynaptic rules exhibit sophisticated biological properties, specially the probabilistic version.	activation function;emoticon;experiment;hebbian theory;linux test project (ltp);singer system 10;synapse;synapse;synaptic weight	Francisco Javier Ropero Peláez;Diego Andina	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21344-1_9	artificial intelligence;machine learning;metaplasticity	ML	20.477087030987224	-71.23255070776031	167095

In this paper, local and global burst synchronization is studied in a noisy small-world neuronal network composed of nonidentical Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. It is found that burst synchronization can be obtained easily by very small coupling strength and local burst synchronized clusters have already formed before global burst synchronization happens. The effects of the shortcut-adding probability and noise intensity on local and global burst synchronization of the network are also studied and it is found that the introduction of shortcuts facilitates burst synchronization while noise has little effect.

We investigate the conditions under which these behaviors occur in a multidimensional parametric space defined by the connectivity strengths and dispersion of the neuronal membrane excitability. Using mode decomposition techniques, we further derive analytically a low dimensional description of the neural population dynamics and show that the various dynamic behaviors of the entire network can be well reproduced by this reduced system.

So far, neuroscientists needed to select electrodes manually from hundreds of electrodes. Here we present an electronic depth control algorithm that allows to select electrodes automatically, hereby allowing to reduce the amount of data and locating those electrodes that are close to neurons. The electrodes are selected according to a new penalized signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) criterion that demotes electrodes from becoming selected if their signals are redundant with previously selected electrodes. It is shown that, using the PSNR, interneurons generating smaller spikes are also selected. We developed a model that aims to evaluate algorithms for electronic depth control, but also generates benchmark data for testing spike sorting and spike detection algorithms. The model comprises a realistic tufted pyramidal cell, non-tufted pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons. All neurons are synaptically activated by hundreds of fibers. This arrangement allows the algorithms to be tested in more realistic conditions, including backgrounds of synaptic potentials, varying spike rates with bursting and spike amplitude attenuation.

Grid cells in the rat entorhinal cortex are found with periodic firing fields and have been hypothesized as the basis for the `cognitive map'. This paper presents a grid-cell based computational model for cognitive map building together with an analysis of the learning from grid cells to place cells. Experiment results demonstrate that the learning from grid cells to place cells plays an important role affecting the performance of map building and that the proposed computational model provides an alternative approach for robot mapping.	algorithm;cognitive map;computation;computational model;hebbian theory;machine learning;memory bound function;mobile robot;robotic mapping;supervised learning	Jun Hu;Miaolong Yuan;Huajin Tang;Wei-Yun Yau	2016	2016 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	10.1109/CEC.2016.7743925	robot;hebbian theory;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;leabra;computational model	Robotics	19.20997003247378	-67.6022904271104	167918

Characterizing these dynamics may reveal important features of neural computation, particularly during internally-driven cognitive operations. For example, the activity of premotor cortex (PMd) neurons during an instructed delay period separating movement-target specification and a movementinitiation cue is believed to be involved in motor planning. We show that the dynamics underlying this activity can be captured by a lowdimensional non-linear dynamical systems model, with underlying recurrent structure and stochastic point-process output. We present and validate latent variable methods that simultaneously estimate the system parameters and the trial-by-trial dynamical trajectories. These methods are applied to characterize the dynamics in PMd data recorded from a chronically-implanted 96-electrode array while monkeys perform delayed-reach tasks.	artificial neural network;computation;dynamical system;electronic circuit;experiment;latent variable;mental operations;nonlinear system;pmd;point process;stochastic process	Byron M.

We used a laboratory task to investigate the neural correlates of reactive aggression using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The task is disguised as a reaction-time competition between the subject and two opponents and entitles the winner to punish the loser. It seeks to elicit aggression by provocation of the subject. As each single trial in this task is separated into a decision phase, during which the severity of the prospective punishment of the opponent is set, and an outcome phase, during which the actual punishment is applied or received, the paradigm enables us to analyze the neural events during each of these phases. Specific neural responses in areas related to negative affect, cognitive control and reward processing provide additional information about the cognitive, emotional and motivational processes underlying reactive aggressive behavior and afford us with the possibility to test and expand theories on aggression such as the General Aggression Model.	amygdaloid structure;arousal;cingulate cortex;cognition;consciousness;emotions;insula of reil;magnetic resonance imaging;opponent process;personality disorders;programming paradigm;prospective search;theory;fmri	Ulrike M.

ab4cbf5c4a350aecd4356a93443be086a7437986	spike-frequency adaptation		When stimulated with a constant stimulus, many neurons initially respond with a high spike frequency that then decays down to a lower steady-state frequency (Fig. 1 A). This dynamics of the spike frequency response is referred to as “spike-frequency adaptation”. Spike-frequency adaptation is a process that is slower than the dynamics of action potential generation. Spikefrequency adaptation by this definition is an aspect of the neuron’s super-threshold firing regime, although the mechanisms causing spike-frequency adaptation could also be at work in the neuron’s subthreshold regime.	action potential;frequency response;neuron;steady state;the spike (1997)	Jan Benda;Joël Tabak	2014		10.1007/978-1-4614-7320-6_339-1	stimulus (physiology);frequency response;control theory;neuron;subthreshold conduction;physics	ML	17.366401571621047	-71.37539050728913	168495

Conventional measures of connectivity are mostly linear and bivariate. This paper proposes an effective connectivity measure called Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System Granger Causality (ANFISGC). The proposed measure is based on the symplectic geometry embedding dimension, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) predictor, and Granger Causality (GC). It is a powerful predictor that detects both linear and nonlinear causal information flow. It is not bivariate and thus can distinguish between direct and indirect connections. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with those of the Linear Granger Causality (LGC), Kernel Granger Causality (KGC), combination of Pairwise Granger Causality and Conditional Granger Causality (PwGC + CGC), Transfer Entropy (TE), and Phase Transfer Entropy (PTE) methods using simulated and experimental MEG data. Simulation results show that ANFISGC outperforms the other methods in detecting both linear and nonlinear connections and, by increasing the coupling strength between nodes, the value of ANFISGC increases. In the analysis of the time series of the brain sources of epilepsy patients obtained from the MEG inverse problem, the regions found by ANFISGC were more similar to the clinical findings than those found by the other methods.	adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;apricot kernel oil;bivariate data;causality;coupling constant;electroencephalography;embedding;epilepsy;kerrison predictor;linear iga bullous dermatosis;magnetoencephalography;neuro-fuzzy;nonlinear system;patients;peroxisome biogenesis disorder, complementation group c;pressure-tolerant electronics;sensor;signs and symptoms;simulation;symplectic integrator;tellurium;test engineer;time series;transfer entropy	Mona Farokhzadi;Gholam-Ali Hossein-Zadeh;Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh	2018	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.07.024	granger causality;kernel (linear algebra);cognitive psychology;psychology;adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system;bivariate analysis;statistics;inference;transfer entropy;nonlinear system;inverse problem	ML	22.78172942763117	-79.00905836141555	168497

However, this hypothesis has been challenged by recent observations of gradually ramping stratal dopamine levels as a goal is approached. This note describes conditions under which temporal difference learning models predict dopamine ramping. The key idea is representational: a quadratic transformation of proximity to the goal implies approximately linear ramping, as observed experimentally.	dopamine;encode;experiment;representation (action);temporal difference learning	Samuel J Gershman	2014	Neural Computation	10.1162/NECO_a_00559	psychology;developmental psychology;artificial intelligence;machine learning;social psychology	ML	16.06370746827405	-73.49210927645647	169116

During visual perception, pattern completion enables recognition of poorly visible or occluded objects. We combined psychophysics, physiology, and computational models to test the hypothesis that pattern completion is implemented by recurrent computations and present three pieces of evidence that are consistent with this hypothesis. First, subjects robustly recognized objects even when they were rendered <15% visible, but recognition was largely impaired when processing was interrupted by backward masking. Second, invasive physiological responses along the human ventral cortex exhibited visually selective responses to partially visible objects that were delayed compared with whole objects, suggesting the need for additional computations. These physiological delays were correlated with the effects of backward masking. Third, state-of-the-art feed-forward computational architectures were not robust to partial visibility. However, recognition performance was recovered when the model was augmented with attractor-based recurrent connectivity. The recurrent model was able to predict which images of heavily occluded objects were easier or harder for humans to recognize, could capture the effect of introducing a backward mask on recognition behavior, and was consistent with the physiological delays along the human ventral visual stream. These results provide a strong argument of plausibility for the role of recurrent computations in making visual inferences from partial information.	architecture as topic;backward masking;cognition;color vision;computation;computational model;interrupt;obstruction;physical object;plausibility structure;recurrent neural network;physiological aspects	Hanlin Tang;Bill Lotter;Martin Schrimpf;Ana Paredes;Josue Ortega Caro;Walter Hardesty;David Cox;Gabriel Kreiman	2018		10.1073/pnas.1719397115	psychophysics;computation;computational model;computer vision;machine learning;artificial intelligence;visual perception;pattern completion;computer science;cognition	ML	14.935125705363822	-75.6550148764082	169367
18d0daa5c802f30e251b105bd5ce4d272624ee56	a dynamic system of brain networks revealed by fast transient eeg fluctuations and their fmri correlates		Resting state brain activity has become a significant area of investigation in human neuroimaging. An important approach for understanding the dynamics of neuronal activity in the resting state is to use complementary imaging modalities. Electrophysiological recordings can access fast temporal dynamics, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies reveal detailed spatial patterns. However, the relationship between these two measures is not fully established. In this study, we used simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI, along with Hidden Markov Modelling, to investigate how network dynamics at fast sub-second time-scales, accessible with EEG, link to the slower time-scales and higher spatial detail of fMRI. We found that the fMRI correlates of fast transient EEG dynamic networks show highly reproducible spatial patterns, and that their spatial organization exhibits strong similarity with traditional fMRI resting state networks maps. This further demonstrates the potential of electrophysiology as a tool for understanding the fast network dynamics that underlie fMRI resting state networks.	electroencephalography phase synchronization;exhibits as topic;magnetic resonance imaging;microtubule-associated proteins;neuroimaging;rest;fmri	Borbála Hunyadi;Mark W.

30949030a4ff8a336328a7a4fe951b723e07b562	the influence of non-rigid transformation of binocularly matched information on depth perception		Previous research (Ni, Chen, u0026 Andersen, 2010) found that subjects could perceive a quantitative depth of an occluding surface only when binocularly matched information is also presented with temporal interocular unmatched (IOUM) information. However, the relationship between the binocularly matched information and the IOUM information and how it will affect depth perception in an occlusion scene is still not clear. In the present study, we examined whether the relationship between the binocularly matched information and the IOUM information is rigid or not. In our experiment, we presented 3 columns of dots on the left as binocularly matched information, which were undertaking a non-rigid transformation. Another one single column of dots translates to the right, which would be visible monocularly when being occluded by a featureless subjective surface. The results showed that non-rigid transformation of the binocularly matched information would interfere with subjectsu0027 quantitative depth perception, which may be caused by the destruction of the subjectsu0027 perception of acknowledging the binocularly matched and unmatched information as an implicit object.	column (database);depth perception;entity–relationship model	Jieren Li;Zixuan Zeng;Yao Chen;Rui Ni	2017	2017 10th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, BioMedical Engineering and Informatics (CISP-BMEI)	10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2017.8302017	artificial intelligence;computer vision;pattern recognition;rigid transformation;perception;computer science;depth perception	HCI	13.042669443044376	-76.718440648349	169582

However, the cause of the detected activity relies on the anatomy. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTMRI) as a noninvasive modality providing in vivo anatomical information allows determining neural fiber connections which leads to brain mapping. Still a complete map of fiber paths representing the human brain is missing in literature. One of the main drawbacks of reliable fiber mapping is the correct detection of the orientation of multiple fibers within a single imaging voxel. In this study a method based on linear data structures is proposed to define the fiber paths regarding their diffusivity. Another advantage of the proposed method is that the analysis is applied on entire brain diffusion tensor data. The implementation results are promising, so that the method will be developed as a rapid fiber tractography algorithm for the clinical use as future study.	algorithm;anatomic structures;autostereogram;brain mapping;cognition;data structure;electroencephalography;list of data structures;magnetic resonance imaging;modality (human–computer interaction);tissue fiber;video-in video-out;voxel;fmri	Dilek Göksel;Mehmed Özkan	2010		10.1155/2010/251928	diffusion mri;computer vision;uncertainty;data structure;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;linear model;tractography;high definition fiber tracking;statistics	Vision	22.78771992208416	-78.97365488493818	169698

The right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been suggested to contain a general magnitude system that underlies the overlap between various perceptual dimensions. However, comparative studies including spatial, temporal, and numerical dimensions are missing. In a unified paradigm, we compared the impact of right PPC inhibition on associations with spatial response codes (i.e., Simon, SNARC, and STARC effects) and on congruency effects between space, time, and numbers. Prolonged cortical inhibition was induced by continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), a protocol for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), at the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Our results show that congruency effects, but not response code associations, are affected by right PPC inhibition, indicating different neuronal mechanisms underlying these effects. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that interactions between space and time perception are reflected in congruency effects, but not in an association between time and spatial response codes. Taken together, these results implicate that the congruency between purely perceptual dimensions is processed in PPC areas along the IPS, while the congruency between percepts and behavioral responses is independent of this region.	belief revision;causal filter;code;dimensions;interaction;linker (computing);list of http status codes;mental association;numerical analysis;parietal lobe;posterior parietal cortex;primary peritoneal carcinoma;programming paradigm;stochastic neural analog reinforcement calculator;structure of intraparietal sulcus;transcranial magnetic stimulation;transcranial magnetic stimulation;dinoflagellate sulcus;standards characteristics	Martin Riemer;Nadine Diersch;Florian Bublatzky;Thomas Wolbers	2016	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.01.030	psychology;mental chronometry;neuroscience;developmental psychology;radiology;young adult;magnetic resonance imaging;brain mapping;communication;social psychology;time perception	HCI	17.80949329645947	-77.85334939034631	169827

They are physiologically significant, playing important roles in cellular growth and tissue function. Most models of gap junctions focus on single channel currents. Here we present a model exhibiting macroscopic currents in homotypic gap junctions, and thereby allowing evaluation of cellular features. The technique is novel in its modular approach, whereby modules of hemi-channels are developed, followed by their serial combination to obtain the complete gap junction. It is an improvement over earlier models as it is able to demonstrate the phenomena of contingent gating. We present certain biophysical properties observed in a 3-D syncytium under different gap junction subtypes. Finally, we test the efficacy of this approach towards modeling of heterotypic gap junctions.	contingency (philosophy);duality gap;gap buffer	Shailesh Appukuttan;Rohan Sathe;Rohit Manchanda	2015	2015 IEEE 5th International Conference on Computational Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences (ICCABS)	10.1109/ICCABS.2015.7344707	biology;gap junction;nanotechnology;anatomy	Robotics	12.854403159054128	-68.00650997918102	169859

Here we describe a series of simulations involving neural networks that learned to perform their task by self-organizing their internal connections. The networks controlled artificial agents with an orienting eye and an arm. Agents saw objects with various shapes and locations and learned to press a key appropriate to their shape. The results showed the following: (1) Despite being able to see the entire visual scene without moving their eye, agents learned to orient their eye toward a peripherally presented object. (2) Neural networks whose hidden layers were previously partitioned into units dedicated to eye orienting and units dedicated to arm movements learned the identification task faster and more accurately than did nonmodular networks. (3) Nonetheless, even nonmodular networks developed a similar functional segregation through self-organization of their hidden layer. (4) After partial disconnection of the hidden layer from the input layer, the lesioned agents continued to respond accurately to single stimuli, wherever they occurred, but on double simultaneous stimulation they oriented toward and responded only to the right-sided stimulus, thus simulating extinction/neglect. These results stress the generality of the advantages provided by orienting processes. Hard-wired modularity, reminiscent of the distinct cortical visual streams in the primate brain, provided further evolutionary advantages. Finally, disconnection is likely to be a mechanism of primary importance in the pathogenesis of neglect and extinction symptoms, consistent with recent evidence from animal studies and brain-damaged patients.	cognition disorders;cognitive tutor;computational model;extinction, psychological;intelligent agent;movement;neural network simulation;neural networks;neuroscience discipline;organizing (structure);patients;physical object;primates;self-organization;anatomical layer;saw (device);spelling	Andrea Di Ferdinando;Domenico Parisi;Paolo Bartolomeo	2007	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2007.19.6.1033	psychology;computer simulation;cognitive psychology;vision;connectionism;neuroscience;self-organization;systems modeling;genetic algorithm;cognition;developmental psychology;spatial disorientation;visual system;extinction;simulation modeling;orientation;perception	ML	21.058972006242367	-69.95671414644887	170029
172d2c6d889a7393119a952d7998e78c946a39cb	segmentation of the thalamus in mri based on t1 and t2	deep brain stimulation;feature space	Reliable identification of thalamic nuclei is required to improve positioning of electrodes in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), and to allow the role of individual thalamic nuclei in health and disease to be fully investigated. In this work, a previously proposed method for identifying sub-regions within the thalamus based on differences in their T1 and T2 values is explored in detail. The effect on the segmentation of T1 and T2 dependence weighted against priors for spatial position and extent was investigated. When T1 and T2 dependence was highly weighted, good distinction between identified regions was obtained in T1/T2 feature-space, but no contiguous anatomically distinct regions were identified within the thalamus. Incorporating spatial priors was necessary to ensure anatomically distinct regions were defined. Optimal values for segmentation parameters were obtained by assessing performance on a 'synthetic thalamus'. Using these optimum input parameters, within- and between-subjects reproducibility was assessed. Good reproducibility was obtained when six regions were specified to be identified in the thalamus. The six regions identified were similar in the majority of the normal subject group. However, intriguingly these regions were different from those obtained in the same subjects using a well-known connectivity-based segmentation technique. This method shows promise to identify intrathalamic structures on the basis of T1 and T2 signal. A comprehensive characterisation of thalamic nuclei may require a fully multi-modal approach.	deep brain stimulation;modal logic;numerous;synthetic data;thalamic nuclei;thalamic structure;biologic segmentation;electrode	Catherine R.

American Psychologist, 54, 182203; Schacter, D. L. (2001). The seven sins of memory: How the mind forgets and remembers. Boston: Houghton Mifflin]. Cognitive studies have suggested that misattribution errors may occur in the absence of recollection for the details of an initial encounter with a stimulus, but little is known about the neural basis of this memory phenomenon. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the hypothesized role of recollection in counteracting the illusory truth effect, a misattribution error whereby perceivers systematically overrate the truth of previously presented information. Imaging was conducted during the encoding and subsequent judgment of unfamiliar statements that were presented as true or false. Event-related fMRI analyses were conditionalized as a function of subsequent performance. Results demonstrated that encoding activation in regions previously associated with successful recollectionincluding the hippocampus and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC)correlated with the successful avoidance of misattribution errors, providing initial neuroimaging support for earlier cognitive accounts of misattribution.	codependency (psychology);cognition disorders;cognitive science;inborn errors of metabolism;magnetic resonance imaging;mental recall;neuroimaging;neuroscience discipline;prefrontal cortex;unconscious personality factor;fmri	Jason P.

171495415fdbe54343e2568aa2163d35dce9e4da	the geometry of behavioral and brain dynamics in team coordination		Performing a task as a team requires that team members mutually coordinate their actions. It is this coordination that distinguishes the performance of a team from the same actions performed independently. Here we set out to identify signatures of team coordination in behavioral and brain dynamics. We use dual electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain dynamics of dyadic teams performing a virtual room clearing task. Such complex tasks often exhibit high variability of behavioral and brain dynamics. Although such variability is often considered to impede identification of the behavior or brain dynamics of interest here we present a conceptual and empirical framework which explains variability in geometrical terms and classifies its sources into those that are detrimental and non-detrimental to performing the task at hand. Using our framework we found that behaviorally team coordination is reflected in terms of role dependent behavior. Furthermore we identified a low-dimensional subspace of the brain dynamics in the frequency domain which is specific for team behavior and correlated with successful team coordination. Moreover, successful team coordination was positively correlated with the inter- but not intra-brain coherence in the gamma band. Our results hence indicate that successful team coordination is associated with increased team cognition, particularly readiness to engage in the task.		Silke Dodel;Emmanuelle Tognoli;J. A.

Behavioral theories comprise two classes: those that use common mechanisms and those that use distinct mechanisms for study and retrieval of associations versus serial lists. We tested the common-mechanisms hypothesis by recording electroencephalographic activity related to successful study (“subsequent memory effect” [SME]) of pairs and short lists (triples) of nouns. Multivariate analysis identified four distributed patterns of brain activity: (1) right parietal activity throughout most of the study period that differentiated study of pairs from triples within subjects as well as exhibiting an SME that was significant for pairs but not for triples; (2) a left parietal and fronto-polar activity pattern that was reliable around 500 msec and later in the study trial, exhibiting an SME for pairs and a weaker, nonsignificant SME for triples; (3) a left frontal/right parietal topography in the middle of the study interval which covaried with speed and accuracy across subjects; and (4) a pattern resembling the late positive component preceded by an early potential which together covaried with accuracy in triples but slow response times for both pairs and triples. These patterns point to the relevance of three classic SME components (early, late positive, and slow components) from single-item memory to memory for structured information, but suggest that they reflect subsets of more complex spatio-temporal patterns. Our findings support common underlying mechanisms for study and recall of pairs and lists. However, existing models must be modified to account for differences in both the presence of certain study-relevant processes and in the relevance of these processes to performance measures for pairs versus serial lists.	class;ecology;electroencephalography;exhibits as topic;memory effect;mental association;order (action);relevance;theory;topography	Jeremy B.

Over the past two decades, a number of major sources of noise have been identified, including system-related instabilities, subject motion, and physiological fluctuations. This article reviews the characteristics of the various noise sources as well as the mechanisms through which they affect the fMRI signal. Approaches for distinguishing signal from noise and the associated challenges are also reviewed. These challenges reflect the fact that some noise sources, such as respiratory activity, are generated by the same underlying brain networks that give rise to functional signals that are of interest.	electroencephalography;magnetic resonance imaging;motion;review [publication type];fmri	Thomas T.

The approach is exploratory in the sense that it does not require an a priori model as in the earlier approaches, such as the Structural Equation Modeling or Dynamic Causal Modeling, which can only affirm or refute the connectivity of a previously known anatomical model or a hypothesized model. The conditional probabilities that render the interactions among brain regions in Bayesian networks represent the connectivity in the complete statistical sense. The present method is applicable even when the number of regions involved in the cognitive network is large or unknown. We demonstrate the present approach by using synthetic data and fMRI data collected in silent word reading and counting Stroop tasks.	bayesian network;causal filter;cognitive network;interaction;probability;structural equation modeling;synthetic data;fmri	Xuebin Zheng;Jagath C.

To expand these findings, we used functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and perfusion imaging in combination with repeated electrical stimulation in humans. Specifically we monitored modulation of somatosensory processing during inhibition of excitatory transmission by ocular application of the glutamate receptor antagonist xenon. BOLD responses upon secondary stimulation increased in mid insular and in primary/secondary sensory cortices under placebo and decreased under xenon treatments. Xenon-induced decreases in regional perfusion were confined to stimulation responsive brain regions and correlated with time courses of xenon concentrations in the cranial blood. Moreover, effects of xenon on behavioral, fMRI and perfusion data scaled with stimulus intensity. The dependence of pain sensitization on sufficient pre-activation reflects a multistage process which is characteristic for glutamate receptor related processes of LTP. This study demonstrates how LTP related processes known from the cellular level can be investigated at the brain systems level.	cns disorder;electric stimulation technique;excitatory amino acid antagonists;functional electrical stimulation;glutamate receptor;glutamic acid;long-term potentiation;modulation;multistage amplifier;pain perception;perfusion imaging;resonance;sensitization (observable entity);sensory neuroscience;spinal cord;xenon (processor);blood oxygen level dependent;central nervous system tumor, pediatric;chemosensitization/potentiation;fmri	Oliver Adolph;Sarah Köster;Michael Georgieff;Stefan Bäder;Karl Josef Föhr;Thomas Kammer;Bärbel Herrnberger;Georg Grön	2010	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.08.034	psychology;nmda receptor;neuroscience;long-term potentiation;central nervous system;magnetic resonance imaging;perfusion scanning;glutamate receptor;anesthesia;surgery	ML	18.494344853154853	-78.79661168019854	171382

Here we will explore these hypotheses using the Spike-timing theory of working memory. We represent memory traces as spatio-temporal patterns of spikes called polychronous groups which behave according to short-term and long-term synaptic dynamics. In spite of their contradictions, we show that all three forgetting hypotheses can co-exist - yet each one can have a different degree of influence in the process of forgetting with interference having an immediate impact.	artificial neural network;baseline (configuration management);catastrophic interference;criticality matrix;earthbound;experiment;interference (communication);portable network graphics;simulation;statistical interference;synaptic package manager;temporal difference learning;the spike (1997);tracing (software)	Panagiotis Ioannou;Matthew Casey;André Grüning	2015	2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280584	computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;interference;artificial neural network	ML	19.42829360410931	-73.01695480301059	171514
f57ac5a56b2b54dea09068c4b576e37ae27c13a7	realizing medium spiny neurons with a simple neuron model		Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) constitute input nuclei of the basal ganglia. Most well-known dichotomous of striatal MSNs stem from dopaminergic modulation of striatal processing. Dopamine modulates excitability in striatal MSNs with a complex underlying mechanism and lack of balance in this delicate system leads to pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease. On the contrary, investigation of such a system requires simple, but yet comprehensive models that are capable of capturing complex behaviour of MSNs. We propose a reduced-computational but biologically plausible model that mimics the cell dynamics of striatal D(_1)- and D(_2)-type MSNs with different levels of dopamine using data from a recent study. Proposed computational model shows good matches to the MSN responses and captures some essential features of MSNs such as first spike latencies, dopamine modulated state transitions and enhanced response to depolarizing input during dopamine intervention.	biological neuron model	Sami Utku Çelikok;Neslihan Serap Sengör	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-44778-0_30	artificial intelligence;biological neuron model;dopamine;medium spiny neuron;electrophysiology;pattern recognition;cell biology;basal ganglia;computer science;depolarization;dopaminergic	ML	18.08042454212685	-72.5327751560138	171581

a1110503833ae8da3998c04dd1d9c4565b59d395	multiscale statistical testing for connectome-wide association studies in fmri		Alteration in brain connectivity, as captured by fMRI, has been found to be associated with a variety of clinical disorders. Yet, the systematic identification of connections associated with a disease state is a “needle in a haystack” problem. There are numerous connections to test and potentially very few of them show a strong association with the variable of interest. The number of brain parcels (or scale) used to measure connections is a key parameter, as more parcels means more anatomically accurate measures, but also means many more connections to test and thus more risk to find spurious associations by chance. This work presents a multiscale approach designed to assess the impact of scale on connectome-wide association studies. A mass univariate general linear model is applied independently at each connection, for functional networks generated through clustering at different scales. The multiple comparison problem is addressed at each scale independently, using the false-discovery rate. An omnibus permutation test is implemented to reject the global null hypothesis of no association across all scales. Our results support the fact that, when the global null is rejected, the false-discovery rate is well controlled both within and across scales. On simulations, we showed that multiscale group differences can be detected ∗Corresponding author Email address: pierre.bellec@criugm.qc.ca (Pierre Bellec) Preprint submitted to Neuroimage September 7, 2014 ar X iv :s ub m it/ 10 52 65 8 [ qbi o.

In addition, the multiscale method performed better than current techniques such as network-based statistics or multivariate distance matrix regression, both on simulations and real datasets. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that our approach is a powerful tool to mine for associations across the whole connectome, at multiple scales.	cluster analysis;connectome;distance matrix;email;general linear model;randomness;resampling (statistics);simulation	Pierre Bellec;Yassine Benhajali;Felix Carbonell;Christian Dansereau;Z.

Within this network, problems may occur if more than one task should be addressed within a short time window. Such situations have been studied in so called dual-task experiments in the field of psychology. We take these results as inspiration to develop a structure that can be integrated into our framework. The model focuses on essential aspects of the basic phenomena observed in human subjects as forward masking, backward masking and PRP. While there are detailed models available concentrating on specific paradigms, those do not cover all three types of paradigms. We are not heading for a detailed simulation of the psychological findings, but show how these effects, on a qualitative level, can be implemented in our framework.	action selection;microsoft windows	Holk Cruse;Malte Schilling	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-09435-9_5	attentional blink;machine learning;hexapod;architecture;masking (art);backward masking;artificial intelligence;action selection	HCI	13.583137194881314	-73.58560736105721	171912

Although the electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of the pulmonary vein myocardium have been compiled in various studies, a comprehensive understanding of the spontaneous action potentials generated in the myocardial layer has yet to be presented. Here we integrated the electrophysiological properties of the pulmonary vein myocardial layer using a guinea pig ventricular cell model. Based on the preceding research, which reported that approximately half of the isolated pulmonary vein myocardial layer exhibited spontaneous action potentials and the remaining half was quiescent, we constructed various combinations of the pulmonary vein myocardial models to represent variations of the action potential tracings. As a result, we predicted that the spontaneous action potentials, including burst-like action potentials, are observed with varying currents of the relative densities of Na+ (INa), L-type Ca2+ (ICaL), inwardly rectifying K+ (IK1), rapid component of delayed rectifying K+ (IKr), and ACh-activated K+ (IKACh).	action potential;automated clearing house;compiler;rectifier;spontaneous order	Hitomi Sano;Yuichiro Tanaka;Yasuhiro Naito;Masaru Tomita	2015	2015 Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)	10.1109/CIC.2015.7411047	medicine;anesthesia;surgery;cardiology	Robotics	12.23531043902612	-68.43776636293781	171933

The model, topographic latent source analysis (TLSA), assumes that fMRI images are generated by a covariate-dependent superposition of latent sources. These sources are defined in terms of basis functions over space. The number of parameters in the model does not depend on the number of voxels, enabling a parsimonious description of activity patterns that avoids many of the pitfalls of traditional voxel-based approaches. We develop a multi-subject extension where latent sources at the subject-level are perturbations of a group-level template. We evaluate TLSA according to prediction, reconstruction and reproducibility. We show that it compares favorably to a Naive Bayes model while using fewer parameters. We also describe a hypothesis testing framework that can be used to identify significant latent sources.	basis function;clinical use template;dns-based authentication of named entities;generative model;magnetic resonance imaging;naive bayes classifier;numerous;occam's razor;open-source software;quantum superposition;topography;voxel;fmri	Samuel J Gershman;David M.

Behavioral and electrophysiological studies of shape processing have demonstrated greater sensitivity to differences in NAPs than in MPs. However, previous work has shown that such sensitivity is lacking in multiple-views models of object recognition such as Hmax. These models typically assume that object processing is based on populations of view-tuned neurons with distributed symmetrical bell-shaped tuning that are modulated at least as much by differences in MPs as in NAPs. Here, we test the hypothesis that unsupervised learning of invariances to object transformations may increase the sensitivity to differences in NAPs vs. MPs in Hmax. We collected a database of video sequences with objects slowly rotating in-depth in an attempt to mimic sequences viewed during object manipulation by young children during early developmental stages. We show that unsupervised learning yields shape-tuning in higher stages with greater sensitivity to differences in NAPs vs. MPs in agreement with monkey IT data. Together, these results suggest that greater NAP sensitivity may arise from experiencing different in-depth rotations of objects.	accident (philosophy);aspect ratio;modulation;outline of object recognition;physical object;population;published comment;selectivity (electronic);sensitivity and specificity;unsupervised learning;cell transformation	Sarah M.

However, most of the studies investigated brain activity during the performance of comparatively simple (verbal) type of tasks and the majority of studies focused on samples of the normal population. In this study we investigate EEG activity in professional dancers (n=15) who have attained a high level of expertise in this domain. This group was compared with a group of novices (n=17) who have only basic experience in dancing and completed no comprehensive training in this field. The EEG was recorded during performance of two different dancing imagery tasks which differed with respect to creative demands. In the first task participants were instructed to mentally perform a dance which should be as unique and original as possible (improvisation dance). In the waltz task they were asked to imagine dancing the waltz, a standard dance which involves a sequence of monotonous steps (lower creative demands). In addition, brain activity was also measured during performance of the Alternative Uses test. We observed evidence that during the generation of alternative uses professional dancers show stronger alpha synchronization in posterior parietal brain regions than novice dancers. During improvisation dance, professional dancers exhibited more right-hemispheric alpha synchronization than the group of novices did, while during imagining dancing the waltz no significant group differences emerged. The findings complement and extend existing findings on the relationship between EEG alpha activity and creative thinking.	complement system proteins;creativity;electroencephalography;guided imagery;high-level programming language;synchronization (computer science)	Andreas Fink;Barbara Graif;Aljoscha C.

Part of the reason why this is the case is due to its subjective nature. In our previous computational experiments, to avoid such a subjective trap, we took a strategy to investigate objective necessary conditions of consciousness. Our basic hypothesis was that predictive internal dynamics serves as such a condition. This is in line with theories of consciousness that treat retention (memory), protention (anticipation), and primary impression as the tripartite temporal structure of consciousness. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed publicly available sleep and awake electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Our results show that EEG signals from awake or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep states have more predictable dynamics compared to those from slow-wave sleep (SWS). Since awakeness and REM sleep are associated with conscious states and SWS with unconscious or less consciousness states, these results support our hypothesis. The results suggest an intricate relationship among prediction, consciousness, and time, with potential applications to time perception and neurorobotics.	computation;conscious;electroencephalography phase synchronization;experiment;eye movements;faceted classification;neurorobotics;numerous;sinewave synthesis;sleep apnea syndromes;theory;unconscious personality factor;rapid eye movement	Jaewook Yoo;Jaerock Kwon;Yoonsuck Choe	2014		10.3389/fnbot.2014.00018	psychology;neuroevolution;text mining;neuroscience;computer science;bioinformatics;artificial intelligence;machine learning;consciousness;sleep;communication	ML	15.91751750881668	-76.05288985917151	172489

However, large inter-subject variability in functional connectivity, particularly in disease populations, renders detection of representative group networks challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, “group replicator dynamics” (GRD), for detecting sparse functional brain networks that are common across a group of subjects. We extend the replicator dynamics (RD) approach, which we show to be a solution of the nonnegative sparse principal component analysis problem, by integrating group information into each subject's RD process. Our proposed strategy effectively coaxes all subjects' networks to evolve towards the common network of the group. This results in sparse networks comprising the same brain regions across subjects yet with subject-specific weightings of the identified brain regions. Thus, in contrast to traditional averaging approaches, GRD enables inter-subject variability to be modeled, which facilitates statistical group inference. Quantitative validation of GRD on synthetic data demonstrated superior network detection performance over standard methods. When applied to real fMRI data, GRD detected task-specific networks that conform well to prior neuroscience knowledge.	antibody to islet cells of pancreas measurement;cross-validation (statistics);functional integration;ground truth;handling (psychology);heart rate variability;independent computing architecture;inference;iterative and incremental development;magnetic resonance imaging;neuroscience discipline;parkinson disease;population;principal component analysis;relevance;rendering (computer graphics);resting state fmri;ruby document format;sensor;sparse matrix;spatial variability;synthetic data;explanation	Bernard Ng;Martin J.

They have been widely applied to gain understanding of the underlying mechanisms for spike timing in neurons, and have served as building blocks for more elaborate models. Especially the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is popular to describe the stochastic fluctuations in the membrane potential of a neuron, but also other models like the square-root model or models with a non-linear drift are sometimes applied. Data that can be described by such models have to be stationary and thus, the simple models can only be applied over short time windows. However, experimental data show varying time constants, state dependent noise, a graded firing threshold and time-inhomogeneous input. In the present study we build a jump diffusion model that incorporates these features, and introduce a firing mechanism with a state dependent intensity. In addition, we suggest statistical methods to estimate all unknown quantities and apply these to analyze turtle motoneuron membrane potentials. Finally, simulated and real data are compared and discussed. We find that a square-root diffusion describes the data much better than an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process with constant diffusion coefficient. Further, the membrane time constant decreases with increasing depolarization, as expected from the increase in synaptic conductance. The network activity, which the neuron is exposed to, can be reasonably estimated to be a threshold version of the nerve output from the network. Moreover, the spiking characteristics are well described by a Poisson spike train with an intensity depending exponentially on the membrane potential.	action potential;biological neuron model;coefficient;conductance (graph);membrane potentials;microsoft windows;motor neurons;nonlinear system;quantity;severo ornstein;spike glycoprotein, coronavirus;stationary process;synaptic package manager;synaptic weight;tissue membrane;turtle	Patrick Jahn;Rune W.

Here we investigate the behavioral and brain adjustments that occur when conflicting stimulus elements are, or are not, temporally predictable. ERPs were collected while manual response variants of the Stroop task were performed in which the SOAs between the relevant color and irrelevant word stimulus components were either randomly intermixed or held constant within each experimental run. Results indicated that the size of both the neural and behavioral effects of stimulus incongruency varied with the temporal arrangement of the stimulus components, such that the random-SOA arrangements produced the greatest incongruency effects at the earliest irrelevant first SOA (−200 msec) and the constant-SOA arrangements produced the greatest effects with simultaneous presentation. These differences in conflict processing were accompanied by rapid (∼150 msec) modulations of the sensory ERPs to the irrelevant distractor components when they occurred consistently first. These effects suggest that individuals are able to strategically allocate attention in time to mitigate the influence of a temporally predictable distractor. As these adjustments are instantiated by the participants without instruction, they reveal a form of rapid strategic learning for dealing with temporally predictable stimulus incongruency.	catastrophic interference;computer monitor;conflict (psychology);contribution;control system;enterprise resource planning;humans;interference (communication);modulation;onset (audio);randomness;relevance;temporal logic	Lawrence G.

Optic flow provides information about the rat’s linear and rotational velocity and, thus, could influence the firing pattern of grid cells. To investigate this possible link, we model parts of the rat’s visual system and analyze their capability in estimating linear and rotational velocity. In our model a rat is simulated to move along trajectories recorded from rat’s foraging on a circular ground platform. Thus, we preserve the intrinsic statistics of real rats’ movements. Visual image motion is analytically computed for a spherical camera model and superimposed with noise in order to model the optic flow that would be available to the rat. This optic flow is fed into a template model to estimate the rat’s linear and rotational velocities, which in turn are fed into an oscillatory interference model of grid cell firing. Grid scores are reported while altering the flow noise, tilt angle of the optical axis with respect to the ground, the number of flow templates, and the frequency used in the oscillatory interference model. Activity patterns are compatible with those of grid cells, suggesting that optic flow can contribute to their firing.	apache axis;axis vertebra;cerebral cortex;clinical use template;estimated;eye;grid cells;interference (communication);movement;optic disk;optic flow;optic nerve glioma, childhood;velocity (software development)	Florian Raudies;Ennio Mingolla;Michael E.

Functional neuroimaging results, studies on patients with posterior parietal cortex (PPC) lesions, and single-unit recordings in the lateral intraparietal sulcus of primates indirectly suggest that the PPC might be a potential locus of visual stability through its involvement with spatial remapping. Here we directly explored the role of the PPC in visual stability by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while participants performed a perisaccadic displacement detection task. We show that TMS over the PPC but not a frontal control site alters sensitivity to displacement detection when administered just before contralateral saccades and that a general impairment in attention or in the perception of apparent motion cannot account for the decreased sensitivity. The specific relationship between the timing of TMS and saccade direction demonstrates that saccadic suppression of displacement (SSD) is likely a consequence of noisy contralateral spatial representations in the PPC around the time of a saccade. The same mechanism may keep the unstable visual world in the temporal proximity of saccades from reaching our consciousness.	consciousness;control theory;displacement mapping;functional gastrointestinal disorders;groove;locus;lateral thinking;neuroimaging;parietal lobe;patients;posterior parietal cortex;primary peritoneal carcinoma;primates;psychologic displacement;saccades;solid-state drive;spatial–temporal reasoning;structure of intraparietal sulcus;transcranial magnetic stimulation;unstable medical device problem;zero suppression	Erik Chang;Tony Ro	2007	Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience	10.1162/jocn.2007.19.2.266	psychology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;posterior parietal cortex;communication	ML	16.908892105724448	-76.9066730641937	173196
478fee5c9bbad1dcfa838804802e97314a5de32e	a biologically plausible network for the computation of orientation dominance		The determination of dominant orientation at a given image location is formulated as a decision-theoretic question. This leads to a novel measure for the dominance of a given orientation θ, which is similar to that used by SIFT. It is then shown that the new measure can be computed with a network that implements the sequence of operations of the standard neurophysiological model of V1. The measure can thus be seen as a biologically plausible version of SIFT, and is denoted as bioSIFT. The network units are shown to exhibit trademark properties of V1 neurons, such as cross-orientation suppression, sparseness and independence. The connection between SIFT and biological vision provides a justification for the success of SIFT-like features and reinforces the importance of contrast normalization in computer vision. We illustrate this by replacing the Gabor units of an HMAX network with the new bioSIFT units. This is shown to lead to significant gains for classification tasks, leading to state-of-the-art performance among biologically inspired network models and performance competitive with the best non-biological object recognition systems.	computation;computer vision;neural coding;outline of object recognition;scale-invariant feature transform;theory;zero suppression	Kritika Muralidharan;Nuno Vasconcelos	2010			computer vision;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning	ML	21.726560829033875	-66.96201258094662	173311
de8eaaa5f881712c42c17e8dc982bcd07387a326	space-time interdependence and sensory modalities: time affects space in the hand but not in the eye		Time and space are intimately related, but what is the real nature of this relationship? Is time mapped metaphorically onto space, or do the two domains share a common representational format? In the present paper, participants touched (but could not see) physical sticks while listening to an auditory note. Judgements of stick length were affected by concurrent note duration, but not vice versa. When participants were allowed to see as well as touch the sticks, however, the effects reversed. These findings run counter to the spatial metaphor account of time, which claims that effects of space on time should always be stronger than those of time on space. Rather, our findings support the spatial representation account, in which time and space share a common neural substrate that may be affected by concurrent temporal or spatial information, depending on the perceptual acuity of the modality used to perceive space.	concurrent computing;interdependence;modality (human–computer interaction);spatial file manager	Zhenguang Cai;Louise Connell	2012			representational systems;cognitive psychology;psychology;cognitive science;social psychology;spacetime;perception;haptic perception;metaphor;visual perception;spatial analysis;space time	HCI	14.883577944658652	-76.57193573032623	173485

This study examined whether cerebellar and motor cortex hyperactivation is a compensatory mechanism for hypoactivation in the basal ganglia or is a pathophysiological response that is related to the signs of the disease. Using a BOLD contrast fMRI paradigm PD patients and healthy controls performed automatic and cognitively controlled thumb pressing movements. Regions of interest analysis quantified the BOLD activation in motor areas, and correlations between the hyperactive and hypoactive regions were performed, along with correlations between the severity of upper limb rigidity and BOLD activation. There were three main findings. First, the putamen, supplementary motor area (SMA) and pre-SMA were hypoactive in PD patients. The left and right cerebellum and the contralateral motor cortex were hyperactive in PD patients. Second, PD patients had a significant negative correlation between the BOLD activation in the ipsilateral cerebellum and the contralateral putamen. The correlation between the putamen and motor cortex was not significant. Third, the BOLD activation in the motor cortex was positively correlated with the severity of upper limb rigidity, but the BOLD activation in the cerebellum was not correlated with rigidity. Further, the activation in the motor cortex was not correlated with upper extremity bradykinesia. These findings provide new evidence supporting the hypothesis that hyperactivation in the ipsilateral cerebellum is a compensatory mechanism for the defective basal ganglia. Our findings also provide the first evidence from neuroimaging that hyperactivation in the contralateral primary motor cortex is not a compensatory response but is directly related to upper limb rigidity.	basal (phylogenetics);basal ganglia;bradykinesia;cerebral cortex;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;hyperactive behavior;limb structure;motor cortex;movement;muscle rigidity;muscular dystrophies, limb-girdle;neuroimaging;parkinson disease;parkinsonian disorders;patients;programming paradigm;region of interest;structure of putamen;upper extremity;mesial premotor cortex	Hong Yu;Dagmar Sternad;Daniel M.

A self-organizing map is an artificial neural network model that transforms high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional (often a 2-D) map using unsupervised learning. However, a postprocessing scheme is necessary to correctly interpret similarity between neighboring node prototypes (feature vectors) on the output map and delineate clusters and features of interest in the data. In this paper, we used graph-based visualizations to capture fMRI data features based upon 1) the distribution of data across the receptive fields of the prototypes (density-based connectivity); and 2) temporal similarities (correlations) between the prototypes (correlation-based connectivity). We applied this approach to identify task-related brain areas in an fMRI reaction time experiment involving a visuo-manual response task, and we correlated the time-to-peak of the fMRI responses in these areas with reaction time. Visualization of self-organizing maps outperformed independent component analysis and voxelwise univariate linear regression analysis in identifying and classifying relevant brain regions. We conclude that the graph-based visualizations of self-organizing maps help in advanced visualization of cluster boundaries in fMRI data enabling the separation of regions with small differences in the timings of their brain responses.	artificial neural network;classification;feature vector;graph - visual representation;imagery;independent component analysis;magnetic resonance imaging;network model;node - plant part;organizing (structure);regression analysis;self-organizing map;self-organization;unsupervised learning;fmri	Santosh B.

However, the difficulties associated with subjective prior elicitation have prevented the widespread adoption of the Bayesian methodology by the neuroimaging community. In this paper, we present a Bayesian multilevel model for the analysis of brain fMRI data. The main idea is to consider that all the estimated group effects (fMRI activation patterns) are exchangeable. This means that all the collected voxel time series are considered manifestations of a few common underlying phenomena. In contradistinction to other Bayesian approaches, we think of the estimated activations as multivariate random draws from the same distribution without imposing specific prior spatial and/or temporal information for the interaction between voxels. Instead, a two-stage empirical Bayes prior approach is used to relate voxel regression equations through correlations between the regression coefficient vectors. The adaptive shrinkage properties of the Bayesian multilevel methodology are exploited to deal with spatial variations, and noise outliers. The characteristics of the proposed model are evaluated by considering its application to two real data sets.	coefficient;magnetic resonance imaging;multilevel model;neuroimaging;time series;voxel;fmri	Adelino R.

a09bfce46b5552fbdd230917f6e0926d5f17009a	identification of critical areas for motor function recovery in chronic stroke subjects using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping	motor performance;motor function	INTRODUCTION Previous stroke studies using fMRI or lesion characterization methods to study the preservation of motor performance have been limited in defining anatomical structure critical for functional performance. This study attempts to overcome this limitation by using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) to identify specific anatomical regions required for preservation of motor function.   METHODS Forty-one moderate to moderately severe stroke subjects (upper extremity Fugl-Meyer between 28 and 50, Arm Motor Ability Test >35) were imaged with a 1 mm isotropic T1-weighted volumetric sequence, and their motor performance was assessed. The T1 volume images were normalized to a symmetric template using SPM5 and oriented so the lesion appeared in the left hemisphere. The lesioned areas were manually segmented on the normalized T1 image. All 3D lesion maps were entered into the VLSM analysis. Areas showing significant correlations with functional performance measures were identified using the false discovery rate corrected at p< or =0.05.   RESULTS The areas most correlated with a decrease in motor performance were at the junction of the corona radiata leading into the corticospinal tract. The Arm Motor Ability Test scores produced the most significant results, while the other measures showed similar anatomical patterns.   CONCLUSION The use of lesion symptom mapping in conjunction with behavioral measures produced anatomically specific results demonstrating that the area leading from the corticospinal tract to cortical motor areas is critical for maintaining hand motor performance after a stroke. This area may represent the joining of parallel redundant tracts that, when damaged, limit recovery potential.	anatomic structures;biologic preservation;cerebrovascular accident;classless inter-domain routing;clinical use template;corticospinal tracts;limb structure;map;moderate response;motor cortex;tract (literature);voxel;fmri	Ryan Lo;Darren R.

One possibility is that recollection reflects the operation of a continuous retrieval process, whereby test cues always elicit some information from memory. Alternatively, recollection may reflect the operation of a thresholded process that allows for retrieval failure, whereby test cues sometimes elicit no information from memory at all. Here we demonstrate that recollection is thresholded by measuring a commonly reported electrophysiological correlate of episodic retrieval--known as the Left Parietal old/new effect. We use a novel source task designed to directly measure the accuracy of retrieval success, finding that the neural correlate of retrieval was sensitive to the precision of responses when recollection succeeded, but was absent when recollection failed. The results clarify the nature of the neural mechanism underlying episodic memory, providing novel evidence in support of some-or-none threshold models of recollection.	memory disorders;memory, episodic;mental recall;neural correlates of consciousness	Jamie G.

This present study intended to label phagocytosing immune cells in the plaque periphery of APP23 mice in vivo by intraventricular injection of VSOP-C184, a phagocytosable iron oxide nanoparticle MRI contrast agent. Firstly, the dosages of 0.1, 1.0 and 10 micromol Fe/kg body weight dissolved in 500 nl of artificial cerebrospinal fluid, delivered by stereotaxic surgery were evaluated 4 h after surgery in 7 wild type mice using 7 T MRI. Secondly, the dosage of 1.0 micromol Fe/kg body weight was investigated in 6 APP23 mice. The distribution of iron oxide particles was evaluated histologically. The injection of 0.1 micromol Fe/kg body weight did not result in any signal alterations, 10 micromol resulted in strong signal artifacts. The delivery of 1.0 micromol Fe/kg body weight in wild type mice resulted in MRI signal alterations throughout the ventricular system without large artifacts. It was regarded superior to other dosages for the study of the transgenic mice. There was no difference in MRI signal alterations and the distribution of iron particles in the histology between APP23 and wild type mice using the dosage of 1.0 micromol Fe/kg body weight. Upon intraventricular injection, the phagocytosable contrast agent VSOP-C184 distributes throughout the ventricular system, whereas it does not reach the periphery of amyloid plaques in APP23 mice in a concentration sufficient to cause MRI signal alterations.	artificial nanoparticles;cerebral ventricles;cerebrospinal fluid;computer mouse;contrast media;dental plaque;dietary iron;dosage;experiment;field electron emission;hvcn1 gene;heart ventricle;human body weight;injections, intraventricular;microglia;micromole;morphologic artifacts;plaque, amyloid;senile plaques;video-in video-out;wild type;bacterium nlae-zl-c184;ferric oxide;sodium citrate	Adrian P.

Next, we extend the basic model to -ary decision making and show that it can also be used in conjunction with other population codes such as rate or even latency coding.	code;decision making;modulation;neuronal plasticity;synaptic package manager	Johannes Friedrich;Robert Urbanczik;Walter Senn	2010	Neural Computation	10.1162/neco.2010.05-09-1010	psychology;synaptic plasticity;complexity;population size;neuroscience;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;feedback;mathematics;coding;neural coding;communication;artificial neural network;models of neural computation	ML	21.077325910941443	-70.68838328992314	174144

Yet, our brain transforms patterns of light falling on our retina into a coherent percept within a few hundred milliseconds. Possibly, low-level neural responses already carry substantial information to facilitate rapid characterization of the visual input. Here, we computationally estimated low-level contrast responses to computer-generated naturalistic images, and tested whether spatial pooling of these responses could predict image similarity at the neural and behavioral level. Using EEG, we show that statistics derived from pooled responses explain a large amount of variance between single-image evoked potentials (ERPs) in individual subjects. Dissimilarity analysis on multi-electrode ERPs demonstrated that large differences between images in pooled response statistics are predictive of more dissimilar patterns of evoked activity, whereas images with little difference in statistics give rise to highly similar evoked activity patterns. In a separate behavioral experiment, images with large differences in statistics were judged as different categories, whereas images with little differences were confused. These findings suggest that statistics derived from low-level contrast responses can be extracted in early visual processing and can be relevant for rapid judgment of visual similarity. We compared our results with two other, well- known contrast statistics: Fourier power spectra and higher-order properties of contrast distributions (skewness and kurtosis). Interestingly, whereas these statistics allow for accurate image categorization, they do not predict ERP response patterns or behavioral categorization confusions. These converging computational, neural and behavioral results suggest that statistics of pooled contrast responses contain information that corresponds with perceived visual similarity in a rapid, low-level categorization task.	accidental falls;acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;area striata structure;autostereogram;categories;categorization;coherence (physics);computer-generated holography;confusion;convergence (action);erp;electroencephalography;extraction;high- and low-level;numerous;pooled sample;retina;sample variance	Iris I.

9fa485c422809340af4d1a51a97292de85acad36	a wave model of temporal sequence learning	sequential learning;learning processes;sequence learning;neurological organization;models;memory	Models of circuit action in the mammalian hippocampus have led us to a study of habituation circuits. In order to help model the process of habituation we consider here a memory network designed to learn sequences of inputs separated by various time intervals and to repeat these sequences when cued by their initial fragments. The structure of our model is based on the anatomy of the dentate gyrus region of the mammalian hippocampus, though our basic circuit theme is not unique to the hippocampus. Our model consists of a number of arrays of cells called lamellae. Each array consists of four lines of neuromimes coupled uniformly to neighbors within the array and with some randomness to neuromimes in other lamellae. All neuromimes operate according to first-order differential equations. Two of the neuromime lines in each lamella are coupled such that sufficient excitation by a system input generates a wave of activity that moves slowly along the lines away from the point of excitation. Such waves effect dynamic storage of the representation of each input, enabling association with the next inputu0027s representation via connections between lamellae. When an input is again presented to the memory, waves are excited which move through the system as before to generate the next inputu0027s representation after the proper time interval. The system thus implements a process of associative chaining. The memory circuit can be developed to allow further decisionary circuitry to react to any changes in the timing of regularly repeated inputs.		James C. Stanley;William L.

For these reasons realistic computational models of a motoneuron pool and the innervated muscle fibers (a “motor unit pool”) have an important role in the study of the human control of muscles. However such models are complex and their mathematical analysis is difficult. We present a system identification approach of a realistic motor unit pool model with the objective of obtaining a simpler model capable of representing the transduction of the motoneuron pool inputs into the force generated by the respective muscle. The system identification was based on an orthogonal least squares algorithm to find a NARMAX model, the input being the net dendritic excitatory synaptic conductance of the motoneurons and the output being the force produced by the muscle. The identified model output reproduced the mean behavior of the output from the realistic computational model even for input-output signals not used in the identification process, such as sinusoidally modulated output force signals.	algorithm;computation;computational model;conductance (graph);least squares;modulation;synaptic package manager;system identification;transduction (machine learning)	Renato Naville Watanabe;André Fabio Kohn	2014	5th IEEE RAS/EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics	10.1109/BIOROB.2014.6913845	simulation;engineering;artificial intelligence;machine learning	Robotics	15.255873794540223	-69.12283204398706	174488
2ee9978bcf9db7ed6224f1313dac5f8fd995bec1	confounds in multivariate pattern analysis: theory and rule representation case study		Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is a relatively recent innovation in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods. MVPA is increasingly widely used, as it is apparently more effective than classical general linear model analysis (GLMA) for detecting response patterns or representations that are distributed at a fine spatial scale. However, we demonstrate that widely used approaches to MVPA can systematically admit certain confounds that are appropriately eliminated by GLMA. Thus confounds rather than distributed representations may explain some cases in which MVPA produced positive results but GLMA did not. The issue is that it is common practice in MVPA to conduct group tests on single-subject summary statistics that discard the sign or direction of underlying effects, whereas GLMA group tests are conducted directly on single-subject effects themselves. We describe how this common MVPA practice undermines standard experiment design logic that is intended to control at the group level for certain types of confounds, such as time on task and individual differences. Furthermore, we note that a simple application of linear regression can restore experimental control when using MVPA in many situations. Finally, we present a case study with novel fMRI data in the domain of rule representations, or flexible stimulus-response mappings, which has seen several recent MVPA publications. In our new dataset, as with recent reports, standard MVPA appears to reveal rule representations in prefrontal cortex regions, whereas GLMA produces null results. However, controlling for a variable that is confounded with rule at the individual-subject level but not the group level (reaction time differences across rules) eliminates the MVPA results. This raises the question of whether recently reported results truly reflect rule representations, or rather the effects of confounds such as reaction time, difficulty, or other variables of no interest.	design of experiments;general linear model;norm (social);pattern recognition;prefrontal cortex;research design;resonance;rule (guideline);sensor;silo (dataset);spatial scale;fmri	Michael T.

In linear and semilinear Hebbian models, multiplicative synaptic normalization fails to segregate afferents whose activity patterns are positively correlated. To achieve this, the biologically problematic device of subtractive synaptic normalization must be used instead. Our own model of competition for neurotrophic support, which can segregate positively correlated afferents, was developed in part in an attempt to overcome these problems by removing the need for synaptic normalization altogether. However, we now show that the dynamics of our model decompose into two decoupled subspaces, with competitive dynamics being implemented in one of them through a nonlinear Hebb rule and multiplicative synaptic normalization. This normalization is emergent rather than imposed. We argue that these observations permit biologically plausible forms of synaptic normalization to be viewed as abstract and general descriptions of the underlying biology in certain scaleless models of synaptic plasticity.	database normalization;description;emergence;hebbian theory;neuronal plasticity;nonlinear system;semilinear response;synapse;synaptic package manager	Terry Elliott;Nigel Shadbolt	2002	Neural Computation	10.1162/089976602753712954	psychology;synaptic plasticity;neurology;neuroscience;developmental psychology;hebbian theory;anti-hebbian learning;lyapunov function;artificial intelligence	ML	21.01974345559259	-68.32015330074827	174963

However, the cerebro-cerebellar network for visual working memory is not as well defined. Our previous fMRI study showed superior and inferior cerebellar activations during a block design visual working memory task, but specific cerebellar contributions to cognitive processes in encoding, maintenance and retrieval have not yet been established. The current study examined cerebellar contributions to each of the components of visual working memory and presence of cerebellar hemispheric laterality was investigated. 40 young adults performed a Sternberg visual working memory task during fMRI scanning using a parametric paradigm. The contrast between high and low memory load during each phase was examined. We found that the most prominent activation was observed in vermal lobule VIIIb and bilateral lobule VI during encoding. Using a quantitative laterality index, we found that left-lateralized activation of lobule VIIIa was present in the encoding phase. In the maintenance phase, there was bilateral lobule VI and right-lateralized lobule VIIb activity. Changes in activation in right lobule VIIIa were present during the retrieval phase. The current results provide evidence that superior and inferior cerebellum contributes to visual working memory, with a tendency for left-lateralized activations in the inferior cerebellum during encoding and right-lateralized lobule VIIb activations during maintenance. The results of the study are in agreement with Baddeley's multi-component working memory model, but also suggest that stored visual representations are additionally supported by maintenance mechanisms that may employ verbal coding.	bilateral filter;breast lobule;cerebellar diseases;cerebellar model articulation controller;cognition;cortical cell layer of the cerebellum;functional laterality;handedness;memory disorders;memory, short-term;numerous;programming paradigm;fmri	M.

Do these findings indicate that oscillatory synchrony is an unspecific epiphenomenon occurring in any demanding task, or that oscillatory synchrony is a fundamental mechanism involved whenever neural cooperation is requested? If the latter hypothesis is true, then oscillatory synchrony should be specific, with distinct visual processes eliciting different types of oscillations. We recorded magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals while manipulating the grouping properties of a visual display on the one hand, and the focusing of attention to memorize part of this display on the other hand. Grouping-related gamma oscillations were present in all conditions but modulated by the grouping properties of the stimulus (one or two groups) in the high gamma-band (70120 Hz) at central occipital locations. Attention-related gamma oscillations appeared as an additional component whenever attentional focusing was requested in the low gamma-band (4466 Hz) at parietal locations. Our results thus reveal the existence of a functional specialization in the gamma range, with grouping-related oscillations showing up at higher frequencies than attention-related oscillations. The pattern of oscillatory synchrony is thus specific of the visual process it is associated with. Our results further suggest that both grouping processes and focused attention rely on a common implementation process, namely, gamma-band oscillatory synchrony, a finding that could account for the fact that coherent percepts are more likely to catch attention than incoherent ones.	action potentials;action potential;bands;bertrand (programming language);cognition;coherence (physics);dendritic spine;downstream (software development);epiphenomenon;frequency band;gamma correction;hl7publishingsubsection <operations>;hearing loss, high-frequency;hebbian theory;hertz (hz);input/output;interaction;interdependence;koch snowflake;magnetoencephalography;memory disorders;modulation;neural oscillation;neuron;neurons;partial template specialization;personnameuse - assigned;population;request - action;rule (guideline);synapses;synaptic package manager;synaptic potentials;tom gruber;virtual synchrony;word lists by frequency;xslt/muenchian grouping	Juan R.

The model consists of a set of retinotopically organized layers that label objects via temporal signal correlations (synchronization coding). The successive set of layers computes scale and position invariance and functions as a dynamic associative memory in which objects can invariantly be stored and retrieved. Model neurons are arranged in six layers and coupled in forward direction via feeding connections and in lateral and backward directions via linking connections. Feeding connections manage the function of feature extraction and pattern recognition while linking connections support synchronizations among mutually coupled neurons. The most important property of the associative memory is its ability to support the retinotopic representation of a visual object via selective backward paths. For this, a special backward network has been included that is selectively activated by the forward pathway performing the invariance operation from the retinotopic layers to the associative memory. If a certain object in the input pattern is recognized by the associative memory, the synchronized signals of the object's memory neurons are routed back selectively to that position of the retinotopic network where the object is actually represented. Due to this backward coupling, the affiliation of neurons to assemblies can be re-defined by modifying the temporal synchronizations in the retinotopic layers. We demonstrate the effect of top-down influence on figure/ground separation and pattern recognition for different visual objects and scenes in computer simulations. It improves the segmentation of images containing multiple objects, including overlapping patterns of equal brightness, and it improves the rate of recognition. It is probable that our model can also be modified for other sensory modalities and it is proposed that selective feedback routing is one of the possible roles the numerous cortical backward projections may play.	artificial neural network;map;network model	Michael Stöcker;Reinhard Eckhorn;Herbert J.

Low spatial frequencies (LSF) convey coarse information and are characterized by high luminance contrast, while high spatial frequencies (HSF) convey fine details and are characterized by low luminance contrast. In the present fMRI study, we examined how scene-selective regions-the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the occipital place area (OPA)-responded to spatial frequencies when contrast was either equalized or not equalized across spatial frequencies. Participants performed a categorization task on LSF, HSF and non-filtered scenes belonging to two different categories (indoors and outdoors). We either left contrast across scenes untouched, or equalized it using a root-mean-square contrast normalization. We found that when contrast remained unmodified, LSF and NF scenes elicited greater activation than HSF scenes in the PPA. However, when contrast was equalized across spatial frequencies, the PPA was selective to HFS. This suggests that PPA activity relies on an interaction between spatial frequency and contrast in scenes. In the RSC, LSF and NF elicited greater response than HSF scenes when contrast was not modified, while no effect of spatial frequencies appeared when contrast was equalized across filtered scenes, suggesting that the RSC is sensitive to high-contrast information. Finally, we observed selective activation of the OPA in response to HSF, irrespective of contrast manipulation. These results provide new insights into how scene-selective areas operate during scene processing.	categories;categorization;convolutional code;hearing loss, high-frequency;hyalinosis, systemic;hypothalamic area, lateral;lsf;new foundations;noise figure;occipital lobe;opa;remodels the structure of chromatin;retrosplenial cortex	Louise Kauffmann;Stephen Ramanoël;Nathalie Guyader;Alan Chauvin;Carole Peyrin	2015	NeuroImage	10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.02.058	psychology;computer vision;spatial frequency;communication	HCI	17.01968470055171	-74.95475858271769	175240

We aimed at specifying the common and differential neural mechanisms of self- and other-related attribution of emotional states using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects viewed faces expressing emotions with direct or averted gaze and either focused on their own emotional response to each face (self-task) or evaluated the emotional state expressed by the face (other-task). The common network activated by both tasks included the left lateral orbito-frontal and medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC), bilateral inferior frontal cortices, superior temporal sulci and temporal poles, as well as the right cerebellum. In a subset of these regions, neural activity was significantly correlated with empathic abilities. The self- (relative to the other-) task differentially activated the MPFC, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, and the temporo-parietal junction bilaterally. Empathy-related processing of emotional facial expressions recruited brain areas involved in mirror neuron and theory-of-mind (ToM) mechanisms. The differential engagement of the MPFC, the PCC/precuneus, and temporo-parietal regions in the self-task indicates that these structures act as key players in the evaluation of one's own emotional state during empathic face-to-face interaction. Activation of mirror neurons in a task relying on empathic abilities without explicit task-related motor components supports the view that mirror neurons are not only involved in motor cognition but also in emotional interpersonal cognition. An interplay between ToM and mirror neuron mechanisms may hold for the maintenance of a self-other distinction during empathic interpersonal face-to-face interactions.	bilateral filter;cerebellum;cerebral cortex;cingulate cortex;cognition disorders;emotional states;emotions;empathy;epilepsy, temporal lobe;face;facial muscles;inference;interaction;lateral thinking;medial dorsal nucleus;medial graph;mental state;mirror neurons;parietal lobe;portable c compiler;resonance;structure of precuneus;subgroup;wnt signaling pathway involved in midbrain dopaminergic neuron differentiation;attribution;fmri;frontal lobe	Martin Schulte-Rüther;Hans Joachim Markowitsch;Gereon R.

b300ba43edb9e5b55be7aee72b89040dc05d5bed	characterization of myocardial motion patterns by unsupervised multiple kernel learning	multiple kernel learning;myocardial motion;echocardiography;pattern analysis	We propose an independent objective method to characterize different patterns of functional responses to stress in the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) syndrome by combining multiple temporally-aligned myocardial velocity traces at rest and during exercise, together with temporal information on the occurrence of cardiac events (valves openings/closures and atrial activation). The method builds upon multiple kernel learning, a machine learning technique that allows the combination of data of different nature and the reduction of their dimensionality towards a meaningful representation (output space). The learning process is kept unsupervised, to study the variability of the input traces without being conditioned by data labels. To enhance the physiological interpretation of the output space, the variability that it encodes is analyzed in the space of input signals after reconstructing the velocity traces via multiscale kernel regression. The methodology was applied to 2D sequences from a stress echocardiography protocol from 55 subjects (22 healthy, 19 HFPEF and 14 breathless subjects). The results confirm that characterization of the myocardial functional response to stress in the HFPEF syndrome may be improved by the joint analysis of multiple relevant features.	alignment;biologic preservation;carpal tunnel syndrome;dimensionality reduction;dyspnea;echocardiography;echocardiography, stress;ejection fraction (procedure);functional response;heart atrium;heart failure;heart rate variability;kernel (operating system);machine learning;multiple kernel learning;myocardium;spatial variability;stress ball;sturge-weber syndrome;tracing (software);unsupervised learning;velocity (software development)	Sergio Sanchez-Martinez;Nicolas Duchateau;Tamás Erdei;Alan Fraser;Bart Bijnens;Gemma Piella	2017	Medical image analysis	10.1016/j.media.2016.06.007	computer vision;computer science;machine learning;pattern recognition;mathematics	ML	23.30016065457135	-78.82865267741315	175359
5e9bc781a11e0ea6ee009bc3f69cad2a4b4cd23c	discriminative analysis of non-linear brain connectivity for leukoaraiosis with resting-state fmri	functional magnetic resonance imaging;brain;networks;strength;dementia	ABSTRACT Leukoaraiosis (LA) describes diffuse white matter abnormalities on CT or MR brain scans, often seen in the normal elderly and in association with vascular risk factors such as hypertension, or in the context of cognitive impairment. The mechanism of cognitive dysfunction is still unclear. The recent clinical studies have revealed that the severity of LA was not corresponding to the cognitive level, and functional connectivity analysis is an appropriate method to detect the relation between LA and cognitive decline. However, existing functional connectivity analyses of LA have been mostly limited to linear associations. In this investigation, a novel measure utilizing the extended maximal information coefficient (eMIC) was applied to cons truct non-linear functional connectivity in 44 LA subjects (9 dementia, 25 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 10 cognitively normal (CN)). The strength of non-linear functional connections for the first 1% of discriminative power increased in MCI compared with CN and deme ntia, which was opposed to its linear counterpart. Further functional network analysis revealed th at the changes of the non-linear and linear connectivity have similar but not completely the same spatial distribution in hu man brain. In the multivariate pattern analysis with multiple classifiers, the non-linear functional connectivity mostly identified dementia, MCI and CN from LA with a relatively higher accuracy rate than the linear measure. Our findings revealed the non-linear functional connectivity provided useful discriminative power in classification of LA, and the spatial distributed changes between the non-linear and linear measure may indicate the underlying mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in LA. Keywords: extended maximal information coefficient (eMIC), Leukoaraiosis, non-linear brain connectivity, classification, cognitive decline, resting-state fMRI.	nonlinear system;resting state fmri	Youzhi Lai;Lele Xu;Li Yao;Xia Wu	2015		10.1117/12.2081378	artificial intelligence;resting state fmri	Robotics	22.381049733898394	-78.83090699511057	175436

In humans, such bilateral activation of SI is considered controversial due to highly variable detection rates for the much weaker ipsilateral response across different studies (ranging from 3% to 100%). Second-order blind identification (SOBI) is a blind source separation algorithm that has been successfully used to isolate neuronal signals from functionally distinct brain regions, including the left- and right-SI. SOBI-aided extraction of left- and right-SI responses to median nerve stimulation from high-density EEG has been previously validated against the fMRI and MEG literature. Here, we applied SOBI to EEG data and examined whether relatively weaker ipsilateral activations could be reliably detected across subjects. In single subject analysis, statistically significant somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to unilateral stimulation were detected from both SI contralateral to and SI ipsilateral to the side of stimulation. Furthermore, these ipsilateral responses were observed in both the left and right hemispheres of all 10 subjects studied. Together these results demonstrate that unilateral stimulation of the median nerve, whether applied to the left or right wrist, can activate both the left- and right-SI, raising the possibility that in humans, unilateral sensory input may be bilaterally represented at the lowest level of cortical processing.	abducens nerve diseases;acoustic evoked brain stem potentials;bilateral filter;blind signal separation;deciduous tooth;electroencephalography;humans;magnetoencephalography;neuromodulation (medicine);primates;sacral nerve stimulation;silicon;somatosensory cortex;somatosensory evoked potentials;source separation;structure of median nerve;subject indexing;vagus nerve stimulation;algorithm;fmri	Matthew T.

It is related to properties of cortical gamma oscillations as expressed with the communication-through-coherence hypothesis. The rhythm dominating among excitatory units is imprinted on the inhibitory units through columnar couplings. Excitatory units that participate in the dominating rhythm may escape the feedback from the inhibitory pool through being active in the time windows given by the minima of the inhibitory effect. The activity of other units is suppressed. Constituting an excitatory rhythm that is compatible with the inhibitory one, the participating units comprise the winning patterns. This windowing mechanism is specified through giving an oscillatory network model and demonstrating it with image processing examples. Thereby, we also provide a gradient system formulation for inhibitory generation of synchrony. & 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis and simulations demonstrated the need to include a large number of parallel bers (244,000) to obtain realistic Purkinje cell ring patterns for random mossy ber input. Using smaller numbers of parallel ber inputs resulted in unrealistic Purkinje cell spiking characterized by spontaneous dendritic calcium spikes. Because the scale required is beyond workstation capabilites, we used a 128-processor Cray T3E running PGENESIS. This size network could produce realistic spiking patterns provided the stellate cell inhibition was tuned carefully.	cray t3e;multi-compartment model;network model;simulation;spontaneous order;workstation	Fredrick W.

806a24b81da2d691f98c530275255c40bff47427	multiscale modeling of dependencies between spikes and fields		Measuring and modeling the brain at multiple spatiotemporal scales are important for studying brain function and developing high-performance brain-machine interfaces. To better understand neural encoding of behavior, the conditional dependencies between different scales of brain activity should be considered in the multiscale modeling framework. Here, we develop a new multiscale model that characterizes the conditional dependence between spikes and fields during behavior. We modeled this mutual dependence by incorporating the effect of field features on each neuron's firing rate function. To reduce the number of model parameters to be learned, we assumed that the strength of dependency between a pair of neuron and field feature is a function of the distance between electrodes from which they are recorded. We then constructed the shape of this unknown spatial dependency function with a weighted sum of Gaussian kernels. We devised an unsupervised learning algorithm using expectation-maximization to learn the kernel weights as well as other model parameters. Using simulated data, we show that this learning algorithm accurately identifies the multiscale model parameters and the conditional dependency functions. This modeling and learning framework can help study spike-field encoding and dependencies and could enhance future neurotechnologies.	brain–computer interface;electroencephalography;expectation–maximization algorithm;multiscale modeling;neural coding;neuron;neurotechnology;unsupervised learning;weight function	Hamidreza Abbaspourazad;Han-Lin Hsieh;Maryam M.

We propose a three-state Markov model to simulate the individual contribution of each channel. Rather than using a statistical approximation, we actually consider each individual channel transitions between states and evaluate the unitary channel current. We compare this aggregated unitary contributions with simulated whole cell currents, both in response to a depolarising voltage pulse. On the computational side, we have employed a parameter-sweep, component based approach. Being embarrassingly parallel by design, we have parallelised it in a naive manner. We argue its possible extension using algorithmic skeletons.

A Certainty Equivalent procedure was used during functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural substrates that are important for nonlinear transformation of probabilities to decision weights. Differential activation in the anterior cingulate cortex during high versus low probability prospects correlated (r = 0.84, P < 0.01) with the degree of the nonlinearity of the transformation of probabilities to decision weights, which indicates that risk-seeking behavior for low probability prospects and risk-averse decision-making for mid to high probability prospects may be due to a lack of controlled processing by the anterior cingulate cortex.	childhood immunization;cingulate cortex;cognitive model;decision making;magnetic resonance imaging;nonlinear system;probability;risk aversion;weight function;fmri	Martin P.

314d08f3bcd035ecdc9d77cc7963517c37e93caf	neuronal projections can be sharpened by a biologically plausible learning mechanism	recurrent networks;self organization;early development	It is known that neurons can project topographically to their target area, and reciprocal projections back from the target area are typically aligned with the forward projection. However, the wide terminal arbors of individual axons limit the precision of such anatomical reciprocity. This leaves open the question of whether more precise reciprocal connectivity is obtainable through the adjustment of synaptic strengths. We have found that such a sharpening of projections can indeed result from a combination of biologically plausible mechanisms, namely Hebbian learning at synapses, continuous winner-take-all circuitry within areas, and homeostatic activity regulation within neurons. We show that this combination of mechanisms, which we refer to collectively as “sharp learning”, is capable of sharpening inter-area projections in a variety of network architectures. Sharp learning offers an explanation for how precise topographic and reciprocal connections can emerge, even in early development.	electronic circuit;hebbian theory;homeostasis;synaptic package manager;topography	Matthew Cook;Florian Jug;Christoph Krautz	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-21735-7_13	self-organization;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;mathematics	ML	19.642833758950456	-69.11452645176402	177059
c95ee9141151a805d295eae4ec6319737415c614	research of hubs location method for weighted brain network based on nos-fa		As a complex network of many interlinked brain regions, there are some central hub regions which play key roles in the structural human brain network based on T1 and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technology. Since most studies about hubs location method in the whole human brain network are mainly concerned with the local properties of each single node but not the global properties of all the directly connected nodes, a novel hubs location method based on global importance contribution evaluation index is proposed in this study. The number of streamlines (NoS) is fused with normalized fractional anisotropy (FA) for more comprehensive brain bioinformation. The brain region importance contribution matrix and information transfer efficiency value are constructed, respectively, and then by combining these two factors together we can calculate the importance value of each node and locate the hubs. Profiting from both local and global features of the nodes and the multi-information fusion of human brain biosignals, the experiment results show that this method can detect the brain hubs more accurately and reasonably compared with other methods. Furthermore, the proposed location method is used in impaired brain hubs connectivity analysis of schizophrenia patients and the results are in agreement with previous studies.	anatomic node;betweenness;complex network;conflict (psychology);correlative study;diffusion tensor imaging;folic acid;fractional anisotropy;iterative reconstruction;node - plant part;numerous;patients;schizophrenia;total correlation;usb hub;weight	Zhengkui Weng;Bin Wang;Jie Xue;Baojie Yang;Hui Liu;Xin Xiong	2017		10.1155/2017/6174090	complex network;artificial intelligence;machine learning;computer science;fractional anisotropy;pattern recognition;information transfer;human brain;diffusion mri	ML	22.69746836137304	-78.46126815044612	177064

The theory proposes that input data are temporally grouped and used to predict and estimate the motion flows in the image sequence. This temporal grouping can be considered a generalization of the data association techniques that engineers use to study motion sequences. Our temporal grouping theory is expressed in terms of the Bayesian generalization of standard Kalman filtering. To implement the theory, we derive a parallel network that shares some properties of cortical networks. Computer simulations of this network demonstrate that our theory qualitatively accounts for psychophysical experiments on motion occlusion and motion outliers. In deriving our theory, we assumed spatial factorizability of the probability distributions and made the approximation of updating the marginal distributions of velocity at each point. This allowed us to perform local computations and simplified our implementation. We argue that these approximations are suitable for the stimuli we are considering (for which spatial coherence effects are negligible).	approximation;assumed;coherence (physics);computation;correspondence problem;engineering;experiment;flow;generalization (psychology);kalman filter;marginal model;motion estimation;simulation;temporal logic;velocity (software development)	Pierre-Yves Burgi;Alan L.

0cac9afe3b03c2a8fa69eff8c316cb732d527a29	fmri resting state analysis using empirical mode decomposition		The paper studies connectivity pattern between two functionally specialized brain areas: the primary motor area and the occipital (visual) cortex in the resting state fMRI using empirical mode decomposition (EMD). EMD enables identification of low frequency oscillatory modes in the resting state range [0, 01-0, 1 Hz]. Three frequency modes were determined in the resting state band in 13 subjects with the mean frequencies 0,07Hz, 0,034Hz and 0,016Hz. The temporal correlations among the oscillatory modes were strongest within homologous (corresponding) sources in left and right hemisphere, and weakest between the motor-occipital fMRI signal pairs. The functional connectivity - spatial distribution of temporal correlations in the resting state - has been identified and refined by the oscillatory modes. Connectivity graph obtained across all subjects and all IMFs showed high connectivity rate between homologous areas in the left and right hemisphere and among the visual cortex areas. Combining EMD with the Hilbert transformation may provide an additional tool for exploring correlations between frequency and amplitude ridges in task related problems.	hilbert–huang transform;homology (biology);resting state fmri	Kristina Vakarov;Tatjana Loncar-Turukalo;Katarina Koprivsek;Milos Lucic;Olivera Sveljo	2016	2016 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics (SISY)	10.1109/SISY.2016.7601487	speech recognition;machine learning;mathematics;communication	Embedded	20.40904075673099	-77.36452473025066	177293
