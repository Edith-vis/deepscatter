8bc1068ab1b0ce9a614c372527ecea451e4551ce	study of electroencephalographic signal regularity for automatic emotion recognition		Nowadays, emotional intelligence plays a key role in improving human-machine interaction (HMI). The main objective of HMI is to fill the gap between human emotional states and the reaction of a computer in accordance with this feeling. However, there is a lack of mathematical emotional models to implement affective computing systems into real applications. Consequently, this paper explores the properties of the nonlinear methodology based on Quadratic Sample Entropy (QSE) for the recognition of different emotional subspaces. Precisely, 665 segments of 32-channel electroencephalographic recordings from 32 subjects elicited with different emotional stimuli have been analyzed to validate the proposed model. Results conclude that QSE is a promising feature to be taken into account. Indeed, this metric has reported a discriminant ability around 72% using a support vector machine classifier. This result is comparable with the outcomes reported by other more complex methodologies which use multi-parametric analysis.	electroencephalography;emotion recognition	Arturo Martínez-Rodrigo;Beatriz García-Martínez;Raúl Alcaraz;Antonio Fernández-Caballero;Pascual González	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-67585-5_74	support vector machine;machine learning;computer science;human–computer interaction;affective computing;feeling;emotion recognition;sample entropy;speech recognition;emotional intelligence;artificial intelligence	NLP	10.539839499121687	-94.46712574350197	137957
7198286333c0ac9db3d90aec4e5160a384819883	a maximum likelihood formulation to exploit heart rate variability for robust heart rate estimation from facial video		The problem of estimating the heart rate (HR) from a racial video is considered. A typical approach for this problem is to use independent component analysis (ICA) on the red, blue, green intensity prof iles averaged over the facial region. This provides estimates of the underlying source signals, whose spectral peaks are used to predict HR in every analysis window. In this work, we propose a maximum likelihood formulation to optimally select a source signal in each window such that the predicted HR trajectory not only corresponds to the most likely spectral peaks but also ensures a realistic HR variability (HRV) across analysis windows. The likelihood function is efficiently optimized using dynamic programming in a manner similar to Viterbi decoding. The proposed scheme for HR estimation is denoted by vICA. The performance of vICA is compared with a typical ICA approach as well as a recently proposed sparse spectral peak tracking (SSPT) technique that ensures that the predicted HR does not vary drastically across analysis windows. Experiments are performed in a five fold setup using racial videos of 15 subjects recorded using two types of smartphones (Samsung Galaxy and iPhone) at three different distances (6inches, lfoot, 2feet) between the phone camera and the subject. Mean absolute error (MAE) between the original and predicted HR reveals that the proposed vICA scheme performs better than the best of the baseline schemes, namely SSPT by −8.69%, 52.77% and 8.00% when Samsung Galaxy phone was used at a distance of 6inches, lfoot, and 2feet respectively. These improvements are 12.13%, 13.59% and 18.34% when iPhone was used. This, in turn, suggests that the HR predicted from a racial video becomes more accurate when the smoothness of HRV is utilized in predicting the HR trajectory as done in the proposed vICA.	approximation error;baseline (configuration management);camera phone;decoder device component;distance;dynamic programming;estimated;experiment;heart failure;heart rate variability;independent computing architecture;independent component analysis;isoleucine;likelihood functions;mathematical optimization;microsoft windows;preparation;real-time computing;smartphone;sparse matrix;viterbi algorithm;viterbi decoder;window function;videocassette	T RaseenaK.;Prasanta Kumar Ghosh	2018	2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513483	heart rate variability;viterbi decoder;camera phone;microsoft windows;computer vision;independent component analysis;dynamic programming;trajectory;likelihood function;computer science;pattern recognition;artificial intelligence	Vision	19.746255346447352	-96.07176664161753	141980
0c453859b7522497ee7eeefc27f150cd258d50ac	robustness of surface emg classifiers with fixed-point decomposition on reconfigurable architecture		To the present day, the control of prosthetic mechanisms and the classification of surface Electro-Myography (sEMG) signals is heavily influenced by multiple factors, such as the overall quality of the signal acquired, the number and the position of electrodes, and unwanted noise or crosstalk between them. For this reason, the technological state-of-the-art is moving from the analysis of low-order features (e.g. Median Absolute Value and spectral features) that could suffer the aforementioned issues, to more complex techniques, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) separation Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) decomposition of signal channels. The latter hypothesizes a high-order modular control of muscles at the Central Nervous System (CNS) level built upon coordinated motor patterns (called muscle synergies), and it removes the limitations on Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) per electrode given by standard sEMG controllers. Unfortunately, the utilisation of such techniques in prosthetics is limited by their computational complexity, which limits them to research laboratories and bulky processing systems, calling for novel algorithms and hardware implementations that achieve same the level of accuracy and speed necessary for movement control, while minimizing the power consumption and the device size. This paper presents a FPGA-based, real-time NMF processor that extracts muscle synergies from a 8-electrode sEMG recording. The execution of the NMF algorithm is entirely performed using a fixed-point architecture, in order to increase computation speed and minimize the amount of DSPs used. The NMF fixed-point decomposition is then fed to two software different classifiers, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Neural Network, in order to quantify the degradation of the accuracy given by fixed-point calculations and to understand which mechanism is more robust. Preliminary results show that there are no remarkable differences between the classification results obtained using floating-point or fixed-point operations.	algorithm;artificial neural network;cns;computation;computational complexity theory;control system;crosstalk;digital signal processor;electromyography;elegant degradation;field-programmable gate array;fixed point (mathematics);fixed-point arithmetic;independent component analysis;long short-term memory;microsoft windows;non-negative matrix factorization;numerical analysis;real-time clock;spatial variability;speedup;statistical classification;support vector machine;synergy	Luca Cerina;Giuseppe Franco;Pierandrea Cancian;Marco D.

d3e727ba951629ceba264b8db2d6d5b663dfaf4a	speech reconstruction from human auditory cortex with deep neural networks		We examined the accuracy of the reconstructed speech spectrograms from neural responses recorded intracranially in human auditory cortex. Electrodes were implanted over the cortex of epilepsy patients for the localization of seizures, and neural responses were recorded as the subjects passively listened to continuous speech. We compared the reconstructed spectrograms estimated with two different models: a linear regression model and a deep neural network. Compared with linear regression model, the reconstructed spectrograms from the deep neural network achieved a higher average correlation with the original spectrograms. In addition, the reconstructed spectrograms from the neural network better preserved the average acoustic features of phones. We further investigated how changing the number of hidden layers in the network affects the reconstruction accuracy and found a better performance with deeper networks, particularly in the reconstruction of spectrotemporal modulation content of speech. These findings reveal the efficacy of deep neural network models in decoding speech signals from neural responses and provide a method for improving the performance of brain computer interfaces with prosthetic applications.	acoustic cryptanalysis;artificial neural network;deep learning;modulation;spectrogram;time-compressed speech	Minda Yang;Sameer A.

d0ca90ba35e01261d4312e1c42d5044b3502ca5b	adversarial domain adaptation for stable brain-machine interfaces		Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have recently emerged as a clinically viable option to restore voluntary movements after paralysis. These devices are based on the ability to extract information about movement intent from neural signals recorded using multi-electrode arrays chronically implanted in the motor cortices of the brain. However, the inherent loss and turnover of recorded neurons requires repeated recalibrations of the interface, which can potentially alter the day-to-day user experience. The resulting need for continued user adaptation interferes with the natural, subconscious use of the BMI. Here, we introduce a new computational approach that decodes movement intent from a low-dimensional latent representation of the neural data. We implement various domain adaptation methods to stabilize the interface over significantly long times. This includes Canonical Correlation Analysis used to align the latent variables across days; this method requires prior point-to-point correspondence of the time series across domains. Alternatively, we match the empirical probability distributions of the latent variables across days through the minimization of their Kullback-Leibler divergence. These two methods provide a significant and comparable improvement in the performance of the interface. However, implementation of an Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network trained to match the empirical probability distribution of the residuals of the reconstructed neural signals outperforms the two methods based on latent variables, while requiring remarkably few data points to solve the domain adaptation problem.

Based on the conversion, we proposed a unified data format for Holter data, whose sampling frequency and sampling precision are settled. Thus, other Holter data could be converted to our unified data format, which is much easier for data sharing and unified Holter data management.	han unification	Jiali Wang;Yue Zhang	2014		10.1109/ICMB.2014.32	electronic engineering;speech recognition;computer science;data mining	DB	21.506585319183674	-94.64433791061742	167740

Simultaneous hand movements are characterized by single coordinated patterns of digit movements, while sequential hand movements involve sequences of such patterns. Here, we investigate the extent of the coordination among 15 hand-joints during simultaneous hand movements, and demonstrate that it leads to a concise representation that facilitates movement recognition. Principal component analysis (PCA), performed in the 15-dimensional (15-D) joint-space, indicates that the first principal-component captures more than 98% of the variability in individual hand movements. Consequently, the first principal direction provides a 15-D feature-vector that describes the underlying-coordination and can be used for automatic recognition. We evaluated this recognition strategy on a set of nine simultaneous hand-movements using a database of six users, each performing six sessions. A dedicated classifier for each user resulted in recognition rates of 97.0plusmn4.7% during testing, while a single generic classifier achieved 95.2plusmn2.5% recognition rates. We conclude that the suggested feature-vector captures the invariant structure of simultaneous hand-movements, facilitates their recognition, and may provide insight into motor planning	articular system;classification;digit structure;feature vector;manipulation procedure;movement;principal component analysis;spatial variability	Iris Dejmal;Miriam Zacksenhouse	2006	IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering	10.1109/TBME.2006.883795	computer vision;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;biomechanics;machine learning;communication;principal component analysis	Vision	12.346499027497533	-94.71776003522272	174137

Electromyogram (EMG) signals, which are derived from the neuromuscular system, provide an important access to the human-robot interface. On one hand, EMG signals can be used for real-time estimation of the motion intention of human body, e.g., the current joint angle status. On the other hand, however, the process of the mass EMG data, which are captured instantaneously from skin surface, challenges the state-of-the-art technology. Because its non-stationary and randomness, it is difficult to extract the valuable and stable features from the raw EMG signals. This paper investigates into the learning process of high dimensional EMG signals with a hierarchical mechanism that projects the original data into a lower feature space to achieve a local refined mapping from the EMG signals to the motion states of the human body. This hierarchically projected regression algorithm constructs incrementally a tree-based knowledge library, whose components represent local regression models. The components will be retrieved online efficiently and contribute to the estimation of the motion states. A great number of experiments are carried out to evaluate the accuracy of this novel algorithm.	algorithm;electromyography;experiment;feature vector;k-means clustering;kinesiology;map;powered exoskeleton;proteomics;randomness;real-time locating system;recursion;robot;robotic arm;stationary process;tree (data structure)	Yang Chen;Xingang Zhao;Jianda Han	2012	Neural Computing and Applications	10.1007/s00521-012-1045-8	simulation;speech recognition;exoskeleton;computer science;machine learning;linear discriminant analysis;k-means clustering	AI	16.074316214623355	-95.15482702424302	189344

We introduce new update formulas for otherwise time-demanding calculations of window based current mean and variance of the signal. Those were required for efficient realtime time series data processing. We discuss the formulas with the help of synthetic data. They differ from existing incremental calculations due to a decremental component, because of samples leaving the window of observation. An example application for EMG-based movement onset prediction is presented.	algorithm;electroencephalography;electromyography;field-programmable gate array;human–computer interaction;onset (audio);polynomial;signal processing;synthetic data;time series;traffic collision avoidance system;user interface	Mario Michael Krell;Marc Tabie;Hendrik Woehrle;Elsa Andrea Kirchner	2013		10.5220/0004633800410045	electroencephalography;signal processing;artificial intelligence;computer science;pattern recognition	ML	15.94261372210284	-95.19960975484429	194346
03ba007946410f0783ee46213015c9ef5ca3207a	selection of stable features for modeling 4-d affective space from eeg recording		Recent advances in neuroscience made it possible to understand how the human brain processes emotions and affective states. However, the modeling of emotion remains elusive due to inherent ambiguity and complexity related to the perception of emotions, interpersonal variabilities, and context-specific interpretations. Here, we present a robust method of modeling 4-D continuous affective space (Valence, Arousal, Like, and Dominance). First, we determined the functional areas and frequency bands related to 4-D affective space. Second, we extracted and selected a set of stable features. For both steps, we used two different feature selection methods namely: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and stability selection method. Moreover, compare their performances. For the RFE, we used Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Tree-based bagging, and for the stability selection, we used Randomized Lasso as an estimator. Empirical analysis on the DEAP data set shows that the stability selection method consistently provides relevant set of bands, electrode location and features over a range of model parameters. We also observed that only a small number of locations (40%–63%) and certain frequency bands specifically, gamma band frequency over Superior Temporal Gyrus, Supramarginal Gyrus, and Somatosensory Association Cortex were the highest ranked features across the affective dimensions. The selected features using the stability criteria were used to model 4-D affective space using SVR. Empirical analyses shows that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for Valence, Arousal, Dominance, and Like are 2.13, 2.00, 2.07, and 2.11 respectively. In addition, we also compare the performance of this method with feature fusion and ensemble classification. It was observed that the SVR with selected features outperformed all other approaches. The predicted Valence-Arousal-Dominance were converted to categorical emotions for seamless interpretation.	bibo stability;complexity;computation;condition number;electroencephalography;feature selection;frequency band;lasso;performance;radio frequency;random forest;randomized algorithm;recursion (computer science);seamless3d;support vector machine	Rakib Al-Fahad;Mohammed Yeasin;A.
