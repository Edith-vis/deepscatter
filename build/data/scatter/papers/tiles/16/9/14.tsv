We first investigate a tradeoff between the rate selection and user selection through two extreme scheduling criteria: retransmission oriented scheduling (ROS) and mixed scheduling (MS) criteria. Then, we propose a baseline procedure for the joint rate adaptation and user scheduling (JRAUS). Based on the baseline procedure, we introduce a conventional MS-based JRAUS policy, our proposed ROS-based JRAUS policy, and reference JRAUS policies. Finally, through system-level simulations, we evaluate the system performance of the proposed ROS-based JRAUS policy, compared with the conventional and reference JRAUS policies, in homogeneous and heterogeneous mobility scenarios. Through this study, we find that the rate adaptation is not only important in a single point-to-point link but also is very significant in HARQ-based multi-user systems with heterogeneous mobility. Moreover, the rate adaptation needs to be more carefully considered than the user scheduling in heterogeneous mobility scenarios.	baseline (configuration management);heterogeneous system architecture;hybrid automatic repeat request;korea computer center;multi-user;numerical analysis;point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);retransmission (data networks);scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Su Min Kim;Bang Chul Jung;Wan Choi;Dan Keun Sung	2012	2012 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6380931	fair-share scheduling;fixed-priority pre-emptive scheduling;real-time computing;telecommunications;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;deadline-monotonic scheduling;round-robin scheduling;computer network	Mobile	14.850914739741778	93.92667760662486	90475

Generally speaking, routing enables Secondary Users (SUs) to select optimal routes, while minimizing interference to Primary Users (PUs), which is a key requirement of CRNs. Nevertheless, there has been limited research in the literature for routing schemes that consider both SUs' interference to PUs and network-wide performance of SUs. This paper proposes a novel Cognitive Radio Q-routing (CRQ-routing) scheme, which aims to take account of SU-to-PU interference and SUs' end-to-end delay. Traditionally, routing schemes have been designed for specific applications and may not achieve the optimum network-wide performance in most kinds of network scenarios. In this paper, CRQ-routing has been shown to achieve network-wide performance in scenarios with various levels of channel dynamicity and unpredictability in regards to PU activities. Furthermore, CRQ-routing is simple to implement since it does not require additional hardware or geographical information. Basically, CRQ-routing is a Reinforcement Learning- (RL-) based approach that provides intelligence to SUs so that they can learn to make dynamic and efficient routing decisions on the fly while addressing the important characteristics of CRNs namely, dynamicity and unpredictability of channel availability, and SUs' interference to PUs. Simulation results show that CRQ-routing reduces the interference to PUs for up to 43% compared to traditional routing schemes, and it achieves lower end-to-end delay under highly unpredictable PU activities.	coexist (image);cognitive radio;cross-recurrence quantification;end-to-end principle;ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);link-state routing protocol;network packet;network performance;on the fly;one-class classification;performance evaluation;queuing delay;reinforcement learning;routing table;shortest path problem;simulation;superuser;throughput	Hasan A.

For this, we first develop efficient and exact computational tools using column generation with greedy pricing that allow us to compute exact solutions for networks significantly larger than what has been possible so far. We also develop very fast approximations that compute nearly optimal solutions for even larger cases. Finally, we adapt our tools to the case of proportional fairness and show that the engineering insights are very similar.	approximation;column generation;fairness measure;greedy algorithm;loss function;mesh networking;optimization problem;proportionally fair;routing;throughput;wireless mesh network	Jun Luo;Catherine Rosenberg;André Girard	2010	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2010.2041788	column generation;wireless mesh network;pricing;routing;throughput;greedy algorithm;real-time computing;power control;computer science;distributed computing;interference;scheduling;approximation algorithm;computer network	Mobile	16.427437618190734	94.22368684366768	91915

We propose packet schedulers that meet individual per-packet maximum-delay constraints and present their performance. The main emphasis is on deriving an easy-to-implement scheduler with low average power consumption in a Rayleigh fading channel, and to identify areas of potential improvements. We firstly outline the structure of the optimal scheduler with prescient knowledge of the channel and the traffic pattern, and an efficient algorithm to derive this optimal schedule. This provides a baseline for comparison for all other schedulers. From the insight gained in the study of the prescient optimal scheduler, we remove algorithmic dependency on the future to derive a practical scheduler that has energy usage at most 6 dB away from the prescient optimal at 0.1% probability of bit outage under Rayleigh fading conditions.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);causal filter;downtime;heuristic;mathematical optimization;network packet;rayleigh fading;robust optimization;scheduling (computing);sun outage	Shyh-hao Kuo;James K.

Whereas traditionally max-min fairness protocols have been developed for wired networks (where interference is not a factor for network performance), in this paper we investigate the problem of flow routing and fair bandwidth allocation under the constraints of the physical interference model for multihop wireless networks. A max-min fair (MMF) routing algorithm under physical interference constraints is proposed where multiple candidate paths coexist for each user to the base station. The algorithm is formulated as a multicommodity flow problem where the lexicographically largest bandwidth allocation vector is found among all optimal allocation vectors. We compare our approach with two MMF interference routing algorithms in the literature that use the protocol interference model to garner fair bandwidth allocation. We show that our algorithm performs better in terms of blocking probability, bandwidth usage and link load.	algorithm;blocking (computing);catastrophic interference;coexist (image);erlang (unit);fairness measure;flow network;incremental funding methodology;interference (communication);lexicographical order;mathematical optimization;max-min fairness;maxima and minima;multipath propagation;multipath routing;multistage interconnection networks;network performance;scheduling (computing);throughput	Preetha Thulasiraman;Jiming Chen;Xuemin Shen	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502063	wireless routing protocol;max-min fairness;telecommunications;computer science;base station;resource management;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	15.805376062158839	93.58980725365404	93439

However, the capability of PSM to save energy is limited when the WLANs are highly congested by other Wi-Fi clients. In this paper, instead of further pursuing the trade-off between power saving and the incurred delay on the client side, we take a different approach and explore the energy saving potential by considering the scheduling policy on the Access Point (AP) side. We find that the traditional packet-level first-come-first-serve policy is not sleep optimal since it keeps the PSM clients awake unnecessarily. We propose SOFA, an AP-centric scheme, which helps PSM clients save energy by minimizing the time they are forced to stay awake while down link traffic is being transmitted to other clients. SOFA delivers down link packets to the PSM clients in an optimal sequence, such that several objective are simultaneously achieved: (i) system-sleep optimality, (ii) energy-fairness, (iii) attention fairness, and (iv) no unnecessary deferral of packets beyond a beacon period. First, it determines an attention quota for each client at the beginning of each beacon period, without requiring any knowledge of available wireless capacity. Then it takes the attention """"quota'' and attention request as inputs to decide the down link packet scheduling. We prove the stability and optimality of SOFA. Simulation results shows SOFA dramatically decreases the energy consumption of PSM clients in a crowded WLAN, especially for those clients with small attention requests."""	client-side;fairness measure;network packet;network scheduler;round-robin scheduling;sofa;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;transmitter	Zheng Zeng;Yan Gao;Panganamala Ramana Kumar	2011	2011 31st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2011.78	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;mobile device;computer security;computer network;computer-aided manufacturing	Mobile	23.375268005908882	93.24544833007326	93989
e8bad2a3dd9acc545715fc527c27e44a00b13fe1	performance analysis of network coding-based content delivery in dual interface cellular networks		We consider a group of mobile users, in closed proximity, who are interested in downloading a common content (e.g., a video file). We address a cooperative solution where each mobile device is equipped with both cellular and Wi-Fi interfaces. The users exploit the cellular link to download different shares of the content from the based-station and leverage on Wi-Fi link to exchange the received data. In order to expedite content delivery, the base-station transmits random linear network-coded data to users. This paper presents an analytical study of the average completion time, i.e., the time necessary for all devices to successfully retrieve the data. We propose an analytical model to address the effect of random access MAC as well as the correlation among the received coded packets on the performance of content delivery. In our model, a p-persistent carrier sense multiple access approximation for IEEE 802.11 MAC is considered. We also derive the probability of a newly received packet to be innovative, where the coding coefficients are selected randomly and uniformly from GF(q). Our simulations confirms the theoretical analysis.	approximation;coefficient;digital distribution;digital video;download;linear network coding;mobile device;network packet;open content;profiling (computer programming);random access;randomness;simulation	Mohammad H.

As mobile traffic transitions from being voice dominated to video and data dominated, the revenue per byte for the mobile operators is declining at an unhealthy rate. To counter the traffic growth and build cost-effective networks, many operators are now forging alliances for RAN (Radio Access Network) sharing to improve coverage and capacity at reasonable investments and operational costs. This paper presents the design and implementation of NetShare, a network-wide radio resource management framework that provides effective RAN Sharing. NetShare introduces a novel two-level scheduler split between the mobile gateway and the cellular basestations to effectively manage and allocate the wireless resources of the radio access network composed of multiple basestations among multiple different entities (such as operators, content providers, etc.) that share the network. Firstly, NetShare provides performance isolation across entities with a minimum guaranteed resource allocation to each entity across the network. Secondly, NetShare optimally distributes the resources to each entity across the network proportional to the resource demand at each basestation. Through extensive LTE-based system simulations and prototype evaluations on a WiMAX testbed, we show the efficacy of NetShare in (a) providing isolation across entities and (b) efficiently distributing resources for each entity across the network thus achieving high utilization of resources for an entity.	byte;compaq lte;emoticon;entity;prototype;radio access network;radio resource management;scheduling (computing);service innovation;simulation;smartphone;testbed	Rajesh Mahindra;Mohammad Ali Amir Khojastepour;Honghai Zhang;Sampath Rangarajan	2013	2013 21st IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	10.1109/ICNP.2013.6733595	wimax;radio access network;cellular network;cognitive radio;public land mobile network;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;radio resource management;small cell;access network discovery and selection function;computer security;computer network;umts terrestrial radio access network	Mobile	21.398825531854328	90.0159245780942	95220

In a previous work, we introduced the concept of snapshot capacity region and studied it extensively for the case of single hop ad hoc networks. Here, we extend the snapshot capacity region idea to the more general and practical case of multi hop ad hoc networks with the partial successive interference cancellation technique. First, we prove the existence of a minimal power vector for each rate matrix and then we find the necessary and sufficient conditions of the rate matrices to be on the border of the snapshot capacity region. At the end, a novel iterative algorithm is proposed to produce the border of the snapshot capacity region. This algorithm can be used as an admission control algorithm to achieve the snapshot capacity region with some modifications.	algorithm;apollonian network;hoc (programming language);hop;interference (communication);iterative method;nyquist rate;snapshot (computer storage);snapshot isolation	Pouriya Sadeghi;M.

IEEE 802.11 (or WiFi) and IEEE 802.16 (or WiMAX) are the two primary building block technologies for HetNets because of their sustainability, cost effectiveness, well-deployed architectures, and ability to support high-data-rate wireless communications. The existing literature has extensively studied the interoperability between these two technologies, and seamless handover schemes are designed to support WiFi-WiMAX integration in a HetNet environment. However, effective utilization of these two technologies from the end users' point of view is another important research area. We have the following question: When should a user migrate between these two technologies in a HetNet environment?

Represented by 3GPP LTE and IEEE 802.16 cellular standards, they support both stationary and mobile users. Due to the limited power budget of the latter, the energy efficient behavior is becoming of primary importance. In order to save power and maximize battery lifetime (without recharging) of battery-driven mobile devices, either 4G cellular standard defines a power saving mode. It is termed Discontinuous Reception (DRX) by 3GPP LTE and Sleep Mode by IEEE 802.16.

Generally, there are no changes in the available spectrum, thus static spectrum allocation policies were adopted. However, these allocation policies lead to spectrum under-utilization. In this regard, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have received great attention due to their potential to improve the spectrum utilization. In general, efficient spectrum management and resource allocation are essential and very crucial for CRNs. This is due to the fact that unlicensed users should attain the most benefit from accessing the licensed spectrum without causing adverse interference to the licensed ones. The cognitive users or called secondary users have to effectively capture the arising spectrum opportunities in time, frequency, and space to transmit their data. Mainly, two aspects characterize the resource allocation for CRNs: 1) primary (licensed) network protection and 2) secondary (unlicensed) network performance enhancement in terms of quality-of-service, throughput, fairness, energy efficiency, etc. CRNs can operate in one of three known operation modes: 1) interweave; 2) overlay; and 3) underlay. Among which the underlay cognitive radio mode is known to be highly efficient in terms of spectrum utilization. This is because the unlicensed users are allowed to share the same channels with the active licensed users under some conditions. In this paper, we provide a survey for resource allocation in underlay CRNs. In particular, we first define the RA process and its components for underlay CRNs. Second, we provide a taxonomy that categorizes the RA algorithms proposed in literature based on the approaches, criteria, common techniques, and network architecture. Then, the state-of-the-art resource allocation algorithms are reviewed according to the provided taxonomy. Additionally, comparisons among different proposals are provided. Finally, directions for future research are outlined.	algorithm;cognitive radio;fairness measure;frequency allocation;interference (communication);memory management;network architecture;network performance;open research;quality of service;taxonomy (general);throughput;traffic collision avoidance system;video overlay	Sara Hamdan;Walaa Hamouda	2017	IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials	10.1109/COMST.2016.2631079	cognitive radio;cognitive network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer network	Metrics	22.36367609608628	91.08975499932451	96116

e6446dbfca3715c44f8b5afffe823fe63dda2a37	a simulation framework for the evaluation of scenarios and algorithms for common radio resource management		We present a simulation framework based on a systematic view on Common Radio Resource Management (CRRM). It enables a cost-benefit investigation of different CRRM algorithms and architectures. Different scenarios, centralized as well as decentralized ones, can be clearly defined based on five standard components, namely the radio access system, the environment, the user equipment, the CRRM information manager, and the CRRM decider. The costs and time consumption of CRRM operations are taken into account via chargeable messages. The clarity of the model enables an efficient investigation of CRRM algorithms based on optimization theory, game theory, physical models and other methods. The resulting framework has been implemented as a hybrid simulation model using OMNeT++. A convenient and straightforward integration of different wireless network technologies and user service demands is also supported; models for UMTS and GSM/EGPRS are already integrated. The scope of the proposed framework is demonstrated by the evaluation of realistic scenarios.	algorithm;radio resource management;simulation	Andreas Pillekeit;Bruno Müller-Clostermann	2009		10.1145/1537614.1537636	real-time computing;simulation;heterogeneous network;computer science;computer network	Web+IR	22.603487573905987	92.55509784094842	96718

To address this problem, several research works have proposed the random access systems combined with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex Access (OFDMA) technology. Access granularity control is a crucial issue in this combination. Specifically, this issue focuses on how to tune the subchannel bandwidth and the number of accessible subchannels towards the maximum channel utilization. This paper analyzes access granularity control in an OFDMA system that adopts a multichannel Carrier Sensing Multiple Access (CSMA) MAC and resolves contention by the frequency-domain backoff. The theoretical analysis verifies the significance of access granularity control. In addition, the simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed dynamic access granularity control algorithms notably outperform the traditional ones that divide channel band statically and adjust the number of accessible subchannels empirically.	random access	Jiechen Yin;Yuming Mao;Supeng Leng;Yuming Jiang;Muhammad Asad Khan	2015	Computer Networks	10.1016/j.comnet.2015.08.008	real-time computing;media access control;channel access method;telecommunications;computer science;random access;computer network	Mobile	22.66705474318569	90.77981665883715	96788

We propose an algorithmic approach to identify such profiles from real cellular network datasets and we show how to use them for an efficient mobility prediction.

However, the lack of schemes to completely characterize M2M network topology, to efficiently share radio resource, and to provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee regarding end-to-end delay creates challenges to practically facilitate M2M communications. Via mathematical derivations, the network connectivity, degree distribution, and average distance are provided for large M2M networks. To achieve reliable communications upon such M2M networks, inspired by cognitive radio technology and cooperative communications, a cognitive and opportunistic relay (COR) scheme is proposed. Specifically, machines with the proposed COR autonomously sense the primary systems' spectrum usage so as to mitigate detractive interference and adopt opportunistic forwarder selection for lower link delay of packet transmissions. Furthermore, by analytical deriving the effective capacity of the COR over connected M2M networks, the throughput under statistical QoS guarantee and the corresponding delay violation probability are proposed to specify the QoS guarantee capability of the networks and thus suggest the conditions of dependable end-to-end transmissions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed COR effectively achieves the delay guarantee performance, to yield a novel framework for facilitating reliable M2M communications in large machine networks.	algorithm;chain-of-responsibility pattern;closed-circuit television;cognitive radio;conscience;degree distribution;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;interference (communication);machine to machine;network packet;network topology;quality of service;relay;reliability (computer networking);routing;server message block;simulation;swarm;throughput	Shih-Chun Lin;Kwang-Cheng Chen	2016	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2421931	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	19.12746829458158	91.57595744573628	96965

Transmission design plays a key role in leveraging the benefits of CRNs. In this paper, we propose an efficient batch transmission scheme for the data transmission in multi-channel CRNs with practical lossy channels. The proposed scheme exploits the dynamic spectrum opportunities by combining opportunistic routing strategy with network coding based multi-channel transmission. We derive network performance measures of the scheme in terms of batch delay, which provide better insights into the data transmission capability than packet based link delay analysis. Our analyses, validated by simulations, show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms others, reducing batch delay by up to 60%.	cognitive radio;linear network coding;lossy compression;network packet;network performance;packet switching;routing;simulation	Changliang Zheng;Eryk Dutkiewicz;Ren Ping Liu;Rein Vesilo;Zheng Zhou	2012	2012 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6380965	cognitive radio;electronic engineering;cognitive network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer network	Mobile	11.987997711731735	90.31280272978184	97051
1a985872da1ece504a967aa9308c6eed4bebda48	a capture-aware and blocking binary tree protocol for rfid tag identification	capture effect;anti collision;blocking;rfid	The capture effect is inevitable in the Radio frequency identification (RFID) system. In the capture environment, the reader may not fully recognize the tags within its scope. In many RFID applications, the reader identifies the tags in its range repeatedly; in these cases, the reader should recognize staying tags rapidly and spend the main time in identifying arriving tags. For these reasons, this paper presents a capture-aware and blocking binary tree protocol (CBBT). A CBBT reader can identify the tags in its range completely when the capture effect happens. CBBT not only prevents the collisions of staying tags but also inhibits staying tags from colliding with arriving tags. What's more, each staying tag only replies a very short response to the reader to be identified. Thus, staying tags can be identified quickly in CBBT. Simulation results show that CBBT outperforms the existing algorithm significantly.	algorithm;binary tree;blocking (computing);capture effect;government and binding theory;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;simulation	Hongyi Wang;Qing Yang;Xiaolei Wan;Jiasong Wang;Yi Miao	2016	2016 10th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)	10.1109/ICSPCS.2016.7843332	telecommunications;engineering;communication;world wide web	Mobile	10.415370675505269	94.06485393172024	97088

When UE wish to communicate over direct link it is required to know the channel condition of its D2D link and its cellular link to select a link providing the best quality of service, so-called mode selection. UEs participating D2D communication need to conduct measurement over its UE-UE link and its eNB-UE link as well, and BS makes decision on mode switching based on the measurement report of UE. In this paper, we study the measurement procedures and reporting algorithms required for D2D communication. Frequent measurement report can cause the ping-pong mode switching whereas infrequent measurement report results in the delay of mode switching, thereby, leading to losing opportunity to offload traffic from the network. Wasteful frequent ping-pong mode switching is observed in some cases. We show that our proposal prevents frequent ping-pong mode switching without significant degradation in offloading performance achievable from D2D communication.	algorithm;compaq lte;elegant degradation;inline linking;quality of service;unreal development kit	Hyung-Deug Bae;Jae-Wook Shin;Pyung-Joong Song	2014		10.1145/2684103.2684108	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;label switching;handover;lte advanced;operating system;computer security;measurement;computer network	Metrics	19.813764147757535	90.59810090908583	97141

The local profiles are associated with a mobile user and correspond to its frequent and similar movements, whereas the global profiles match with the frequent and similar movements of the majority of users in the covered area. We consider the LTE network architecture with possible deployment of femtocells. The prediction model combines two complementary algorithms: the global profiles-based algorithm and the local profiles-based one. The former is implemented in the enhanced Node B and the home enhanced Node B and the latter works at the user terminal level. An algorithmic approach is used to identify such local and global profiles from real cellular network datasets and we show how to use them for an efficient mobility prediction. Simulation results show that our approach is significantly efficient in predicting both random and regular movements.	algorithm;compaq lte;network architecture;simulation;software deployment;user profile	Dominique Barth;Samir Bellahsene;Leïla Kloul	2012		10.1145/2387238.2387295	markov chain;simulation;quality of service;computer science;graph theory;data mining;femtocell;computer network	ML	11.779832267113505	99.73246052520271	97165

The OSS system consists of primary users and secondary users. The initiating secondary users sense the channels that are unused by the primary users and then make use of the channels. An ongoing secondary user also senses the spectrum and vacates its channel in the presence of a primary user on the channel; it then switches to another idle channel if one is available, or moves to a buffer if no channel is available. The call waiting in the buffer can reconnect back when a channel becomes available or drop out when a maximum waiting time is reached. Spectrum sensing errors from either an initiating or an ongoing secondary user causes false alarm and misdetection events, which may impose various impact on both types of users. We analyze multiple sensing errors and multiple possible results due to the sensing errors, solve the steady-state probability vector of the system, and derive a set of performance metrics of interest. Numerical results and discussion are presented. The proposed modeling method is expected to be used for evaluation and design of future opportunistic spectrum sharing wireless networks.

In the near future, it is expected that in addition to traditional humanto- human (H2H) communications, an LTE-A system needs to support many applications with the technique of machine type communications (MTC), or machine-to-machine communications (M2M). Since M2M features a large number of devices, a mechanism to guarantee the performance of H2H and M2M in the random access procedure of LTE-A (RACH procedure) should be considered. However, little research provides dynamic RACH resource allocation approaches for H2H and M2M. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework, which divides its random access resources into three groups: for H2H, for M2M, and for the hybrid usage. Under this framework, the Nash Equilibrium (NE) guarantees the system throughput by adaptively redistributing the traffic loading, and the NE can be approached rapidly even if the information of traffic loading is quite limited.	compaq lte;game theory;linear network coding;machine to machine;nash equilibrium;random access;throughput;unicast;whole earth 'lectronic link	Yu Kyung Yang;Xunrui Yin;Xiubo Chen;Yixian Yang;Zongpeng Li	2014	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2014.040214.140280	game theory;routing;throughput;linear network coding;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;distributed computing;nash equilibrium;encoding;measurement;computer network;unicast;access network	Mobile	22.34454385868529	96.56885750182163	97474

Unlike traditional radios, a cognitive radio may change its objectives as radio scenarios vary. Because of the dynamic pairing of objectives and contexts, it is imperative for cognitive radio network designers to have a firm understanding of the interrelationships among goals, performance metrics, utility functions, link/network performance, and operating environments. In this paper, we first overview various performance metrics at the node, network, and application levels. From a game-theoretic viewpoint, we then show that the performance evaluation of cognitive radio networks exhibits the interdependent nature of actions, goals, decisions, observations, and context. We discuss the interrelationships among metrics, utility functions, cognitive engine algorithms, and achieved performance, as well as various testing scenarios. We propose the radio environment map-based scenario-driven testing (REM-SDT) for thorough performance evaluation of cognitive radios. An IEEE 802.22 WRAN cognitive engine testbed is presented to provide further insights into this important problem area.	algorithm;cognitive radio;game theory;imperative programming;interdependence;network performance;performance evaluation;reflection mapping;service description table;testbed	Youping Zhao;Shiwen Mao;James O.

To reduce the fluctuation of the coded data packet sizes for efficient wireless transmission, we adopt the intra-refreshment and adaptive slice partitioning for video encoding. We model the delay-constrained video transmission with the proposed video coding and slicing scheme using an MDP model, and compute the optimal coding and modulation scheme corresponding to each channel state and the encoding and transmission delay using the value iteration algorithm. Extensive simulations based on real videos show that the MDP-based transmission scheme significantly reduces the transmission cost and enhances the quality of the reconstructed video sequences compared with the non-adaptive transmission scheme, which transmits constant number of transmitted symbols for all slices. Simulation results also show that the intra-refreshment and adaptive slice partitioning significantly enhances the quality of the reconstructed video sequences compared with the video coding without intra-refreshment.	adaptive grammar;approximation algorithm;burst transmission;data compression;iteration;iterative method;markov chain;markov decision process;markov model;maxima and minima;modulation;multistage interconnection networks;network packet;point-to-point protocol;point-to-point (telecommunications);quantum fluctuation;rayleigh fading;simulation;state transition table;time complexity;vii	Chen Gong;Xiaodong Wang	2014	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2013.112613.121033	scalable video coding;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;coding tree unit;mathematics;iterative method;context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding;motion compensation;h.261;computer network;multiview video coding	Mobile	20.503629109652852	99.10944507598894	98163

These algorithms require only local information and they are easy to implement. The setup is a network of wireless nodes with a fixed conflict graph that identifies pairs of nodes whose simultaneous transmissions conflict. The paper studies two algorithms. The first algorithm schedules transmissions to keep up with given arrival rates of packets. The second algorithm controls the arrivals in addition to the scheduling and attempts to maximize the sum of the utilities, in terms of the rates, of the packet flows at different nodes. For the first algorithm, the paper proves rate stability for strictly feasible arrival rates and also Harris recurrence of the queues. For the second algorithm, the paper proves the ε-optimality in terms of the utilities of the allocated rates. Both algorithms are iterative and we study two versions of each of them. In the first version, both operate with strictly local information but have relatively weaker performance guarantees; under the second version, both provide stronger performance guarantees by utilizing the additional information of the number of nodes in the network.	algorithm;backoff;concave function;harris affine region detector;iteration;network congestion;network packet;random access;randomized algorithm;scheduling (computing);serializability;throughput	Libin Jiang;Devavrat Shah;Jinwoo Shin;Jean C.

In contrast with previous works that model wireless channels according to the Protocol or Physical model of interference, this paper studies the scheduling problem in multiple access (multi-access) networks. In this kind of network, the receiver node can decode multiple transmissions simultaneously if the transmission rates of concurrent transmitters lie inside the capacity region of the receiver node. We propose a linear programming model that minimizes the schedule length. The model incorporates the capacity region of multiple access channels into scheduling decisions, such that the sum of the transmission rates of simultaneous transmitters is maximized. Because of the high-complexity of the model, we also present a heuristic algorithm, whose performance is extensively evaluated and compared with the optimal solutions.	algorithm;heuristic (computer science);hop;interference (communication);linear programming;mathematical optimization;programming model;scheduling (computing);transmitter	Jorge Crichigno;Min-You Wu;Wei Shu	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502355	exposed node problem;telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	15.391460390684793	93.06803472745975	98705
a0e537c90f6645c38dac1ab607ae940dc12e7f2a	using deep neural networks for forecasting cell congestion on lte networks: a simple approach		Predicting short-term cellular load in LTE networks is of great importance for mobile operators as it assists in the efficient managing of network resources. Based on predicted behaviours, the network can be intended as a proactive system that enables reconfiguration when needed. Basically, it is the concept of self-organizing networks that ensures the requirements and the quality of service. This paper uses a dataset, provided by a mobile network operator, of collected downlink throughput samples from one cell in an area where cell congestion usually occurs and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach to perform short-term cell load forecasting. The results obtained indicate that DNN performs better results when compared to traditional approaches.	compaq lte;deep learning;network congestion	Pedro Torres;Hugo Marques;Paulo Marques;Jonathan Rodriguez	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-76207-4_23	throughput;operator (computer programming);artificial neural network;deep learning;control reconfiguration;mobile network operator;telecommunications link;quality of service;computer network;computer science;artificial intelligence	ML	22.67090588629898	91.04956765452579	98744

In the proposed PACR scheme, tags are embedded in random access (RA) PAs and multiple TA values are captured for a single detected PA during a tag detection procedure. The proposed PACR scheme significantly improves RA success probability for stationary machine nodes since the nodes using collided PAs can successfully complete the corresponding RAs using exclusive data resource blocks.	embedded system;hash table;phy (chip);random access;simulation;stationary process;traffic collision avoidance system	Han Seung Jang;Su Min Kim;Hong-Shik Park;Dan Keun Sung	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2759163	collision;computer network;electronic engineering;computer science;timing advance;preamble;internet of things;random access	Mobile	10.316729081090106	90.75225318468073	99217

Using optimization and stochastic network theory we study the problem of scheduling to meet quality of service (QoS) requirements under heterogeneous delay constraints and time-varying channel conditions. Our analysis results in an optimal scheduling algorithm which fairly allocates data rates to all flows while meeting long-term delay demands. We also prove that under a simplified scenario our solution translates into a greedy strategy that makes optimal decisions with low complexity.	greedy algorithm;mathematical optimization;network packet;network theory;quality of service;queueing theory;real-time clock;requirement;scheduling (computing)	Juan José Jaramillo;R.

In particular, we consider the natural agent utility where costs are proportional to delay. Access to the channel is modelled as a game in extensive form with simultaneous play.  Standard protocols such as Aloha are vulnerable to manipulation by selfish agents. We show that choosing appropriate transmission probabilities for Aloha to achieve equilibrium implies exponentially long delays. We give a very simple protocol for the agents that is in Nash equilibrium and is also very efficient --- other than with exponentially negligible probability --- all n agents will successfully transmit within cn time, for some small constant c.	carrier-to-noise ratio;nash equilibrium	Amos Fiat;Yishay Mansour;Uri Nadav	2007			telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;nash equilibrium;computer network	Theory	13.67586536787474	95.43264822702754	100485

The Long Term Evolution (LTE) network has received much attention as a promising platform for SG communications due to its high bandwidth and low latency over a large coverage area. Nevertheless, when a huge number of SMs access the LTE network, the preamble collision becomes an issue. The negative effects of preamble collision are packet loss, delay, reestablishment attempts, and physical channel utilization, which degrade the performance of the LTE network. Hence, a Random Access (RA) mechanism is required for preamble signature to occupy Resource Blocks (RBs) for SMs. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid procedure that combines contention and non-contention based random access methods. The significance of this method is that, although SMs have fixed periodic communications, preamble signatures do not need to be reserved. The simulation results are compared with LTE standard. Packet loss is reduced by approximately 43%. SM latency is decreased by 11 ms at 90% of probability delay. Re-establishment attempts are lower than standard by proximately 76%. Finally, physical channel utilizations are reduced by around 3%.	centralized computing;compaq lte;electronic signature;interrupt latency;network packet;network performance;random access;simulation;smart meter;suicidegirls;throughput	Chalakorn Karupongsiri;Kumudu S.

One of the major MAC approaches for RFID systems is the framed slotted ALOHA based approach. It is proven that this class of algorithms achieve the smallest total reading time when, at each reading round, the frame length is set equal to the actual number of remaining unread tags. An important design challenge to increase the performance of this class of algorithms is to estimate the remaining tag count before each reading round. In this paper, we address this remaining tag count estimation problem for such RFID systems. The introduced algorithm is an a posteriori tag count estimation scheme from the collision statistics of the previous reading round. We compare the algorithm with the optimum, lower bound and other a posteriori estimation algorithms and demonstrate its efficiency. The performance of the algorithm is better than the current a posteriori tag count estimation algorithms. Another improvement brought by the algorithm is the reduction in reader side computational overhead existing in the previous schemes.	approximation algorithm;expectation–maximization algorithm;overhead (computing);radio-frequency identification;tag system	Ilker Onat;Ali Miri	2011	2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/icc.2011.5962792	radio-frequency identification;algorithm design;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	EDA	10.761424104776323	93.50858596785498	101048

The aim is to save energy under the framework of the fixed-block signaling (FBS) system and the equi-block principle. Unlike past research regarding the energy savings of train operation, this paper proposes a combinatorial optimization model to reduce the computation time. In the presented approach, the problem of minimizing the energy consumption between successive stations is first formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. Then, the train-speed trajectory for saving energy is optimized by a MAX-MIN ant system (MMAS) of ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms. Finally, the block layout is designed in accordance with the shortest block length under the equi-block principle. It is shown that the method presents a significant improvement for the reduction of computational burden on the block-layout design. The feasibility and benefits are verified via simulation study.

By means of the wireless channel allocation problem, a heuristic approach to fairness allocation will be presented, based on searching for allocations with high similarity of the corresponding throughputs and high total throughput at the same time. Thus, the proposed approach overcomes stated problems with discrete fairness by capturing the characterisitics of fairness as comparison criterion among solutions. A meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed to handle this problem, and results are presented for problem scales, where a complete analysis is still possible. The approach is demonstrated to sufficiently follow up the maxmin fairness states with regard to performance, while definitely excluding any artifacts arising from the transition of maxmin fair allocations to the discrete domain.	algorithm;fairness measure;heuristic (computer science);minimax;throughput	Mario Köppen;Rodrigo Verschae;Kaori Yoshida;Masato Tsuru	2010	2010 International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2010.141	fairness measure;heuristic;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;throughput;wireless sensor network;max-min fairness;computer science;multi-objective optimization;distributed computing;wireless;computer network;evolutionary computation	Robotics	16.43344447270706	95.16318158855661	101369

In this paper, a novel Martingale approach to dynamically monitoring overall network health, based upon the exploitation of a Quality of Service (QoS) requirement, is proposed. Incorporating a Martingale framework for nodal response as an integral calculation of current network statistics allows local nodal decisions to become progressively more accurate as the network life increases and the rigid constraints to power become inescapable. Hence, nodes become increasingly aware of the network conditions, based upon the current environment as well as a priori statistics, and have the ability to react with more foresight. Simulations and analysis show that this framework for sensor nodal decisions has several advantages compared with an existing learning automation approach in different fading channel environments.	algorithm;computer simulation;mimo;microsoft outlook for mac;performance rating;quality of service;scalability;smart antenna;weight function	Deborah D.

We further assume that each wireless node can transmit/receive at <i>W</i> bits/second over a <i>common</i> wireless channel. For each node <i>v<sub>i</sub></i>, we <i>randomly</i> pick <i>k</i>-1 nodes from the other <i>n</i>-1 nodes as the receivers of the multicast session rooted at node <i>v<sub>i</sub></i>. The aggregated multicast capacity is defined as the total data rate of all multicast sessions in the network. In this paper we derive matching asymptotic upper bounds and lower bounds on multicast capacity of random wireless networks. We show that the total multicast capacity is Θ(√<i>n</i> over log <i>n</i> dot <i>W</i> over √ <i>k</i>) when <i>k</i> = Ω(<i>n</i> over log <i>n</i>); the total multicast capacity is Θ(<i>W</i>) when <i>k</i> =Θ(<i>n</i> over log <i>n</i>). Our bounds unify the previous capacity bounds on unicast (when <i>k</i>=2) by Gupta and Kumar [7]and the capacity bounds on broadcast (when <i>k</i>=<i>n</i>) in [11,20]. We also study the capacity of group-multicast for wireless networks where for each source node, we randomly select <i>k</i>-1 groups of nodes as receivers and the nodes in each group are within a constant hops from the group leader. The same asymptotic upper bounds and lower bounds still hold. For arbitrary networks, we provide a constructive lower bound Ω(√<i>n</i> over √<i>k</i> dot <i>W</i>) for aggregated multicast capacity when we can carefully place nodes and schedule node transmissions.	additive white gaussian noise;burst transmission;computation;concurrency (computer science);data rate units;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);multicast;randomness;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;software deployment;transmission (bittorrent client);transmitter;uncompressed video;unicast	Xiang-Yang Li;Shaojie Tang;Ophir Frieder	2007		10.1145/1287853.1287886	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;computer network	Mobile	15.532886621808515	89.45095411826054	101753

Since traffic load in mobile networks significantly varies during a working or weekend day, it is important to quantify the influence of these variations on the base station power consumption. Therefore, this paper investigates changes in the instantaneous power consumption of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) base stations according to their respective traffic load. The real data in terms of the power consumption and traffic load have been obtained from continuous measurements performed on a fully operated base station site. Measurements show the existence of a direct relationship between base station traffic load and power consumption. According to this relationship, we develop a linear power consumption model for base stations of both technologies. This paper also gives an overview of the most important concepts which are being proposed to make cellular networks more energy-efficient.	access network;electricity;futures studies;interdependence;lipid r1 mri;mobile phone;network congestion	Josip Lorincz;Tonko Garma;Goran Petrovic	2012		10.3390/s120404281	embedded system;simulation;energy;consumption;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;base station;mobile technology;power;operations research;physics;quantum mechanics;wireless;measurement	Mobile	23.917556248680718	92.09630855172838	101952
cbbd6df8950a2b2e5618f2313e9c826c2c60091a	jointly optimizing content caching and recommendations in small cell networks		Caching decisions typically seek to cache content that satisfies the maximum possible demand aggregated over all users. Recommendation systems, on the contrary, focus on individual users and recommend to them appealing content in order to elicit further content consumption. In our paper, we explore how these, phenomenally conflicting, objectives can be jointly addressed. First, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint caching and recommendation decisions, aiming to maximize the cache hit ratio under minimal controllable distortion of the inherent user content preferences by the issued recommendations. Then, we prove that the problem is NP-complete and that its objective function lacks those monotonicity and submodularity properties that would guarantee its approximability. Hence, we proceed to introduce a simpler heuristic algorithm that essentially serves as a form of lightweight control over recommendations so that they are both appealing to end-users and friendly to network resources. Finally, we draw on both analysis and simulations with real and synthetic datasets to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. We point out its fundamental properties, provide bounds for the achieved cache hit ratio, and study its sensitivity to its own as well as system-level parameters.

In this paper, we seek to answer the fundamental question: how much performance bene fit from network coding can be expected for general traffic patterns in a moderate-sized wireless mesh network? We approach this question via an empirical study of both coordinated and opportunistic coding based protocols subject to general traffic p atterns. Our study shows the performance benefits under both types of coding for general traffic patterns are extremely limited. We then analyze and uncover fundamental reasons for the limite d performance benefits.	linear network coding;mesh networking;routing;throughput;uniprot;wireless mesh network	Dimitrios Koutsonikolas;Y.

29bea6ddabd80604f516abe943fcf7c150ea0681	study on dynamic channel switch in license-assisted-access based on listen-before-talk		License-Assisted-Access technology enables LTE to operate on unlicensed bands. It is promising to enhance LTE system capacity efficiently and meet the future requirements of increasing the volume of data. Nevertheless, coexistence among several wireless communication systems on unlicensed bands, for example LAA and WiFi, has become a key problem to be solved. In this paper, channel switch is considered in LAA to achieve a harmonious coexistence with WiFi. First, an enhanced Listen-Before-Talk scheme with channel switch is proposed, where a frozen period is introduced to guarantee appropriate channel switch decision and release channel for other systems' use. Then a proportional fair based dynamic channel switch method is presented, which dynamically make channel switch according to channel selection probability. Thus it can enable LAA to make best use of unlicensed bands and to coexist with other systems in an efficient way. Finally, simulation results validate that the proposed schemes can yield the hybrid system performance and the advantage of the proposed schemes is especially obvious when the system packet arrival rate is in a relatively low level.	channel capacity;coexist (image);compaq lte;hybrid system;network packet;network switch;proportionally fair;queueing theory;requirement;simulation;telecommunications link	Hongdou Li;Yongyu Chang;Fanrong Hao;Aidong Men;Jian Zhang;Wei Quan	2016	2016 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2016.7600957	computer network;license;crossover switch;computer science;communication channel	Arch	23.472311596240598	93.1838914806701	103357

In spectrum trading, the primary users lease their unoccupied spectrum to the secondary users for a market fee. Although spectrum trading is considered as a reliable approach, it is confronted with a spectrum transaction completion time problem, which negatively impacts on end-users Quality of Service and Quality of Experience metrics. Spectrum transaction completion time is the duration to successfully conduct TVWS spectrum trading. To address this issue, this paper proposes simple mechanism auction reward truthful (SMART), a fast and iterative machine learning-assisted spectrum trading model to address this issue. Simulated results indicate that SMART out-performs referenced VERUM algorithm in three key performance indicators: bit-error rate, instantaneous throughput, and probability of dropped packets by 10%, 5%, and 15%, respectively.	auction algorithm;bit error rate;iteration;machine learning;quality of service;smart;throughput;white spaces (radio)	Anabi Hilary Kelechi;Nor Fadzilah Abdullah;Rosdiadee Nordin;Mahamod Ismail	2017	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2768964	throughput;performance indicator;computer network;quality of service;white spaces;computer science;cloud computing;quality of experience;database transaction;network packet	Mobile	23.56779016887275	93.7485732856047	103758

It has a flavor of distributed mutual exclusion but is not exactly a mutual exclusion problem (because a channel may be reused in different cells). In this paper, we establish the exact relationship between the two problems. Specifically, we introduce the problem of relaxed mutual exclusion to model one important aspect of the DDCA problem. We develop a general algorithm that guarantees relaxed mutual exclusion for a single resource and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the information structure. Considering distributed dynamic channel allocation as a special case of relaxed mutual exclusion, we apply and extend the algorithm to further address the issues that arise in distributed channel allocation such as deadlock resolution, dealing with multiple channels, design of efficient information structures, and channel selection strategies. Based on these results, we propose an example distributed channel allocation scheme using one of the information structures proposed. Analysis and simulation results are provided and show that the results of this research can be used to design more efficient distributed channel allocation algorithms.	algorithm;deadlock;memory management;mobile phone;mutual exclusion;regular expression;simulation	Jianping Jiang;Ten-Hwang Lai;Neelam Soundarajan	2002	IEEE Trans.

While multimedia content is heavily demanding in terms of network resources, it is also inherently adaptable at the application layer, thereby imposing soft QoS constraints, rather than strict requirements on a specific data rate. In this paper, we specifically investigate the suitability of such a medium access control rationale for this kind of traffic. It turns out that, if properly managed, next generation networks can accommodate several multimedia users, thanks to a proper exploitation of user and frequency diversity. However, on the application side a great deal of attention should be paid to take advantage of scalability of the video flows and adaptability of this kind of traffic, to exploit the network capacity at its fullest.	access control;data rate units;design rationale;next-generation network;quality of service;requirement;scalability	Davide Chiarotto;Leonardo Badia;Michele Zorzi	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6654908	multi-frequency network;real-time computing;next-generation network;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;wireless multimedia extensions;computer network	Mobile	22.131290549634638	93.01408268998273	104317

Detection error has certain impacts on spectrum access, leading to overlook vacant frequency bands or occur the collision between primary users(PUs) and SUs. Since sensing mistake is inevitable, an optimal dynamic access scheme should be based on imperfect detection outcome. Therefore we propose a variable bandwidth spectrum access scheme with imperfect spectrum sensing. In this scheme, SUs can access different amount of frequency bands by detecting spectrum resources. As soon as PUs reclaim the frequency bands, SUs adjust own frequency bands according to the state of spectrum resources, meanwhile renewing their service quality level. Considering the impact of detection error on CRNs performance, this scheme is based on imperfect sensing and modeled by three-dimension Continuous-Time Markov Chain (3D-CTMC). We give the expression of performance metrics evaluating QoS of CRNs and use QBD theory to gain the solution of steady state probability. Theory analysis and simulation experiments show that the proposed scheme efficiently improves QoS of CRNs with an acceptable degradation of SUs'service quality level, the degradation has no influence on the normal transmission of SUs.	cognitive radio;elegant degradation;experiment;frequency band;markov chain;quality of service;sensor;simulation;steady state	Fu Yu;Qinyu Zhang;Wang Ye;Guan Xin	2011	2011 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2011.6096924	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	10.96412737433745	101.23577866969329	104331

This article investigates a novel framework of dynamic spectrum management for femtocell networks, called cognitive-empowered femtocells (CEF), aiming at mitigating both cross-tier and intratier interferences with minimum modifications required on the corresponding macrocell network. With the proposed framework, each CEF base station (BS) and the femtocell users can utilize spatiotemporally available radio resources for the access traffic. We conclude that the proposed CEF framework can effectively complement the existing femtocell design and serve as a value-added feature to the state-of-the-art femtocell technologies, while achieving high scalability and interoperability by minimizing the required modifications on the macrocell protocol design.

(les réseaux radio maillés et le problème du """"round weighting"""")"""		In this thesis, we address the joint routing and slot assignment problem between the routers and the gateways in a radio mesh access networks. We model the problem as a Round Weighting Problem (RWP) in which the objective is to minimize the overall period of slot activations providing enough capacity to satisfy the bandwidth requirements of the routers. Solving the full problem means generating an exponential set of simultaneous transmission rounds which is intractable even for small networks. To cope with this issue, we implement a mathematical multi-objective model to solve the problem using a column generation method. We observe that the bottleneck is usually located in a limited region around a gateway. We propose a method to obtain lower bounds (considering only a limited probable bottleneck region) and upper bounds for general graphs. Our methods are applied to grid graphs providing closed formulae for the case of uniform demands, and also optimal routing strategies considering non-uniform demands. Motivated by the results of the existence of a limited (bottleneck) region capable of representing the whole network, we consider a variant of the RWP dealing also with bandwidth allocation, but considering SINR conditions in a CDMA network. We give sufficient conditions for the whole network to be reduced to a single-hop around the gateway. It is due to the fact that the problem is convex under some conditions that are often met. We are interested in optimal solutions in which each flow going through a bottleneck receives a fair share of the available bandwidth.	access network;assignment problem;column generation;convex function;mesh networking;radio broadcasting;requirement;routing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;time complexity	Cristiana Gomes	2009				ML	16.57771671735021	92.98464968548969	104813

For the finite single-hop network with arbitrary interference constraints we prove stochastic stability under the natural conditions. For the infinite (as well as finite) single-hop network, we obtain broad rate-stability conditions.

For a given distance between the source and the destination, as the number of relays increases the overhead necessary to operate the MAC protocol increases. However, the energy needed for a given throughput decreases when the distance between relays decreases. Thus there is an optimal number of relays that optimizes both the throughput and the energy efficiency. We analyze how the number of relays used between the source and the destination affects the throughput and the energy consumption. The energy-throughput relationship incorporating both the physical layer and the MAC layer was considered in the analysis and optimization of the number of relays. Based on the analysis we provide general criteria for the optimal number of relays.	access control;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);relay;throughput	Sanghoon Kim;Wayne E.

By using D2D data offloading, mobile users can reduce the cost for data service from wireless cellular networks. However, due to users’ mobility, the opportunity for a user to obtain his interested objects via D2D communication is transient. In this paper, we first propose an expected available duration (EAD) metric to evaluate the opportunity that an object can be downloaded by a user via D2D data offloading. The EAD metric takes into account the pairwise connectivity of users, social influence between users, diffusion of digital objects, and the time that users would like to wait for D2D data offloading. We then propose a distributed algorithm for a mobile device to determine the EAD of each object. Given a set of available objects in the neighborhood, a mobile device will first download the object that has the smallest EAD. We validate our model via trace-driven simulations. Results show that our proposed algorithm can effectively find the object that should be first downloaded. Comparing with existing schemes, our work can help users download more data via D2D data offloading.	distributed algorithm;download;ead socket;mobile device;simulation	Zehua Wang;Hamed Shah-Mansouri;Vincent W.

The measurements of multiple sensors are transmitted to a remote estimator over a multi-channel network, which may be congested by an intelligent attacker. Aiming at improving the estimation accuracy, we first propose a novel aggregation scheme for the estimator to produce accurate state estimates, from which we obtain a closed-form expression of the expected estimation error covariance. We further develop a sensor-attacker game to design the cooperative and defensive channel-selection strategy, which avoids the sensors being attacked in an energy-efficient way.

We begin with a wireless communication network in which n nodes (agents), which might have different utility functions, contend for access on a common, wireless communication channel. We characterize this distributed multiple-access problem in terms of a one-shot random-access game, and then analyze the behavior of the nodes using the tools of game theory. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on nodes for the complete characterization of the Nash equilibria of this game for all n ges 2. We show that all centrally controlled optimal solutions are a subset of this game theoretic solution, and almost all (w.r.t. Lebesgue measure) transmission probability assignments chosen by a central authority are supported by the game theoretic solution. We analyze the behavior of the network throughput at Nash equilibria as a function of the costs of the transmitters incurred by failed transmissions. Finally, we conclude the paper with the asymptotic analysis of the system as the number of transmitters goes to infinity. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the packet arrivals converges in distribution to a Poisson random variable, and the channel throughput converges to -(c/(1+c))ln(c/(1+c)) with c > 0 being the cost of failed transmissions. We also give the best possible bounds on the rates of convergence of the packet arrival distribution and the channel throughput.	nash equilibrium;random access	Hazer Inaltekin;Stephen B.

d46c3452b6f1922c667b7abf04dc96b2e29bbf0b	performance bounds in switched ethernet onboard networks		In modern automotive and aeronautic onboard networks, a driving force exists to integrate multiple communication networks onto a single switched Ethernet network. Goals for future onboard communication networks are low weight, low price, high bandwidth, and certifiable safety. Certainly, these objectives influence each other and are difficult to fulfill. Furthermore, an existing certification may not encourage an expensive recertification of novel communication technologies. Aircraft cabin networks are subject to certification, as they not only cover comfort functions such as In-Flight Entertainment, but also safety related functions such as the announcement of evacuation messages or the polling of smoke detectors. This work addresses the applicability of a switched queuing network for both safety relevant and comfort functions in aircraft cabin networks. Hard performance guarantees on latency and jitter must be fulfilled. The state-of-the-art approach to determine worst case bounds in queuing networks is Network Calculus. The tightness of Network Calculus is subject to ongoing research. Recent work even showed the NP-hardness of determining tight bounds in general networks. In this work, we propose a packetized model based on a mixed-integer program, which is able to express the worst-case in a closed-form representation. The proposed algorithm allows better mapping of packetized switched networks compared to known state-of-the-art Network Calculus approaches. The presented approach is embedded in the performance evaluation platform DIMTOOL. This platform provides several performance evaluation techniques, such as network simulation and Network Calculus, in one single toolbox. Having a consistent view on performance bounds allows for a rapid evaluation of the worst case bounds of the cabin network, which in turn is required for the certification process. We show that the hard performance bounds are guaranteed, which opens the investigated switched queuing network for a wide range of applications.	algorithm;best, worst and average case;cell signaling;embedded system;hop;integer programming;linear programming;management system;np-hardness;network calculus;network switch;performance evaluation;sensor;simulation;telecommunications network;weatherstar	Emanuel Heidinger	2013			latency (engineering);telecommunications network;real-time computing;ethernet;bandwidth (signal processing);network calculus;switched communication network;engineering;jitter	Metrics	12.880301292709937	97.69099532628945	105638

In this context, transparent WDM networks represent a promising solution for reducing the power consumption of telecom networks. For this reason transparent WDM networks attract a lot of interest and several power-aware routing and wavelength assignment algorithms are available in the literature. These approaches, however, seem to consider power minimization as the only parameter to be optimized. Little or no attention is given to other important network aspects, e.g., connection requests blocking. Such approaches may not always be advisable, especially in core WDM networks where high performance levels must be considered in the first place. This article aims at providing a different insight to the PA-routing problem. It follows the intuition that in some cases relaxing the power minimization constraint can have beneficial effects on the overall network performance, especially on the blocking probability.

However, in addition to the inherent complexities in determining the exact bandwidth, this approach requires an admission control strategy. In this paper we present a distributed algorithm that is integrated into the previously proposed rate control and scheduling algorithms and, unlike the previous QoS schemes, regulates packet latency without the need for admission control. The proposed algorithm achieves fairness based on the delay constraints, and enables maximum utilisation of network capacity. We analyse the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm, and demonstrate its performance through numerical examples.	control theory;distributed algorithm;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;network packet;network utility;numerical analysis;numerical method;scheduling (computing)	Soroush Jahromizadeh;Veselin Rakocevic	2011	2011 IEEE 73rd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2011.5956645	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	16.01595069577815	96.23094297010196	106024

In this scheme of networking, specified bandwidth is reserved for each communication path based on bandwidth tables constructed by each terminal. This bandwidth reservation is desirable in diaster areas where rescue teams need to share wideband picture images of distant locations sent from rescue robots or human scouts. However, because process gain of associated CDMA operation is assumed to be high enough, unreasonable ra-diowave bandwidth is necessary for the system designs. The proposed method for bandwidth table construction regards CDMA interferences when the process gain is set arbitrary. With this method, system designs with reasonable radiowave bandwidth become possible. Simulations confirm the network performances with the proposed method.	computer simulation;hoc (programming language);performance;process gain;quality of service;radio frequency;robot;signal-to-noise ratio;unity	Hisayoshi Sugiyama	2011		10.1145/2093698.2093775	bandwidth management;electronic engineering;network traffic control;telecommunications;engineering;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Mobile	10.942239408417901	90.50477955385118	106138

Our joint optimization framework provides a convenient way of maximizing the reliability or minimizing the jitter delay of paths. Data traffic is sensitive to droppage at buffers, while it can tolerate jitter delay. On the other hand, multimedia traffic can tolerate loss but it is very sensitive to jitter delay. Depending on the type of data, our scheme provides a convenient way of selecting the parameters which result in either reliability maximization or jitter minimization. We solve the optimization problem for a GPS network and provide the optimal solutions. We find the values of control parameters which control the type of optimization performed. We use our analytical results in a multi-objective QoS routing algorithm. Finally, we provide insights into our optimization framework using simulations.		Waseem Sheikh;Arif Ghafoor	2011	Int.

Several standards have, therefore, proposed mechanisms aimed at giving devices more autonomy in making transmission decisions on the wireless uplink. This paper explores the impact this can have on total throughput in CDMA systems, where this control has traditionally been centralized. The investigation relies on a simple distributed policy that helps provide insight into the impact of distributed decisions on overall system efficiency, and identify guidelines on how to best mitigate it.	centralized computing;differentiated services;distributed transmission system;mobile device;scheduling (computing);simulation;switch;telecommunications link;throughput;token bucket	Ashwin Sridharan;Ramesh Subbaraman;Roch Guérin	2007		10.1007/978-3-540-72606-7_43	code division multiple access;real-time computing;index term;telecommunications link;computer science;operating system;mobile device;distributed computing;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	22.682776765592653	92.83904010189273	106653

Most prior work on the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks, however, has focused only on one-way communication. In this paper we develop the concept of transmission capacity of two-way communication in wireless ad hoc networks. The transmission capacity has been used extensively to analyze one-way ad hoc networks in this paper we provide a generalization that incorporates the concept of a twoway outage. We derive an upper bound and an approximation for the two-way transmission capacity, which are shown to be relatively tight for small outage probability constraints. We also quantify how the two-way success requirement reduces network capacity. Our numerical and simulation results show that for certain two-way networks the capacity loss is considerable.	approximation;capacity loss;control function (econometrics);downtime;duplex (telecommunications);frequency divider;futures studies;hoc (programming language);modulation;network packet;numerical analysis;one-way function;simulation	Kien T.

While most literature on medium access focuses on how to share a medium among nodes, these approaches are often either not directly applicable to co-existing networks as they would violate the independence requirement, or they yield a low throughput if applied to multiple networks. We present the randomized medium access (MAC) protocol COMAC which guarantees that a given communication channel is shared fairly among competing and independent networks, and that the available bandwidth is used efficiently. These performance guarantees hold in the presence of arbitrary external interference or even under adversarial jamming. Concretely, we show that the co-existing networks can use a Ω(ε2 min{ε, 1 poly(K)})-fraction of the non-jammed time steps for successful message transmissions, where ε is the (arbitrarily distributed) fraction of time which is not jammed.	channel (communications);interference (communication);radio jamming;randomized algorithm;throughput	Andréa W.

ccbaf273b7fd5d3424a46a0b7364f42fc8156c83	a device-to-device multicast scheme for delay-constraint content delivery		Motivated by the explosive increase of mobile traffic, study on the device-to-device (D2D) communication is kicked off for content delivery through proximal transmission among users. D2D multicast has advantage on serving multiple users simultaneously with less resource cost. However, when D2D multicast is appropriate for content delivery and how to make it serve delay-constraint traffic are still unclear. In this paper, parameters impacting on D2D multicast content delivery is investigated to find good chances for utilizing D2D multicast. Furthermore, some rules to be obeyed are proposed for the content caching and delivery of D2D multicast to satisfy delay constraints. Based on these analyses, a delay-aware multicast scheme is proposed to maximize the network performance utility while satisfying delay constraints of contents. Simulations results verify our analyses and show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve multicast efficiency with guaranteed delay.	multicast	Yanli Xu	2017	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2017/8012517	real-time computing;multicast;inter-domain;reliable multicast;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;distance vector multicast routing protocol;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	Mobile	17.427489507685454	97.75002039667064	107412

In the case of temporally and spatially varying traffic distribution the optimal topology will also vary in time and an efficient way for topology control is needed in order to maximize the system performance. In this paper we present an algorithm for efficient relaying topology control, which is aware of the intercell interference, requiring coordinated action between the cells and resulting in multicell jointly optimal relaying topology. Numerical results demonstrate that an adaptive relaying topology control provides the network utility improvements and presents the framework for quantifying these improvements for spatially and temporally varying traffic.	algorithm;catastrophic interference;centralized computing;convex optimization;duality (optimization);elegant degradation;interference (communication);lookup table;mathematical optimization;network utility;optimization problem;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);temporal logic;topology control;transmitter;wireless access point	Beatriz Lorenzo;Savo Glisic	2009	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.2009.081613	cellular network;routing;adaptive control;telecommunications;computer science;interference;spread spectrum;network topology;telecommunications network;computer network	Visualization	15.548927573784773	94.93583281436557	107688

The measurement data from real cellular networks indicate that the mobile Internet traffic expresses long-range dependence (LRD) characteristics, which differs from the traditional exponential assumption as well as 3GPP reports, would greatly deteriorate the experience of the subscribers. On the other hand, the mobile cellular networks treat most services without differentiation, although different services have their own requirements on transmission rates and delay. After introducing a new metric called the Quality of Experience (QoE) index for different services and analyzing the influence of LRD traffic, two approaches are proposed to alleviate the experience deterioration caused by traffic bursts: cloud based baseband resource pool to improve the flexibility of networks and wireless context-aware service controller to manage the distinctive QoE requirements of different services. Finally, simulations validate that these approaches not only contribute to service-oriented cross-layer optimization methods to satisfy the network resource constraints, but also provide a software-controlled service management framework for cellular networks.	baseband;cloud computing;ibm service management framework;mathematical optimization;mobile app;mobile phone;next-generation network;operating system service management;phy (chip);programming paradigm;quality of service;rlc circuit;requirement;service layer;service-oriented device architecture;simulation;software-defined networking;time complexity;user space	Xuan Zhou;Zhifeng Zhao;Rongpeng Li;Yifan Zhou;Honggang Zhang	2014	2014 IEEE 25th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communication (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2014.7136517	database index;cellular traffic;real-time computing;quality of service;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;baseband;mobile computing;wireless;computer network	Mobile	22.16562115064349	91.34143932501269	108132

The motivation for this study is twofold, limiting multiuser interference to increase single-hop throughput and reducing power consumption to prolong battery life. We focus on next neighbor transmissions where nodes are required to send information packets to their respective receivers subject to a constraint on the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. The multiple access problem is solved via two alternating phases, namely scheduling and power control. The scheduling algorithm is essential to coordinate the transmissions of independent users in order to eliminate strong levels of interference (e.g., self-interference) that cannot be overcome by power control. On the other hand, power control is executed in a distributed fashion to determine the admissible power vector, if one exists, that can be used by the scheduled users to satisfy their single-hop transmission requirements. This is done for two types of networks, namely time-division multiple-access (TDMA) and TDMA/code-division multiple-access wireless ad hoc networks.	admissible heuristic;algorithm;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);multi-user;requirement;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Tamer A.

We model the probability mass function (pmf) of the dissemination time as a sequence of independent geometric random variables whose success probability changes with every successful reception of an innovative packet. We derive a tight approximation of the average networked innovation probability conditioned on network dimension increase. We show through simulations that our approximations for the average dissemination time and its pmf are tight. We then propose to use a RLNC-based broadcast dissemination protocol over a general dynamic topology where nodes are chosen for transmission based on average innovative information that they can provided to the rest of the network. Simulation results show that information disseminates considerably faster as opposed to standard RLNC algorithm where nodes are chosen uniformly at random.	algorithm;approximation;hoc (programming language);linear network coding;network packet;network topology;simulation;unicast	Shwan Ashrafi;Sumit Roy;Hamed Firooz	2013	CoRR		telecommunications;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing	Theory	13.478224547206851	89.47845476729064	109080

The objective is to allocate optimally the power to each user, take advantage of the time diversity of the time varying channel and satisfy the delay constraints of the services. To this end, we model the bit rate dynamics of the users as a linear stochastic control scheme and formulate a risk-sensitive control framework that minimizes an exponential cost function of the deviation between the traffic arrivals and departures from the queues.

In this paper, we present a generalized model for the throughput optimization problem in multi-hop wireless networks that support multi-packet reception (MPR) capability. The model incorporates the multi-access channel, which accurately accounts for the achievable capacity of links used by simultaneous packet transmissions. The problem is modeled as a joint routing and scheduling problem. The scheduling subproblem deals with finding the optimal schedulable sets, which are defined as subsets of links that can be scheduled or activated simultaneously. We demonstrate that any solution of the scheduling subproblem can be built with |E| + 1 or fewer schedulable sets, where |E| is the number of links of the network. This result contrasts with a conjecture that states that a solution of the scheduling subproblem, in general, is composed of an exponential number of schedulable sets. Due to the hardness of the problem, we propose a polynomial time scheme based on a combination of linear programming and greedy paradigms. The scheme guarantees the operation of links at maximum aggregate capacity, where the sum of the capacity of the links is maximized and the multi-access channel is fully exploited.	aggregate data;greedy algorithm;linear programming;mathematical optimization;minkowski portal refinement;network packet;optimization problem;rough set;routing;scheduling (computing);throughput;time complexity	Jorge Crichigno;Min-You Wu;Sudharman K.

d9f905aaebdbd17d4cfb29047c43286aa3db1506	qos aware predictive radio resource management approach based on mih protocol		The vision of next-generation wireless networks is based on the heterogeneity of different types of radio access technologies such as LTE/LTE-Advanced, WiMax, and Wi-Fi to achieve the demand of high data rate and good quality of service (QoS) to support multimedia streaming at accuracy levels. As a significant key toward achieving this objective, vertical handover management schemes have been broadly treated in the literature. This later mechanism could be redefined as a process of reallocating resources as result of roaming user from one technology to another. Therefore, the addressed issue is not only how to ensure a seamless mobility and end-to-end QoS guarantee but also how to reassign resource when requested and use all offered capacity without underuse it or overuse it. In this context, we propose a new scheme that involves vertical handover process and resource control mechanism by explicitly using multiple challenges to achieve a load balancing among available radio access technologies in order to improve average system utilization. From the radio resource management point of view, our optimized vertical handover procedure has the three following phases: 1) resource allocation estimation; 2) radio resource allocation decision; and 3) radio resources allocation and allocation notification. Detailed simulation analysis illustrates that our scheme is not complex as well as its ability to provide good performance in terms of overall QoS satisfaction in the system.	compaq lte;data rate units;definition;end-to-end encryption;load balancing (computing);point of view (computer hardware company);quality of service;radio resource management;seamless3d;simulation	Khitem Ben Ali;Faouzi Zarai;Radhia Khdhir;Mohammad S.

For example, in a TDD wireless system, the frequency resources utilization over the network can be improved by acquiring TDD frame synchronization. This paper proposes a novel scheme that autonomously realizes the synchronization in a whole wireless network without centralized control. The proposed scheme just needs information from adjacent wireless nodes and other mechanisms are not necessary. In addition, this scheme maintains synchronization in the link connected-area, if the network topology changes or node failure occurs in a local area. The proposed scheme responds flexibly to changing the network topology. The scheme is applicable in the case where many nodes join in and out frequently in the network, such as in nomadic wireless access.

Specifically, we formulate this problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) by explicitly considering the users’ heterogeneous multimedia traffic characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines, distortion impacts and dependencies etc.), time-varying network conditions as well as, importantly, their ability to adapt their cross-layer transmission strategies in response to these dynamics. Based on the heterogeneous characteristics of the media packets, we are able to express the transmission priorities between packets as a new type of directed acyclic graph (DAG). This DAG provides the necessary structure for determining the optimal cross-layer actions in each time slot: the root packet in the DAG will always be selected for transmission since it has the highest positive marginal utility; and the complexity of the proposed cross-layer solution is demonstrated to linearly increase w.r.t. the number of disconnected packet pairs in the DAG and exponentially increase w.r.t. the number of packets on which the current packets depend on. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-layer solutions. Moreover, we show that our solution provides the upper bound performance for the cross-layer optimization solutions with delayed feedback such as the wellknown RaDiO framework.	directed acyclic graph;distortion;marginal model;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;network packet;simulation;time-varying network	Fangwen Fu;Mihaela van der Schaar	2009	CoRR		markov decision process;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;directed acyclic graph;computer network	Metrics	16.855617228785743	96.27004218460337	110168

This has given rise to Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, which offloads the relaying burden of the base station to direct links between the users. Recent studies have shown that D2D communication results in higher data rates, lower energy consumption and time delay. In this paper, the architecture and a set of protocols for enabling inter-cell D2D communication in 5G networks have been proposed. More specifically, device discovery and session setup protocols for different applications have been presented.	broadcast delay;cell (microprocessor);electronic product code;performance evaluation;uncompressed video	Zainab Rauf;Riaz Hussain;Syed Faraz Hasan;Min Young Chung;Boon-Chong Seet;Peter Han Joo Chong;Syed Tariq Shah;Shahzad A.

f51b2de57a60139a709aab7cebfcfd487d43206c	latency-efficient video streaming in metropolis: a caching framework		This paper presents a latency-efficient mobile video streaming design in the context of metropolis by incorporating caching. It shows that video traffic can be substantially offloaded from backhaul by caching predictable demands in the network edge. Notably, exploiting the spatial and temporal characteristics of video popularity, we focus on two sub problems: how to cache the content and how to associate users. Firstly, we investigate cache deployment strategy based on clients' viewing behavior in both downtown and suburb. The proposed hybrid collaborative filtering (CF)-based scheme guarantees high hit rate utilizing the available storage capacity in small base stations (SBS). Further, we formulate the dynamic user equipment and SBS (UE- SBS) optimal association problem into a convex optimization problem, so as to maximize the sum transmission rate of SBSs under the resource and quality-of-service constraint. Performance evaluation of real trace data demonstrates the significant advantage of our proposed framework.	backhaul (telecommunications);cache (computing);collaborative filtering;convex optimization;mathematical optimization;metropolis;optimization problem;performance evaluation;quality of service;smart battery system;software deployment;streaming media;tracing (software)	Danlan Huang;Xiaoming Tao;Chunxiao Jiang;Yong Li;Jianhua Lu	2017	GLOBECOM 2017 - 2017 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254126	user equipment;edge device;computer network;latency (engineering);collaborative filtering;cache;computer science;hit rate;backhaul (telecommunications);server	Mobile	24.016896608889063	96.47665550906636	111258
209af5c51084f6a35a8d8085160c4a5b4d2a2f69	optimal rendezvous strategies for different environments in cognitive radio networks	会议论文;rendezvous;cognitive radio networks	In Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), a fundamental operation for the secondary users (SUs) is to establish communication through choosing a common available channel at the same time slot, which is referred to as rendezvous. In this paper, we study fast rendezvous for two SUs.  The channel availability for SUs is subject to temporal and spatial variation. Moreover, in a distributed system, one user is oblivious of the other user's channel status. Therefore, a fast rendezvous is not trivial. Recently, a number of rendezvous strategies have been proposed for different system settings, but rarely have they taken the temporal variation of the channels into account. In this work, we first derive a time-adaptive strategy with optimal expected time-to-rendezvous (TTR) for synchronous systems in stable environments, where channel availability is assumed to be static over time. Next, in dynamic environments, which better represent temporally dynamic channel availability in CRNs, we first derive optimal strategies for two special cases, and then prove that our strategy is still asymptotically optimal in general dynamic cases.  Numerous simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of our strategies, and validate the theoretical analysis. The impacts of different parameters on the TTR are also investigated, such as the number of channels, the channel open possibilities, the extent of the environment being dynamic, and the existence of an intruder.	asymptotically optimal algorithm;average-case complexity;cognitive radio;distributed computing;simulation	Haisheng Tan;Jiajun Yu;Hongyu Liang;Rui Wang;Zhenhua Han	2015		10.1145/2811587.2811606	cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	ML	14.078046179929034	95.29147860362704	111259
ec0c27c5c42fc64ec41604ea6c9fd8b10f3e68bd	new communication strategy for spectrum sharing enabled smart grid cyber-physical system		Smart grid cyber-physical system (CPS) exploits various physical components to provide better knowledge and delicate control of the power grid, while the huge data volume is transmitted via the integration of advanced communication technologies. To provide better services for the applications in the smart grid CPS, the communication network has to consider the aspects of both improving the system throughput and meeting the real-time requirement. In order to address this issue, a new communication strategy is proposed in this study. The strategy is based on the time performance features of different smart grid CPS applications, which also exploits both temporal and spatial available spectrum resources for transmitting via spectrum sharing techniques. Moreover, the performance has been verified by a case study based on IEEE 14-bus power system. An important real-time application, namely real-time voltage stability enhancement, has been investigated in the case study. Results show that the proposed communication strategy is able to improve the throughput of the smart grid CPS and the time performance of time sensitive applications.	cyber-physical system	Minglei You;Qitao Liu;Hongjian Sun	2017	IET Cyper-Phys.

49bb53a495699499b978bcfe615426f13f21b037	comparison of spectral and energy efficiency metrics using measurements in a lte-a network		Energy and spectral efficiencies are key metrics to assess the performance of networks and compare different configurations or techniques. There are many ways to define those metrics, and the performance indicators used in their calculation can also be measured in different ways. Using an LTE-A network, we measure different performance indicators and the metrics' outputs are compared. Modifying the transmitted output power, the bandwidth, and the number of base stations, different network configurations are also compared. As expected, the measurements show that increasing the bandwidth increases the throughput more than it increases the energy consumption. Results clearly show that using inappropriate indicators can be misleading. The power indicator should include all energy consumed and the throughput should be dependent on the traffic, taking into account the idle time of the network, if any. There is a need to include more performance indicators into the metrics, especially those related to quality of service.	bandwidth (signal processing);broadcast television systems inc.;compaq lte;java platform, standard edition;quality of service;software deployment;spectral efficiency;stellar classification;throughput;user experience	Sandrine Boumard;Ilkka Harjula;Teemu Kanstrén;Patel S	2018	2018 Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA)	10.23919/TMA.2018.8506529	performance indicator;computer network;throughput;lte advanced;real-time computing;energy consumption;efficient energy use;quality of service;idle;computer science;bandwidth (signal processing)	Metrics	24.322655037800228	90.51073828888637	112031

In the field trial, the LTE network shared the spectrum with a program making and special events Incumbent. New LSA concept elements, LSA Repository for Incumbent protection information and LSA Controller for controlling the mobile broadband network in the same spectrum band were implemented in the trial environment. The trial utilized commercially available network elements like multimode multiband terminals, LTE base stations, core network and network management system. Incumbent spectrum usage data was collected to the LSA repository, which further converts it to spectrum availability information for the LSA controller. The trial goes beyond previous LSA demonstrations by presenting LSA controller power control concept algorithm that formulate the optimization objective as a function of base station cell transmit powers. An advantage of this procedure is that considering aggregated interference from the LTE network to Incumbent and adjusting the transmit power levels do not result in abrupt changes in the received signal quality and results better overall throughput. The developed LSA controller was implemented as self-organizing network solution integrated into network management system. Numerical results are presented to quantify the duration of the LSA procedure flow. The performance results on the LSA system workflow indicated that in the program, making special event use case the LSA band can be managed timely manner and the Incumbents’ rights can be protected.	algorithm;compaq lte	Seppo Yrjölä;Vesa Hartikainen;Lucia Tudose;Jaakko Ojaniemi;Arto Kivinen;Tero Kippola	2017	Signal Processing Systems	10.1007/s11265-016-1170-1	real-time computing;power control;mobile broadband;throughput;control theory;network monitoring;algorithm;computer science;core network;network element;base station	Arch	23.50194341219248	92.69327395841243	112164

In particular, we evaluate the amount of energy that can be saved by using all networks in high traffic conditions, but progressively switching off networks during the periods when traffic decreases, and eventually becomes so low that the desired quality of service can be obtained with just one network. When a network is switched off, its customers are allowed to roam over those networks that remain powered on. Several alternatives are studied, as regards the traffic profile, the switch-off pattern, the energy cost model, and the roaming policy. Numerical results indicate that a huge amount of energy can be saved with an energy-aware cooperative management of the networks, and suggest that, to reduce energy consumption, and thus the cost to operate the networks, new cooperative attitudes of the operators should be encouraged with appropriate incentives, or even enforced by regulation authorities. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

9296117fdc93415c34389cb5f78b7317cb35990f	a user-centric wireless networks' optimization method for data service		The optimization method based on traditional KPI statistics can’t effectively meet the goal of improving user experience of quality (QoE). Based on QoE, this paper presents a kind of user-centric wireless networks optimization method that includes a users’ QoE evaluation model and a locating the network problems method for data service. We propose a novel way of data analysis to build users’ QoE evaluation model to allow operators to monitor users experience quality. Based on the technology of data fusion, we exploit a data mining algorithm for diging out the problems leading poor users’ QoE and the corresponding probability from multisource data. Consequently, the operators can not only real-time monitor the entire network users’ QoE and actively identify the wireless network problems, but also obtain reference guidance for the network optimization staff by utilizing the method. Obviously, this method ensures users’ QoE and helps saving a large amount of manpower in networks optimization.

Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) can be a possible solution to enhance indoor coverage, deliver high bandwidths and off-load traffic from the macro base stations. However, this technology is still under development and several open issues have to be still investigated, such as interference coordination, power consumption, resources management and handover techniques. The aim of this work is to guarantee the reduction of power consumption using a new handover algorithm based on green policy. In addition, the proposed scheme guarantees the minimization of unnecessary handovers. The simulation campaigns have been conducted through the open-source Network Simulator 3 (NS-3). The preliminary results demonstrate that an efficient use of green approach improves the HetNETs performance in terms of power saving, energy efficiency and allow to reduces the number of unnecessary handovers.	algorithm;compaq lte;data rate units;green book (cd standard);hoc (programming language);interference (communication);machine to machine;open-source software;programming paradigm;simulation	Giuseppe Araniti;John Cosmas;Antonio Iera;Antonella Molinaro;Antonino Orsino;Pasquale Scopelliti	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting	10.1109/BMSB.2014.6873558	real-time computing;geography;telecommunications;radio resource management;computer network	Embedded	24.112029513897873	90.22504571670228	113547

Furthermore, the tolerable delay varies depending on the use case such as live streaming or two-way video conferencing. Due to the inherently stochastic nature of wireless fading channels, deterministic delay bounds are difficult to guarantee. Instead, we propose providing statistical delay guarantees using the concept of effective capacity. We consider a multiuser setup whereby different users have (possibly different) delay QoS constraints. We derive the resource allocation policy that maximizes the sum video quality and applies to any quality metric with concave rate-quality mapping. We show that the optimal operating point per user is such that the rate-distortion slope is the inverse of the supported video source rate per unit bandwidth, a key metric we refer to as the source spectral efficiency. We extend the resource allocation policy to capture video quality-driven adaptive user-subcarrier assignment in wideband channels as well as capture the impact of adaptive modulation and coding. We also solve the alternative problem of fairness-based resource allocation whereby the objective is to maximize the minimum video quality across users. Finally, we derive user admission and scheduling policies that enable selecting a maximal user subset such that all selected users can meet their statistical delay requirement. Results show that video users with differentiated QoS requirements can achieve similar video quality with vastly different resource requirements. Thus, QoS-aware scheduling and resource allocation enable supporting significantly more users under the same resource constraints.	asp.net;concave function;distortion;fairness measure;maximal set;modulation;multi-user;operating point;provisioning;quality of service;real-time transcription;requirement;scheduling (computing);server (computing);spectral efficiency;streaming media;subcarrier;video	Amin Abdel Khalek;Constantine Caramanis;Robert W.

This sensing range has a similar definition as the carrier sensing range of IEEE 802.11 MAC. It is widely considered that a SU is permitted to utilize the primary channel if no primary user (PU) transmits data inside its sensing range. However, it is observed that a busy PU outside the sensing range still can be detected by SU. As a result, the SU misinterprets that this busy PU is inside its sensing range, and hereby loses opportunity to utilize the primary channel. This new sensing issue is termed as spatial false alarm (SFA) problem. In this paper, we show the SFA can obviously reduce the SU's sensing performance, and cause the probabilities of false alarm and detection evaluated in current research have a great deviation with the actual results. To solve this SFA issue, the principle of SFA is studied thoroughly: i) this paper reveals the cause of this sensing problem, and presents the related approaches to ameliorate its negative impact; ii) this paper provides a reliable performance evaluation method to allow the SU to be aware of the real sensing results rather than the current works. Furthermore, with regarding the SFA, this paper derives the general upper and lower bounds of SU's sensing performance to have an insight into various sensing applications.	cognitive radio;ibm systems network architecture;performance evaluation;primary channel;simple features;superuser	Weijia Han;Jiandong Li;Yuquan Li;Jiangbo Si;Yan Zhang	2013	IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing	10.1109/TSP.2012.2236833	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	17.666253073357716	88.97104178676994	114100

The existed popular anti-collision algorithms are ALOHA-type algorithms and QT. But these methods show good performance when the number of tags to read is small and not dynamic. However, when the number of tags to read is large and dynamic, the efficiency of recognition is very low. A novel approach to mapped correlation of ID for RFID anti-collision has been proposed to solve the problem in this paper. This method can increase the association between tags so that tags can send their own ID under certain trigger conditions, by mapped correlation of ID, querying on multi-tree becomes more efficient. In the case of not too big number of tags, by replacing the actual ID with the temporary ID, the method can greatly reduce the number of times that the reader reads and writes to tag's ID. In the case of dynamic ALOHA-type applications, the reader can determine the locations of the empty slots according to the position of the binary pulse, so it can avoid the decrease in efficiency which is caused by reading empty slots when reading slots. Experiments have shown this method can greatly improve the recognition efficiency of the system.	algorithm;deterministic finite automaton;radio-frequency identification	Degan Zhang;Xiuli Wang;Xiao-dong Song;Dexin Zhao	2014	IEEE Transactions on Services Computing	10.1109/TSC.2014.2370642	radio-frequency identification;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;world wide web;correlation;computer network	Mobile	10.322416760524728	94.15782322351058	114634
d646dc82de427d9ef869222eee1225a0023c74e4	efficient traffic offloading for seamless connectivity in 5g networks onboard high speed trains		Seamless wireless connectivity in high mobility scenarios (> 300 km/h), is one of the fundamental key requirements for the future 5G networks. High speed train (HST) is one of the preferred mid-range transportation systems, and highlights the challenges of providing wireless connectivity in high mobility scenarios for the 5G networks. Advanced version of Long Term Evolution (LTE-A) from the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) with peak data rate up to 100 Mbps in high mobility scenarios paved the road toward high quality and cost effective onboard Internet in HSTs. However, frequent handovers (HO) of large number of onboard users increase the service interruptions that in turn inevitably decrease the experienced quality of service (QoS). In this paper, according to the two-tier architecture of the HST wireless connectivity, we propose a novel and practically viable onboard traffic offloading mechanism among the HST carriages that effectively mitigates the service interruptions caused by frequent HOs of massive number of onboard users. The proposed architecture does not imply any change on the LTE network standardization. Conclusions are supported by numerical results for realistic LTE parameters and current HST settings.	compaq lte;data rate units;display resolution;multitier architecture;numerical analysis;quality of service;requirement;seamless3d;uncompressed video	Leila Jalili;Ali Parichehreh;Stefan Alfredsson;Johan Garcia;Anna Brunstrom	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292462	computer network;real-time computing;the internet;standardization;quality of service;train;architecture;3rd generation partnership project 2;wireless;computer science	Mobile	22.75150804769733	88.64845343605457	114986

Building on recent work in the field of network coding, we describe the input-output relations of network nodes in terms of network codes. This very general concept of network behavior as a code provides a way to quantify essential management information as that needed to switch among different codes (behaviors) for different failure scenarios. We compare two types of recovery schemes, receiver-based and network-wide, and consider two formulations for quantifying network management. The first is a centralized formulation where network behavior is described by an overall code determining the behavior of every node, and the management requirement is taken as the logarithm of the number of such codes that the network may switch among. For this formulation, we give bounds, many of which are tight, on management requirements for various network connection problems in terms of basic parameters such as the number of source processes and the number of links in a minimum source-receiver cut. Our results include a lower bound for arbitrary connections and an upper bound for multitransmitter multicast connections, for linear receiver-based and network-wide recovery from all single link failures. The second is a node-based formulation where the management requirement is taken as the sum over all nodes of the logarithm of the number of different behaviors for each node. We show that the minimum node-based requirement for failures of links adjacent to a single receiver is achieved with receiver-based schemes.	centralized computing;code;ergodicity;information theory;linear network coding;management information system;multicast;overhead (computing);requirement	Tracey Ho;Muriel Médard;Ralf Koetter	2005	IEEE Transactions on Information Theory	10.1109/TIT.2005.844062	telecommunications;information theory;computer science;mathematics;network simulation;distributed computing;upper and lower bounds;statistics;computer network	Networks	15.410869670894304	92.05077009052444	115024

The practicality of such a system increases significantly in sparse areas such as countryside and motorways. The deployment of standalone off-grid wind powered roadside units could alleviate the common issues related to grid connected renewable energy farms. Hence, there is need to study the feasibility of an off-grid wind powered roadside unit for seamless connectivity. Unlike the conventional usage of reliability analysis of fault-tolerant systems, in this paper, reliability is redefined in the context of availability of intermittent wind for powering a roadside unit (RSU) in a UK motorway vehicular environment. Transient analysis of energy consumption (energy demand) of the RSU and harnessed wind energy are carried out along with real measurements for developing respective generic energy models. Further, a generalised methodology is developed to determine the minimum battery size for achieving a certain reliability standard and quality of service. Several reliability indices such as loss of load probability (LOLP), loss of load expectation (LOLE), energy index of reliability (EIR), mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to recovery (MTTR), forced outage rate (FOR), etc. are obtained for the RSU. The performance results reveal that with a standard micro-turbine and a reasonably small battery, an RSU achieves a good reliability of 99.9% with significant improvement in the quality of service.

fb760e0812038fc7fc5ca24e962dcd8b88004959	rate-aware network codes for video distortion reduction in point-to-multipoint networks		This paper considers a wireless point-to-multipoint network in which a base station needs to broadcast a real-time video sequence to a set of devices with heterogeneous channel capacities. In such a scenario, a packet transmission is successfully received at a given device if the adopted transmission rate is lower than the channel capacity of that device. To reduce the video distortion of all devices before the deadline, this paper employs instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) and formulates the video distortion minimization problem as a Markov decision process. Given that the optimal policy suffers from a high computational complexity, an online maximal clique selection algorithm over a rate-aware IDNC graph is proposed to heuristically select a transmission rate and a packet combination at each transmission. This heuristic reduces the individual video distortions of all devices by incorporating the unequal importance of video packets, the hard deadline, and the various channel capacities into the coding decisions. Furthermore, this heuristic is modified to propose a fairer solution that delivers a good quality video to individual devices regardless of their channel conditions. Simulation results over a real video sequence reveal that the proposed IDNC algorithms improve the received video quality as compared to existing rate-aware IDNC algorithms.	channel capacity;clique (graph theory);computation;computational complexity theory;distortion;fairness measure;heuristic (computer science);linear network coding;markov chain;markov decision process;maximal set;multipoint ground;network packet;point-to-multipoint communication;real-time clock;selection algorithm;simulation;sorting	Mohammad Shahedul Karim;Ahmed Douik;Sameh Sorour	2017	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2017.2674674	computer network;linear network coding;selection algorithm;computer science;real-time computing;video quality;network packet;heuristic;communication channel;channel capacity;broadcasting	Mobile	21.074882005514773	98.14689868752029	115562

We study the effects of topology on the throughput capacity. This problem is inherently difficult since it is complex to handle the interference caused by simultaneous transmission. To solve this problem, we, according to the inhomogeneity of topology, divide the transmission into intra-cluster transmission and inter-cluster transmission. For the intra-cluster transmission, a spheroidal percolation model is constructed. The spheroidal percolation model guarantees a constant rate when a power control strategy is adopted. We also propose a cube percolation mode for the inter-cluster transmission. Different from the spheroidal percolation model, a constant transmission rate can be achieved without power control. For both transmissions, we propose a routing scheme with five phases. By comparing the achievable rate of each phase, we get the rate bottleneck, which is the throughput capacity of the network.	control theory;interference (communication);network packet;percolation theory;routing;sparse matrix;storage networking certification program;throughput	Qiuming Liu;Xuejing Jiang;Xiaohong Qiu	2017	Information	10.3390/info8010032	mathematical optimization;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;percolation;computer network	Mobile	16.633883492707252	88.78598020874551	115983

In this paper, a distributed algorithm for wireless ad hoc networks which is contention-based and makes use of a back off mechanism is proposed. This algorithm aims to eliminate overhead communication, improve fairness, allow nodes to operate asynchronously while establishing some performance level.

In this work, we present the system architecture where multiple road side units (RSUs) are cooperated to provide information services, and the vehicles can upload up-to-date information to RSUs via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. On this basis, we formulate the distributed temporal data management (DTDM) problem as a two-objective problem, which aims to enhance overall system performance on both the service quality and the service ratio simultaneously. Further, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm called MO-DTDM to obtain a set of pareto solutions and analyze how to fulfill given requirements on system performance with obtained pareto solutions. Finally, we build the simulation model and give a comprehensive performance evaluation, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed optimization method.	data quality;evolutionary algorithm;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;multi-objective optimization;network packet;pareto efficiency;performance evaluation;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;systems architecture;throughput;upload;vehicle-to-vehicle	Penglin Dai;Kai Liu;Liang Feng;Qingfeng Zhuge;Victor Chung Sing Lee;Sang Hyuk Son	2016	2016 IEEE 41st Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)	10.1109/LCN.2016.117	data modeling;simulation;computer science;operating system;data mining;distributed database;computer security;information system;bandwidth;computer network	DB	11.245577005723572	98.45328048932532	116319

However, current backhaul networks statically allocate resources, resulting in minuscule allocations when many small cells are connected to cellular operators with given resources. We introduce a novel access backhaul network architecture based on a smart gateway (Sm-GW) between the small cell base stations, e.g., long term evolution (LTE) enhanced Nodes B (eNBs), and the conventional backhaul gateways, e.g., LTE servicing/packet gateways (S/P-GWs). We specify the modest LTE protocol modifications that integrate the Sm-GW into the conventional LTE network. The Sm-GW flexibly schedules uplink transmissions for the eNBs. Our simulation evaluations indicate that the Sm-GW scheduling can fairly allocate uplink transmission bitrates to the eNBs and reduce packet delays. Based on software defined networking (SDN), we introduce a management mechanism that allows multiple operators, i.e., multiple S/P-GWs, to flexibly inter-operate via multiple Sm-GWs with a multitude of small cells. An SDN orchestrator coordinates the adaptive allocation of uplink transmission bitrates to Sm-GWs (which in turn allocate the uplink transmission bitrates to eNBs based on their demands). We formulate optimization problems for the operator (S/P-GW) resource allocation to Sm-GWs without and with sharing among operators. Our numerical evaluations indicate that the flexible SDN orchestration substantially increases the network throughput compared to the current static resource allocations.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);compaq lte;gw-basic;mathematical optimization;network architecture;network packet;numerical analysis;scheduling (computing);simulation;software-defined networking;telecommunications link;throughput	Akhilesh S.

The reasons for such a change have been ease of management and better design of various control and security functions. The data path of WLANs, however, continues to use the distributed, random-access model, as defined by the popular DCF mechanism of the 802.11 standard. While theoretical results indicate that a centrally scheduled data path can achieve higher efficiency than its distributed counterpart, the likely complexity of such a solution has inhibited practical consideration. In this paper, we take a fresh, implementation and deployment oriented, view in understanding data path choices in enterprise WLANs. We perform extensive measurements to characterize the impact of various design choices, like scheduling granularity on the performance of a centralized scheduler, and identify regions where such a centralized scheduler can provide the best gains.  Our detailed evaluation with scheduling prototypes deployed on two different wireless testbeds indicates that DCF is quite robust in many scenarios, but centralization can play a unique role in 1) mitigating hidden terminals - scenarios which may occur infrequently, but become pain points when they do and 2) exploiting exposed terminals - scenarios which occur more frequently, and limit the potential of successful concurrent transmissions. Motivated by these results, we design and implement CENTAUR - a hybrid data path for enterprise WLANs, that combines the simplicity and ease of DCF with a limited amount of centralized scheduling from a unique vantage point. Our mechanisms do not require client cooperation and can support legacy 802.11 clients.	backoff;centralized computing;design rule for camera file system;network packet;random access;scheduling (computing);software deployment;telecommunications link	Vivek Shrivastava;Nabeel Ahmed;Shravan K.

This paper recovers a non-cooperative game model from the protocol. We show that the control algorithm used by Idle Sense can be reverse-engineered so that each node implicitly maximizes a selfish local utility function. We prove the game has a Nash equilibrium which, under certain conditions, is unique with all nodes sharing the wireless channel equally. We perform extensive numerical simulations to get the equilibrium point for various network sizes and compare the performance of the model with IEEE 802.11 DCF. The achieved throughput at equilibrium is close to optimal.

The two main features at the PHY layer are: MIMO and channel bonding, while the main throughput enhancing feature at the MAC/link layer is Frame Aggregation. While in theory, as well as in controlled experimental conditions, these features achieve throughput enhancements, the extent to which they are useful for in-the-wild deployments has not been studied thus far. This paper presents measurements from three sets of traces: one from a research conference, one from a busy airport, and the third from a dense classroom setting with extensive WiFi usage for classroom activities. Our findings are as follows: (a) the high data rates of 802.11n are not used substantially, although the presence of moderate rates is significant, (b) the use of the channel bonding feature is minimal in dense deployments, and (c) the percentage of bytes undergoing frame aggregation is considerable but the levels of aggregation are not very high. We also undertake controlled experiments which shed light on non-wireless, system bottlenecks. Specifically, we find that many clients are not equipped to handle high levels of frame aggregation. Worse, this interacts badly with the rate adaptation algorithm, significantly lowering the data rates being used. These issues need careful addressing before 802.11n features are used effectively.	algorithm;byte;channel bonding;emoticon;experiment;mimo;phy (chip);throughput;tracing (software)	Naman Mishra;Avinash Chaurasia;Arun Kallavi;Bhaskaran Raman;Purushottam Kulkarni	2015	2015 7th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	10.1109/COMSNETS.2015.7098700	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;electrical engineering;operating system;computer security;computer network	Mobile	12.034690704682053	94.19319040593764	117608

However, due to the global climate change, reducing the energy consumption of cellular infrastructures is an important and urgent problem. In this study, we propose a novel two-level cooperative game framework for improving the energy efficiency and fairness in cellular networks. For the energy efficiency, base stations (BSs) constantly monitor the current traffic load and cooperate with each other to maximize the energy saving. For the energy fairness, renewable energy can be shared dynamically while ensuring the fairness among BSs. To achieve an excellent cellular network performance, the concepts of the Raiffa Bargaining Solution and Jain’s fairness are extended and practically applied to our dual-level cooperative game model. Through system level simulations, the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared with other existing schemes. The simulation results show that our two-level game approach outperforms the existing schemes in providing a better fair-efficient system performance.	algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);coexist (image);fairness measure;low-power broadcasting;network performance;next-generation network;overhead (computing);simulation;sysop;telecommunications network	Sungwook Kim	2016	Mobile Information Systems	10.1155/2016/9036929	fairness measure;simulation;computer security	Mobile	24.30329140351218	90.92830360196908	117632

Their purpose is to guarantee stable operation and to achieve some form of fairness among users, whenever the traffic demand exceeds network capacity. Despite the plethora of work in this field, the scenario where one or more nodes declare false queue backlog values in order to gain throughput advantage remains unexplored. In this paper we examine this type of selfish misbehavior, concentrating on a specific class of algorithms, the so-called quadratic Lyapunov-function-based algorithms (QLA). In particular, the effect of backlog misreporting on a single-hop access network with contending stations is evaluated through simulations. A simple framework for the detection of misbehaving nodes is proposed, under the assumption that the access-point is aware of the utility functions of the stations. The detection approach exploits the fact that under QLA the throughput of a node must be approximately equal to an """"expected"""" value, derived from the reported queue backlogs."""	access network;algorithm;approximation;fairness measure;lyapunov fractal;mathematical optimization;refinement (computing);simulation;throughput	Dimitris Giatsios;Iordanis Koutsopoulos;Thanasis Korakis	2012	2012 IEEE 20th International Workshop on Quality of Service	10.1109/IWQoS.2012.6245985	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;multilevel queue;telecommunications;lyapunov function;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;queueing theory;expected value;statistics;computer network;access network	Metrics	15.81929769969743	96.3005028651142	117723

However, since the QoS was considered only within a predetermined cell capacity, the results indicated a serious overload problem of systems not guaranteeing both CDP and CBP constraints, especially in the hotspot cell. That is why a close interrelationship between CDP, CBP and cell capacity exists. Thus, it is indispensable to consider optimal cell capacity guaranteeing multiple QoS (CDP and CBP) at the time of initial cell planning for networks deployment. In this paper, we will suggest a distributed determination scheme of optimal cell capacity guaranteeing both CDP and CBP from a long-term perspective for initial cell planning. The cell-provisioning scheme is performed by using both the two-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain and an iterative method called the Gauss-Seidel method. Finally, numerical and simulation results will demonstrate that our scheme successfully determines an optimal cell capacity guaranteeing both CDP and CBP constraints for initial cell planning.	algorithm;erlang (unit);gauss–seidel method;iterative method;java hotspot virtual machine;markov chain;numerical analysis;provisioning;quality of service;simulation;software deployment	YoungHa Hwang;SungKee Noh;Sang Ha Kim	2006	JIPS	10.3745/JIPS.2006.2.2.088	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Robotics	21.84913646812459	95.0916365421037	117805

Transmitters in the networkare subject to average power constraints per link and peak power constraints per node. Subject to these constraints, we find optimal subsets ofeoncurrent transmitters and associated power levels to maximize network throughput, taking into aecount multi-access interference. We find that when ambient noise levels are sufficiently high, it is generally desirable to enable simultaneous transmissions, even if they are in close geographic proximity. We compare our results against pure CDMA to illustrate the significant gains of our approach. The results in this paper are applicable to multihop and single hop networks.	interference (communication);scheduling (computing);throughput;transmitter	Rene L.

In fact, it is considered as an emerging technology to provide ubiquitous connectivity among devices without human intervention. Due to its wide coverage and Heterogeneous Networks(HetNets), the next generation of communication system, which is commonly referred to as 5G cellular network, is expected to support, besides traditional voice and data traffic, M2M communication. However, this new communication paradigm generates concurrent and massive access attempts with small data traffic and low mobility. As consequently, this latter may cause overload problems in the radio access network (RAN), which lead to intolerable access delay, packet loss and even unavailability service. In this paper, we derive an optimal model to handle Random Access (RA) loads from MTC devices. Our interest is based on balancing Random Access intensity among macro and small cells in order to reduce the collision probability, increase network resource utilization and minimize access delay. The proposed model is assessed via analysis and simulations. Related results show the ability to maintain the optimal RA while satisfying the load balancing between cells.	compaq lte;interference (communication);internet of things;load balancing (computing);machine to machine;network congestion;network packet;next-generation network;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;quality of service;radio access network;random access;simulation;throughput;traffic collision avoidance system;unavailability	Kaouther Taleb Ali;Sonia Ben Rejeb;Zièd Choukair	2016	2016 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)	10.1109/ISNCC.2016.7746069	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	21.29929561892905	91.42911045036583	118035

Prior studies on this problem only consider one objective, e.g., maximizing the revenues by mapping more VNs or minimizing the energy cost. In this paper, we addressed the virtual network embedding problem with these two objectives. We leverage niche particle swarm optimization technique to design a meta-heuristic algorithm to solve this problem.

Due to such interferences, pessimistic concerns have been recently raised with respect to the decreasing network capacity in wireless ad hoc networks when the number of nodes scales to several orders of magnitude higher. In this paper, we argue that in all cases of end-to-end data communications - including one-to-k unicast and multicast data dissemination as well as k-to-one data aggregation - the maximum achievable end-to-end data throughput (measured on the sources) heavily depends on the strategy of arranging the topology of transmission between sources and destinations, as well as possible per-node operations such as coding. An optimal strategy achieves better end-to-end throughput than an arbitrary one. We present theoretical studies and critical insights with respect to how these strategies may be designed so that end-to-end throughput may be increased	approximation algorithm;data aggregation;distributed algorithm;end-to-end encryption;end-to-end principle;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);multicast;network topology;scalability;semantic network;throughput;unicast	Zongpeng Li;Baochun Li	2005	Second International Conference on Quality of Service in Heterogeneous Wired/Wireless Networks (QSHINE'05)	10.1109/QSHINE.2005.36	wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	13.334058002227362	90.05821637126093	118540
43b1bfbfe089172077d5775568b164799984917d	efficient resource utilization for heterogeneous wireless personal area networks	radio resource management;heterogeneous networks	Wireless personal area networks (WPANs) will play an important role in next-generation communication networks. Currently, two technologies are being considered for the physical layer of WPANs, based on the two ultra wideband (UWB) standards, namely, multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) UWB and direct-sequence (DS) UWB. The coexistence issue of these two types of WPANs in the same coverage area, raises new issues and introduces new problems which should be dealt with to avoid performance degradation. In particular, efficient radio resource management (RRM) in such environments is challenging. Indeed, the coexistence of heterogenous UWB based WPANs (UPANs) has an ad hoc nature, which requires RRM approaches that are different from traditional infrastructure-based ones. In this paper, we propose new algorithms for two RRM modules in heterogeneous UPANs, namely, radio access technology (RAT) selection and vertical handoff (VHO). To improve the overall performance of the system, our design considers possible narrowband interference (NBI) in the environment as well as the link outage probability, in the decision process. We also provide an analytical model based on a 4D Markov process to study the system in equilibrium and derive the performance metrics, namely, the new-call and handoff-call blocking probabilities, throughput and average carried traffic. Numerical results and comparisons show that our design achieves enhanced performance in terms of throughput and grade of service (GoS). key words: radio resource management, heterogeneous networks, MBOFDM, DS-UWB, vertical handoff, grade of service	algorithm;assistive technology;blocking (computing);coexist (image);downtime;elegant degradation;frequency divider;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);multiplexing;radio resource management;telecommunications network;throughput;ultra-wideband;variometer	Abolfazl Mehbodniya;Sonia Aïssa;Fumiyuki Adachi	2013	IEICE Transactions		grade of service;real-time computing;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;operating system;computer network	Mobile	23.111653928213748	90.43791377249538	119142

The network covers a whole service area with macrocells and high traffic density areas with microcells. The location tracking scheme requires each mobile platform (MP) to count the number of macrocell boundary crossings from the last location update and use the number, compared with two thresholds, to determine which tier to report to. If it is greater than or equal to the lower threshold the MP is allowed to update location information but report only to a low-tier microcell. If it reaches the higher threshold the MP reports immediately to the overlaying macrocell and resets the counter. For the scheme combined with one-step paging, expected total tracking cost per call is analyzed based on the MP mobility modelled as a semi-Markov chain with uniform transitions between neighboring microcell areas and the presence of a microcell determined by a Bernoulli trial with probability p of success. Results, corroborated by simulations, show that the analysis yields accurate performance bounds for a wide range of parameters. This allows us to study the effects of several critical factors on tracking costs.

27ed3d72f480f8ba001b8d0a68af4c3a14ebdfa9	an improved algorithm for transmission in heterogeneous cellular networks		This paper presents improvements to a coverage algorithm that we previously proposed for use in heterogeneous cellular networks, with the improved algorithm being referred to as the modified coverage algorithm. The modified coverage algorithm maintains the coverage advantages provided by the previous coverage algorithm; that is, users can be covered by the network in any scenario and unnecessary power consumption can be avoided through the use of the algorithm. The modified coverage algorithm also mitigates the sole disadvantage of the previous coverage algorithm, that is, its inability to meet users' transmission rate requirements, instead ensuring that the respective transmission rate requirements of all users can be typically met. According to the simulation results, compared with the previous coverage algorithm, the modified coverage algorithm improves the average transmission rate significantly (especially when the traffic volume is low) at the small expense of a slightly increased outage ratio under high traffic volumes; however, based on our design, the users who face an increase in the outage ratio are of lower priority. As a result, the system's overall performance is at an acceptable level.	genetic algorithm;requirement;simulation;sun outage	Yao-Liang Chung	2017	2017 Twelfth International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM)	10.1109/ICDIM.2017.8244692	traffic volume;computer science;algorithm design;algorithm;cellular network;transmission (mechanics)	Mobile	21.085943935589693	92.9030232743553	119254

Specifically, the problem scenario consists of a wireless transmitter with B units of data that must be transmitted by deadline T over a fading channel. The transmitter can control the transmission rate over time and the required instantaneous power depends on the chosen rate and the present channel condition, with limits on short-term average power consumption. The objective is to obtain the optimal rate-control policy that minimizes the total energy expenditure while ensuring that the deadline constraint is met. Using a continuous-time stochastic control formulation and a Lagrangian duality approach, we explicitly obtain the optimal policy and show that it possesses a very simple and intuitive form. Finally, we present an illustrative simulation example comparing the energy costs of the optimal policy with the full power policy.	augmented lagrangian method;duality (optimization);network packet;simulation;stochastic control;transmitter	Murtaza Zafer;Eytan Modiano	2009	IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control	10.1109/TAC.2009.2034202	stochastic process;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;mathematics;efficient energy use;fading	Embedded	17.74919195465905	95.92005400307524	119285
dccf5803fe2423cbc8494f6b11fe24ef979d8563	qos-based multi-criteria handoff algorithm for femto-macro cellular networks	femtocell;handoff;received signal strength (rss);interference;outage probability	The hierarchical coexistence of femtocells and macrocells is a promising approach for heterogeneous networks (HetNets), dealing mainly with indoor coverage issues and providing high data rates in cellular networks. As for any HetNet, mobility management with handoff issues on top, should be studied prior to hindering the successful deployment of these networks. The current study introduces a new handoff algorithm in hierarchical macro/femtocell HetNets based on the combination of quality of service metrics for efficient network selection including: received signal strength, co-channel interference level, and outage probability of each of femtocell and macrocell networks. The proposed algorithm first collects the measured three mentioned metrics based on mobile station (MS) location, then applies a dynamic weighting system to three-metric sets according to the significance of each metric to obtain one utility for each of femtocell and macrocell networks. The obtained utility is then used as a measure for determining handoff necessity. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the paper then introduces analytical model of cell assignment probability for an MS moving from the serving macrocell base station to the target femtocell base station in a two-tier cellular network. The analytical and simulation results indicate the efficiency of the proposed handoff algorithm in comparison with the existing algorithms in terms of cell assignment probability, throughput, number of handoffs, and ping-pong rate.	algorithm;quality of service	Hashem Kalbkhani;Sahar Jafarpour;Mahrokh G.

Our focus is on SUs' queueing delay performance, for which a systematic understanding is lacking. We take a fluid queue approximation approach to study the steady-state delay performance of SUs, for cases with a single PU channel and multiple PU channels. Using stochastic fluid models, we represent the queue dynamics as Poisson driven stochastic differential equations, and characterize the moments of the SUs' queue lengths accordingly. Since in practical systems, a secondary user would have no knowledge of other users' activities, its contention probability has to be set based on local information. With this observation, we develop adaptive algorithms to find the optimal contention probability that minimizes the mean queue lengths. Moreover, we study the impact of multiple channels and multiple interfaces, on SUs' delay performance. As expected, the use of multiple channels and/or multiple interfaces leads to significant delay reduction.	algorithm;approximation;cognitive radio;duty cycle;ibm systems network architecture;maxima and minima;mean squared error;multichannel multipoint distribution service;numerical analysis;one-class classification;queuing delay;random access;steady state	Shanshan Wang;Junshan Zhang;Lang Tong	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5461943	mathematical optimization;cognitive radio;simulation;multilevel queue;computer science;theoretical computer science;statistics;fluid dynamics	Metrics	14.722996763586298	97.28958136817603	119573

We optimally solve the problem in both cases, and prove that the schedulability does depend on the aggregation policy. This allows us to derive rules of thumb to identify which policy improves the schedulability with a given traffic. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic solution strategy that allows good suboptimal solutions to the scheduling problem to be computed in relatively small times, comparable to those required for online admission control in relatively large WMNs.	alessandro vespignani;algorithm;end-to-end principle;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;real-time transcription;scheduling (computing);serializability;wireless mesh network	Paola Cappanera;Alessandro Lori;Giovanni Stea;Gigliola Vaglini	2015	Comput.

The work started in Rel-10 by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) had the initial objective of meeting the International Mobile Telecommunications-Advanced (IMTAdvanced) requirements set by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) which defined fourth generation (4G) systems. However, predictions based on the wireless traffic explosion in recent years indicate a need for more advanced technologies and higher performance. Hence, 3GPP’s efforts have continued through Rel-11 and now Rel-12. This paper provides a state-of-the-art comprehensive view on the key enabling technologies for LTE-Advanced systems.

This article presents a simple and pragmatic reinforcement learning (RL)-based routing scheme called Cognitive Radio Q-routing (CRQ-routing). CRQ-routing is a spectrum-aware scheme that finds least-cost routes taking into account the dynamicity and unpredictability of channel availability and channel quality, as well as interference to PUs. RL is applied to enable each SU node to observe, learn and make action selection that maximizes network performance as time goes by; and this is essential as it may not be feasible to define actions for all possible sets of network conditions. Simulation results show that CRQ-routing minimizes SUs' interference to PUs, SUs' end-to-end delay, SUs' packet loss rate, as well as maximizes SUs' throughput.	action selection;bit error rate;cognitive radio;cross-recurrence quantification;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);ibm systems network architecture;interference (communication);network packet;network performance;reinforcement learning;routing;simulation;throughput;white spaces (radio)	Hasan A.

f4a6ac670235694ec4fc19f42a2a09a718463572	a unified framework for analyzing closed queueing networks in bike sharing systems		During the last decade bike sharing systems have emerged as a public transport mode in urban short trips in more than 500 major cities around the world. For the mobility service mode, many challenges from its operations are not well addressed yet, for example, how to develop the bike sharing systems to be able to effectively satisfy the fluctuating demands both for bikes and for vacant lockers. To this end, it is a key to give performance analysis of the bike sharing systems. This paper first describes a large-scale bike sharing system. Then the bike sharing system is abstracted as a closed queueing network with multi-class customers, where the virtual customers and the virtual nodes are set up, and the service rates as well as the relative arrival rates are established. Finally, this paper gives a product-form solution to the steady state joint probabilities of queue lengths, and gives performance analysis of the bike sharing system. Therefore, this paper provides a unified framework for analyzing closed queueing networks in the study of bike sharing systems. We hope the methodology and results of this paper can be applicable in the study of more general bike sharing systems.	profiling (computer programming);queueing theory;steady state;unified framework	Quan-Lin Li;Rui-Na Fan;Jing-Yu Ma	2016	CoRR		simulation	Metrics	10.500991778928766	99.68349165802951	120060

To further improve the performance, the source may also make these nodes serve as agents, which can help the source to make other nodes serve as relays. However, nodes may not be willing to help the source without any reward because of the selfish nature. This means that the source has to pay certain reward to the nodes that provide help. Furthermore, such fees may be varying with time. For example, if the nodes guess that the source is eager to transmit the message to the destination, they may ask for more reward. In addition, the reward that the source obtains from the destination may be varying with time, too. For example, the sooner the destination gets the message, the more reward may be. In such complex case, it may not be good for the source to request help all the time. This paper proposes a unifying theoretical framework based on Ordinary Differential Equations to evaluate the total reward that the source can obtain. Then, based on the framework, we study the optimal control problem by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and prove that the optimal policy confirms to the threshold form in some cases. Simulations based on both synthetic and real motion traces show the accuracy of the framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of the optimal policy is the best through extensive numerical results.	routing	Yahui Wu;Hongbin Huang;Su Deng	2014	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-013-1385-4	real-time computing;simulation;optimal control;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	14.17273162841249	90.82094125819651	120072

Currently existing DMAC designs employ extra hardware or network-wide synchronization to overcome the hidden terminal problem. In the proposed CA-DMAC, the neighboring nodes around the negotiating pair actively participate in the link establishment procedure to eliminate hidden terminals. Further, since most of the previous DMAC studies employ ideal antenna model without minor-lobes, their performance may not be guaranteed in practice. In this paper, we also take the minor-lobe interference of directional antennas into consideration. The detail of the CA-DMAC is presented in the paper and the protocol's performance is validated via simulations in NS2. The results demonstrate that CA-DMAC can provide good spatial sharing gain and excellent performance in terms of throughput and data packet transmission ratio.

In order to adeptly access and analyze the energy efficiency of a cognitive radio network, a standardized metric for this purpose is required. As a starting point, in this article we provided an analysis for energy efficiency metrics of a cognitive radio network in respect to its design and operation. The performance metrics and metrics developed at the different levels of a cognitive radio network are also studied. Establishing a comprehensive metric for evaluating, measuring and reporting the energy efficiency of cognitive radio networks is a crucial step in achieving an energy-efficient cognitive radio network.	categorization;cognitive radio;color gradient;quality of service;telecommunications network	Efe Francis Orumwense;Thomas J.

We provide an approximation formula considering two scenarios (intercity bus and train) to estimate this probability for large networks. We then carry out a sensitivity analysis and supply a guide for operators when choosing the parameters of the networks. Last, we show that such systems are viable, as they attain a very low probability of long disconnections with a very low maintenance cost.	access network;approximation;denial-of-service attack;telecommuting	Frédéric Giroire;Juan-Carlos Maureira	2016	2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841604	transport;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;trajectory;computer security;network topology;computer network	Mobile	19.7964594607971	89.26430521218964	121783

We consider a novel and important factor, handset screen status, i.e., whether the screen is on or off, which was ignored by previous approaches for optimizing cellular resource utilization. Based on analyzing real smartphone traffic collected from 20 users over five months, we find that off-screen traffic accounts for 58.5% of the total radio energy consumption although their traffic volume contribution is much smaller. Such unexpected results are attributed to the unique cellular resource management policy that is not well understood by developers, leading to cellular-unfriendly mobile apps. We then make a further step by proposing screen-aware optimization, by leveraging the key observation that screen-off traffic is much more delay-tolerant than its screen-on counterpart due to a lack of user interaction. Our proposal can better balance the key tradeoffs in cellular networks. It saves up to 60.92% of the network energy and reduces signaling and delay overhead by 25.33% and 30.59%, respectively.	mathematical optimization;mobile app;network processor;overhead (computing);smartphone;spectral density	Junxian Huang;Feng Qian;Zhuoqing Morley Mao;Subhabrata Sen;Oliver Spatscheck	2012		10.1145/2398776.2398813	cellular network;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;artificial intelligence;lte advanced;operating system;computer security;computer network;traffic optimization	Metrics	21.124452342618145	90.0394128240287	121787

In this paper, we develop the PHY and MAC protocols to enable autonomous device discovery.

Previous studies on reducing the energy consumption of IEEE 802.11 WLAN systems mainly focused on the energy consumption of a single-link transmission only. However, due to its carrier sensing property, all the WLAN stations in the network receive the transmitted frames. Hence, this single-link transmission not only consumes the energy of the transmitter and receiver of the link, but also consumes the energy of the other stations. Moreover, most of the previous work on energy efficiency optimization problems were considered in MAC perspectives. In this paper, we show that the energy efficiency of all the stations in WLAN network can be optimized by our proposed adaptive transmission power control and rate selection scheme, with more accurate analysis of the energy consumption in IEEE 802.11 MAC and IEEE 802.11n PHY. The proposed adaptive transmission power control and rate selection scheme achieves an increase in an average energy efficiency of 34% at the cost of 5% throughput degradation for 800bits payload size and 20 users, for varying the distance from 0m to 90m.	elegant degradation;frame (networking);mathematical optimization;phy (chip);throughput;transmitter	Byoung Hoon Jung;Hu Jin;Dan Keun Sung	2012	2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2012.6362794	ieee 802.11s;logical link control;service set;network allocation vector;throughput;ieee 802.11;ieee 802.11g-2003;real-time computing;adaptive control;telecommunications;inter-access point protocol;ieee 802.11b-1999;power control;computer science;ieee 802.11h-2003;power optimization;computer network;ieee 802.11e-2005	Embedded	17.771351907899167	90.9445920334878	122181

To achieve this goal, the support of vertical handoff is important in mobility management. This paper focuses on the vertical handoff decision algorithm, which determines the cri teria under which vertical handoff should be performed. The problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process. The objective is to maximize the expected total reward of a connection subject to the expected total access cost constraint. In our model, a benefit function is used to assess the quality of the connection, and a penalty function is used to model the signaling incurred and call dropping. The user’s velocity and location information are also considered when making handoff decisions. The policy iteration and Q-learning algorithms are employed to determine the optimal policy. Structural results on the optimal verti cal handoff policy are derived by using the concept of supermodularity. We show that the optimal policy is a threshold policy in bandwidth, delay, and velocity. Numerical result show that our proposed vertical handoff decision algorithm outperforms other decision schemes in a wide range of conditions such as variations on connection duration, user’s v locity, user’s budget, traffic type, signaling cost, and mon etary access cost.	access network;algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);iteration;machine learning;markov chain;markov decision process;penalty method;q-learning;seamless3d;supermodular function;variometer;velocity (software development);wireless access point	Chi Sun;Enrique Stevens-Navarro;Vahid Shah-Mansouri;Vincent W.

6635369b8e9ace82b1599b0b23a11e4e2ecdfd21	show me the cache: optimizing cache-friendly recommendations for sequential content access		Caching has been successfully applied in wired networks, in the context of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs), and is quickly gaining ground for wireless systems. Storing popular content at the edge of the network (e.g, at small cells) is seen as a “win-win” for both the user (reduced access latency) and the operator (reduced load on the transport network and core servers). Nevertheless, the much smaller size of such edge caches, and the volatility of user preferences suggest that standard caching methods do not suffice in this context. What is more, simple popularity-based models commonly used (e.g, IRM) are becoming outdated, as users often consume multiple contents in sequence (e.g. YouTube, Spotify), and this consumption is driven by recommendation systems. The latter presents a great opportunity to bias the recommender to minimize content access cost (e.g, maximizing cache hit rates). To this end, in this paper we first propose a Markovian model for recommendation-driven user requests. We then formulate the problem of biasing the recommendation algorithm to minimize access cost, while maintaining acceptable recommendation quality. We show that the problem is non-convex, and propose an iterative ADMM-based algorithm that outperforms existing schemes, and shows significant potential for performance improvement on real content datasets.	algorithm;biasing;cache (computing);content delivery network;edge computing;edge dominating set;information rights management;iterative method;optimizing compiler;recommender system;simulation;telecommunications network;user (computing);volatility	Theodoros Giannakas;Pavlos Sermpezis;Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos	2018	"""2018 IEEE 19th International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WoWMoM.2018.8449731	transport network;latency (engineering);recommender system;cache;performance improvement;operator (computer programming);distributed computing;computer science;server;base station	DB	23.938681460656415	96.76764538456939	122649

Existing protocols have demonstrated its resilience to packet losses, as well as the ability to integrate naturally with multipath opportunistic routing. However, these heuristics do not take into account the inherent resource competition in wireless networks, thereby compromising the coding advantages. In this paper, we take a game-theoretic perspective towards optimized resource allocation for network coding based unicast protocols. We design decentralized mechanisms that achieve better efficiency-fairness tradeoff, for both cooperative and selfish users. Our framework features a modularized optimization of two subproblems: the multipath routing of coded information flows for each player, and the broadcast and coding rate allocation among competing players. We have implemented the framework on a wireless emulation testbed and demonstrated its high performance in terms of throughput and fairness.	algorithm;emulator;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;game theory;heuristic (computer science);linear network coding;lossy compression;mathematical optimization;mesh networking;multipath propagation;multipath routing;nash equilibrium;network packet;testbed;throughput;unicast;wireless mesh network	Xinyu Zhang;Baochun Li	2008		10.1145/1374618.1374658	wireless mesh network;game theory;routing;linear network coding;wireless wan;information flow;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;multipath routing;wireless network;flow control;distributed computing;order one network protocol;packet loss;computer network	Networks	13.42312047873688	92.43031993915784	122668
5ce89d8f62f29e3eefcf8254535035cf6cf02bef	on the cascading spectrum contention problem in self-coexistence of cognitive radio networks	percolation;cognitive radio;dynamic spectrum access;self coexistence	In cognitive radio (CR) networks, the coexistence between neighboring secondary networks is referred to as self coexistence. As prescribed in IEEE 802.22, a self-coexistence protocol enables a CR network in need of more spectrum resources to acquire spectrum (channels) from neighboring CR networks via a distributed inter-network spectrum contention process. A network that forfeits part of its spectrum in a spectrum contention process may later become short of spectrum, and in turn, it initiates a cascading spectrum contention process to acquire more spectrum resources. As a result, a local spectrum contention may trigger a series of successive contention instances that proliferate over the whole network, which may waste the network resources. In this paper, we systematically study the cascading spectrum contention problem using a percolation-based model in the context of CR networks. We show that cascading spectrum contentions under existing spectrum contention resolution rules is equivalent to a site percolation process that can readily lead to a network-wide cascade. To address such a problem, we identify the critical conditions for determining the occurrence of cascading spectrum contentions, and propose a biased spectrum contention protocol that intentionally lowers the probability that a starving network can trigger successive spectrum contentions. We show that the proposed solution can effectively restrict the spatial cascading impact of contentions.	coexist (image);cognitive radio;percolation theory;sensor;spectrum analyzer	Lin Chen;Kaigui Bian;Lin Chen;Wei Yan;Xiaoming Li	2013		10.1145/2508478.2508479	telecommunications;mathematics;distributed computing;computer network	Networks	17.368420032449976	90.69855714559819	122673

This includes scheduling and task processing to maximize utility in stochastic networks with variable length scheduling modes. Every frame, a new policy is implemented that affects the frame size and that creates a vector of attributes. An algorithm is developed for choosing policies on each frame in order to maximize a concave function of the time average attribute vector, subject to additional time average constraints. The algorithm is based on Lyapunov optimization concepts and involves minimizing a “drift-plus-penalty” ratio over each frame. The algorithm can learn efficient behavior without a-priori statistical knowledge by sampling from the past. Our framework is applicable to a large class of problems, including Markov decision problems.	algorithm;concave function;decision problem;drift plus penalty;lyapunov fractal;lyapunov optimization;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;sampling (signal processing);scheduling (computing)	Michael J.

Two of the more popular are the random waypoint and the random direction models. The random waypoint model is physically appealing but difficult to understand. Although the random direction model is less appealing physically, it is much easier to understand. User speeds are easily calculated, unlike for the waypoint model, and, as we observe, user positions and directions are uniformly distributed. The contribution of this paper is to establish this last property for a rich class of random direction models that allow future movements to depend on past movements. To this end, we consider finite oneand two-dimensional spaces. We consider two variations, the random direction model with wrap around and with reflection. We establish a simple relationship between these two models and, for both, show that positions and directions are uniformly distributed for a class of Markov movement models regardless of initial position. In addition, we establish a sample path property for both models, namely that any piecewise linear movement applied to a user preserves the uniform distribution of position and direction provided that users were initially uniformly throughout the space with equal likelihood of being pointed in any direction.	markov chain;mobile phone;piecewise linear continuation;simulation;waypoint	Philippe Nain;Donald F.

This increase in demand can be supported by densification and expansion of wireless networks. Such expansion poses new challenge on energy efficiency. This paper presents several techniques to enable energy savings for both devices and infrastructure. These techniques are based on cognitive and cooperative concepts to enable low power network acquisition, energy efficient paging, and dynamic/opportunistic network energy savings. A simulation analysis based on the information from a commercially deployed network presents a promising results on the possible infrastructure energy saving gains as well as a seamless location service offering.	fifth generation computer	Samir S.

Most of the researches in the domain of wireless network have focused on routing based approaches. In such an approach, wireless network is reduced to a dynamic graph, and a minimum cost routing mechanism is applied. These approaches have led to several routing mechanisms as OLSR and AODV. However, the fundamental nature of wireless network is the broadcast. In the wireless network, all the tuned receivers potentially receive every transmission. This basic property is not well captured by graph-based approaches where packets follow a single path from sender to receiver. In this paper we propose a relaying scheme for wireless multi-hop networks. It is based on collaboration of intermediate relays at network layer to forward useful side information in place of forwarding packets. In our scheme we assume that the nodes are not able to benefit from any interference cancellation mechanism. The channels from sender to relay nodes and from sender to receiver are logically separated through a temporal scheduling. This model is realistic for many practical scenarios in the context of wireless networks. We show in this paper the information theoretic bounds and show that they are achievable using practical codes. The proposed coding scheme is simulated in realistic scenarios. The obtained results show a remarkable improvement in throughput, relay load and reliability compared to network using classical routing approach.	code;information theory;interference (communication);optimized link state routing protocol;receiver (information theory);relay;scheduling (computing);throughput	Ramin Khalili;Kavé Salamatian	2005	Third International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt'05)	10.1109/WIOPT.2005.3	wireless mesh network;wireless ad hoc network;routing;linear network coding;wireless wan;telecommunications;bridging;computer science;dynamic source routing;graph theory;wireless network;distributed computing;packet forwarding;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;relay channel;computer network	Mobile	13.134102055489462	89.92754380924809	123941
edba2560b9b946f0781b7b290eb9a4834d2b14b4	a q-learning scheme for fair coexistence between lte and wi-fi in unlicensed spectrum		During the last years, the growth of wireless traffic pushed the wireless community to search for solutions that can assist in a more efficient management of the spectrum. Toward this direction, the operation of long term evolution (LTE) in unlicensed spectrum (LTE-U) has been proposed. Targeting a global solution that respects the regional regulations worldwide, 3GPP has published the LTE licensed assisted access (LAA) standard. According to LTE LAA, a listen before talk (LBT) procedure must precede any LTE transmission burst in the unlicensed spectrum. However, the proposed standard may cause coexistence issues between LTE and Wi-Fi, especially in the case that the latter does not use frame aggregation. Toward the provision of a balanced channel access, we have proposed mLTE-U that is an adaptive LTE LBT scheme. According to mLTE-U, LTE uses a variable transmission opportunity (TXOP), followed by a variable muting period. This muting period can be exploited by co-located Wi-Fi networks to gain access to the medium. In this paper, the system model of the mLTE-U scheme in coexistence with Wi-Fi is studied. In addition, mLTE-U is enhanced with a Q-learning technique that is used for autonomous selection of the appropriate combinations of TXOP and muting period that can provide fair coexistence between co-located mLTE-U and Wi-Fi networks. Simulation results showcase the performance of the proposed model and reveal the benefit of using Q-learning for self-adaptation of mLTE-U to the changes of the dynamic wireless environment, toward fair coexistence with Wi-Fi. Finally, the Q-learning mechanism is compared with conventional selection schemes showing the superior performance of the proposed model over less complex mechanisms.	autonomous robot;coexist (image);compaq lte;q-learning;simulation	Vasilis Maglogiannis;Dries Naudts;Adnan Shahid;Ingrid Moerman	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2829492	frame aggregation;wireless sensor network;spectrum management;q-learning;computer network;computer science;wireless;system model;communication channel	Mobile	22.703980421667104	90.50230871068156	124588

The relay nodes relay packets from a number of users to a destination node. We assume that the two relays do not have packets of their own and the users have saturated queues and random access to the medium with slotted time. We obtain analytical expressions for the arrival and service rates of the queues of the two relays and the stability conditions. We also study a model of the system, in which the users are divided into two clusters, and show its advantages in terms of aggregate and per user throughput. We quantify the above, analytically and through simulations, for different number of users and we indicate the conditions under which the deployment of a second relay in the system provides significant advantages.	aggregate data;cluster analysis;network packet;random access;relay;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Georgios I.

Discontinuous transmission (DTX) and reception (DRX) have been designed to facilitate power management, but they can provide energy savings only via proper tuning. Relevant work in the literature mainly pertains only to discontinuous reception mode (DRX) for downlink data. However, today’s increasingly powerful UEs can generate and upload significant amount of data. This paper proposes an energy management framework applicable to both discontinuous transmission (DTX) and DRX power saving modes. In particular, in DTX mode it can reduce UE energy consumption for uplink intensive applications like telemedicine or social networking. The proposed novel energy management framework is based on jointly using a-priori analytical evaluation of a M/G/1/K finite uplink queue system for mixed traffic with an optimized DTX/DRX algorithm. DTX mode is modeled by an expression, through which the impact of quality of service (QoS) parameters on the UE’s mean energy consumption for uplink transfer is determined. The model extracts and operates on the values computed for the M/G/1/K queue. Finally, a dynamic energy management algorithm for DRX/DTX modes is proposed for energy consumption optimization based on an integrated Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA). Analytical evaluation has shown that using our algorithm to tune DTX can achieve 49-73% energy saving over not using DTX.

Because multiple antennas offer wireless networks a potential capacity increase, they are expected to be a key part of next-generation wireless networks to support the rapidly emerging multimedia applications characterized by their high and diverse QoS requirements. This paper developed methods that exploit the benefits of multiple antennas to enable multi-hop wireless networks with flow-level QoS capabilities. The authors first propose a cross-layer table-driven statistical approach that allows each node to determine the amount of spatial reuse and/or multiplexing, offered by the multiple antennas that are available to it. The authors then use the developed statistical approach to derive sufficient conditions under which flow rates are guaranteed to be feasible. The derived conditions are multi-layer aware in the sense that they account for cross-layer effects between the PHY and the MAC layers to support QoS at higher layers. The authors evaluate and compare the derived sufficient conditions via extensive simulations. The authors show that the conditions result in high flow acceptance rates when used in multi-hop wireless networking problems such as QoS routing and multicommodity flow problems. The authors also demonstrate the importance and the effect of considering cross-layer couplings into the development of flow acceptance methods.	acceptance testing;decision table;hop;layer (electronics);mimo;multiplexing;phy (chip);quality of service;requirement;routing;simulation	Bechir Hamdaoui;Parameswaran Ramanathan	2007	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2007.070504	index term;quality of service;multi-commodity flow problem;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;volumetric flow rate;computer network	Mobile	14.377845339622976	92.62378196966554	124918

To improve system throughput, a scheduling algorithm is necessary to choose a subset of links for data transmission. Throughput optimal link scheduling discipline is generally an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we utilise the concept of line graph and extend it to line multigraph to cope with the complexity issue of the maximum weight scheduling (MWS) algorithm. The necessary and sufficient conditions for reducing the complexity of MWS in terms of network topology are derived. We prove that the complexity of eLehot is polynomial time provided that conflict graph does not contain seven derived forbidden graphs as induced subgraphs. We also propose eLehot algorithm for detecting whether a graph is line multigraph and output its root graph. The results of this paper introduce a new approach in wireless topology control where the target is complexity reduction.	algorithm;reduction (complexity);scheduling (computing);throughput;topology control	Ali Ghiasian;Behnaz Omoomi;Hossein Saidi	2018	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2015.10001795	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;dynamic priority scheduling;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	16.559653975971486	92.03465539068235	125844

This article presents the state-of-the-art power management methods in next-generation wireless networks with a focus on IEEE 802.16m based next-generation WiMAX networks and 3GPP LTE. To minimize and optimize user equipment power consumption, and further to support various services and large amounts of data transmissions, advanced power conservation mechanisms are being developed in IEEE 802.16m and 3GPP. Two advanced power conservation mechanisms, sleep and idle modes, which are enhanced versions of the legacy IEEE 802.16 system's sleep and idle modes, were proposed and adopted in IEEE 802.16m. Similarly, 3GPP LTE adopts a discontinuous reception mechanism for power conservation in RRC_CONNECTED and RRC_IDLE states. Power management techniques in WiMAX and 3GPP LTE provide less control signaling and operational overhead while providing more efficient power saving, and use simpler operation procedures than the existing power management techniques.	advanced power management;compaq lte;discontinuous reception;high availability;mobile device;overhead (computing);sleep mode	Ronny Yongho Kim;Shantidev Mohanty	2010	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2010.5458369	wimax;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;ieee 802.11h-2003;mobile device;power optimization;computer network	Mobile	23.99826785164415	91.10926801661272	125912

This paper proposes a parametric extension allowing the Unified power management mode, in which an ONU periodically turns off both its receiver and transmitter, as in the Cyclic Sleep mode, and performs infrequent bidirectional handshakes, as in the Doze mode. The timely reaction to an external stimulus is ensured by periodic unidirectional handshakes when only the ONU receiver is turned on. The Unified mode thus combines the advantages of the two standardized power saving modes, and a system that supports the Unified mode can emulate either the cyclic sleep or doze behavior as a special case. Simulation results show the energy efficiency superiority of the Unified mode over either of the two standardized modes in general.	10g-pon;passive optical network;performance per watt;power management;simulation;sleep mode;transmitter	Denis A.

Unlike the conventional opportunistic routing case where there is a single active S-D pair, for an ad hoc network in the presence of fading, we investigate the performance of parallel opportunistic multihop routing that is simultaneously performed by many source-destination (S-D) pairs to maximize the opportunistic gain, thereby enabling us to obtain a logarithmic gain. We first analyze a cut-set upper bound on the throughput scaling law of the network. Second, computer simulations are performed to verify the performance of the existing opportunistic routing for finite network conditions and to show trends consistent with the analytical predictions in the scaling law. More specifically, we evaluate both power and delay with respect to the number of active S-D pairs and then, numerically show a net improvement in terms of the power-delay trade-off over the conventional multihop routing that does not consider the randomness of fading.	performance evaluation;routing	Won-Yong Shin	2014	J.

However, there are situations in which “prime users” should be given priority, as for example in the transmission of emergency messages. We examine prioritization policies that could be implemented at the physical layer and propose a new one, termed interference priority (IP), which is shown to have excellent performance. We evaluate the performance of these prioritization techniques both in controlled settings and within the context of a full cellular system and discuss the impact of prioritized use of resources on the unprioritized users.	interference (communication);programming paradigm	Angel Lozano;Ezio Biglieri;Nabil Alrajeh	2012	Journal of Communications and Networks	10.1109/JCN.2012.00005	real-time computing;resource allocation;computer science;radio resource management;distributed computing;interference;wireless;computer network	Networks	22.31221358885592	90.96358955115149	126163

In this paper, we present a stability subregion with closed form of a static greedy link scheduling in MC-MR wireless networks under the 802.11 interference model. By adopting some special static link orderings, the stability subregion is within a constant factor of the stable capacity region of the network. We also obtain constant lower bounds on the throughput efficiency ratios of the static greedy link schedulings in some special static link orderings.	greedy algorithm;interference (communication);scheduling (computing);throughput	Peng-Jun Wan;Zhiguo Wan;Zhu Wang;XiaoHua Xu;Shaojie Tang;Xiaohua Jia	2013	2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567097	stability;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;statistics;computer network	Mobile	15.455575116239014	95.50168482359831	126670

We propose a novel interference management technique for overlapping basic service sets (OBSSs) in such WLANs, which intelligently applies an opportunistic interference alignment (OIA) concept to WLANs. Each BSS has an AP and multiple STAs, and operates with a carrier sensing multiple access (CSMA) protocol as commercial IEEE 802.11 WLANs. Both APs and STAs are assumed to have multiple antennas. Specifically, the proposed OIA framework consists of physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layer techniques: transmit beamforming and opportunistic medium access, respectively. First, each STA performs transmit beamforming which minimizes generating interference to other BSSs at the PHY layer. Second, each STA sends packets to its serving AP only when its generating interference to other BSSs is smaller than a pre-determined threshold at the MAC layer. Through extensive simulations, we show that proposed OIA scheme significantly outperforms existing schemes in terms of system throughput. Note that the OIA scheme operates with a distributed manner based on local channel state information at each STA and does not require any coordination among BSSs, leading an easier implementation in practice.	access control;beamforming;channel state information;interference (communication);phy (chip);simulation;throughput;wireless access point	Hu Jin;Bang Chul Jung;Jinhyung Oh;Myungsun Song	2015	2015 IEEE 82nd Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2015-Fall)	10.1109/VTCFall.2015.7390787	communications protocol;throughput;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;antenna;interference;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	10.455064111491309	90.81982947718295	126788

Firstly, we established a dynamic optimal rate allocation model under time-varying channel capacity. Due to the distributed property of cognitive radio terminals, we extend the model to differential game approach and turn it into a Boundary Value Problem(BVP).

66eec46a2f7585a44643c99c91070c4c5f3b115c	optimal placement delivery arrays		In wireless networks, coded caching scheme is an effective technique to reduce network congestion during peak traffic times. A (K,F,Z, S) placement delivery array ((K,F,Z, S)PDA in short) can be used to design a coded caching scheme with the delivery rate S/F during the peak traffic times. Clearly in order to minimize delivery rate, we only need to consider a (K,F,Z, S)PDA with minimum S. For the fixed parameters K, F and Z, a (K,F,Z, S)PDA with the minimum S is called optimal. So it is meaningful to study optimal PDAs. There are some known PDAs constructed by combinatorial design theory, hypergraphs and so on. However there is only one class of optimal PDAs (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60:2856-2867, 2014) constructed by Ali and Niesen. We will focus on constructing optimal PDAs. In this paper, two kinds of lower bounds on the value of S in a (K,F,Z, S)PDA are derived first. Then two kinds of recursive constructions are proposed. Consequently (i) optimal PDAs with Z = 1 and F − 1 for any positive integers K and F are obtained; (ii) several infinite classes of optimal PDAs for some K, F and Z are constructed. Finally more existence of optimal PDAs with Z = F − 2 are given.	cache (computing);network congestion;personal digital assistant;recursion	Minquan Cheng;Jing Jiang;Qifa Yan;Xiaohu Tang;Haitao Cao	2016	CoRR		discrete mathematics;combinatorial design;wireless network;recursion;mathematics;network congestion;constraint graph;integer	Theory	20.66399431756696	97.72141681236265	127897

We show that the above optimization problem is a polynomial optimization problem, which is generally NP-hard. We provide sufficient conditions on the network topology, scheduling and routing such that it is computationally feasible, namely such that it reduces to a convex optimization problem.	bandwidth (signal processing);channel (communications);combinatorial optimization;computation;convex optimization;dataflow;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;network topology;optimization problem;overshoot (signal);polynomial;routing;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation interoperability standards organization;telecommunications network	Francesco Smarra;Alessandro D'Innocenzo;Maria Domenica Di Benedetto	2012	2012 IEEE 51st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	10.1109/CDC.2012.6426249	routing table;routing domain;mathematical optimization;routing;static routing;real-time computing;network architecture;hierarchical routing;optimal control;digital control;engineering;sensor;multipath routing;control theory;mathematics;network simulation;routing protocol;computational complexity theory;actuator	Embedded	16.510128796889813	95.29159828446763	127991

Among them, the IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) is one of the most promising standard to carry out a full-service broadband wireless network in an urban and suburban area. This standard provides high data rate within a wide coverage area with low implementation costs, possibility of multi-traffic communications, and different network topologies. This paper deals with the analysis and performance comparison of different scheduling techniques for WiMAX networks for allowing quality of service (QoS) differentiation when different types of applications have to be supported and achieving a fair distribution of resource among users. In particular, the focus here is on the resource allocation problem for the case of mobile stations (MSs) active in an urban environment. The proposed scheduling algorithms exploit the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) scheme with adaptive modulation techniques in order to achieve a better network behavior. The performance of the proposed approaches will be derived here by means of theoretical analysis and computer simulations.

D2D communication can not only effectively reduce traffic loads to the core network but also reduce power consumption of user equipments (UEs), thus making it a desirable candidate for machine-to-machine communication in cellular networks. Among all functionalities required to enable D2D communication, peer discovery is arguably the most critical one. In this paper, we propose a distributed peer discovery protocol for LTE-A networks. The proposed protocol requires UEs to advertise their presence based on random access. In order to minimize resource consumption on discovery, an adaptive resource allocation algorithm based on the number of requesting D2D UEs is also proposed. Our numerical analysis shows that a very high discovery probability (e.g., 0.99) can be achieved using only 1% of the evolved Node B's (eNB's) uplink resource.	algorithm;compaq lte;machine to machine;mathematical model;numerical analysis;peering;random access;telecommunications link	Zhu-Jun Yang;Jie-Cheng Huang;Chun-Ting Chou;Hung-Yun Hsieh;Chin-Wei Hsu;Ping-Cheng Yeh;Alex Chia-Chun Hsu	2013	2013 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6825064	communications protocol;computer science;resource management;operating system;distributed computing;dead peer detection;world wide web;server;computer network	Mobile	23.812848637036847	94.95689912520176	129387

Transmission is slotted into transmit resource units (RU). The qualities of the transmission channels from the BS to the UEs differ between RUs and between UEs. The transmit rate can be chosen by the BS independently in each RU based on the per UE channel qualities, which are assumed to be known by the BS. For each UE we calculate the throughput as the mean information received per RU over all RUs within a scheduling unit. Here, the multicast throughput is defined as the minimum UE throughput. We present a scheme to optimize the rate selections for all RUs such that the minimum UE throughput is maximized, even in the general case that the channel qualities of UEs are non-identically distributed. The achievable gains are evaluated using radio net¬work simulations with realistic channel models.	multicast;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput	Jörg Huschke	2010	2010 IEEE 72nd Vehicular Technology Conference - Fall	10.1109/VETECF.2010.5594264	throughput;electronic engineering;link adaptation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;operating system;signal-to-noise ratio;scheduling;encoding;computer network	Mobile	14.752972287972906	93.97826259199844	129516
14a2f42663dd127f1dc168b8683ca402ecbf6188	multiplexing gain and processing savings of 5g radio-access-network functional splits		Centralized radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising mobile network architecture designed to support the requirements of future 5G mobile networks. In C-RAN, the “centralization” of baseband units enables substantial savings of computational resources (what we call “multiplexing gain” in this paper) and significant power savings. On the other hand, the deployment of C-RAN requires high capacity and imposes strict latency requirements on the fronthaul transport-network. To address these issues, various alternative architectures, known as “RAN functional splits,” have been introduced to relax these strict fronthaul requirements. In this paper, we perform a quantitative analysis of the computational savings and the resulting power savings enabled by C-RAN, considering different RAN functional splits. To this end, we analytically model RAN computational resources to evaluate the multiplexing gain for different RAN functional splits. This model allows to calculate the processing reduction occurring in each RAN functional split. We then use this model to estimate the power savings of the various functional splits, considering different assumptions in terms of geographical areas, users distribution and number of aggregated cell sites. We find that up to 28% computational resources savings and 24% power savings can be achieved through functional splits in comparison to distributed RAN.	baseband;c-ran;centralized computing;common public radio interface;computation;computational resource;multiplexing;network architecture;phy (chip);rlc circuit;radio access network;requirement;semiconductor consolidation;software deployment	Mohamed Shehata;Ahmed Elbanna;Francesco Musumeci;Massimo Tornatore	2018	IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking	10.1109/TGCN.2018.2869294	software deployment;latency (engineering);architecture;radio access network;computer network;fronthaul;cellular network;baseband;computer science;multiplexing	Mobile	23.003669329353986	88.82428914900355	129927

The motivation behind the vertical handover can be either based on the user demands to achieve larger data rates or lower service delays, but also it can be operator-based to balance the system load or to increase the system coverage. This paper presents a hybrid technique for vertical handover where both the operator satisfaction and the user satisfaction are concerned whenever a vertical handover is to be accomplished. Results are presented for the system behaviour with and without the proposed handover mechanism.	assistive technology;computer user satisfaction;entity;load (computing);quality of service;seamless3d;signal-to-noise ratio;uncompressed video	Mohammed Shakil;Nizar Zorba;Cosmas Adam;Christos V.

DEX can effectively explore the spatial multiplexing gain of UWB networks and allow users to efficiently and fairly share network resources in a distributed manner by reserving exclusive regions (ER) around the sender and receiver for data and acknowledgment (ACK) transmissions. We further quantify the network performance bounds and derive the optimal ER size to maximize the expected network transport throughput for a dense multi-hop UWB network. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the DEX protocol.	acknowledgement (data networks);acknowledgment index;communications protocol;exclusive or;hop;interference (communication);network performance;optimizing compiler;simulation;spatial multiplexing gain;telecommunications network;throughput;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video	Lin X.

d32272ed7b9a30e63fce026758c87eda12519a0a	the allocation in cognitive radio network: combined genetic algorithm and on/off primary user activity models		Cognitive radio (CR) has appeared as a promising solution to the problem of spectrum underutilization. Cognitive radio user (CU) is an intelligent equipment who scent the spectrum which is licensed to primary radio users (PUs) when it is idle and use it with other CUs for their communication. Thus by modeling PUs activity, CUs can predict the future state ON or OFF (busy or idle) of PUs by learning from the history of their spectrum utilization. In this manner, CUs can select the best available spectrum bands. On this point, many PU ON/OFF activity models have been proposed in the literature. Among this models, Continuous Time Markov chain, Discrete Time Markov chain, Bernoulli and Exponential models. In this paper, we firstly compare these four models in term of better numbers of OFF slots to deduce which model give best performance of available resources. Then, the activity history patterns generated from each model are combined with the genetic algorithm as sensing vectors to select the best available channel in terms of quality and least PU arrivals.	activity recognition;cognitive radio;euler–bernoulli beam theory;genetic algorithm;ibm systems network architecture;markov chain;tip (unix utility)	Yasmina El Morabit;Fatiha Mrabti;El Houssein Abarkan	2016		10.1007/978-981-10-1627-1_1	simulation;machine learning;computer network	HCI	22.476449155383214	94.44411026874668	130263

However they consume a non-negligible amount of power, while their traffic volume is forecasted to grow at very high rates for the 10 or 15 coming years. Thus, energy-efficiency in core and metro networks is mandatory for the sustainability of the future Internet. In this context, in this work we used Mantis, our network planning and operation tool, to design and carry out a comparative study of energy efficiency of current and next generation optical networks. In particular, we examined the cases of fixed-grid single-line-rate (SLR) Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical networks, which are now deployed in the core, and next-generation mixed-line-rates (MLR) WDM and flex-grid networks. Under realistic network scenarios we profiled the total energy consumption of the optical layer and showed that through energy-aware algorithms we can achieve significant power savings.	algorithm;energy minimization;future internet;learning to rank;metro (design language);next-generation network;wavelength-division multiplexing	Polyzois Soumplis;P.

However, microcells and/or LEO multi-beams may give rise to a great number of handovers. Each handover requires network resources to reroute the corresponding call to a new base station, it is preferred to have as few handovers as possible to decrease the processing burden. New call attempts generated near cell boundaries usually request handovers very soon. This phenomenon may cause unnecessary handover processing burden and too much bandwidth reservation. We suggest a selective admission control scheme in order to resolve the drawback of the phenomenon. Performance analysis shows that our scheme improves handover performance without sacrificing new call blocking performance.	blocking (computing)	Ki-Dong Lee;Deock-Gil Oh;Ho-Jin Lee	2004	2004 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (IEEE Cat.

The eNB scheduled resource access gives flexibility to eNB with additional signalling overhead. The random access scheme is simple without the eNB control but has the drawback of data collision. In this paper, we propose a collision-aware random access scheme for the D2D communications. The proposed scheme utilizes the feature that there are many unused resources in the data transmission period and all user equipments (UEs) have full information about the resource usage. Before data transmission, the UEs send the resource reservation messages in the unused resource to inform others about the selected resources to be used in the next period. By this means, the D2D UEs can detect the resource reservation messages from each other, and hence can try to select different resources to avoid collision. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed and evaluated by simulations. Our results shown that the proposed scheme outperforms the random access scheme by a wide margin in terms of data collision probability.	collision domain;compaq lte;overhead (computing);random access;simulation;transmitter	Peng Xue;Hyunseok Ryu;Seung-Hoon Park;Sangwon Choi	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247254	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;wireless network;computer network	HPC	20.386545825195025	92.49209163056247	131714

A mobile node stores data and carries it around; when it encounters another node, it may decide to forward the data if the encountered node is the destination or has a better chance of bringing the data closer to the destination.  In order to obtain efficient routing in such a network, we should be able to predict the future behavior of a node. This would help the algorithm decide if the data contained by the node should be further carried or forwarded, and to which node it is to be forwarded. In this paper, we present a mobile interaction trace collected at the University Politehnica of Bucharest in the spring of 2012, and analyze it in terms of the predictability of encounters and contact durations. We show that there is a regular pattern in the contact history of a node and then we prove that, by modelling the time series as a Poisson distribution, we can efficiently predict the number of contacts per time unit in the future. These assumptions are demonstrated both on the trace presented in this paper, as well as on a different trace recorded in another type of environment, showing that predictability doesn't happen only in strict and controlled situations.	algorithm;mobile device;mobile interaction;routing;time series	Radu-Ioan Ciobanu;Ciprian Dobre	2012		10.1145/2386980.2386983	simulation;geography;telecommunications;computer security	Mobile	12.4863328938231	89.14643083898272	132016

In this paper, we consider schemes for the decentralized cross-layer optimization of multichannel random access, in which users are not necessarily within the transmission ranges of all other users, and each user may choose to send packets to or receive packets from different users simultaneously. With cross-layer design, users are configured according to local neighborhood information to adapt to inhomogeneous network characteristics. It is demonstrated by simulation that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing channel aware Aloha schemes due to its exploitation of both multiuser diversity and the inhomogeneous characteristics of traffic distribution in the network.	mathematical optimization;multi-user;random access;simulation	Guowang Miao;Geoffrey Ye Li;Ananthram Swami	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.847	stochastic geometry models of wireless networks;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;wireless network;traffic flow;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;random access;computer network;broadband networks	Mobile	17.561415888176363	92.30850138250936	132229

Fixed-length packets and AWGN channels are considered, and a simple ARQ scheme (Send-and-Wait) is used for error control. Packets are retransmitted until a minimum QoS requirement is met for each packet. Transmission powers are chosen from a finite set depending on the number of nodes that have received the packet successfully. The goal is to minimize the total energy expended for each successful packet transmission. The system is studied when the transmitter chooses between two distinct powers, and the results are then extended to multiple powers. It is observed that the optimal policy is always of the separation type. Also, the effect of varying the QoS requirement on the energy and service time is studied.	mathematical optimization	Adarsh Sridhar;Anthony Ephremides	2008	Ad Hoc Networks	10.1016/j.adhoc.2006.11.001	markov decision process;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	14.536892614771208	90.82200999503911	132238

The basic idea is to allow active users to be seamlessly linked to different networks (licensed or unlicensed band).

In this paper, we address the challenge of optimizing the radio resource allocation process so that heterogeneous groups of users, according to their propagation conditions, can receive layered video streams at predefined and progressively decreasing service levels matched to respective user groups. A key aspect of the proposed system model is that video streams are delivered as eMBMS flows that utilize the random linear network coding (NC) principle. Furthermore, the transmission rate and NC scheme of each eMBMS flow are jointly optimized. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can exploit user heterogeneity to optimize the allocated radio resources while achieving desired service levels for different user groups.	compaq lte;itil;linear network coding;multimedia broadcast multicast service;simulation;software propagation;streaming media	Andrea Tassi;Chadi Khirallah;Dejan Vukobratovic;Francesco Chiti;John S.

We consider that the network is structured into pairs of nodes (sender, receiver) in a decay space. We take into account the following: Each node has its own power assignment and the distance between them does not follow the symmetry property. Then, we consider a non-uniform network or a realistic wireless network, which is beyond the geometry. Our model is based on the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) model. In this work, the main problem is to solve the scheduling task aiming the successful transmission of messages in a realistic environment. Therefore, we propose the first randomized scheduling and power selection algorithm in a decay space and is called as SPAIDS. In order to solve the problem in this non-uniform network, we introduce a new way to study the affectance (the interference) among the links, which is defined as Weighted Average Affectance (WAFF). Moreover, we study the online broadcast problem in a metric space, in which the nodes are activated in case that they receive packets. We propose an online algorithm in a metric space which is denoted as OAMS. Our aim is to obtain the maximum subset of nodes that receive the message from a sender node with enough energy supplies. Finally, we compare the performance of OAMS to the optimal.	distributed algorithm;graph coloring;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);maxima and minima;online algorithm;randomized algorithm;rayleigh–ritz method;scheduling (computing);selection algorithm;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;time complexity	Aikaterini Nikolidaki	2018	CoRR		distributed algorithm;online algorithm;wireless network;distributed computing;computer science;scheduling (computing);communication source;network packet;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;wireless ad hoc network	Mobile	15.888219709746174	90.06558102710794	134731

By adjusting the internal time reference of a node in response to the detected timing of a received synchronization word, and by following simple rules, synchronization emerges from an initially completely uncoordinated situation. However these protocols typically assume that synchronization words are detected error free. In this paper the performance of biologically inspired slot synchronization is investigated when a realistic timing synchronization scheme is employed. We consider an ad hoc network where nodes communicate over an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) air interface. The transmission is organized in frames, and each frame is preceded by a synchronization preamble with known repetitive parts. Specifically one common synchronization preamble is employed for all transmitting terminals, as, e.g., for the wireless LAN standard 802.11. Computer simulations verify that provided a sufficiently long synchronization word, reliable slot synchronization is maintained using a practical synchronization unit.	algorithm;emergence;frame (networking);hoc (programming language);multi-user;multiplexing;scenario (computing);sensor;simulation;synchronization (computer science);transmitter	Luca Sanguinetti;Alexander Tyrrell;Michele Morelli;Gunther Auer	2008	VTC Spring 2008 - IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VETECS.2008.17	computer simulation;wireless ad hoc network;clock synchronization;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;telecommunications;frame synchronization;computer science;self-clocking signal;data synchronization;synchronization;frame synchronization;computer network	Embedded	10.252523638874408	90.79337115353002	134766

This scheme optimizes the resource in unlicensed band based on decision tree learning and repeated game. We consider a flexible architecture decoupling control plane from data plane in the coexistence system. In control plane, strong ability of data processing is provided. Controllers learn the latest data set in the pool to build decision trees. According to the decision tree, controllers deduce the network status of the opponent. Repeated game is played to share spectrum resources for maximizing the resource utilization in the coexistence system. At the beginning of each game stage, controllers use decision tree to make informed decisions quickly. In repeated game, an encouragement mechanism is proposed to stimulate operators to share spectrum resources.

867d1e88ebaa203bc1b4f2cada23ea67981a822d	a scalable framework for wireless distributed computing	wireless communication;distributed computing;encoding;mobile communication;uplink;downlink;communication system security	We consider a wireless distributed computing system, in which multiple mobile users, connected wirelessly through an access point, collaborate to perform a computation task. In particular, users communicate with each other via the access point to exchange their locally computed intermediate computation results, which is known as data shuffling. We propose a scalable framework for this system, in which the required communication bandwidth for data shuffling does not increase with the number of users in the network. The key idea is to utilize a particular repetitive pattern of placing the data set thus a particular repetitive pattern of intermediate computations, in order to provide the coding opportunities at both the users and the access point, which reduce the required uplink communication bandwidth from users to the access point and the downlink communication bandwidth from access point to users by factors that grow linearly with the number of users. We also demonstrate that the proposed data set placement and coded shuffling schemes are optimal i.e., achieve the minimum required shuffling load for both a centralized setting and a decentralized setting, by developing tight information-theoretic lower bounds.	centralized computing;code;computation;computation offloading;computer cluster;directed acyclic graph;distributed computing;exclusive or;failure;graph (abstract data type);greedy algorithm;ibm notes;information theory;mapreduce;matrix multiplication;mobile app;mobile device;multicast;quality of service;scalability;scheduling (computing);self-organizing map;singleton bound;telecommunications link;vii;wireless access point	Songze Li;Qian Yu;Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali;Amir Salman Avestimehr	2017	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2017.2702605	computer network;computation;scalability;wireless;telecommunications link;computer science;shuffling;distributed computing;mobile telephony;bandwidth (signal processing)	HPC	23.949944183917005	95.44278082946653	136079

The conventional wireless video transmission scheme which consists of separate digital source coding and digital channel coding is now unable to meet the broadcast and mobile scenarios owing to the dramatic changes in its channel conditions. However, a newly uncoded transmission scheme called SoftCast was presented to provide graceful quality transition. SoftCast performs power allocation over chunks to decrease the amount of Meta data. But the magnitudes vary dramatically in some chunks and SoftCast expends very large power to transmit some coefficients with large value. This paper introduces a scalable video SoftCast using Magnitude Shift to constraint the value of DCT coefficients. It only costs little power and bandwidth to transmit the overhead generated by Magnitude Shift. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can improve the performance of the original SoftCast using 3D-DCT transform by 2-5dB.	channel capacity;coefficient;data compression;discrete cosine transform;forward error correction;overhead (computing);scalability	Xiaocheng Lin;Yu Liu;Lin Zhang	2015	2015 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2015.7127774	telecommunications;scaling;computer science;computer network	Mobile	21.182448092416553	100.17852373244203	136283

In wireless communications, TDMA algorithms often divide the radio time into timeslots of uniform size, ξ, and then combine them into frames of uniform size, b τ. We consider TDMA algorithms that allocate at least one timeslot in every frame to every node. Given a maximal node degree, δ, and no access to external references for collision detection, time or position, we consider the problem of collision-free self-stabilizing TDMA algorithms that use constant frame size. We demonstrate that this problem has no solution when the frame size is τ < max{2δ, χ2}, where χ2 is the chromatic number for distance-2 vertex coloring. As a complement to this lower bound, we focus on proving the existence of collision-free self-stabilizing TDMA algorithms that use constant frame size of τ. We consider basic settings (no hardware support for collision detection and no prior clock synchronization), and the collision of concurrent transmissions from transmitters that are at most two hops apart. In the context of self-stabilizing systems that have no external reference, we are the first to study this problem (to the best of our knowledge), and use simulations to show convergence even with computation time uncertainties.	algorithm;hoc (programming language)	Thomas Petig;Elad Michael Schiller;Philippas Tsigas	2014		10.1109/MedHocNet.2014.6849109	telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	HCI	10.438732867210414	89.10028514982295	136629

In this paper, we combine routing and cooperative diversity, with the consideration of a realistic channel model. We focus on a multihop network with multiple relays at each hop, and three routing strategies are designed to achieve the full diversity gain provided by cooperation among the relays. In particular, an optimal routing strategy is proposed to minimize the end-to-end outage, which requires the channel information of all the links and serves as a performance bound. An ad-hoc routing strategy is then proposed based on a hop-by-hop relay selection, which can be easily implemented in a distributed way. As expected, ad-hoc routing performs worse than optimal routing, especially with a large number of hops. To achieve a good complexity-performance tradeoff, an N-hop routing strategy is further proposed, where a joint optimization is performed every N hops. Simulation results are provided which verify the outage analyses of the proposed routing strategies.	algorithm;channel (communications);channel state information;complexity;downtime;end-to-end principle;hoc (programming language);hop-by-hop transport;mathematical optimization;relay;routing;simulation;sun outage	Bo Gui;Lin Dai;Leonard J.

e9c8c38d80331d87579e2983ccec39bdd1666b93	a markovian rohc control mechanism based on transport block link model in lte networks		In many packet-switched wireless systems including cellular networks, RObust Header Compression (ROHC) plays an important role in improving payload efficiency by reducing the number of header bits in a link session. However, there are only very few research works addressing the optimized control of ROHC. Our recent studies have demonstrated the advantage of a trans-layer ROHC design that exploits lower layer link status. We have presented a unidirectional ROHC design based on a partially observable Markov decision process formulation that enables the transmitter to decide the header compression level without receiver feedback. The present work considers the physical channel dynamics in an LTE environment and how they affect header decompressor status. Our new model takes into consideration the transport block (TBs) size defined in LTE transmission according to the modulation and coding scheme (MCS). Our novel and practical model can significantly improve the efficiency of the transmission when compared to a traditional timer-based ROHC control.	compaq lte;markov chain;mathematical optimization;modulation;network packet;packet switching;partially observable markov decision process;partially observable system;robust header compression;signal-to-noise ratio;source-to-source compiler;timer;transmitter	Carlos Feres;Wenhao Wu;Zhi Jun Ding	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2018.8422165	real-time computing;computer network;header;computer science;exploit;robust header compression;modulation;partially observable markov decision process;cellular network;markov process;communication channel	Mobile	11.530434305618346	95.08883444416419	137858

To fully exploit cooperative diversity, we propose a medium access control and routing enabled cross-layer cooperative transmission (MACR-CCT) protocol for improving the performance in multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks (MWAN). Different from previous cooperative protocols that determine a receiver in one hop according to a non-cooperative routing protocol first and then select a cooperative relay, MACR-CCT selects the cooperative relay together with the receiver in one hop to exploit fully cooperative diversity, so that the receiver is selected for higher cooperative gain and closer distance to destination, and the relay is selected to achieve the better throughput performance while considering transmission error. Furthermore, considering that there are multiple source–destination pairs in MWAN, MACR-CCT takes interference mitigation into account to further improve network throughput when selecting the cooperative relay. Besides, we propose a theoretical model to analyze the throughput performance. Finally, we take advantage of simulation results to validate the effectiveness of our analytical model and show that our proposed MACR-CCT protocol can significantly outperform existing packet transmission mechanisms in terms of throughput and delay under the multi-hop multi-flow network scenario.	hoc (programming language)	Qilin Wu;Xianzhong Zhou;Fangzhen Ge	2017	Wireless Networks	10.1007/s11276-016-1238-7	wireless network;throughput;computer network;hop (networking);antenna diversity;distributed computing;cooperative diversity;routing protocol;computer science;wireless ad hoc network;network packet	Mobile	10.268491644282024	89.26825025838514	137925

We analyze the underlying noncooperative game and find its Nash equilibria unsatisfactory. Yet for a repeated version of the game, a strategy of toggling between selfish and honest play can be devised, leading to all stations playing honest and resilient to sophisticated deviations that may seek an unfairly high bandwidth share.

Using stability as the throughput performance metric, we outline the single-hop and multi-hop stability regions of the network. Our analysis of the stability regions is a generalization of the BvN decomposition technique that has been so effective at expressing any stabilizable rate matrix for input-queued switches as a convex combination of service configurations. We consider generalized decompositions for physical topologies with wavelength and port constraints. For the case of a single wavelength per optical fiber, we link the decomposition problem to a corresponding Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem. We characterize the stability region of the reconfigurable network, employing both single-hop and multi-hop routing, in terms of the RWA problem applied to the same physical topology. We derive expressions for two geometric properties of the stability region: maximum stabilizable uniform arrival rate and maximum scaled doubly substochastic region. These geometric properties provide a measure of the performance gap between a network having a single wavelength per optical fiber and its wavelength-unconstrained version. They also provide a measure of the performance gap between algorithms employing single-hop versus multi-hop electronic routing in coordination with WDM reconfiguration.	algorithm;maximum throughput scheduling;network switch;optical fiber;qr decomposition;queueing theory;reconfigurability;routing and wavelength assignment;token reconfiguration;wavelength-division multiplexing	Andrew Brzezinski;Eytan Modiano	2006	Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2006. 25TH IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1145/1453698.1453716	convex combination;telecommunications;computer science;optical fiber;mathematics;network topology;wavelength-division multiplexing;computer network	Vision	13.581043451577067	96.30670281592751	138415

One such example is hybrid Free Space Optical (FSO)/Radio Frequency (RF) systems. These networks aim to merge the high capacity of FSO links with the high availability of RF links to form resilient high-bandwidth communications. When used for wireless communications, the main challenge is the dynamic response to variations in the atmospheric channel in adverse weather conditions. In this paper we simulate adaptive hard-switched transmission algorithms on a practical prototype hybrid system. FSO channel scenarios are formed based on climate data, and are emulated on the prototype system to compare the performance of the hybrid system to each solo carrier respectively.	algorithm;elegant degradation;emulator;experiment;high availability;hybrid system;network performance;prototype;radio frequency;simulation;structure of observed learning outcome;throughput	Kristen Nock;Carlos Font;Michael Rupar	2016	MILCOM 2016 - 2016 IEEE Military Communications Conference	10.1109/MILCOM.2016.7795440	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	10.826115374532	88.60036277657132	138918

To achieve the fundamental understanding of MANETs, we focus on deriving the closed-form expressions of the network capacity and end-to-end delay. A MANET with the generalized correlated mobility model is considered in this paper, where the mobility of nodes clustered in one group is confined within a specified area, and multiple groups move uniformly across the network. We also leverage limited packet redundancy to speed up the packet transmission, i.e., each source node is allowed to distribute at most f copies of each packet in its delivery process. Specifically, we first propose an effective multi-hop scheduling-routing scheme under the correlated mobility model, and then develop the closed-form expressions of both per node throughput capacity and expected end-to-end delay. We further explore the tradeoff between throughput capacity and packet delay by using packet redundancy f.

Among these methods, opportunistic routing and network coding are regarded as the most promising techniques. While there have been some attempts to combine opportunistic routing with network coding to capture the advantages of both techniques, none of these attempts has considered bit-rate selection for data transmission in multi-rate wireless networks. In this paper, we study the potential benefits of the combination of opportunistic routing and network coding with the bit-rate selection mechanism from an optimization perspective. We develop a theoretical model and algorithm for finding the optimal forwarding scheme for a multi-rate combination of opportunistic routing and network coding in a given network. MIT Roofnet trace-based simulations show that considering bit-rate selection in combination with opportunistic routing and network coding has substantial benefits in terms of the expected transmission time compared to multi-rate opportunistic routing, multi-rate network coding, and a fixed-rate combination approach.	algorithm;linear network coding;mathematical optimization;routing;theory;trace-based simulation	Daehyeok Kim;Young-Joo Suh	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214107	wireless routing protocol;routing domain;routing;static routing;linear network coding;hierarchical routing;telecommunications;equal-cost multi-path routing;computer science;dynamic source routing;multipath routing;destination-sequenced distance vector routing;wireless network;distributed computing;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;geographic routing;computer network	Networks	13.263390758973417	91.99322013542522	139538

We adopt a deterministic model for VBR traffic that considers video frame sizes and playout buffers at the mobile users. The problem is to find the optimal transmit powers for the base stations, such that VBR video data can be delivered to mobile users without causing playout buffer underflow or overflow. We formulate a nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem and prove the condition for the existence of feasible solutions. We then develop a centralized branch-and-bound algorithm incorporating the Reformulation-Linearization Technique, which can produce (1−ε)-optimal solutions. We also propose a low-complexity distributed algorithm with fast convergence. Through simulations with VBR video traces under fading channels, we find the distributed algorithm can achieve a performance very close to that of the centralized algorithm.	arithmetic underflow;branch and bound;centralized computing;distributed algorithm;fast fourier transform;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;nonlinear system;optimization problem;playout;requirement;simulation;streaming media;telecommunications link;tracing (software);volume boot record	Yingsong Huang;Shiwen Mao	2011	2011 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2011.5935081	distributed algorithm;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	17.961287881588493	95.54702037804756	140044

This paradigm in radio communication has been successfully used in vehicular networks wherein communication can be established within vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle) or vehicles to static stations (vehicle-to-infrastructure) without allocating dedicated frequencies. However, the challenge in CR design lies in building intelligence that helps in efficiently sensing and transmitting data through available radio spectrum channels. This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based Proactive Medium Access Control protocol (ProMAC) for the SUs in a CR network. To the best of our knowledge this is the first proactive MAC reported in the literature for CR. Employing ProMAC in a architecture where the number of SUs and PUs were constant, we achieved 20 % , 13 . 5 % and 12 % improvement in channel utilization, backoff rate and sensing delay respectively as compared to the recently proposed PO-MAC protocol, which is so far the best reported in the literature. In an architecture where the numbers of SUs varied with time, ProMAC achieved 21 % and 13 . 17 % improvement in channel utilization and backoff rate, respectively, as compared to PO-MAC. The proposed protocol is based on a self-learning engine that can evolve and improve its prediction accuracy even after deployment on field. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we propose a semi-dynamic and distributed CA mechanism called semi-dynamic interference aware channel assignment SICA based on game theory formulation. SICA is an interference aware, distributed CA which preserves the network connectivity without relying on a common channel nor central node for coordination between mesh routers. SICA applies a real time learner algorithm which assumes that nodes do not have perfect information about the network topology. To the best of our knowledge this is the first game formulation of CA which takes the co-channel interference into account. We have simulated SICA and compared against other channel assignment mechanisms proposed in the literature. Simulation results show that SICA outperforms other mechanisms.	interference (communication);mesh networking;semiconductor industry;wireless mesh network	Maryam Amiri Nezhad;Llorenç Cerdà-Alabern;Boris Bellalta;Manel Guerrero Zapata	2013	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2013.058237	game theory;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	17.05293289311687	89.99105695733694	140616
da5af23955cf127e573bf1ec606931a01351f049	an analysis of user mobility in cellular networks		User mobility impacts the performance of cellular networks. However, there is a lack of results on this problem because of the difficulty of the analysis. The existing results are limited to handover rate and mean path length that a user is associated with the same base station. In this paper, we derive the probability distribution function of the path length that a user will be associated with the same base station. It is assumed that the user travels along a straight path and it is associated to the nearest base station. We make the stochastic geometry assumption that the base stations are distributed over the area according to a Poisson point process. We provide simulation results as further evidence that the analysis is correct. The results of this paper may be useful in the design of cellular networks.	instruction path length;point process;simulation;straight skeleton	Shamma Nikhat;Mustafa Mehmet-Ali	2018		10.1145/3265863.3265878	stochastic geometry;computer science;probability density function;computer network;handover;path length;poisson point process;distributed computing;base station;cellular network	Mobile	12.750531846273017	89.00760432637183	141532

One concern of computation offloading is the energy consumption of transmission due to the long air interface distance between the user and the cloud. Therefore, we introduce device-to-device communications into computation offloading, and then propose a framework of user-centric local mobile cloud-assisted D2D communications in heterogeneous cloud RANs (H-CRANs). In this framework, resource-poor devices can utilize other users' vacant computing resources. Following that, we consider an energy- aware subtask allocation strategy with limited fronthaul data transfer in H-CRAN. Finally, simulation results illustrate that the proposed strategy consumes less transmission energy than conventional computation offloading strategies with fronthaul usage fairness guaranteed.	computation offloading;fairness measure;mobile cloud computing;mobile device;simulation	Honglin Hu;Rui Wang	2015	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2015.7143327	embedded system;real-time computing;mobile search;mobile web;mobile telephony;cloud computing;mobile database;computer science;operating system;mobile technology;mobile station;mobile computing;server;computer network	Mobile	24.539732272927214	92.75998379926169	141664
a8425cea4c046ce9266b5a206fae4315d96f2b2d	capacity of heterogeneous mobile wireless networks with d-delay transmission strategy	mobile networks;network capacity;heterogeneous;delay constraints	This paper investigates the capacity problem of heterogeneous wireless networks in mobility scenarios. A heterogeneous network model which consists of n normal nodes and m helping nodes is proposed. Moreover, we propose a D-delay transmission strategy to ensure that every packet can be delivered to its destination nodes with limited delay. Different from most existing network schemes, our network model has a novel two-tier architecture. The existence of helping nodes greatly improves the network capacity. Four types of mobile networks are studied in this paper: i.i.d. fast mobility model and slow mobility model in two-dimensional space, i.i.d. fast mobility model and slow mobility model in three-dimensional space. Using the virtual channel model, we present an intuitive analysis of the capacity of two-dimensional mobile networks and three-dimensional mobile networks, respectively. Given a delay constraint D, we derive the asymptotic expressions for the capacity of the four types of mobile networks. Furthermore, the impact of D and m to the capacity of the whole network is analyzed. Our findings provide great guidance for the future design of the next generation of networks.	channel (communications);genetic heterogeneity;multitier architecture;network model;network packet;next-generation network;virtual channel	Feng Wu;Jiang Zhu;Zhipeng Xi;Kai Gao	2016		10.3390/s16040425	simulation;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;wireless network;mobility model;computer network	Mobile	13.605421962871857	90.45247421899472	141939

We observe that even a smart phone remains in the RRC state, there may still exist some significant performance change if it simultaneously carry on voice and data services. For example, the Round Trip Time (RTT) will get larger when a voice call comes upon, and may get even larger after finishing the voice call. We conduct in-depth study and find out the primary cause of those phenomena - smart phones may get different physical channels even in the same RRC state. In this paper, we define new states according to which physical channel is allocated to smart phones, then discover a fine-grained state machine which is hidden in the physical layer of user plane, which can explain those phenomena very well. We construct the hidden fine-grained state machine for two carriers, one only supports 3G network in most area and the other supports 4G network. The state machine can help us analyze the interference of voice to data. Using the fine-grained state machine, we also offer some suggestions on how to avoid those performance loss both from the perspective of carriers and users.	existential quantification;experiment;finite-state machine;forwarding plane;interference (communication);network performance;protocol stack;smartphone	Wenshan Fu;Kaigui Bian;Tong Zhao;Wei Yan	2014	2015 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7417329	communications protocol;cellular network;throughput;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;interference;round-trip delay time;physical layer;server;computer network	Mobile	19.79624279163113	90.45165796155496	142574

Therefore, all intra-cell communications have to be via base stations. It not only leads to extra power consumption for intra-cell communications, but also only one channel can be used per time slot in the whole cell. This may lead to decrease in the network performance. Therefore, we propose a protocol called intra-cell peer to peer communication protocol (ICP2P) based on IEEE 802.22 protocol. The main accomplishments of ICP2P are to support direct intra-cell peer to peer communications between Customer Premises Equipments (CPEs), to allocate multiple channels per time slot in a cell, and to re-allocate same channels in one time slot. The network performance, such as capacity, channel usage and energy consumption, are significantly improved by ICP2P. Additionally, a weighed demand queue algorithm (WDQA) is proposed to guarantee the fairness in channel access opportunities for CPEs.	algorithm;centralized computing;communications protocol;experiment;fairness measure;network performance;peer-to-peer;simulation;throughput	Huaizhou Shi;R.

To fully utilize the hop by hop feedback information, a suite of novel, decentralized, predictive congestion control schemes are proposed for wireless sensor networks in concert with distributed power control (DPC). Besides providing energy efficient solution, embedded channel estimator in DPC predicts the channel quality. By using the channel quality and node queue utilizations, the onset of network congestion is predicted and congestion control is initiated. Stability of the hop by hop congestion control is demonstrated by using a Lyapunov-based approach. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes result in fewer dropped packets than a network without the hop-by-hop congestion control, better fairness index and network efficiency, higher aggregate throughput, and smaller end-to-end delays over the other available schemes like IEEE 802.11 protocol.	aggregate data;algorithm;deferred procedure call;embedded system;end-to-end principle;fair-share scheduling;fairness measure;hop-by-hop transport;lyapunov fractal;network congestion;network packet;onset (audio);quality of service;scheduling (computing);simulation;tcp congestion control;throughput;traffic flow (computer networking)	Maciej J.

In detail, a still open question concerns the closed-form design of cross-layer control policies to maximise the average throughput while taking into account constraints comprising layers of the protocol stack from the physical (PHY) up to the application (APP) one. To overcome the computational cost entailed by dynamic programming solutions, the approach we follow aims at the maximisation (on a per-slot basis) of the throughput averaged over the fading statistic and conditioned on the queue state. To show the performance of the proposed controller, (tight) upper and lower bounds have been derived for the average throughput and numerical tests have been presented to give insight into the connection bandwidth vs. queue-delay tradeoff.

Although thecode assignment problem has been studied extensively on PRN, we o bserve in this paper that thepower control problem has been ignored by most works, but may have significant impact on performance. By power control, we mean that the transmission ranges of stations are tunable. We show given a PRN in which each host already received a code, how to adjust the powers of stations to control/improve the topology of the PRN without violating the original code assignment. Several schemes are proposed. Through sim ulations, we demonstrate that although the code assignment pro blem is NP-complete and thus computationally very expensive, us ing our power adjustment schemes can easily improve the network per formance by about 20% with polynomial costs.	assignment problem;np-completeness;network packet;polynomial;throughput	Chi-Fu Huang;Yu-Chee Tseng;Shih-Lin Wu;Jang-Ping Sheu	2001		10.1109/ICCCN.2001.956246	cognitive radio;telecommunications;power control;computer science;radio resource management;distributed computing;assignment problem;network performance;computational complexity theory;code;network topology;wireless;computer network;umts terrestrial radio access network	Mobile	17.874503631663824	93.64714211534985	143727

In this paper, we investigate the use of cooperative communications with adaptive relay selection for resource-constrained wireless sensor networks, and propose QoS-RSCC, a QoS-support multi-agent reinforcement learning based relay selection scheme for cooperative communications. In QoS-RSCC, optimal relays, in terms of outage probability and channel efficiency, are selected distributedly from multiple relaying candidates for the intermediate routers along the multi-hop route, without the needs of prior knowledge of the wireless network model and centralized control. We compare the network performance of QoS-RSCC with CRP [1], and investigate the impacts of network traffic load, channel bit error rate, and node’s mobility on the network performance. Simulation results show that QoS-RSCC can achieve a near-optimal performance on both diversity gains and channel efficiency, and fits well in dynamic environments.	bit error rate;centralized computing;channel capacity;cooperative mimo;downtime;fits;fairness measure;forward error correction;multi-agent system;network model;network packet;network performance;provisioning;quality of service;reinforcement learning;relay;simulation;throughput	Xuedong Liang;Ilangko Balasingham;Victor C.

For energy-efficient cellular communication, we tackle two energy characteristics of cellular networks: (1) transmission energy highly varies upon channel condition, and (2) transmission of a packet accompanies unnecessary tail energy waste. Under the objective of transmitting packets when the best channel is provided as well as a number of packets are accumulated, we propose a new mobile collaboration framework “CarrierMix” that aggregates smart devices across multiple heterogeneous cellular carriers. Compared to the standalone operation, even without a buffering delay, CarrierMix allows better channel and reduces more tail energy in a statistical point of view. To maximize the energy benefit while maintaining the fairness among the nodes in collaboration, we further develop a dynamic programming framework providing the optimal algorithm of CarrierMix and its approximated heuristic. Trace-driven simulations on our experimental HSPA/EVDO/LTE network traces show that CarrierMix of five devices achieves up to 42 percent of energy reduction.	approximation algorithm;compaq lte;dynamic programming;fairness measure;heuristic;mobile phone;network packet;point of view (computer hardware company);simulation;smart device;smartphone;tracing (software);transmitter	Joohyun Lee;Kyunghan Lee;Yeongjin Kim;Song Chong	2017	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2016.2538238	real-time computing;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network	Mobile	18.412638279693624	90.59418293115294	144304

We study the economic viability of SCWNO by considering the cost of leasing HPC, delay in data transmission, and quality of data. When the free TVWS is congested, SCWNO may choose to purchase HPC, or delay the transmission, or reduce the data unit size by sacrificing the data quality. We develop offline and online algorithms for two optimization problems: SCWNO cost minimization subject to target delay and data quality constraints; and delay minimization subject to given total budget and data quality constraints. Simulation results show that considering data quality as an additional QoS dimension can aid SCWNO in meeting its QoS objectives while also maintaining its economic viability.	cognitive network;data quality;machine to machine;mathematical optimization;online algorithm;online and offline;quality of service;simulation;white spaces (radio)	Naveed Ul Hassan;Chau Yuen;Muhammad Bershgal Atique	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7511004	database index;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	EDA	19.339152450529888	97.23480650986326	144307

With this aim, we extend the subgroup merging scheme (SMS), designed for generic Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems, by proposing two low-complexity subgroup formation schemes, named L-SMS and L-eSMS. Such schemes are tailored to exploit the great potentialities of LTE systems. Specifically, L-SMS is proposed in order to improve the scalability of SMS by handling a more efficient subgroup formation scheme with a computational cost which does not depend on the multicast group size. The L-eSMS also improves the resource assignment phase with the aim to achieve better near-optimal performance compared to L-SMS. Through simulations, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in different cell deployment and multicast configuration scenarios. The achieved results underlined that the proposed L-eSMS is well designed in order to guarantee performance close to the optimal one.	algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;channel capacity;compaq lte;computation;expectation–maximization algorithm;massimo negrotti;multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;scalability;simulation;software deployment	Giuseppe Araniti;Massimo Condoluci;Antonella Molinaro;Antonio Iera;John Cosmas	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting (BMSB)	10.1109/BMSB.2013.6621786	multicast;telecommunications;protocol independent multicast;computer science;pragmatic general multicast;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;computer network	Embedded	22.401539537188018	96.17167411397774	144515

The connections are grouped according to their source-destination pairs, which correspond to the up- and down-link channels traversed, and each group may experience different fading conditions. By exploiting the tradeoff between bandwidth and channel redundancy (as determined by bit and coding rates) in the maximization of TCP goodput, an overall optimization problem is constructed, which can be solved by numerical techniques. Different relations between goodput maximization and fairness of the allocations are investigated, and a possible pricing scheme is proposed.

Packet loss probabilities depend upon time-varying channel gains, packet lengths and transmission power levels of the sensors. Measurements are coded into packets by using either independent coding or distributed zero-error coding. At the gateway, a time-varying Kalman filter uses the received packets to provide the state estimates. To trade sensor energy expenditure for state estimation accuracy, we develop a predictive control algorithm which, in an online fashion, determines the transmission power levels and codebooks to be used by the sensors. To further conserve sensor energy, the controller is located at the gateway and sends coarsely quantized power increment commands, only whenever deemed necessary. Simulations based on real channel measurements illustrate that the proposed method gives excellent results.	algorithm;codebook;computer simulation;error detection and correction;kalman filter;network packet;packet analyzer;quantization (signal processing);sensor	Daniel E.

These assumptions break down in many practical systems, where, by adapting the physical layer channel coding or transmission diversity, different tradeoffs between rate and reliability can be achieved. In network utility maximization problems formulated in this paper, the utility for each user depends on both transmission rate and signal quality, with an intrinsic tradeoff between the two. Each link may also provide a higher (or lower) rate on the transmission """"pipes"""" by allowing a higher (or lower) decoding error probability. Despite nonseparability and nonconvexity of these optimization problems, we propose new price-based distributed algorithms and prove their convergence to the globally optimal rate-reliability tradeoff under readily-verifiable sufficient conditions. We first consider networks in which the rate-reliability tradeoff is controlled by adapting channel code rates in each link's physical-layer error correction codes, and propose two distributed algorithms based on pricing, which respectively implement the """"integrated"""" and """"differentiated"""" policies of dynamic rate-reliability adjustment. In contrast to the classical price-based rate control algorithms, in our algorithms, each user provides an offered price for its own reliability to the network, while the network provides congestion prices to users. The proposed algorithms converge to a tradeoff point between rate and reliability, which we prove to be a globally optimal one for channel codes with sufficiently large coding length and utilities whose curvatures are sufficiently negative. Under these conditions, the proposed algorithms can thus generate the Pareto optimal tradeoff curves between rate and reliability for all the users. In addition, the distributed algorithms and convergence proofs are extended for wireless multiple-inpit-multiple-output multihop networks, in which diversity and multiplexing gains of each link are controlled to achieve the optimal rate-reliability tradeoff. Numerical examples confirm that there can be significant enhancement of the network utility by distributively trading-off rate and reliability, even when only some of the links can implement dynamic reliability."""	channel capacity;code;converge;distributed algorithm;ecc memory;entropy maximization;error detection and correction;expectation–maximization algorithm;formal verification;forward error correction;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;multiplexing;network congestion;network utility;pareto efficiency	Jang-Won Lee;Mung Chiang;A.

Recently, a heuristic algorithm H MCOP, which is based on a non-linear Lagrange relaxation (NLR) technique, has been proposed to resolve the contradiction between the time complexity and the quality of solution. Even though H MCOP has demonstrated outstanding capability of finding feasible solutions to the multi-path constrained (MCP) problem, it has not exploited the full capability that an NLR-based technique could offer. In this paper, we propose a new NLR-based heuristic called NLR MCP, in which the search process is interpreted from a probability’s perspective. Simulation results indicate that NLR MCP can achieve a higher probability of finding feasible solutions than H MCOP. We also verify that the performance improvement of a MCP heuristic has a tremendous impact on the performance of a higher level heuristic that uses a MCP heuristic as the basic step.

In particular, we propose an analytical framework, which can exploit the best coding opportunities among all the possible realistic ones, for deriving the network throughput gains of the wireless NC schemes. By solving the problem of maximizing the network throughput subject to the fairness requirements under our proposed framework, we quantitatively analyze the network throughput gains of these two types of wireless NC schemes under various wireless network topologies.	coding gain;fairness measure;grid network;linear network coding;linear programming;mathematical optimization;network topology;rado graph;random graph;requirement;simulation;spectral efficiency;throughput;unicast	Hang Su;Xi Zhang	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2009.5199530	telecommunications;computer science;linear programming;wireless network;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Mobile	13.706776350311502	92.07256348948714	147368

With abilities to sense for available channels and to adapt to the radio environment, a CRSN is able to be more opportunistic in accessing spectrums than a WSN, but it also has problems due to hardware constraints and energy limitations. In many studies on distributed CR MAC protocols, establishing dedicated control channels (DCCs) has been considered as an important problem because it is essentially used for coordination and negotiation of spectrum assignments. However, directly applying DCCs into CRSNs is impractical, due to its high-cost complexity in hardware and deployment. To solve it, in this paper we propose a distributed MAC protocol using virtual control channels for CRSNs, in which CR sensor nodes called secondary users are grouped into clusters, and commonly shared available channels are utilized as virtual DCCs. In addition, a channel selection scheme is developed, based on an approximated partially observable Markov decision process. Our numerical simulation results indicate that the proposed MAC protocol can not only improve the throughput rate but also reduce the energy consumption under no DCCs.

The case of study is that of a pair of nodes establishing a data stream that has routing priority over all the remaining traffic in the network. For every delay constraint, upper and lower bounds on the achievable information rate between the two end-points of the stream are obtained as the network size grows. The analysis concerns decentralized schemes, in the sense that all nodes make next-hop decisions based only on local information, namely their channel strength to other nodes in the network and the position of the destination node. This is particularly important in a fading scenario, where the channel strength varies with time and hence pre-computing routes can be of little help. Natural applications are remote surveillance using sensor networks, and communication in emergency scenarios.	image scaling;precomputation;rayleigh fading;routing;scaling limit;throughput	Nikhil Karamchandani;Massimo Franceschetti	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.168	scaling limit;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;rayleigh fading;upper and lower bounds;statistics;computer network	Mobile	13.423024743651473	89.06731303819875	147865

First, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for the throughput-maximizing scheduling problem. We then elaborate on certain special cases of this problem and explore their combinatorial properties. Second, we prove that the max-min fair scheduling problem is NP-Hard in the strong sense. We also prove that the problem cannot be approximated within any constant factor better than 2 unless P = NP. Additionally, we propose an approximation algorithm for the max-min fair scheduling problem with approximation ratio depending on the ratio of the maximum possible data rate to the minimum possible data rate of a secondary users. We then focus on the combinatorial properties of certain special cases and investigate their relation with various problems such as the multiple-knapsack, matching, terminal assignment, and Santa Claus problems. We then prove that the proportionally fair scheduling problem is NP-Hard in the strong sense and inapproximable within any additive constant less than log (4/3). Finally, we evaluate the performance of our approximation algorithm for the max-min fair scheduling problem via simulations. This approach sheds light on the complexity and combinatorial properties of these scheduling problems, which have high practical importance in centralized cognitive radio networks.	approximation algorithm;centralized computing;cognitive radio;data rate units;fair-share scheduling;matching (graph theory);max-min fairness;maxima and minima;multistage interconnection networks;np-hardness;p versus np problem;polynomial;proportionally fair;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;time complexity;utility functions on indivisible goods	Didem Gözüpek;Mordechai Shalom;Fatih Alagöz	2015	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2013.2297441	fair-share scheduling;mathematical optimization;cognitive radio;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;linear programming;rate-monotonic scheduling;theoretical computer science;maximum throughput scheduling;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;proportionally fair;computer network	Theory	16.46400532408558	91.09786875606956	148166

CRs work in an unlicensed network setting, so it is important that cognitive users utilize the spectrum opportunistically, i.e., without interrupting the licensed user's activity. To provide the opportunistic access for a cognitive 4G user, we propose an architecture that delivers the desired solution by following a novel five-step process. First, the cognitive (or secondary) user relays its throughput requirements from the application layer down to the media access layer by way of cross-layering. Second, the media access layer at its end senses the licensed spectrum and, based on the sensed parameters, characterizes the licensed (or primary) user's amount of spectrum occupancy into three different occupancy level types. Third, the licensed user's spectrum occupancy, categorized into three levels, is statistically represented by setting up a Markov model that evaluates the probability that the licensed channel could be found in a particular state at a given time instant for each level. Fourth, to provide opportunistic spectrum access to the secondary user, an optimization strategy is devised in the media access control layer that will bring face to face the throughput requirements obtained from the application layer and the steady-state probabilities for the licensed channel from the physical layer. Fifth, optimal performance metrics concerning the 4G user throughput and power are attained by solving the optimization problem. Results obtained are simulated against a variety of network parameters, and performance improvement through the proposed scheme is assessed by simulations conducted for a long-term evolution (LTE) system.	access control;categorization;cognitive radio;compaq lte;interrupt;markov chain;markov model;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;real-time transcription;relay;requirement;simulation;steady state;throughput	Maria Aslam;Muhammad Naeem Ayyaz	2016	IEEE Systems Journal	10.1109/JSYST.2014.2367529	throughput;cognitive radio;simulation;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;sensor;markov process;steady state;computer security;statistics;computer network	Mobile	21.066710105481636	96.1507543712263	148770
4c9c35ccb9a69ff19b482c5f76e4104c7a560d7b	dynamic spectrum management through resource virtualization with m2m communications		Wireless spectrum licensing has increased due to the continuous evolution and use of cellular technology. The increase in the number of mobile-connected devices and global data traffic demand has led to a significant increase in demand for spectrum access with studies showing that there is unexploited capacity in the spectrum. This is especially critical for 5G networks where the service requirements are extremely stringent. To that end, this article proposes dynamic spectrum management through the combination of two innovative architectures, wireless resource virtualization (WRV) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. WRV allows for better utilization of the spectrum, while reducing both the capital and operational expenditures. On the other hand, M2M communications can help boost capacity and improve quality of service by leveraging spectrum access across multiple radio technologies. In this article, a brief discussion of multi-radio access technology heterogeneous networks is given. Then the problem of dynamic spectrum management through resource virtualization with M2M communications is described. To the best of our knowledge, such a combined framework has not been previously proposed. Two different algorithms are proposed to evaluate the performance of the considered architecture, namely a decomposition- based algorithm and a greedy-based algorithm. Simulation results show that such architecture can boost the overall capacity of the system by achieving higher data rates. Moreover, it is shown that the number of possibly supported M2M pairs is increased while using the same spectrum.	assistive technology;frequency allocation;greedy algorithm;machine to machine;mobile phone;quality of service;requirement;simulation	Abdallah Moubayed;Karim Hammad;Abdallah Shami;Hanan Lutfiyya	2018	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2018.1800060	computer network;architecture;virtualization;dynamic priority scheduling;wireless;dynamic spectrum management;quality of service;heterogeneous network;computer science;distributed computing;cellular network	Mobile	22.871677808035486	88.72210190486011	148884

Given the unique capabilities of smart antennas, and how they can improve performance in a typically constrained ad hoc network environment, the attention is with merit. However, not much light has been shed on wireless ad hoc networks that have nodes with varying antenna capabilities. While homogeneous ad hoc networks with all nodes having the same antenna capabilities will have certain applications, we argue that ad hoc networks with nodes having heterogeneous antenna capabilities are more likely to be the norm due to a variety of motivating factors. In this context, we answer two fundamental questions in this paper: (i) what is the theoretical capacity of an ad hoc network when its nodes have varying antenna capabilities? We consider nodes equipped with only omnidirectional antennas to those that are equipped with more sophisticated adaptive-array and MIMO capable antennas. Perhaps more interestingly, we provide insights into what percentage of nodes in an ad hoc network have to be ‘smart’ to get a certain overall network capacity. (ii) What medium access control (MAC) and routing protocols should nodes use in such a heterogeneous network? We present MAC and routing protocols for ad hoc networks with heterogeneous antenna capabilities that allow nodes to interact with each other effectively despite their heterogeneity, and in the process deliver considerably improved performance over simplistic strategies. We substantiate our theoretical results, and evaluate the proposed protocols using ns2-based network simulations.

This paper proposes a new analytical model for the management of virtual radio resources in full heterogeneous networks. The estimation of network capacity and data rate allocation are the model’s two main components. Based on the probability distribution of the signal-tointerference-plus-noise-ratio observed at the user terminal, the model leads to the probability distribution for the total network data rate. It considers different approaches for the estimation of the total network data rate, based on different channel qualities, i.e., optimistic, realistic and pessimistic. The second component uses the outcome of the first one in order to maximise the weighted data rate subject to the total network capacity, the SLAs (service level agreements) of Virtual Network Operators (VNOs), and fairness. The weights for services in the objective function of the resource allocation component enable the model to have prioritisation among services. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in a practical heterogeneous access network. Results show an increase of 2.5 times in network capacity by implementing an access point at the centre of each cell of a cellular network. It is shown that the cellular network capacity itself can vary from 0.9 Gbps in the pessimistic approach up to 5.5 Gbps in the optimistic one. Finally, the isolation of service classes and VNOs by means of virtualisation of radio resources is clearly demonstrated.	access network;data rate units;fairness measure;loss function;optimistic concurrency control;optimization problem;programming paradigm;radio resource management;service-level agreement;uncompressed video;wireless access point	Sina Khatibi;Luís M.

However, they ignore the inherent stochasticity in arrival and service processes. To address this shortcoming, we develop a robust fluid approach to the control of processing networks. We provide insights into the mathematical structure, modeling power, tractability, and performance of the resulting model. Specifically, we show that the robust fluid model preserves the computational tractability of the classical fluid problem and retains its original structure. From the robust fluid model, we derive a (scheduling) policy that regulates how fluid from various classes is processed at the servers of the network. We present simulation results to compare the performance of our policies to several commonly used traditional methods. The results demonstrate that our robust fluid policies are near-optimal (when the optimal can be computed) and outperform policies obtained directly from the fluid model and heuristic alternatives (when it is computationally intractable to compute the optimal).	cobham's thesis;computation;computational complexity theory;computational fluid dynamics;effective dimension;heuristic;mathematical optimization;mathematical structure;numerical analysis;open research;queueing theory;robust optimization;scheduling (computing);server (computing);simulation;stochastic process;traffic analysis	Dimitris Bertsimas;Ebrahim Nasrabadi;Ioannis Ch.

The optimal policy is the one that maximizes the system throughput while maintaining a level of fairness between users.

The effects of the allowable number of channel states and the fairness factor on the optimal policy performance were also studied.	channel (communications);computation;dynamic programming;fairness measure;iteration;markov chain;markov decision process;numerical analysis;programming model;round-robin scheduling;scheduling (computing);simulation;stochastic programming;telecommunications link;three-state logic;throughput	Hussein Al-Zubaidy;Ioannis Lambadaris;Jerome Talim	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.443	stochastic programming;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	18.232872970917555	97.30293895724816	149804

Relying on the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, the limited wireless resources and vehicle sojourn time make it quite challenging to schedule the transmissions of multiple vehicles to ensure high efficiency and quality. In this paper, the scheduling of multimedia transmissions over drive-thru Internet is investigated. A utility model is devised to map the throughput to user's satisfaction level. The objective of the scheduling problem is to maximize the total utility. Then, the optimization problem is formulated as a finite-state decision problem with the assumption that future arrival information is known, and it is solved by a searching algorithm as the benchmark. To obtain a real-time solution, a practical heuristic algorithm based on the concept of utility potential is devised. We further implemented the solution and conducted extensive simulations using NS-3, and the simulation results show that the proposed heuristic algorithm can outperform the state-of-the-art one; therefore, it can effectively make scheduling decisions to achieve both higher utility and efficiency and better fairness.	benchmark (computing);decision problem;ergodic theory;fairness measure;heuristic (computer science);internet;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;real-time clock;scheduling (computing);search algorithm;simulation;throughput	Min Xing;Jianping He;Lin Cai	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2015.2424372	fair-share scheduling;the internet;simulation;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;genetic algorithm scheduling;operating system;distributed computing;scheduling;wireless;encoding;computer network	Embedded	22.065486683484067	96.91066130522462	149980

A combined SON operation, with numerous SON functions running in parallel, might lead to an undesired network performance due to unforeseen coherencies of parameter changes. In order to gain a greater understanding of the interworking of SON functions, well-known SON use cases are tested with different combinations in a realistic multi-layer, multi-RAT scenario. Results show that a substantial impact on the network performance can be observed for different SON function combinations. Furthermore, the effects also differ if multiple context classes of cells (i.e. different sizes, locations, mobility types) are considered.	cell (microprocessor);emoticon;layer (electronics);mathematical optimization;network performance;self-organization;simulation	Sören Hahn;Michael Schweins;Thomas Kürner	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2018.8368974	task analysis;mobile network operator;real-time computing;handover;self-organizing network;use case;network performance;cellular network;computer science	Visualization	22.631692931163126	90.03626688586178	150199

Although scheduling a single transmission in this manner reduces the amount of transmitter and channel resources being used, it may also place a burden on the receivers in the network. If all receivers do not become available at the same time, then some receivers may have to wait (and be idle) for signi cantly long periods of time before receiving the message. In this paper, we investigate methods for partitioning a multicast group into a number of smaller subgroups and for scheduling a separate transmission for each of these subgroups. We show that this approach more e ectively conserves and balances the usage of transmitter and receiver resources in the network and may lead to signi cantly improved system performance over the conventional single-transmission multicast approach.	computer engineering;computer science;heuristic (computer science);hop;jason;loss function;multicast;scheduling (computing);transmitter;unicast;wavelength-division multiplexing	Jason P.

A person walks along a line, starting from a sink node e.g., a base-station, and proceeds towards a source node e.g., a sensor which is at an a priori unknown location. At equally spaced locations, he makes link quality measurements to the previous relay, and deploys relays at some of these locations, with the aim to connect the source to the sink by a multihop wireless path. In this paper, we consider two approaches for impromptu deployment: i the deployment agent can only move forward which we call a pure as-you-go approach, and ii the deployment agent can make measurements over several consecutive steps before selecting a placement location among them the explore-forward approach. We consider a very light traffic regime, and formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, where the trade-off is among the power used by the nodes, the outage probabilities in the links, and the number of relays placed per unit distance. We obtain the structures of the optimal policies for the pure as-you-go approach as well as for the explore-forward approach. We also consider natural heuristic algorithms, for comparison. Numerical examples show that the explore-forward approach significantly outperforms the pure as-you-go approach in terms of network cost. Next, we propose two learning algorithms for the explore-forward approach, based on Stochastic Approximation, which asymptotically converge to the set of optimal policies, without using any knowledge of the radio propagation model. We demonstrate numerically that the learning algorithms can converge as deployment progresses to the set of optimal policies reasonably fast and, hence, can be practical model-free algorithms for deployment over large regions. Finally, we demonstrate the end-to-end traffic carrying capability of such networks via field deployment.	algorithm;converge;downtime;end-to-end principle;heuristic;impromptu;machine learning;markov chain;markov decision process;numerical analysis;numerical method;relay;software deployment;software propagation;stochastic approximation	Arpan Chattopadhyay;Marceau Coupechoux;Anurag Kumar	2016	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2015.2496721	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;shadow mapping;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fading;approximation algorithm;wireless;computer network	Metrics	15.407331110471326	90.97778886874451	150636

This paper presents and analyses a mechanism that enables PAN-to-PAN communication between WiMedia-based distributed networks that operate on different PHY channels. Whereas other PAN standards like IEEE 802.15.3 do not support this type of communication, it has been found that two WiMedia PANs can be merged using the presented mechanism and thus, communication between formerly independent PANs can be established. The presented simulation results prove the concept and show the performance in terms of the required time to merge and PER during the merge process. Further, it has been found that the time to merge does not depend on the number of allocated medium access slots and that the interference created during the merge process is eliminated quickly.	interference (communication);phy (chip);simulation	Karsten Schoo;Sebastian Doht	2007	2007 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2007.4394477	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;personal area network;computer network	Arch	10.611395978458265	90.72670548157811	150763

Due to the highly dynamic nature of spectrum availability in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), we design a two-step approach, namely long-time route selection and periodic resource allocation. By introducing the interference cushion to resource allocation, we prevent real-time (RT) traffic from starving non-real-time (NRT) traffic. We formulate the problems of channel and power allocation for RT and NRT flows as two mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems which are NP-hard in general, and propose low-complexity yet efficient suboptimal algorithms to solve the formulated MINLP problems. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of RT flow's mean access ratio and NRT flow's mean throughput. Also, we find that how to set interference cushion can affect the performance tradeoff between QoS provisioning for RT traffic and throughput maximization for NRT traffic.	cognitive radio;end-to-end principle;expectation–maximization algorithm;heuristic;interference (communication);max-flow min-cut theorem;mesh networking;np-hardness;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;provisioning;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time computing;simulation;throughput;windows rt	Ningkai Zhou;Hangguan Shan;Aiping Huang;Xin Wang	2013	2013 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing	10.1109/WCSP.2013.6677275	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Mobile	16.025377685284333	95.04137058066459	151338
cbea32a598b9dea87293def403f654ec07217394	robust proactive mobility management in named data networking under erroneous content prediction		Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising paradigm for the future Internet to survive the growing data demand. Supporting seamless operation during user mobility is one of the main challenges in NDN. In this paper, we investigate optimal caching for producer mobility under prediction uncertainties. Mainly, we propose a stochastic optimization framework that exploits location and data requests' predictors to cache data proactively before handover. We model the problem using Chance Constraint Programming (CCP) that probabilistically incorporates the uncertainty in data prediction and models the trade-off between network overhead and Consumer satisfaction. A deterministic formulation is derived to obtain a closed form Integer Linear Programming model based on the prediction error model. The proposed framework is then implemented in ndnSIM and Gurobi, and simulation experiments are conducted to provide benchmark solutions for robust proactive caching. The results show that such robust scheme satisfies the consumers' quality of experience under imperfect prediction of future content requested from mobile producers. Hence, sustains the prediction gains over conventional non- predictive schemes without compromising the network overhead. We believe that such results drive incentives for deploying proactive mobility management in future NDN.	benchmark (computing);cache (computing);computational complexity theory;constraint programming;experiment;future internet;gurobi;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;mathematical optimization;overhead (computing);programming model;programming paradigm;real-time clock;seamless3d;simulation;stochastic optimization	Hisham Farahat;Ramy Atawia;Hossam S.

bf63233d102dbb53a60abb81055fae611e135c44	interference and qos aware cell switch-off strategy for software defined lte hetnets		LTE-Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) with dense deployment of small cells are expected to effectively meet unprecedented ever increasing data traffic demands and offer improved coverage in indoor environments. However, HetNets are raising major issues to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) such as complex distributed control plane management and increased energy costs. Hence, MNOs are looking for flexible software defined mobile architectures to reduce their capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX). In this work, in order to reduce energy costs of the HetNets, we propose an interference and QoS aware cell switch-off strategy (IQ-CSOS) on a software defined LTE Radio Access Network (SD-LTE-RAN) framework. Unlike existing CSOSs, IQ-CSOS investigates both network energy costs and QoS satisfaction of sessions during CSOS decisions. In performance evaluation under various test scenarios, it is found that IQ-CSOS is able to provide 50–80% of network energy savings. Besides, it is able to provide 30% more energy savings compared to existing CSOSs with slight affect on network QoS.		Anil Kumar Rangisetti;Tamma Bheemarjuna Reddy	2019	J.

Due to the shared wireless channel between tags and the reader during communication, the tag collision arbitration is a significant issue for reducing the communication overhead. This paper presents a novel anti-collision algorithm named New Enhanced Anti-Collision Algorithm (NEAA) using counters and stack to reduce the probability of collision efficiently and to make it possible to identify multiple passive tags in a timeslot. The upper bound of total timeslots for identifying N passive tags is first derived in this paper; suppose the length of a tag ID is n, the upper bound of total timeslots for identifying N (N= 2n) passive tags is derived to be 2n-1 - n + 4, when n > 2. This bound is quite tight. Compared to the existing methods proposed by other researchers, the performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme in this paper consumes fewer timeslots and has better performance for identifying tags.	algorithm;authorization;caller id;communication complexity;comparator;counter (digital);electronic product code;human-readable medium;ieee xplore;informatics;logic gate;nonvolatile bios memory;overhead (computing);performance evaluation;pointer (computer programming);qt (software);radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;randomness;tag cloud;world wide web	Shi-Jinn Horng;Yuan-Hsin Chen;Ray-Shine Run;Jui-Lin Lai;Rong-Jian Chen;Wei-Chih Chen;Yi Pan;Takao Terano	2010	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2009.2033050	radio-frequency identification;telecommunications;computer science;computational intelligence;computer security	Mobile	10.66060381695282	93.99299498242229	151686

1f05c5131b56bba711405cade4e2f395eb1a9e9c	energy saving mechanism with a route prediction based intra-handover in lte networks		Long term evolution standard employs the discontinuous reception (DRX) technology to help user equipment (UE) in energy saving. After the UE received nothing from the base station for a predefined time span, it turns off the radio frequency module to enter sleep mode for energy saving. An UE may fail to handover or lost connection for late handover in case it enters sleep mode before handover and missed the optimal handover timing, therefore results in data loss. This paper proposes an energy saving mechanism with a prediction based intra-handover which predicts the next target handover base station and the optimal handover time according to the historical path data kept in a database. The UE would check whether the next sleep mode outlast the handover time point before entering sleep mode to reduce power consumption for handover failure caused by the long DRX cycle and base station reselection. Simulation results show that the DRX mechanism helps reduce power consumption of UE by 90–95 % over the conventional one more than 7 % handover failures. The energy saving mechanism combined with route prediction leads to 22 % more energy saving while cutting handover failures to 5 %.	compaq lte;database;discontinuous reception;failure rate;mike lesser;radio frequency;simulation;sleep mode	Yu-Hsin Cheng;Shang-Juh Kao;Zih-Ciang Yang;Hsiu-Lang Wang	2017	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3578-0	real-time computing;telecommunications;soft handover;computer network	OS	20.789004866674215	92.02185712848016	153149
953ad12785c024ab790425671b17212dc818a078	echo state networks for proactive caching and content prediction in cloud radio access networks		Proactive caching at the baseband units (BBUs) in cloud radio access networks (CRANs) has attracted significant attention. However, most existing works assume certain content distribution while ignoring the massive nature of data in CRANs. In contrast, in this paper, the problem of proactive caching is studied for CRANs. In this model, the BBUs can predict the content distribution of each user, determine which content to cache, and cluster remote radio heads (RRHs) based on the content predictions. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly incorporates backhaul loads, RRH clustering, and content caching. To solve this problem, an algorithm that combines the machine learning framework of echo state networks with sublinear algorithms is proposed. Using echo state networks, the BBUs can predict users content distribution while having only limited information on the network's and users' states. Then, a sublinear algorithm is proposed to determine which content to cache and how to cluster the RRHs while using limited content request samples. Simulation results using real data from Youku show that the proposed approach yields significant gains, in terms of sum effective capacity, that reach up to 26.8 and 36.5%, respectively, compared to random caching and random caching without clustering.	access network;algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);baseband;cache (computing);cluster analysis;digital distribution;echo state network;machine learning;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;r language;remote radio head;simulation	Mingzhe Chen;Walid Saad;Changchuan Yin;Mérouane Debbah	2016	2016 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	10.1109/GLOCOMW.2016.7848887	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;world wide web;computer network	Web+IR	24.083693131764633	96.36587800613137	153462

A dynamic strategy is developed to support all traffic whenever possible, and to make optimally fair decisions about which data to serve when inputs exceed network capacity. The strategy is decoupled into separate algorithms for flow control, routing, and resource allocation, and allows each user to make decisions independent of the actions of others. The combined strategy is shown to yield data rates that are arbitrarily close to the optimal operating point achieved when all network controllers are coordinated and have perfect knowledge of future events. The cost of approaching this fair operating point is an end-to-end delay increase for data that is served by the network.	algorithm;end-to-end principle;fairness measure;operating point;optimal control;routing;stochastic control	Michael J.

To avoid frequent communication disruptions owing to effects such as the ping-pong effect, it is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the cell selection method. Traditionally, such selection method is usually a measured channel/cell quality metric such as the channel capacity, the load of the candidate cell, the received signal strength (RSS), etc. However, one problem with such approaches is that present measured performance does not necessarily reflect the future performance, thus the need for novel cell selection that can predict the \textit{horizon}. Subsequently, we present in this paper a reinforcement learning (RL), i.e, Q- learning algorithm, as a generic solution for the cell selection problem in a non-stationary femtocell network. After comparing our solution for cell selection with different methods in the literature (least loaded (LL), random and capacity-based), simulation results demonstrate the benefits of using learning in terms of the gained capacity and the number of handovers.	channel capacity;function-behaviour-structure ontology;ll parser;q-learning;rss;reinforcement learning;selection algorithm;simulation;stationary process	Chaima Dhahri;Tomoaki Ohtsuki	2012	2012 IEEE 75th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240208	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;channel capacity;computer network	Visualization	22.332350188194226	94.03461548033135	153743

Spectrum sensing for Cognitive Radio User (CRU) enables them to make use of unused spectrum portion. Consensus based algorithms are being developed by researchers to attain reliable spectrum sensing for which various techniques are employed. In this paper, the authors implement a consensus based algorithm by using energy detection as sensing technique and by utilizing cooperation among users. The consensus algorithm is applied on Mobile Nodes (MN) using random walk mobility model. Through this implementation an efficient cooperative spectrum sensing technique is proposed.

We then present a heuristic to increase network throughput and fairness as compared to a random allocation. In the proposed heuristic, nodes that are of similar distances to any sinks are grouped together to utilize the same set of TH slots for transmissions. Simulations show that the proposed heuristic improves both throughput and fairness, scales with multiple sinks and can be used as a simple admission control mechanism.	fairness measure;heuristic;mathematical optimization;np-hardness;optimization problem;sensor node;throughput	Hwee-Xian Tan;Mun Choon Chan;Peng Yong Kong;Chen-Khong Tham	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.277	optimization problem;sensor node;max-min fairness;telecommunications;resource allocation;computer science;np-hard;distributed computing;computational complexity theory;computer network	Robotics	15.399674491323639	92.86173683159271	154124

Given such flexibility, we need to carefully design the system to identify the optimal mechanism that maximizes both performance and resource utilization. To enable the SDN-NFV system to optimize the service chaining according to the user requirements and network environment, in this article, we propose a unified control and optimization framework that jointly controls and optimizes the resource allocation in networking and service provisioning. By modeling the network and services together and developing optimization techniques that jointly examine both, this framework benefits the overall system performance in various scenarios of traffic steering, VM selection, function assignment, and policy optimization. Furthermore, these achievable benefits are demonstrated by a typical example of simulation under a realistic scenario.	agile software development;cognitive radio;mathematical optimization;network function virtualization;provisioning;requirement;routing;simulation;software deployment;software-defined networking;user requirements document	Yong Li;Feng Zheng;Min Chen;Depeng Jin	2015	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2015.7368820	real-time computing;simulation;computer science;noise measurement;resource management;software-defined radio;computer network	Networks	22.61622265560556	92.12931637878313	155041

The key motivation of SCF relaying stems from the fact that energy consumption levels can be dramatically reduced by capitalizing on the inherent mobility of nodes and the elasticity of Internet applications. More specifically, we show how the actual mobility of relay nodes can be incorporated as an additional resource in the system to achieve savings in the required communication energy levels. To this end, we provide a mathematical programming formulation on the aforementioned problem and find optimal routing and scheduling policies to achieve maximum energy savings. By investigating structural properties of the proposed mathematical program we show that optimal solutions can be computed efficiently in time. The tradeoffs between energy and delay in the system are meticulously studied and Pareto efficient curves are derived. Numerical investigations show that the achievable energy gains by judiciously storing and carrying information from mobile relays can grow well above 70 percent for the macrocell scenario when compared to a baseline multihop wireless relaying scheme that uses shortest path routes to the base station.	approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);elasticity (data store);energy level;entity;marginal model;mathematical optimization;numerical linear algebra;overhead (computing);pareto efficiency;relay;routing;scheduling (computing);shortest path problem;uncompressed video	Panayiotis Kolios;Vasilis Friderikos;Katerina Papadaki	2014	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2012.233	real-time computing;the internet;flow network;mobile telephony;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;computer network	Mobile	18.17521526389247	89.93159583356889	155266

However, how to define a green wireless communication system has been an open topic. In this paper, firstly, we present the definition of green efficiency of wireless links and carry out a comprehensive analysis of the efficiency metrics, e.g., the b/s/Hz spectrum efficiency, the b/s/Hz/W energy efficiency, the b/TENU power efficiency and our proposed (b·m)/s/Hz/W green efficiency of a wireless link, in particular we can prove that green efficiency is a strict convex function with respect to transmission power and distance. Secondly, by tuning the cell size with users' QoS (quality of service) guarantee, we introduce green efficiency into a cellular network and achieve the theoretical upper bound of green efficiency for a cellular network. Finally, we present a green efficiency-based network planning method for practical environment. Simulation results show that the proposed network planning mechanism can approach the upper bound of green efficiency.	convex function;performance per watt;quality of service;simulation;spectral efficiency	Liqiang Zhao;Guogang Zhao;Timothy O'Farrell	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666628	wireless wan;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;cdma spectral efficiency;computer network	Mobile	24.564487701474707	90.79223299294357	155418

f0303e63a5b4d6528b26d363fbe661b52f22f9fd	predicting strongest cell on secondary carrier using primary carrier data		There is a rapid evolution in telecommunication with denser networks and systems operating on an increasing number of frequency bands. Also in the next generation 5G networks, even further densification is needed to be able to reach the tight requirements, implying more nodes on each carrier. Denser networks and more frequencies makes it challenging to ensure the best possible cell and frequency carrier assignment to a User Equipment (UE), without the UE needing to perform an excessive amount of inter-frequency measurements and reporting. In this paper, we propose a procedure of predicting the strongest cell of a secondary carrier, and the procedure is exemplified in a UE load-balancing use case. The prediction is based on only measurements on the primary carrier cells, avoiding costly inter-frequency measurements. Simulations of a realistic network deployment show that a UE selection based on the proposed secondary carrier prediction is significantly better than a random UE selection for load balancing.	computer simulation;frequency band;kerrison predictor;load balancing (computing);next-generation network;overhead (computing);requirement;software deployment	Henrik Ryden;Joel Berglund;Martin Isaksson;Rickard Cöster;Fredrik Gunnarsson	2018	2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2018.8369000	software deployment;user equipment;computer network;real-time computing;self-organizing network;radio spectrum;load balancing (computing);load management;computer science	HPC	24.181439511472526	89.57159554619372	156148

However, a better system performance, e.g., in terms of a lower overall frame loss ratio (FLR), can be achieved if BER and FDR are jointly optimized. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimization scheme called traffic-adaptive scheme for multicode CDMA operating over a time division multiple access (TDMA) channel. Based on the traffic condition and buffer status, this scheme employs a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine the optimal value of the maximum number of simultaneous data frames that can be transmitted in each time slot of a TDMA frame so as to minimize the overall FLR of the system. To facilitate implementation, we also propose an approximation scheme named the rate-adaptive scheme to reduce the computation cost. Simulation and analytical results show that both the traffic-adaptive scheme and rate-adaptive scheme can significantly reduce FLR, increase the system throughput, and optimize the packet access delay of the system. Furthermore, the rate-adaptive scheme can achieve a performance close to the traffic-adaptive scheme when the traffic load in the system is high.	an/flr-9;access control;adaptive optimization;bit error rate;channel capacity;clock rate;computation;frame (networking);markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;network packet;optimization problem;polynomial-time approximation scheme;process modeling;requirement;simulation;throughput;x.690	Hui Chen;Henry C.

e2788ead62780fa07ab7597e3763ea8d3ef04016	scheduling and power assignments in the physical model		In the interference scheduling problem, one is given a set of n communication requests each of which corresponds to a sender and a receiver in a multipoint radio network. Each request must be assigned a power level and a color such that signals in each color class can be transmitted simultaneously. The feasibility of simultaneous communication within a color class is defined in terms of the Signal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio (SINR) that compares the strength of a signal at a receiver to the sum of the strengths of other signals. This is commonly referred to as the “physical model” and is the established way of modelling interference in the engineering community. The objective is to minimize the schedule length corresponding to the number of colors needed to schedule all requests. We study oblivious power assignments in which the power value of a request only depends on the path loss between the sender and the receiver, e.g., in a linear fashion. At first, we present a measure of interference giving lower bounds for the schedule length with respect to linear and other power assignments. Based on this measure, we devise distributed scheduling algorithms for the linear power assignment achieving the minimal schedule length up to small factors. In addition, we study a power assignment in which the signal strength is set to the square root of the path loss. We show that this power assignment leads to improved approximation guarantees in two kinds of problem instances defined by directed and bidirectional communication request. Finally, we study the limitations of oblivious power assignments by proving lower bounds for this class of algorithms.

We focus on networks consisting of MIMO nodes that use time division scheduling where the source needs to transmit a certain amount of data to the destination in a fixed amount of time. We show how the intermediate nodes find the route distributively. This protocol takes into account the quality of the MIMO channels and allocates power to them so that the end-to-end transmission energy is minimized. The resulting protocol is easy to implement and provides the most energy efficient route and the power allocation for the data transmission. We perform simulations on Rayleigh-fading channels to show the significant energy benefits of the proposed route discovery protocol against a dynamic source routing (DSR)-based routing protocol with optimal power allocation.	end-to-end principle;mimo;rayleigh fading;rayleigh–ritz method;scheduling (computing);simulation;source routing	Kalle Lähetkangas;Marian Codreanu;Behnaam Aazhang	2015	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2015.2481217	wireless routing protocol;optimized link state routing protocol;enhanced interior gateway routing protocol;static routing;real-time computing;multi-user mimo;hierarchical routing;supernetwork;border gateway protocol;dsrflow;zone routing protocol;telecommunications;computer science;interior gateway protocol;dynamic source routing;resource management;distance-vector routing protocol;routing protocol;link-state routing protocol;path vector protocol;hazy sighted link state routing protocol;routing information protocol;wireless;statistics;computer network;mimo	Mobile	14.145264394945906	89.69004790638475	156955
5037efac5bcc46307170683fc693d47943f5b664	normal approximations for fading channels		Capacity and outage capacity characterize the maximum coding rate at which reliable communication is feasible when there are no constraints on the packet length. Evaluated for fading channels, they are important performance benchmarks for wireless communication systems. However, the latency of a communication system is proportional to the length of the packets it exchanges, so assuming that there are no constraints on the packet length may be overly optimistic for communication systems with stringent latency constraints. Recently, there has been great interest within the information theory community in characterizing the maximum coding rate for short packet lengths. Research on this topic is often concerned with asymptotic expansions of the coding rate with respect to the packet length, which then give rise to normal approximations. In this paper, we review existing normal approximations for single-antenna Rayleigh block-fading channels and compare them with the high-SNR normal approximation we presented at the 2017 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (Lancho, Koch, and Durisi, 2017). We further discuss how these normal approximations may help to assess the performance of communication protocols.

The rule defines a ratio of item occurrences in a schedule, which minimizes the mean serving time. However, the actual number of each item's occurrences must be an integer. Therefore, the square root rule assumes large schedules, in order for the ratio to hold with acceptable precision. The present paper introduces an analysis-derived formula which connects the mean serving time and the size of the schedule. The relation shows that small schedules can also achieve near-optimal serving times. The analysis is validated through comparison with simulation and brute force-derived results. Finally, it is shown that minimizing the size of the schedule is also an efficient way of optimizing the aggregate scheduling cost.	aggregate data;brute-force search;schedule (computer science);scheduling (computing);simulation	Christos Liaskos;Georgios I.

In this article, we first introduce random access procedure in LTE-A. Then we address the issue of RACH overload coming from massive number of MTC devices. To resolve RAN overload, several easy-to-implement RAN level solutions are proposed. Based on simulation of MTC in Long Term Evolution- Advanced (LTE-A) architecture, we compare the overload resolution capability of different overload resolution mechanisms and conclude with observations for further solution design.	compaq lte;function overloading;network congestion;performance evaluation;radio access network;random access;simulation	Ming-Yuan Cheng;Guan-Yu Lin;Hung-Yu Wei;Alex Chia-Chun Hsu	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)	10.1109/WCNCW.2012.6215499	radio access network;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computer security;random access;computer network	Mobile	21.12128478486126	90.50737304315176	157995

Such scenarios often involve numerous wireless stations connected to a shared channel, and contention for the channel significantly affects the performance in such networks. Wi-Fi HaLow contains numerous solutions aimed at handling the contention between stations, two of which, namely, the Centralized Authentication Control (CAC) and the Distributed Authentication Control (DAC), address the contention reduction during the link set-up process. The link set-up process is special because the access point knows nothing of the connecting stations and its means of control of these stations are very limited. While DAC is self-adaptive, CAC does require an algorithm to dynamically control its parameters. Being just a framework, the Wi-Fi HaLow standard neither specifies such an algorithm nor recommends which protocol, CAC or DAC, is more suitable in a given situation. In this paper, we solve both issues by developing a novel robust close-to-optimal algorithm for CAC and compare CAC and DAC in a vast set of experiments.	acclimatization;algorithm;authentication;capture effect;centralized computing;common access card;equilibrium;experiment;fastest;flexibility index;flow;handling (psychology);hotspot (wi-fi);increment;interference (communication);internet of things;load balancing (computing);lupus erythematosus cell;mathematical optimization;national fund for scientific research;network performance;performance evaluation;randomness;sap business one;simulation;snup;time complexity;uptime;wireless access point;exponential	Dmitry Bankov;Evgeny M.

We take systematic Raptor codes as an example for analyzing the optimum performance of the HARQ scheme. The results show that the optimum performance can be obtained by combining the optimum HARQ and FEC. Additionally, the simulation results show that the proposed optimization framework can be used for evaluating the tight lower bound performance of the HARQ, which indicates that it is suitable for designing optimum HARQ scheme with guaranteeing the target quasi-error free delivery requirements very well.	forward error correction;greedy algorithm;hybrid automatic repeat request;internet access;mathematical optimization;multicast;raptor code;real-time clock;requirement;simulation	Guoping Tan;Saisai Ma;Defu Jiang;Yueheng Li;Lili Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214108	hybrid automatic repeat request;greedy algorithm;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;wireless network;statistics;computer network	Mobile	16.102420624274224	95.56498791786854	158501

In fact, D2D can be exploited for different proximity-based services (ProSe) where the users discover their neighbors and benefit form different services like social applications, advertisement, public safety, and warning messages. In such a scenario, the aim is to manage in a proper way the radio spectrum and the energy consumption to provide high Quality of Experience (QoE) and better Quality of Services (QoS). To reach this goal, in this paper we propose a novel D2D-based uploading scheme in order to decrease the amount of radio resources needed to upload to the eNodeB a certain multimedia content. As a further improvement, the proposed scheme enhances the energy consumption of the users in the network, without affects the content uploading time. The obtained results show that our scheme achieves a gain of about 35% in term of mean radio resources used with respect to the standard LTE cellular approach. In addition, it is also 40 times more efficient in terms of energy consumption needed to upload the multimedia content.	compaq lte;upload	Leonardo Militano;Antonino Orsino;Giuseppe Araniti;Antonella Molinaro;Antonio Iera;Li Wang	2015	2015 IEEE International Symposium on Broadband Multimedia Systems and Broadcasting	10.1109/BMSB.2015.7177242	simulation;telecommunications link;telecommunications;radio resource management;resource management;computer network	Mobile	23.24731281829041	91.48511833882014	158510

Further, CSMA random access scheme is employed and the SINR model is used to simulate a successful transmission. We first give a sufficient condition on the transmit power required for the CSMA network to be asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) connected as n → ∞ under the SINR model. Then, we demonstrate constructively that a throughput of Θ(1/(n log2 n)1/3) is obtainable by each node for an arbitrarily chosen destination.	binary logarithm;interference (communication);random access;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;throughput	Tao Yang;Guoqiang Mao;Wei Zhang	2012	2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2012.6364131	signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;channel access method;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computational complexity theory;computer network	Robotics	15.291642665704362	88.66383921095328	158588

Hence, this rapid increase in Machine Type Communications (MTC) poses a challenge on cellular operators to support M2M communications without hindering the existing Quality of Service for already established Human-to-Human (H2H) communications. LTE-M is one of the candidates to support M2M communications in Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular networks. In this paper, we appraise and present an in depth performance evaluation of LTE-M based on cross-layer network metrics. Compared with LTE Category 0 previously released by 3GPP for MTC, simulation results show that LTE-M offers additional advantages to meet M2M communication needs in terms of wider coverage, lower throughput, and a larger number of machines connected through LTE network. However, we show that LTE-M is not yet up to the level to meet future applications requirements regarding a near-zero latency and an advanced Quality of Service (QoS) for this massive number of connected Machine Type devices (MTDs).	algorithm;compaq lte;futures studies;internet of things;machine to machine;naive bayes classifier;network packet;network performance;performance evaluation;quality of service;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;telecommunications link;throughput;transmitter	Samir Dawaliby;Abbas Bradai;Yannis Pousset	2016	2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)	10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763264	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;lte advanced;operating system;computer security;internet of things;computer network	Mobile	22.261784092628826	88.9096030960389	159156

This paper explores coordinated usage of multiple radios (e.g., LTE and WiFi) to improve quality of service (QoS) in multi- radio heterogeneous networks. We focus on heterogeneous network deployments based on co- located WiFi-LTE small cells that allow for tighter multi-radio coordination. To evaluate QoS enhancements, we consider on-time throughput, a metric that captures the deliverable data rate for traffic with delay deadlines. A QoS-aware scheduling algorithm is designed to optimize on-time throughput. Cross-RAT coordination schemes are also explored to further enhance QoS. Through combining the QoS-aware scheduling algorithm and intelligent radio link assignment, we observe significant improvement in per user on-time throughput. Our results indicate that tightly coupled integrated LTE-WiFi small cell architectures can significantly increase the number of user achieving their targeted QoS.	algorithm;compaq lte;data rate units;hall-effect thruster;quality of service;scheduling (computing);throughput	Shu-ping Yeh;Ali Y.

Delayed Wi-Fi offloading is the concept to shift the delay-tolerant mobile traffic from cellular networks to Wi-Fi networks at the cost of additional delay. Existing studies mainly focused on a single-flow management or a multi-flow case without specified deadlines. In this paper, we address a multi-flow offloading problem in which a mobile user has multiple traffic flows whose loads and deadlines are different. More precisely, we formulate a multi-flow rate control based on a discrete and finite-horizon Markov decision problem. We develop a dynamic programming (DP)-based optimal rate control algorithm to maximize user satisfaction defined as offloading efficiency minus disutility due to deadline violations. Moreover, we propose a threshold-based rate control algorithm which requires low-complexity and low-memory but achieves high performance. Trace driven simulations based on measurements show that our proposed algorithms achieve high user satisfaction compared to existing algorithms.	algorithm;decision problem;dynamic programming;markov chain;simulation;utility	Yeongjin Kim;Joohyun Lee;Jaeseong Jeong;Song Chong	2016	2016 International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN)	10.1109/ICOIN.2016.7427076	real-time computing;mobile telephony;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;mobile computing;server;computer network	Mobile	21.13706222822638	95.74921317700657	159519

In our work, we propose and compare two different opportunistic channel access schemes. The first scheme applies when the secondary user (SU) has access to only one channel. The second scheme applies when the SU has access to multiple channels but can at a given time monitor and access only one channel. Two switching strategies, namely the switch and examine and the switch and stay strategies, are proposed. For these proposed access schemes, we investigate their performance by deriving the analytical expression of the novel metric of the average access duration and the average waiting time and based on these two metrics a time average SU throughput formula is proposed to predict the performance of the secondary cognitive system.	artificial intelligence;cognitive radio;throughput;transceiver	Fakhreddine Gaaloul;Hong-Chuan Yang;Redha M.

We study here the combined problem of scheduling and power control, where we seek both an assignment of power settings and a partition of the links so that each set satisfies the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) constraints.  We give an algorithm that attains an approximation ratio of O(log n ċ log log Δ), where n is the number of links and Δ is the ratio between the longest and the shortest link length. Under the natural assumption that lengths are represented in binary, this gives the first approximation ratio that is polylogarithmic in the size of the input. The algorithm has the desirable property of using an oblivious power assignment, where the power assigned to a sender depends only on the length of the link. We give evidence that this dependence on Δ is unavoidable, showing that any reasonably behaving oblivious power assignment results in a Ω(log log Δ)-approximation.  These results hold also for the (weighted) capacity problem of finding a maximum (weighted) subset of links that can be scheduled in a single time slot. In addition, we obtain improved approximation for a bidirectional variant of the scheduling problem, give partial answers to questions about the utility of graphs for modeling physical interference, and generalize the setting from the standard 2-dimensional Euclidean plane to doubling metrics. Finally, we explore the utility of graph models in capturing wireless interference.	approximation algorithm;catastrophic interference;interference (communication);order of approximation;period-doubling bifurcation;polylogarithmic function;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Magnús M.

In this paper, we analyze the performance of Time domain based detection (TDD) and Space domain based detection (SDD) (6) of clone attacks in mobile ad hoc networks in terms of detection ratio and time. The study shows that TDD and SDD utilizes network resource efficiently and achieves great scalability and robust detection performance compared with existing schemes. In particular, the storage overhead of sensors is independent of the network size, and is evenly distributed across the network. Moreover, it only takes limited communication overhead to verify the validity of any node. In addition to the analysis, we also propose simulation study for clone attack detection. According to our proved theorems, TDD and SDD enable users to detect clones in an efficient and effective manner in the network.	lego digital designer;test-driven development	Dapeng Wang;Pei Li;Pengfei Hu;Kai Xing;Yang Wang;Liusheng Huang;Yanxia Rong	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-31869-6_46	real-time computing;mobile ad hoc network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	11.179888506220177	90.01812803201328	160194
7915c58ecacf1b1f5065fcc5d98de0f410990bfa	adaptive traffic signal control with network-wide coordination		Today, Traffic congestion has become an increasingly serious problem. Efficient adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) is a challenging issue in the road network. The existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) schemes do not have satisfactory performance due to the difficulty of coordination between agents and the delay consequence of reward function. In this paper, we present an novel adaptive traffic signal control scheme in the urban road network based on MARL. In the scheme, we adopt a delay time estimation model with network-wide coordination to estimate the total delay time of vehicles for each road link, and control traffic signals adaptively based on the estimated delay time with traffic flow data. We conduct comprehensive simulations using large-scale data collected from real world systems to evaluate the performance of our design, especially under heavy traffic pressure. The results show that our scheme can significantly alleviate the road congestion as well as improving the road network throughput and reducing the vehicles delay time.	atsc standards;mathematical optimization;multi-agent system;network congestion;organizing (structure);reinforcement learning;self-organization;simulation;throughput;world-system	Yong Chen;Juncheng Yao;Chunjiang He;Hanhua Chen;Hai Jin	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-65482-9_12	computer science;throughput;real-time computing;distributed computing;traffic flow;reinforcement learning;multi-agent system;traffic congestion	Mobile	12.059609278767224	98.0414934194498	160442

Next, specific research issues are proposed and discussed with three prominent examples on distributed source coding with packet aggregation, distributed cooperative diversity and distributed cooperative localization.

The first network consists of n randomly distributed primary users, which form an ad hoc network. The second network again consists of m randomly distributed ad hoc secondary users or cognitive users. The primary users have priority access to the spectrum and do not need to change their communication protocol in the presence of the secondary users. The secondary users, however, need to adjust their protocol based on knowledge about the locations of the primary users to bring little loss to the primary network's throughput. By introducing preservation regions around primary receivers, a modified multihop routing protocol is proposed for the cognitive users. Assuming m=nβ with β >; 1, it is shown that the secondary network achieves almost the same throughput scaling law as a stand-alone network while the primary network throughput is subject to only a vanishingly small fractional loss. Specifically, the primary network achieves the sum throughput of order n1/2 and, for any δ >; 0, the secondary network achieves the sum throughput of order m1/2-δ with an arbitrarily small fraction of outage. Thus, almost all secondary source-destination pairs can communicate at a rate of order m-1/2-δ.	cognitive network;communications protocol;downtime;hoc (programming language);image scaling;metcalfe's law;randomness;routing;scalability;secondary source;throughput	Sang-Woon Jeon;Natasha Devroye;Mai H.

The level of interference experienced by the mesh nodes rises when the network becomes more connected and the number of radios per node increases. To mitigate interference experienced by the wireless mesh nodes while taking advantage from the multi-channel network aspect, we propose a novel Interference-aware Game based Channel Assignment algorithm, named IGCA. We prove through simulations that our proposed algorithm contributes in alleviating the node interference degree, fairly allocates interfaces to network non-overlapping channels and increases simultaneous transmissions in the network. An improvement up to 50% of both interference degree and simultaneous connections is particularly observed in comparison with a prominent existing approach - the Near-optimal Partially Overlapping Channel Assignment algorithm.	abcd schema;algorithm;ambiguous name resolution;catastrophic interference;game theory;interference (communication);mesh networking;simulation;wireless mesh network	Amira Bezzina;Mouna Ayari;Rami Langar;Guy Pujolle;Leïla Azouz Saïdane	2014	2014 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)	10.1109/WD.2014.7020816	wireless mesh network;switched mesh;telecommunications;computer science;shared mesh;distributed computing;order one network protocol;computer network	Mobile	17.019994290733067	89.89441764953554	161220
cbb268ca28e7a403676a0188bc8ead83e65ac0a3	hybrid network coding scheme in cognitive radio networks with multiple secondary users		In order to realize a variety of intelligent applications, a large number of devices need to collect and transmit potentially large amounts of data through the Internet of Things. However, with the explosive growth of communication devices, spectrum resources are becoming more and more scarce, which in turn makes it impossible to send information in time. Cognitive radio technology is an effective way to resolve spectrum allocation shortages, while the spatiotemporal uncertainty of spectrum has a great influence on the secondary user (SU)’s throughput. In this paper, we investigate the network coding scheme in cognitive radio networks under multiple primary and SU relationships, including non-collaboration, collaboration, and lease. Moreover, we propose a hybrid network coding scheme to improve the utilization efficiency of idle spectrum. In particular, the successful transmission rate and the packet loss rate can be increased and decreased through redundant coding, respectively. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve a better performance in terms of both delay and throughput than the existing mechanisms.	cognitive radio;frequency allocation;hearing loss, high-frequency;internet of things;linear network coding;myocardial diseases, secondary;neoplasm metastasis;network packet;simulation;throughput	Shiji Mei;Bing Chen;Feng Hu;Zhenzhou Ma	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877219	computer network;linear network coding;throughput;frequency allocation;economic shortage;packet loss;transmitter;cognitive radio;idle;computer science	Networks	11.377969344970275	88.99971830608177	161583

To improve the efficiency of Wi-Fi networks in dense deployment, a novel amendment to the Wi-Fi standard, namely IEEE 802.11ax introduces Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). In contrast to legacy Wi-Fi, where performance of a station to a considerable degree depends on rate control, aggregation and other decision-making algorithms implemented at the station, in 11ax networks it is the access point that schedules channel time and specifies transmission parameters for both uplink and downlink. Although OFDMA scheduling in 11ax has much in common with that in cellular networks, e.g. LTE, 11ax has some peculiarities, especially for uplink transmission. Focusing on such peculiarities, in this paper, we investigate the scheduling problem in 11ax, propose a set of schedulers for 11ax, compare their performance and determine the gain achievable by the usage of OFDMA.	algorithm;apollonian network;compaq lte;internet;propagation constant;quality of service;scheduling (computing);shortest remaining time;software deployment;telecommunications link;wireless access point	Dmitry Bankov;Andre Didenko;Evgeny M.

We show that, by extending the underlying algebraic and graphical structures of sum product algorithm, it also provides a unifying perspective for important distributed algorithms in communication networks. Examples treated here include Bellman-Ford (1957, 1962) routing, traffic shaping, wireless network power control, and congestion control. Through local message passing in the form of sum product algorithm on graphs, each of these network control algorithms solves a corresponding global optimization problem. This common framework also leads to new distributed algorithms, such as joint optimization of power control and utility maximization through distributed gradient descent.	algorithm;belief propagation	Mung Chiang	2002		10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1189060	gradient descent;distributed algorithm;message passing;channel code;telecommunications;power control;computer science;theoretical computer science;wireless network;machine learning;distributed computing;network congestion;bayesian inference;traffic shaping;channel capacity;statistics;computer network	Theory	15.434248161350192	92.25648197981666	162291

Our meta-protocol approach is capable of performing on-line optimization of critical MAC parameters without knowing in advance what network conditions wil l arise or how they may fluctuate over time. Furthermore, this dynamic optimization is achieved without any centralized control or exchange of control messages between nodes. The power of the new technique is demonstrated by two examples. In a LAN environment, it outperforms traditional contention based MAC protocols that adjust retransmission probabilities, e.g., employing binary exponential backoff. In a synchronous multi-hop environment, it automatically converges to the proper transmission schedule assignments for the actual node density.	access control;algorithm;centralized computing;dynamic programming;exponential backoff;mathematical optimization;online and offline;oracle rac;quantum fluctuation;retransmission (data networks);time complexity	András Faragó;Andrew D.

A classically """"fair” allocation leads to poor throughput performance for all flows because connections that traverse a large number of hops (i.e., long connections) consume a disproportionate share of resources. However, naïvely biasing against longer connections can lead to poor network utilization, because a significantly high fraction of total connections are long in large networks with spatially uniform traffic. While proportional fair allocation provides a significant improvement, we show here that there is a much richer space of resource allocation strategies for introducing a controlled bias against resource-intensive long connections in order to significantly improve the performance of shorter connections. Specifically, mixing strongly biased allocations with fairer allocations leads to efficient network utilization as well as a superior trade-off between flow throughput and fairness. We present an analytical model that offers insight into the impact of a particular resource allocation strategy on network performance, taking into account finite network size and spatial traffic patterns. We point to protocol design options to implement our resource allocation strategies by invoking the connection with the well-studied network utility maximization framework.

In particular we consider streaming traffic induced requirements such as avoiding buffer underflows, which significantly complicate the control problem compared to guaranteeing throughput optimality only. Since state-of-the-art approaches for enforcing minimum buffer constraints in broadcast networks are not suitable for application in general networks we argue for a cost function based approach, which combines throughput optimality with flexibility regarding service constraints. New theoretical stability results are presented and various candidate cost functions are investigated concerning their suitability for use in wireless networks with streaming media traffic. Furthermore we show how the cost function based approach can be used to aid wireless network design with respect to important system parameters. The performance is demonstrated using numerical simulations.	computer simulation;loss function;network planning and design;numerical analysis;queueing theory;randomized algorithm;requirement;streaming media;throughput	Martin Kasparick;Gerhard Wunder	2012	2012 50th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)	10.1109/Allerton.2012.6483209	real-time computing;wireless wan;numerical analysis;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;queueing theory;algorithm;statistics;computer network	EDA	16.15087277883378	96.25276090709367	163384

In this work, we study mobile device-to-device (D2D) video distribution that leverages the storage and communication capacities of smartphones. In such a mobile distributed framework, D2D communication represents an opportunistic process to selectively store and transmit local videos to meet the future demand of others. The performance is measured by the service time, which denotes the elapsed period for fulfilling the demand, and the corresponding implementation of each device depends on the video’s demand, availability, and size. The main contributions of this work lie in (1) considering the impact of video size in a practical mobile D2D video distribution scenario and proposing a general global estimation of the video distribution based on limited and local observations; (2) designing a purely distributed D2D video distribution scheme without the monitoring of any central controller; and (3) providing a practical implementation of the scheme, which does not need to know the video availability, user demand, and device mobility.

Recent reports show that most available spectrum has been allocated. While some of the spectrum bands (e.g., unlicensed band, GSM band) have seen increasingly crowded usage, most of the other spectrum resources are underutilized. This drives the emergence of open spectrum and dynamic spectrum access concepts, which allow unlicensed users equipped with cognitive radios to opportunistically access the spectrum not used by primary users. Cognitive radio has many advanced features, such as agilely sensing the existence of primary users and utilizing multiple spectrum bands simultaneously. However, in practice such capabilities are constrained by hardware cost. In this paper, we discuss how to conduct efficient spectrum management in ad hoc cognitive radio networks while taking the hardware constraints (e.g., single radio, partial spectrum sensing and spectrum aggregation limit) into consideration. A hardware-constrained cognitive MAC, HC-MAC, is proposed to conduct efficient spectrum sensing and spectrum access decision. We identify the issue of optimal spectrum sensing decision for a single secondary transmission pair, and formulate it as an optimal stopping problem. A decentralized MAC protocol is then proposed for the ad hoc cognitive radio networks. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed protocol.	approximation;cognitive radio;emergence;full-spectrum light;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);optimal stopping;process (computing);simulation;throughput	Juncheng Jia;Qian Zhang;Xuemin Shen	2008	IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications	10.1109/JSAC.2008.080110	cognitive radio;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network;bandwidth allocation	Mobile	22.58245557913567	91.23547368080536	164219

In this paper, we study a proactive defense mechanism against jamming in multi-hop relay networks, in which one or more network sources introduce a deceptive network flow along a disjoint routing path. The deceptive mechanism leverages strategic jamming behaviors, causing the attacker to expend resources on targeting deceptive flows and thereby reducing the impact on real network traffic. We use a two-stage game model to obtain deception strategies at Stackelberg equilibrium for selfish and altruistic nodes. The equilibrium solutions are illustrated and corroborated through a simulation study.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;flow network;jam;nash equilibrium;network congestion;network traffic control;radio jamming;relay;routing;simulation;throughput;utility	Andrew Clark;Quanyan Zhu;Radha Poovendran;Tamer Basar	2012		10.1007/978-3-642-34266-0_10	wireless routing protocol;routing;static routing;dynamic source routing;link-state routing protocol;geographic routing	Networks	12.981263147640725	93.00647907435096	164430

Indeed, when the latter are called, the mobility management entity (MME), which records the TA in which the UE is registered, broadcasts a paging message in the UE's TA to determine the exact cell through which the call should be delivered. When a UE moves to a new TA, a TA update might be performed either to update the MME or the home subscriber server (HSS) depending on whether the move is intra-or inter-MME. TA update and paging result in a significant amount of signaling overhead. The TA design is usually optimized during the network planning phase. However, the mobility of UEs might turn the initial TA configuration inefficient requiring TA reconfiguration. In this paper we use the tabu search (TS) heuristic to solve TAs reconfiguration problem in LTE networks taking into consideration both signaling overhead and reconfiguration cost. We compare our solution with a variation of the genetic algorithm (GA) based solution found in the literature. Preliminary numerical results showed that the TS algorithm outperformed the GA due to the TS different memory mechanisms used to avoid moves that might lead to non-feasible solutions.	compaq lte;diversification (finance);genetic algorithm;heuristic;high-speed serial interface;ip multimedia subsystem;iteration;local optimum;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);paging;server (computing);software release life cycle;tabu search;token reconfiguration	Haïdar Safa;Nadine Ahmad	2015	2015 IEEE 29th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	10.1109/AINA.2015.241	real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;lte advanced;operating system;computer security;computer network	EDA	23.980171770482894	99.60408075399934	164437

To characterize the logical relationship between spatial contention constraints and transmit power, we formulate the joint power control and radio-channel assignment as a generalized disjunctive programming problem. The generalized Benders decomposition technique is applied for decomposing the radio-channel assignment (combinatorial constraints) and network resource allocation (continuous constraints) so that the problem can be solved efficiently. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution within a finite number of iterations. We have evaluated our scheme using traces collected from two wireless testbeds and simulation studies in Qualnet. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is superior to existing schemes in providing larger interference margin, and reducing outage and packet loss probabilities.	algorithm;benders decomposition;converge;disjunctive normal form;downtime;experiment;heart rate variability;interference (communication);iteration;network packet;numerical analysis;provisioning;requirement;simulation;testbed;tracing (software)	Cunqing Hua;Rong Zheng	2012	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2011.99	mathematical optimization;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	18.085397291476028	94.02993791501245	164751

While previous work has considered the unicast case where each transmission has one sender and one receiver, we consider the setting of multicast requests where each transmission has one sender and a set of receivers. A set of multicast transmissions can be scheduled in the same round if the SINR at all receivers is above a certain threshold. The goal is to minimise the number of rounds. Building on the relationship between SINR scheduling and unit disk graph colouring established by Halldórsson (ESA 2009), we present an O(logΓ )-approximation algorithm for multicast scheduling in the SINR model, where Γ is the ratio of the longest to the shortest link length, considering only the longest link of each multicast request. The algorithm uses uniform power assignment and can be implemented online. We also compare the model of atomic multicasts (where all receivers of a multicast must receive the transmission in the same round) to the model of splittable multicasts (where a multicast sender can transmit in several rounds, each time serving a subset of its receivers). Furthermore, we consider the throughput maximisation problem and obtain an O(logΓ )-competitive randomised online algorithm and show that every deterministic algorithm, even for unicast links and using arbitrary power assignments, has competitive ratio Ω(logΓ ).	apx;approximation algorithm;automaton;best, worst and average case;competitive analysis (online algorithm);deterministic algorithm;esa;graph coloring;heuristic (computer science);icalp;interference (communication);international conference on information processing in sensor networks;interrupt latency;lecture notes in computer science;multicast;online algorithm;online and offline;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;springer (tank);throughput;unicast;unit disk graph	Thomas Erlebach;Tom Grant	2010		10.1007/978-3-642-16988-5_5	competitive analysis;online algorithm;unit disk graph;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;combinatorics;real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;source-specific multicast;xcast;computer network	ECom	16.10248444058752	90.40672186625437	165131

As available networks increase in quantity and overlapping coverage, a user's selection for connection becomes increasingly influential in the quality of their experience. In order for users to make effective decisions for their needs, they must be provided with information on these networks. In this work, we present NetView, a mobile application to acquire and present users with information based on their own usage context to make these informed decisions. Deployment of NetView in a university campus setting is used to demonstrate how user location and historical readings may be used with current network strength readings to shape policies for network selection.	automatic control;experiment;mobile app;network performance;portable document format;requirement;software deployment;user experience	Colin Brennan;Petros Spachos	2018	"""2018 IEEE 19th International Symposium on """"A World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks"""" (WoWMoM)"""	10.1109/WoWMoM.2018.8449741	computer network;software deployment;humanoid robot;distributed computing;user-centered design;computer science	Mobile	13.232716089276671	100.33192716287274	165278

Previously, some works addressed the problem by taking into account primary factors, such as propagation delay of control paths and capacity of controllers. Here, the problem is addressed from a novel standpoint of energy consumption, which is modeled as a binary integer program (BIP). In the BIP model, the energy consumption of the network that serves for the control traffic is minimized under the constraints of the delay of control paths and the load of controllers. In consideration of the high complexity of the BIP in large networks, a genetic heuristic algorithm is designed to find an effective sub-optimal solution. Simulation results show that the energy consumption of the heuristic algorithm is close to that of the BIP solution. No more than 4%, additional links are used by the heuristic algorithm if all the links have the same energy consumption.	control plane;distributed control system;forwarding plane;genetic algorithm;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming;operand forwarding;propagation delay;simulation;software propagation;software-defined networking	Ying Hu;Tao Luo;Norman C.

In majority of tag anti-collision algorithm, Dynamic Framed Slotted Aloha (DFSA) has been employed as a popular collision resolution algorithm to share the medium when multiple tags respond to the reader's signal command. According to previous works, the performance of DFSA algorithm is optimal when the frame size equals to the number of un-identified tags inside the interrogation zone. However, based on our research results, when the frame size equals to number of tags, collision occurs frequently, and this severely affects the system performance because it causes power consumption and longer tag reading time. Since the proper choice of the frame size has a great influence on overall system performance, in this paper we develop an analytical model to study the system throughput of DFSA based RFID systems, and then we use this model to search for an optimal frame size that maximizes the system throughput based on current number of un-identified tags. In addition to theoretical analysis, simulations are conducted to evaluate its performance. Comparing with the traditional DFSA anti-collision algorithm, the simulation results show that the proposed scheme reaches better performance with respect to the tag collision probability and tag reading time.	algorithm	Der-Jiunn Deng;Hsuan-Wei Tsao	2011	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-010-0193-3	radio-frequency identification;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance	Mobile	10.217641787359113	94.06987400565674	165867
5a23c3406b7b058ccb017b6891b537844e5b8f0b	dynamic power allocation and user scheduling for power-efficient and low-latency communications		In this paper, we propose a joint dynamic power control and user pairing algorithm for powerefficient and low-latency hybrid multiple access systems. In a hybrid multiple access system, user pairing determines whether the transmitter should serve a certain user by orthogonal multiple access (OMA) or non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The proposed optimization framework minimizes the longterm time-average transmit power expenditure while reducing the queueing delay and satisfying timeaverage data rate requirements. The proposed technique observes channel and queue state information and adjusts queue backlogs to avoid an excessive queueing delay by appropriate user pairing and power allocation. Further, user scheduling for determining the activation of a given user link as well as flexible use of resources are captured in the proposed algorithm. Data-intensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme guarantees an end-to-end delay smaller than 1 ms with high power-efficiency and high reliability, based on the short frame structure designed for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC).	algorithm;data rate units;end-to-end principle;interrupt latency;mathematical optimization;oma;queuing delay;requirement;scheduling (computing);simulation;transmitter	Minseok Choi;Joongheon Kim;Jaekyun Moon	2018	CoRR		transmitter power output;dynamic demand;real-time computing;scheduling (computing);latency (engineering);queue;queueing theory;communication channel;computer science;pairing	Mobile	23.781262887170797	93.23834454658108	165882

We look on the relation between the PHY layer budding blocks (FEC blocks ) and the allocation of MAC level frames (PDUs) over these FEC blocks. In particular, we show how to transmit a given amount of MAC level data bits over a given Burst in order to maximize the number of successfully transmitted data bits in the Burst. We also compute, given an amount of data bits to transmit, what is the Burst size that maximizes each of the following three performance criterion: the number of successfully transmitted data bits in the Burst, the maximum ratio between the number of successfully transmitted data bits to the Burst size, and the number of successfully transmitted data bits per PHY slot. For the first problem the paper shows how to optimally divide the Burst into PDUs and shows that sometimes it is more efficient to use less reliable Modulation/Coding schemes. For the second problem the paper shows that using the PHY slots efficiently is the best criterion to consider.	download;forward error correction;modulation;phy (chip)	Oran Sharon;Gassan Tabajah;Yaron Alpert	2012	Physical Communication	10.1016/j.phycom.2012.09.002	wimax;4b5b;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;scheduling;goodput;computer network	Metrics	11.148476262458171	94.89920110173863	165945

The goal of our algorithm is to maximize the throughpu t or maximize the minimum ratio between the flow and the demand. Our algorithm partitions the links into buckets. Every buck et consists of a set of links that have nearly equivalent reception powers. We denote the number of nonempty buckets by σ. Our algorithm obtains an approximation ratio of O(σ · logn), wheren denotes the number of nodes. For the case of linear powersσ = 1, hence the approximation ratio of the algorithm is O(log n). This is the first practical approximation algorithm for linear powers with a n pproximation ratio that depends only onn (and not on the max-to-min distance ratio). If the transmission power of each link is part of the input (an d rbitrary), thenσ = O(log Γ + log∆), whereΓ denotes the ratio of the max-to-min power, and ∆ denotes the ratio of the max-tomin distance. Hence, the approximation ratio is O(log n · (log Γ + log∆)). Finally, we consider the case that the algorithm needs to ass ign powers to each link in a range [Pmin, Pmax]. An extension of the algorithm to this case achieves an appro ximation ratio ofO[(log n+ log log Γ) · (log Γ + log∆)].	approximation algorithm;maxima and minima;routing;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio	Guy Even;Yakov Matsri;Moti Medina	2011		10.1007/978-3-642-28209-6_16	mathematical optimization;combinatorics;data structure;#p-complete;computer science;theoretical computer science;wireless network;mathematics;programming language;computer network	Theory	16.144338066397047	90.32325299501827	166247

Understanding the mobile traffic is thus crucial to refine models and improve experiments. In this context, one has to understand the temporal activity of a user and the user movements. At the user scale, the usage is not only defined by the amount of calls but also by the user’s mobility. At a higher level, the base stations have a key role on the quality of service. In this paper, we analyze a very large Call Detail Records (CDR) over 12 months in Mexico. It contains 8 millions users ans 5 billions of call events. Our first contribution is the study call duration and inter-arrival time parameters. Then, we assess user movements between consecutive calls (switching from a station to another one). Our study suggests that user mobility is pretty dependent on user activity. Furthermore, we show properties of the inter-call mobility by making a analysis of the call distribution.	automatic call distributor;cyclostationary process;experiment;mobile app;palm os;point process;quality of service;simulation;spatial variability;stationary process;time complexity;time of arrival	Yannick Léo;Anthony Busson;Carlos Sarraute;Eric Fleury	2016	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2016.05.003	simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;mobility model;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	11.395984347521734	100.30380356088514	166719
fa2c4cc86bab1361ce582630bb5c1474a0133e80	delay analysis of a dynamic queue-based random access network		Motivated by design and performance challenges stemming from emerging applications in randomaccess networks, we focus on the performance of a dynamic two-user slotted-time ALOHA network with a general queue-dependent transmission policy. At the beginning of each slot, each user transmits a packet with a probability that depends on the number of stored packets at both user queues. If both stations transmit at the same slot a collision occurs, and both packets must be retransmitted in a later slot. Each user has external bursty arrivals that are stored in their infinite capacity queues. Arrival processes are independent of each other, but depend also on the state of the network at the beginning of a slot. In such a network of interacting queues, when a user transmits a packet, it causes interference to the nearby user and decreases its successful transmission probability. Each user is aware of the status of the network, and accordingly reconfigures its transmission parameters to improve the network performance. We investigate the ergodicity conditions, and use the generating function approach to investigate the queueing delay. Generating functions for the steady-state distribution are obtained by solving a finite system of linear equations and a functional equation with the aid of the theory of Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problems.	access network;ergodicity;giga-updates per second;interaction;interference (communication);linear equation;network packet;network performance;propagation constant;queuing delay;random access;slot a;steady state;stemming;system of linear equations	Ioannis Dimitriou	2018	CoRR		collision;ergodicity;functional equation;computer network;network packet;queueing theory;computer science;queue;network performance;random access	Networks	10.985817249845404	95.23988930374985	166731

However, due to mobility, the connections between a mobile user and mobile cloudlets can be intermittent. As a result, offloading actions taken by a mobile user may fail (e.g., the user moves out of transmission range of cloudlets). In this paper, we model and develop an optimal offloading algorithm for the mobile user, considering the users' local load and availability of cloudlets. We formulate and solve a Markov decision process (MDP) model to obtain an optimal policy for the mobile user with an objective to minimize the computation and offloading cost. The numerical results show that the proposed dynamic offloading algorithm outperforms conventional baseline schemes.	algorithm;baseline (configuration management);cloudlet;computation;computational complexity theory;emergence;iteration;iterative method;markov chain;markov decision process;mobile app;mobile cloud computing;numerical analysis;performance evaluation	Yang Zhang;Dusit Niyato;Ping Wang;Chen-Khong Tham	2014	2014 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2014.6883978	real-time computing;computer science;distributed computing;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	24.566238414469513	93.41087925116808	167007

This feature makes it practical to incorporate TOD into Lyapunov-based design of linear and nonlinear control systems, yielding a self-contained theory for system stabilization. In previous work, candidates for TOD realizations for single-hop (wired and wireless) networks have been proposed. However, it has been a hitherto open question whether TOD can be realized in wireless multihop networks. In fact, it is far from obvious how dynamic value-based competition with deterministically bounded maximum delay, as required by TOD, is achievable in wireless multihop networks. In this paper, we give a positive answer to this question, by presenting a functionally complete realization of TOD in wireless multihop networks. Our solution is based on highly accurate multihop tick synchronization, and applies an algorithm for collision-protected network-wide value arbitration with deterministic delay. We provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of our solution on existing micro controller platforms, and assess our TOD realization in a batch reactor scenario.	algorithm;control system;experiment;functional completeness;lyapunov fractal;microcontroller;nonlinear system;quantization (signal processing);reactor (software);wireless router	Dennis Christmann;Reinhard Gotzhein;Stefan Siegmund;Fabian R.

Firstly, a brief state of the art of current cell-breathing techniques is provided. Afterwards a description of the system model is given followed by the algorithm description. The algorithm is executed in each BS of each cluster following a sequence, which is synchronized into the set of clusters. When a BS attempts to go to sleep mode, it tries to redistribute the traffic to its neighbors if it is not more loaded than any one of them. When the BS redistributes this traffic, it will prefer to send the traffic to the highest loaded neighbors first. The presented algorithm avoids a centralized coordination and initial setup load thresholds. Therefore single point failure problems are not a risk and a robust self-organized approach is provided. We compare the results of state-of-the-art algorithms with the ones of our algorithm and point out the drawbacks of the other algorithms.	algorithm;centralized computing;goto;self-organization;single point of failure;sleep mode	Luis Suarez;Loutfi Nuaymi;Jean-Marie Bonnin	2012	2012 International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)	10.1109/ISWCS.2012.6328386	synchronization;cellular network;distributed algorithm;failure analysis;real-time computing;cell breathing;telecommunications;network switch;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;cluster analysis;computer network	Robotics	21.582200953302717	93.04836987353248	167475

Despite the inherent difficulties of non-convexity and non-separability of variables in the original optimization problem, we are still able to obtain a decoupled and dual-decomposable convex formulation by applying an appropriate transformation and introducing some new variables. The objective is accomplished by the interaction and coordination among three sub-algorithms of the algorithm through the congestion prices. The convergence properties of the three sub-algorithms are also proved. Simulation results illustrate several other desirable properties of the proposed algorithm, including the impacts of node mobility and path and packet losses on convergence and robustness. This work is a preliminary attempt towards a systematic approach to jointly designing a congestion control sub-algorithm and a power control sub-algorithm coupled with a spectrum allocation sub-algorithm.

The interest evolves as a Markov chain whose transition probabilities depend on the action (display the ad or desist) in a time step. A unit reward is obtained if the ad is displayed and if the user clicks on the ad. If no ad is displayed then a fixed reward is assumed. The probability of click-through is determined by the state of the Markov chain. The recommender never gets to observe the state but in each time step it has a belief, denoted by πt, about the state of the Markov chain. πt evolves as a function of the action and the signal from each state. For the one-armed restless bandit with two states, we characterize the policy that maximizes the infinite horizon discounted reward. We first characterize the value function as a function of the system parameters and then characterize the optimal policies for different ranges of the parameters. We will see that the Gilbert-Elliot channel in which the two states have different success probabilities becomes a special case. For one special case, we argue that the optimal policy is of the threshold type with one threshold; extensive numerical results indicate that this may be true in general.	bellman equation;gilbert cell;markov chain;multi-armed bandit;numerical analysis;observable;recommender system;scheduling (computing)	Rahul Meshram;D.

However, since the typical approach to this problem requires optimizing over a space that is exponential in the number of links, the problem has appeared to be computationally intractable for all but small networks. In this paper, the problem of computing optimal bandwidth allocation is examined and a new approach is presented. While the resulting allocation cannot be guaranteed to be optimal, we find that in the networks where checking optimality is computationally feasible (i.e., networks with fewer than 23 links), the performance of the found allocation is indistinguishable from the optimal allocation. In essence, the proposed iterative scheme focuses on the space of useful bandwidth allocations. The Lagrange multipliers are used to find useful allocations.	bandwidth (signal processing);brute-force search;cobham's thesis;computation;computational complexity theory;entropy maximization;hop;iteration;lagrange multiplier;mathematical optimization;schedule (computer science);time complexity	Stephan Bohacek;Peng Wang	2007	IEEE INFOCOM 2007 - 26th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFCOM.2007.243	mathematical optimization;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;lagrange multiplier;dynamic bandwidth allocation;computer network	Robotics	16.587582388292443	94.08645201317195	168898

In this paper we explain how to set the optimal size of groups, based on results attained decades ago in random access systems. We then present a novel protocol, Partitioned Dynamic Frame Slotted Aloha (PDFSA), based on grouping, that, when adopting the best estimation mechanism, reaches an asymptotical efficiency up to 0.469. With a more practical estimate and a short initial phase, this protocol provides an efficiency above 0.420 for any value of the population size N, reaching 0.455 asymptotically.	asymptote;direction finding;random access	Luca Barletta;Flaminio Borgonovo;Matteo Cesana	2011	SoftCOM 2011, 19th International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks		telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	DB	10.851742502876533	93.5126912287108	169500

Contrarily to the IEEE 802.11 MAC scheme, all nodes adopt a common optimal contention window size for unicast and broadcast transmissions, which is based on a common view of the channel. In this way, the conditional collision probability is independent of the type of traffic (broadcast or unicast). Simulation results for different amounts of broadcast/unicast traffic indicate that our approach significantly outperforms IEEE 802.11, exhibiting broadcast aggregate throughput gains up to 40%. Moreover, the simulation results indicate that the probability of successful transmitting a broadcast frame can be also improved up to 50% and, as the number of nodes increase, broadcast frames can obtain approximately the same reliability and throughput achieved by IEEE 802.11 unicast frames.	aggregate data;approximation algorithm;broadcast domain;broadcasting (networking);hoc (programming language);jumbo frame;simulation;throughput;transmitter;unicast;whole earth 'lectronic link	Rodolfo Oliveira;Miguel Luís;Luís Bernardo;Rui Dinis	2012	IEEE Communications Letters	10.1109/LCOMM.2012.010512.111998	broadcast domain;wireless ad hoc network;broadcast radiation;atomic broadcast;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network;unicast	Mobile	12.42844580604142	90.47625490552183	170205

However, under this scheme, the channel usage may not be efficient because of the variability in the offered traffic. Different approaches such as channel borrowing (CB) and dynamic channel allocation (DCA) have been proposed to accommodate variable traffic. In this paper, we expand on the CB scheme and propose a new channel allocation scheme mobile-assisted connection-admission (MACA) algorithm to achieve load balancing in a cellular network. In this scheme, some special channels are used to connect mobile units from different cells; thus, a mobile unit, which is unable to connect to its own base station because it is in a heavily-loaded “hot” cell, may be able to get connected to its neighboring cold cell’s base station through a twohop link. We find that MACA can greatly improve the performance of a cellular network,	algorithm;load balancing (computing);spatial variability	Xiaoxin Wu;Biswanath Mukherjee;Shueng-Han Gary Chan	2000		10.1109/GLOCOM.2000.891862	channel allocation schemes;cellular network;control channel;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;base station;operating system;time division multiple access;computer network	Mobile	19.148970301607147	91.0669332279735	170324

We first propose a suite of generalized proportional allocation schemes that can be obtained by minimizing the information-theoretic function of relative entropy. We then optimize over the allocation parameters, which are usually design variables an engineer can directly vary, either for a particular user or for the worst-case user, under constraints that lower bound the allocated resources for all other users. Despite the nonlinearity in the objective and constraints, we show that this suite of resource allocation optimization can be efficiently solved for global optimality through a convex optimization technique called geometric programming. This general method and its extensions are applicable to a wide array of resource allocation problems, including processor sharing, congestion control, admission control, and wireless network power control. We provide a specific example of efficiently optimizing an admission control scheme.	mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system	Mung Chiang;Arak Sutivong	2003		10.1109/GLOCOM.2003.1258939	wireless ad hoc network;mathematical optimization;convex optimization;geometric programming;quality of service;power control;resource allocation;computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;kullback–leibler divergence;upper and lower bounds;network congestion;global optimization;computer network	Robotics	16.893089547003818	96.3858216532007	170520
211f4442d8cf34f40d300c80af3486211108baee	multi-dimensional radio service maps for position-based self-organized networks		Increasing spectral and energy efficiency in future networks requires flexible and timely allocation of radio resources along multiple dimensions including frequency, time and space. Although this multi-dimensionality offers additional degrees of freedom, it however comes at the cost of higher complexity. To this end, it is envisaged that spatial information associated with user resource allocation will provide a means for an efficient utilization of a dense radio access network (RAN) infrastructure in a proactive and self-optimized manner. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that aims at the utilization of multi-dimensional (MD) radio service maps (RSM) for storing and exploiting position-based information. Requirements, key concepts and functions are described. The potential gains in energy consumption and efficiency of the radio service maps are shown by means of numerical results for an ultra-dense network deployment scenario.	complexity;map;numerical analysis;radio access network;requirement;response surface methodology;self-organization;software deployment	Per Tengkvist;George P.

Driven by the pursuit of green communication, this paper presents a space-reserved cooperative caching scheme for IIoT in the fifth generation mobile heterogeneous networks, where the cache space in a base station is divided into two parts, one is used to store the prefetched data from the servers ahead of the device request time and the other is reserved to store the temporarily buffering data in the wireless transmission queue at the device request time. With the constraint that the quality of service is guaranteed, we propose an algorithm to obtain the optimal proportion between the two parts of the cache space for the purpose of reducing the average energy consumption. Simulation results verified that the proposed caching scheme is more efficient than the conventional one with respect to the average energy consumption.	algorithm;cache (computing);fifth generation computer;internet of things;quality of service;simulation	Peng Duan;Yunjian Jia;Liang Liang;Jonathan Rodriguez;Kazi Mohammed Saidul Huq;Guojun Li	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2018.2794615	real-time computing;computer science;wireless;heterogeneous network;energy consumption;cache;quality of service;queue;computer network;base station;server	Embedded	23.345643039739173	91.68498528712976	171130

Current research on connected vehicle networks focuses on delivering the data generated from or required by the vehicle networks themselves, of which the data traffic is light; thus, the vehicle-network resource utilization efficiency is low. On the other hand, a large amount of delay-tolerant traffic in other data networks consumes significant communication resources. In this paper, we introduce a new architecture of DaVe to utilize efficiently the potential resource from connected vehicles and to mitigate the congestion problem in other data networks. Delay-tolerant data traffic is offloaded from the data networks to the connected vehicle networks without extra infrastructure/hardware deployment. An optimal distributed data hopping mechanism is also proposed to enable delay-tolerant data routing over connected vehicle networks. We formulate the next-hop decision optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose a heuristic algorithm to reduce computational complexity. Extensive simulation results are also presented to demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed scheme.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;connected car;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;heuristic (computer science);markov chain;mathematical optimization;network congestion;optimization problem;partially observable markov decision process;partially observable system;routing;simulation;software deployment	Pengbo Si;Yu He;Haipeng Yao;Ruizhe Yang;Yanhua Zhang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2016.2550105	real-time computing;the internet;quality of service;resource allocation;computer science;engineering;distributed computing;markov process;distributed database;statistics;computer network;systems architecture	HPC	21.03578019797227	94.77501079833793	171238

An important point is that, although the inclusion of a new user impinges on the power adjustment of all mobiles in the network, this decision is made on the basis of information locally collected at the base stations only. We achieve this goal by an appropriate agglomeration of outer- and inner-cell interference, and an according dimensionality reduction scheme. The corresponding admission control algorithm applies an interference prediction phase prior to making a decision about accepting further customers to the wireless network. Capacity is exploited in that users are admitted whenever there is room to. Individual power constraints are included in our system model, which makes the resulting admission control algorithm widely applicable for practical purposes.	algorithm;dimensionality reduction;interference (communication);quality of service;requirement	Daniel Catrein;Rudolf Mathar	2006	IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference	10.1109/VTCF.2006.254	cellular network;code division multiple access;real-time computing;systems modeling;quality of service;capacity utilization;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;base station;operating system;wireless network;computer network	Mobile	24.502786608470405	98.82564503284848	171287

In an earlier paper [T.E. Klien and S.J. Han, March 12-14, 2003], we have investigated the system-wide performance of assignment strategies based on the users' profile information of velocity and amount of data to be transmitted. The optimal assignment strategies that minimize the average number of users in the system rely on knowledge of the cell capacities, the call arrival rates and the statistical description of the users' profiles. In realistic operating conditions, this knowledge may not be available and would typically be time-varying. In this paper, we propose adaptive and online assignment strategies that do not require any a priori knowledge, but still achieve the same performance as if such knowledge were available.	overlay network;profiling (computer programming)	Seung-Jae Han;Thierry E.

In the mobile RFID environment, consumers can obtain product-related information of tags by using readers which are installed in mobile phones. However, the tag collision problem is serious in this environment. This paper proposes a multiple-bits-slot reservation aloha protocol for handling this problem. In the protocol, the reader assigns reservation slots before allocating frame slots, and each tag generates a random sequence in its own reservation slot randomly selected by this tag to reserve a frame slot, then the reader efficiently captures the reservation collisions in reservation slots by Manchester coding. Accordingly, the protocol significantly reduces collision frame slots, and eliminates empty frame slots. Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed protocol outperforms other aloha-based protocols 1.	collision problem;communication complexity;communications protocol;computer simulation;frame language;mobile rfid;mobile phone;performance evaluation;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;randomness;tag (metadata)	Yihong Chen;Quanyuan Feng;Ma Zheng;Liu Tao	2013	IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics	10.1109/TCE.2013.6490246	stochastic process;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;encoding;statistics;computer network	Mobile	10.28326016842711	94.34841693629409	172063

The proposed hypergraph model can take the sum interference into account and, therefore, is more accurate as compared with the traditional binary graph model. Further, different from the global signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model, the hypergraph model preserves a localized graph-theoretic structure and, therefore, allows the existing graph-based efficient scheduling algorithms to be extended to the cumulative interference case. Finally, by adjusting certain parameters, the hypergraph can achieve a systematic tradeoff between the interference approximation accuracy and the user node coordination complexity during scheduling. As an application of the hypergraph model, we consider the performance of a simple distributed scheduling algorithm, i.e., maximal scheduling, in wireless networks. We propose a lower bound stability region for any maximal scheduler and show that it achieves a fixed fraction of the optimal stability region, which depends on the interference degree of the underlying hypergraph. We also demonstrate the interference approximation accuracy of hypergraphs in random networks and show that hypergraphs with small hyperedge sizes can model the interference quite accurately. Finally, the analytical performance is verified by simulation results.	algorithm;approximation;automated planning and scheduling;flow network;graph theory;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);maximal set;scheduling (computing);signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation	Qiao Li;Rohit Negi	2012	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2011.2176520	wireless ad hoc network;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	16.126406888597177	95.83326059649062	172091

The presented scheme enables nodes to independently agree on the appropriate channel for exchanging control packets required for networking protocols. If jamming is considered, the network can no longer rely on a predefined default channel. However, developing distributed protocols for adaptive default channel selection remains a difficult challenge as the restriction to local information exchange is in conflict with the need to coordinate on a channel. In our protocol, each node alternates between a channel probing-andselection state and a normal operation state. This protocol endows the network with the ability to self-reconfigure once jamming is detected. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme induce stable channel selections that result in satisfactory network connectivity and fast recovery.	communications protocol;hoc (programming language);information exchange;interference (communication);radio jamming	Jorge Barrera;Alfredo García	2009		10.1007/978-3-642-11723-7_45	wireless ad hoc network;communications protocol;information exchange;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;link access procedures, d channel;normal operator;computer network	Mobile	10.762710087975297	91.46934596051935	172289

These technologies support multiple data transmission rates. Transmitting at a lower data rate (by using a more resilient modulation scheme) increases the frame transmission time but reduces the hit error rate. In non-cooperative environments such as public hot-spots or WLANs operated by different enterprises that are physically close to each other, individual nodes attempt to maximize their achieved throughput by adjusting the data rate or frame size used, irrespective of the impact of this on overall system performance. In this paper, we show both analytically using a game theoretic model and through simulation that the existing 802.11 distributed MAC protocol, DCF (for distributed coordination function), as well as its enhanced version, which is being standardized at part of 802.11e, can lead non-cooperative nodes to undesirable Nash equilibriums, in which the wireless channel is inefficiently used. We show that by establishing independence between the allocation of the shared channel resource and the transmission strategies used by individual nodes, an ideal MAC protocol can lead rational nodes to arrive at equilibriums in which all competing nodes achieve higher throughputs tan with DCF.	data rate units;design rule for camera file system;game theory;modulation;nash equilibrium;os-tan;simulation;throughput	Godfrey Tan;John V.

In this paper, we consider practical models for power aware broadcast protocols. First, we employ a universal and widely-used statistic shadowing model for physical layer where nodes can only indefinitely communicate near the edge of the communication range. Second, we consider two MAC layer model: EER (end-to-end retransmission) and HHR (hop-by-hop retransmission). Third, omni-antennas and directional antennas are dealt with separately. Next, we improve the reception probability function proposed in (I. Stojmenovic et al., 2004) and analyze how to choose the transmission radius between transmission nodes and relay nodes to get the trade-off between maximizing probability of delivery and minimizing energy consumption. From our analysis based on practical models, we have derived the optimal transmission range.

01826596b252fa9b989304296d8e2243432ddb8d	on the performance of delay aware shared access with priorities		In this paper, we analyze a shared access network with a fixed primary node and randomly distributed secondary nodes whose distribution follows a Poisson point process (PPP). The secondaries use a random access protocol allowing them to access the channel with probabilities that depend on the queue size of the primary. Assuming a system with multipacket reception (MPR) receivers having bursty packet arrivals at the primary and saturation at the secondaries, our protocol can be tuned to alleviate congestion at the primary. We study the throughput of the secondary network and the primary average delay, as well as the impact of the secondary node access probability and transmit power. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the throughput of the secondary network under delay constraints for the primary node, which in the case that no congestion control is performed has a closed form expression providing the optimal access probability. Our numerical results illustrate the impact of network operating parameters on the performance of the proposed priority-based shared access protocol.	access network;mathematical optimization;minkowski portal refinement;network congestion;network packet;numerical analysis;optimization problem;point process;random access;randomness;throughput	Zheng Chen;Nikolaos Pappas;Marios Kountouris;Vangelis Angelakis	2016	CoRR		real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Networks	10.642999031945969	95.2382132153	172885

The dynamic code sharing technique supported multiple data users by temporarily granting access to dedicated channels. These techniques differed in terms of both complexity and performance guarantees.	quality of service	Carl Edward Fossa	2003			real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	21.89067827346988	93.40315508419768	173031

In the present paper, the distributed MxRRM architecture is studied, including the modelling of signalling, where intersystem cell load information can only be exchanged at certain events. Consequently, the distributed MxRRM entities have to base their decisions on potentially inaccurate load information. The system performance is investigated by simulation studies, where the results of distributed MxRRM scenarios are compared to two reference cases, 1) assuming ideal system information for MxRRM and 2) separated systems without any MxRRM functionality. Furthermore, an additional dedicated mechanism to exchange the load information aiming to improve the load information accuracy is investigated	ambient network;centralisation;channel capacity;distributed computing;dummy variable (statistics);entity;multi-standard television;quality of service;radio resource management;requirement;simulation;system information (windows)	Guihua Piao;Klaus David;Ingo Karla;Rolf Sigle	2006	2006 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2006.254215	radio access network;cognitive radio;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;radio resource management;computer performance;mobile computing;computer network	Arch	22.378745126112367	92.39161942408555	173745

Taking a holistic approach, we investigate the throughput of a CDMA network employing linear multiuser detection, type-I automatic retransmission request (ARQ), and packet combining. In particular, the following two models of CDMA data networks are considered. 1) Fixed-access CDMA data networks, by which we mean that the number of active users is fixed. The corresponding throughput is analyzed by using a one-dimensional Markov chain, and conditions for achieving the optimal throughput are explored. 2) Random-access CDMA data networks, in which we take into account the random arrivals/departures of users. By viewing the fixed-access network studied in the first case as a snapshot of the random-access network, we exploit the results therein to analyze the random-access network, under a processor-sharing system model. Moreover, we identify some important properties of the corresponding throughput and devise a simple recursive algorithm to find the throughput-optimal admission region. Some recent advances on large-system performance of various multiuser detection algorithms are employed in our study. The results in this paper quantitatively characterize the potential for network throughput gain by employing multiuser detection and packet combining, in both fixed-access and random-access CDMA packet data networks.	access control;access network;algorithm;blocking (computing);channel capacity;erlang (unit);fixed access;forward error correction;holism;markov chain;maximal set;multi-user;network packet;neural coding;numerical analysis;random access;random-access memory;recursion (computer science);retransmission (data networks);sensor;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;snapshot (computer storage);throughput	Ben Lu;Xiaodong Wang;Junshan Zhang	2004	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/TWC.0042.833498	code division multiple access;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;automatic repeat request;statistics;computer network	Mobile	13.803994229826596	94.31561422669431	174007

Broadcast capacity depends on factors such as topology, collisions, node failures and queueing delays that may be incurred during heavy load conditions. In our previous work, we studied the improvements in efficiency and collision reduction through the use of information coordination (IC) and communication coordination (CC) respectively. In this paper we extend our work in three aspects: (i) we look at a more realistic topology for sensor networks, a Poisson cluster process, (ii) we allow for variable transmission distances as an abstraction of power control, and (iii) messages have a limited dissemination range, implying that each message may only permeate up to a certain distance r from its originator. We quantify the additional improvement in broadcast capacity when power control is added to IC and CC. We also show that broadcast capacity greatly increases when the reach of the message is restricted irrespective of whether IC and/or CC are employed, however the penalty incurred is reduced coverage.	carpal tunnel syndrome;rs-232	Ananth V.

This network has the potential to provide many of the requirements that other previous systems did not achieve such as high data transfer rates, effectives user control, seamless mobility, and others which will potentially change the way users utilize mobile devices. NGWN will integrate a multitude of different heterogeneous networks including (a) cellular networks, passed through multiple generations—1G, 2G, 3G, and 3.5G; (b) wireless LANs, championed by the IEEE 802.11 wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks; and (c) broadband wireless access networks (IEEE 802.16, WiMAX). In this paper, a new adaptive quality of service (QoS) oriented CAC scheme is proposed to limit the occurrence of hard IEEE 802.11 WLAN-UMTS handovers to mobile users using real time (RT) applications. This scheme is hybrid, based on the service class differentiation, the location in the heterogeneous infrastructure and a vertical handoff decision function as well. Simulation results show that our policy achieves significant performance gains. It maximizes the utilization of the resources available at the WLAN cells, and meets as much as possible the QoS requirement of higher priority users. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In the future fourth-generation mobile communication systems, various access technologies will be integrated into a common platform called the open wireless architecture. SDR technology can be used to implement an OWA system. In a multihop SDR reconfigurable network that follows OWA standards, nodes may be reconfigured while they are working; however, if an error occurs during software dissemination, some nodes may not receive the software correctly, and the network is thus partitioned. Hence, it is very important to ensure that every node in the network can receive the software and update itself correctly.

These networks, however, do not only have to comply with increasing data rates, but they should also meet the societal green agenda. As the access part consumes a major fraction of the energy consumption in today’s fiber-to-the-home-based telecommunication networks, the energy efficiency of NGOA networks should be an important design parameter. In this paper, we present a detailed evaluation of the energy consumption in different NGOA technologies. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of (1) introducing low power modes (e.g., sleep and doze modes) in the various NGOA technologies and (2) using optimal split ratios adjusted to the traffic demands so that the energy consumption is optimized for the desired quality of service level.	10g-pon;access network;burst transmission;digital data;fiber to the x;forward error correction;internet access;pareto efficiency;passive optical network;picture transfer protocol;point-to-multipoint communication;quality of service;sleep mode;throughput;transceiver;wavelength-division multiplexing;yamaha xg	Bart Lannoo;Abhishek Dixit;Sofie Lambert;Didier Colle;Mario Pickavet	2015	Photonic Network Communications	10.1007/s11107-015-0504-4	telecommunications;efficient energy use;computer network	Metrics	21.349008135531825	88.92372503678399	175099

In particular, we investigate the control problem in low load and high load regimes. In the low load regime, we show that the network can be stabilized by a regulated maximal scheduling policy considering flow level dynamics if the offered load satisfies a constraining bound condition. Because maximal matching is a general scheduling rule whose implementation is not specified, we propose a constant-time and distributed scheduling algorithm for a general k-hop interference model which can approximate the maximal scheduling policy within an arbitrarily small error. Under the stability condition, we show how to calculate transmission rates for different user classes such that the long-term (time average) network utility is maximized. Our results imply that congestion control is unnecessary when the offered load is low and optimal user rates can be determined to maximize users' long-term satisfaction. In the high load regime where the network can be unstable under the regulated maximal scheduling policy, we propose the cross-layer congestion control and scheduling algorithm which can stabilize the network under arbitrary network load. Through numerical analysis for some typical networks, we show that the proposed scheduling algorithm has much lower overhead than other existing queue-length-based constant-time scheduling schemes in the literature, and it achieves performance much better than the guaranteed bound. In addition, using congestion control in the low load condition results in much lower average utility compared to that due to the optimal transmission rate derived in the paper.	approximation algorithm;control theory;interference (communication);matching (graph theory);maximal set;network congestion;network utility;numerical analysis;overhead (computing);scheduling (computing);transmission (bittorrent client)	Long Bao Le;Ravi Mazumdar	2008	2008 42nd Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems	10.1109/CISS.2008.4558650	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;wireless network;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;scheduling;computer network	Networks	16.203304066244307	96.42320319627567	175621

However, the realization of these paradigms entails several difficulties such as self-organization of unlicensed users, self-regulation of communication parameters, and self-adaptation to time-varying radio environment. In nature, biological systems intrinsically have these great abilities that can be modeled and adopted to overcome the difficulties posed by opportunistic spectrum access. In this paper, a new Immune system-inspired Evolutionary Opportunistic Spectrum Access (ESA) protocol is introduced. Based on the self-nonself detection and clonal selection principles in immune system, ESA allows unlicensed users to separately detect, share, and access the available spectrum bands without interfering the licensed users. The overall ESA operations do not need for any priori information about the access statistics of licensed users and also do not need for any coordination and message exchanges among the network nodes. In addition, unlike the existing works, ESA does not require any dedicated control channel in the entire network. Furthermore, ESA also exploits the contention among the nodes and their mobility, if exists, towards accelerating the evolution in the system, and hence, yielding higher overall spectrum utilization. Performance evaluation results show that ESA achieves high throughput under various network conditions.	biological system;british informatics olympiad;cognitive radio;esa;high- and low-level;hoc (programming language);ibm systems network architecture;performance evaluation;programming paradigm;self-organization;throughput	Baris Atakan;Burhan Gulbahar;Özgür B.

As energy consumption is on the rise and the price of electricity is increasing very rapidly, necessity to reduce electricity usage in every aspect is becoming much more significant. The power grid infrastructure, from which the cellular networks attain the required electricity for operation is considering a significant change from the traditional electricity grid to the smart grid. The base stations, which are the main candidates for energy consumption in cellular networks, remain in operation even when there are a very few users or no user at all. In this paper, we propose an effective application scenario of the femtocell technology for power saving purpose of cellular networks. Effective deployment of femto-access-points in the required places can reduce the power usage of cellular networks by turning off the redundant base stations. Moreover, the signal to noise plus interference ratio is also enhanced in comparison to the traditional scheme. The base station turn off probability and the energy consumption in the overall network are analyzed. The comparison results show that the proposed energy efficient model can significantly reduce energy consumption and increase the service quality of the cellular users.	interference (communication);mobile phone;profiling (computer programming);quality of service;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;simulation;software deployment;telecommunications network;wireless access point	Imtiaz Nasim;Md.

Nevertheless, service interruptions due to the handovers in overlapping registration areas are still challenging in railway wireless systems. How to achieve soft and fast handovers to overcome these challenges attracts intensive attention finally. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture for 5G C/U-plane decoupled heterogeneous railway wireless systems to physically separate and stagger the C-plane and U-plane handovers. During the C-plane handover process that occurs between the macro-cells, the U-plane is always kept connected without any handover, which achieves non-interruptible soft handover. Moreover, since there are no handovers in the U-plane, the handover procedure is significantly simplified, thereby accelerating the handover process. Similarly, during the U-plane handover process, which happens between the small cells, the C-plane is kept connected all the time, saving the otherwise intensive C-plane handover signaling. Besides, the coordinated multi-point transmission and reception (CoMP) and bi-casting technologies are applied to establish the target U-plane connection ahead of cutting off the old one, so that no interruption occurs during the U-plane handover process. This paper demonstrates that the proposed handover schemes can greatly improve the handover performance.	image plane;interrupt;network architecture;pin grid array	Li Yan;Xuming Fang;Yuguang Fang	2017	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	10.1109/TITS.2017.2685426	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless wan;computer science;engineering;wireless network;wi-fi array;computer network	Mobile	23.19982117069886	89.38874596908236	176063
ba947e28383f09c7d276e5e798c7ba2ba6b755e6	node-based distributed channel access with enhanced delay characteristics		Recent studies in wireless scheduling have shown that carrier-sense multiple access CSMA can be made throughput optimal by optimizing over activation rates. However, those throughput optimal CSMA algorithms were found to suffer from poor delay performance, especially at high throughputs where the delay can potentially grow exponentially in the size of the network. Motivated by these shortcomings, in this paper we propose a node-based version of the throughput optimal CSMA NB-CSMA as opposed to traditional link-based CSMA algorithms, where links were treated as separate entities. Our algorithm is fully distributed and corresponds to Glauber dynamics with “Block updates”. We show analytically and via simulations that NB-CSMA outperforms conventional link-based CSMA in terms of delay for any fixed-size network. We also characterize the fraction of the capacity region for which the average queue lengths and the average delay grow polynomially in the size of the network, for networks with bounded-degree conflict graphs. This fraction is no smaller than the fraction known for link-based CSMA, and is significantly larger for many instances of practical wireless ad-hoc networks. Finally, we restrict our focus to the special case of collocated networks, analyze the mean starvation time using a Markov chain with rewards framework and use the results to quantitatively demonstrate the improvement of NB-CSMA over the baseline link-based algorithm.	adaptive multi-rate audio codec;algorithm;baseline (configuration management);entity;glauber;hoc (programming language);markov chain;naive bayes classifier;network topology;scheduling (computing);simulation;throughput;transmitter	Sherif ElAzzouni;Eylem Ekici	2018	IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking	10.1109/TNET.2018.2834302	throughput;distributed computing;scheduling (computing);special case;computer science;restrict;communication channel;wireless ad hoc network;queue;markov chain	Metrics	12.37081857931483	91.35709004647336	176332

However, its complexity is exponential in the number of links in an ad hoc wireless network. In this work, we consider a greedy variant of the MaxWeight algorithm, called Longest Queue First (LQF) algorithm. A synchronous version of LQF algorithm is known to be throughput-optimal under a topological condition called local pooling. Here we study an asynchronous version which is suitable for implementation in networks with variable packet sizes. We show that the asynchronous LQF algorithm is also throughput-optimal under the local pooling condition.	distributed algorithm;greedy algorithm;hoc (programming language);network packet;scheduling (computing);tails;throughput;time complexity	Siva Theja Maguluri;Bruce E.

Also, reader collision may occur when neighboring readers use the same channel at the same time. This paper proposes the centralized arbitration scheme using a RFID-Arbiter. The RFID-Arbiter operates as a special tag in the air interface so that hardware of reader does not need to be modified. By the centralized arbitration scheme, readers that want to communicate with tags are allotted to operation at different times. For performance evaluation, the proposed centralized arbitration scheme is modeled and simulated by using discrete event system formalism.

As a consequence, a unifying graph-related characterization of performance achieved under max-min fairness is obtained.	fairness measure;graph (discrete mathematics);interference (communication);max-min fairness;maxima and minima;time-sharing	Marcin Wiczanowski;Holger Boche;Slawomir Stanczak	2007	2007 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.136	fairness measure;max-min fairness;computer science;radio resource management;graph theory;theoretical computer science;wireless network;distributed computing;computer network	Arch	16.65489402184342	91.44249008230132	176791

aba796e4e19e6e8717fe52e2b23b052610ea5f96		evolutionary algorithm;steady state grouping genetic algorithm;registration area planning;cellular based wireless communication network	The last two decades have witnessed a phenomenal growth in the number of cellular wireless network users which in turn stressed the need to utilize the limited network bandwidth in an efficient manner. The network bandwidth is consumed not only by user traffic, but also by control traffic needed for ensuring the mobility of users. As we don't have any control over the volume of user traffic, all attempts to efficiently use bandwidth are based on frequency reuse and minimizing the control traffic. The registration area planning (RAP) problem seeks a partition of the cells of the network into contiguous areas called registration areas so that the bandwidth consumed by control signals is minimized. RAP problem in an &#120029; &#120031; $\mathcal {NP}$ -Hard problem. In this paper, we present a steady-state grouping genetic algorithm with local search to solve this problem. We have compared our approach with the state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature. Computational results show the effectiveness of our approach.	bandwidth (signal processing);computation;genetic algorithm;iterative and incremental development;local search (optimization);paging;rapid refresh;run time (program lifecycle phase);steady state;swarm intelligence;viz: the computer game	Sachchida Nand Chaurasia;Alok Singh	2014	Applied Intelligence	10.1007/s10489-014-0582-5	network traffic control;simulation;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;evolutionary algorithm	Mobile	22.52286890287313	97.53240752830649	177055

Inspired by the huge success of the low density parity check (LDPC) codes in the field of error control coding, we transform the broadcast scheduling problem (BSP) into an LDPC-like problem through a factor graph. In the proposed algorithm, the constraint rules of the BSP are divided into many simple local rules, each of which is enforced by a local processing unit in the factor graph. The soft-information, describing the probability that each station will transmit a data packet, is then efficiently exchanged among the local processing units by using the sum-product algorithm to iteratively optimize the broadcasting schedule. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs better than the other existing central-processing algorithms in terms of the channel utilization and the average packet delay. This is true especially when the network scenario is very complex. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is both low in complexity and completely distributed, which makes it suitable for implementation in practical network applications	belief propagation;dijkstra's algorithm;distributed algorithm;error detection and correction;factor graph;interaction;low-density parity-check code;network packet;organizing (structure);parity bit;scheduling (computing);self-organization;simulation;throughput	Jung-Chieh Chen;Pangan Ting;I Chih-Lin;Jiunn-Tsair Chen	2004	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/GLOCOM.2004.1379127	distributed algorithm;real-time computing;low-density parity-check code;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;distributed computing;statistics;computer network	Mobile	15.067233007379677	93.40473875112147	177403

Nodes request files at random. If the requested file is not in the on-board cache, then it is downloaded from some neighboring node via one-hop local communication. An outage event occurs when a requested file is not found in the neighborhood of the requesting node, or if the network admission control policy decides not to serve the request. We characterize the optimal throughput-outage tradeoff in terms of tight scaling laws for various regimes of the system parameters, when both the number of nodes and the number of files in the library grow to infinity. Our analysis is based on Gupta and Kumar protocol model for the underlying D2D wireless network, widely used in the literature on capacity scaling laws of wireless networks without caching. Our results show that the combination of D2D spectrum reuse and caching at the user nodes yields a per-user throughput independent of the number of users, for any fixed outage probability in (0, 1). This implies that the D2D caching network is scalable: even though the number of users increases, each user achieves constant throughput. This behavior is very different from the classical Gupta and Kumar result on ad hoc wireless networks, for which the per-user throughput vanishes as the number of users increases. Furthermore, we show that the user throughput is directly proportional to the fraction of cached information over the whole file library size. Therefore, we can conclude that D2D caching networks can turn memory into bandwidth (i.e., doubling the on-board cache memory on the user devices yields a 100% increase of the user throughout).	cpu cache;cache (computing);downtime;http 404;hoc (programming language);hop;image scaling;network admission control;on-board data handling;period-doubling bifurcation;scalability;sun outage;throughput	Mingyue Ji;Giuseppe Caire;Andreas F.

By enabling additional collaboration from nodes that otherwise will not directly participate in the transmission, it enables spatial diversity and dramatically improves the performance of the network. In this paper we propose a cross-layer cooperative protocol based on a MAC protocol called CoopMAC (Liu et al., 2005; Korakis et al., 2007; and Liu et al., 2006) for ad-hoc wireless networks in order to leverage cooperation in both MAC and PHY layer. Exploiting physical layer combining at the receiver, this simple yet efficient scheme illustrates a new paradigm for realistic cross-layer cooperative protocol design for next generation wireless ad-hoc networks. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed protocol by extensive simulations in a large scale wireless ad-hoc network. Simulation results show that the new protocol significantly improves the network performance in terms of throughput and delay.	coding gain;communications protocol;hoc (programming language);network performance;next-generation network;phy (chip);programming paradigm;simulation;throughput	Feilu Liu;Thanasis Korakis;Zhifeng Tao;Shivendra S.

e494d2e955a4ca76fa9c8c2d1f47a3a202d864ff	a lte/wlan selection method based on a novel throughput estimation method		In this paper, we propose a novel radio access technology (RAT) selection method that can maximize total throughput by simultaneously selecting optimal RATs for a group of user equipments (UEs). To perform simultaneous selection, we also propose a novel throughput estimation method based on not wireless information collected from the existing network equipment but the accurate estimation of the amount of radio resources available for the UEs. Throughputs of all the UEs are estimated for all RAT selection patterns, by using the estimated available radio resources. The RAT selection method then selects a RAT selection pattern that gives the maximum total throughput. We conduct both simulations with a network simulator and field experiments with a commercially operating LTE network. The field experiments confirm that the proposed throughput estimation method can achieve an average estimation error of about 10%. The simulations confirm that the proposed method with a 10% throughput estimation error can achieve 96% throughput compared to that with perfect estimation. A conventional successive RAT selection method takes 1–10 minutes to achieve the same throughput as the proposed method, while the proposed simultaneous RAT selection method only takes about 1–10 seconds. Moreover, the conventional method achieves only 71% throughput of the proposed method with same processing time as the proposed method.	assistive technology;compaq lte;experiment;monte carlo method;selection (genetic algorithm);simulation;throughput	Takayoshi Nakayama;Hiroaki Senoo;Yun Wen;Yoshiharu Tajima;Dai Kimura	2017	2017 IEEE 28th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292455	real-time computing;computer network;networking hardware;throughput;network simulation;wireless;computer science;radio access technology	Mobile	21.311679524981237	92.28091957098701	179099

While the corresponding delay-constrained Shannon capacity remains an open problem (no existing analysis tools can be directly applied), this work focuses on linear codes and proposes three new definitions of delay-constrained throughput based on different outage metrics: the file-based, the rank-based, and the packet-based ones. It then fully characterizes the corresponding linear coding capacity regions for relatively-short-delay flows - flows for which the delay requirement is no larger than the interval of file arrivals.	acknowledgement (data networks);binary erasure channel;broadcasting (networking);causal filter;channel capacity;downtime;linear code;linear network coding;network packet;routing;shannon capacity of a graph;telecommunications link;telecommunications network;throughput;wireless access point	Chih-Chun Wang	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541830	broadcast radiation;telecommunications;computer science;processing delay;distributed computing;transmission delay;computer network	Arch	12.69366574128825	91.16302905850137	179820

However, considerable confusions still exist as to the actual power of POCs to improve network capacity, especially since traditional communication system designs treat the so called adjacent channel interference (ACI) as harmful. Based on measurements of actual testbed experiments, we model the impact of POCs on system design and use numerical method to analyze network capacity improvement comparing POC-based design and traditional design. Our investigation shows that for a wide class of network settings, POC-based design allows more flexibility in wireless resource allocation, and can improve overall network capacity by as much as 100%.	experiment;hoc (programming language);interference (communication);mesh networking;network performance;numerical method;simulation;systems design;testbed;wireless mesh network	Zhenhua Feng;Yaling Yang	2008	2008 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2008.517	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;computer network	Mobile	17.03690664135657	89.02430384928596	180115

While upper bounds and approximations for end-to-end delay in MANETs have been developed in literatur e, which usually introduce significant errors in delay analysi s, the modeling of exact end-to-end delay in MANETs remains a technical challenge. This is partially due to the highly dynamic al behaviors of MANETs, but also due to the lack of an efficient theo retical framework to capture such dynamics. This paper demo nstrates the potential application of the powerful Quasi-Bi rth-andDeath (QBD) theory in tackling the challenging issue of exac t end-to-end delay modeling in MANETs. We first apply the QBD theory to develop an efficient theoretical framework for cap turing the complex dynamics in MANETs. We then show that with the help of this framework, closed form models can be derived for the analysis of exact end-to-end delay and also per node thro ug put capacity in MANETs.

In order to make demand match supply, so as to prevent grid instabilities and to effectively use the produced power, the smart grid can issue some requests to its users to increase or decrease their consumption; the users that can positively respond to the smart grid requests are awarded through cost reductions. We investigate the case in which, in order to better satisfy the requests from the smart grid, the mobile network uses WiFi offloading that, in its turn, reduces the load and, hence, the consumption of the network. Two cases are considered in the paper: a network with always on base stations and a network in which base stations are activated and deactivated based on the traffic demand. The results show that in both cases WiFi offloading improves the capacity of the mobile network to respond to the smart grid requests. In addition, we consider the possibility that the mobile network is equipped with some photovoltaic panels for generating some additional energy.	access network;high availability;suicidegirls	Muhammad Ali;Michela Meo;Daniela Renga	2017	2017 IEEE 14th International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control (ICNSC)	10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000097	grid;smart grid;real-time computing;computer network;mobile telephony;computer science;mobile computing;cellular network;base station;photovoltaic system	Mobile	19.951901422163672	89.7077154939544	181084

By caching a portion of the video files, the base stations (BSs) opportunistically employ Coop-MIMO transmission to achieve MIMO cooperation gain without expensive payload backhaul. We derive closed form expressions of various video streaming performance metrics for cache-induced opportunistic Coop-MIMO and investigate the impact of BS level caching and key system parameters on the performance. Specifically, we first obtain a mixed fluid-diffusion limit for the playback buffer queueing system. Then we derive the approximated video streaming performance using the mixed fluid-diffusion limit. Based on the performance analysis, we formulate the joint optimization of cache control and playback buffer management as a stochastic optimization problem. Then we derive a closed form solution for the playback buffer thresholds and develop a stochastic subgradient algorithm to find the optimal cache control. The analysis shows that the video streaming performance improves linearly with the BS cache size BC, the transmit power cost decreases exponentially with BC, and the backhaul cost decreases linearly with BC.	approximation algorithm;backhaul (telecommunications);cpu cache;cache (computing);cooperative mimo;key;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;queueing theory;stochastic optimization;streaming media;subderivative;subgradient method;video file format	An Liu;Vincent K.

Heterogeneous multilayer network deployment is one essential performance-effective and potentially cost-effective candidate solution. We study optimal new site deployment algorithms in heterogeneous wireless cellular networks. We focus on a joint Macro and Micro layer new site deployment. We propose and evaluate a class of fast-convergent meta-heuristic algorithms: Scalable Multi-radio deployment AlgoRiThm (SMART). Their performances and convergence speeds are evaluated using a large-scale real dense-urban HSPA network deployment. We compare the performance on four variants of SMART: Greedy, Simulated Annealing, Greedy with memory and Simulated Annealing with memory. We show that the Simulated Annealing and Greedy algorithms achieve almost the same optimal deployment when the number of optimization iterations is large and, the Greedy algorithm converges much faster than Simulated Annealing algorithm when the number of optimization iterations is small. We also show that in a practical network deployment scenario SMART outperforms previous heuristic deployment algorithms proposed in the literature.	greedy algorithm;heuristic;iteration;mathematical optimization;performance;smart;simulated annealing;software deployment;time complexity	Liang Hu;István Z.

On the UL, this system collects unicast real-time video streams from mobile wireless camera stations (CSs) and forwards them to a control center. On the DL, the aggregated video streams are multicast to multiple mobile stations (MSs) to facilitate monitoring of the same video scenes. A target bit rate is set for each UL video stream, based on an objective function that includes both the quality of experience (QoE) and popularity of video contents as key criteria. A QoE-driven scheduling and resource allocation policy at the MAC/PHY layers, and a real-time scalable video layer adaptation algorithm in the APP layer are proposed. On the DL, a previously published opportunistic layered multicasting scheduling algorithm is applied. Simulation results demonstrate that this proposed novel architecture can significantly enhance both the spectral efficiency and the QoE of users in both UL and DL directions.	algorithm;camera phone;cascading style sheets;loss function;mobile phone;multicast;optimization problem;phy (chip);real-time clock;scalability;scheduling (computing);simulation;spectral efficiency;streaming media;telecommunications link;unicast	Po-Han Wu;Jenq-Neng Hwang;Jae-Young Pyun;Kung-Ming Lan;Jian-Ren Chen	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2012.6271423	wimax;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;phase-shift keying;lte advanced;computer network	Mobile	21.51360125779362	96.6142667993102	182454

We extend this line of inquiry by examining a multiaccess communication scenario where users' packets arrive randomly into separate queues and transmission rates are allocated from the information-theoretic multiaccess capacity region based on the respective users' queue states. In the symmetric case, a longer-queue-higher rate (LQHR) allocation strategy is shown to minimize the average system delay of packets. Such a policy can be interpreted in the coding context as adaptive successive decoding. The delay performance of the LQHR policy provides a fundamental lower bound to the performance for multiaccess coding schemes which seek to meet any given level of decoding error probability."""

Depending on the type of signal and QoS requirements, different types of multimedia signals need different bandwidths for communication. In typical wireless systems, unless a contiguous frequency band in the spectrum with width at least equal to the required bandwidth is obtained, multimedia communication can not occur with the desired QoS. We propose here a novel technique based on sample division multiplexing (SDM) to overcome this issue. Our proposed approach is based on utilizing several frequency bands, each of smaller width than the required bandwidth but whose sum total equals at least the required bandwidth. Towards this end, we present algorithms for channel reservation, channel sensing and allocation along with protocols for transmission and reception. Our approach also ensures preemption of secondary users by the primary users as typically demanded in a cognitive radio based communication environment.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);cognitive radio;communications protocol;frequency band;multiplexing;network packet;preemption (computing);quality of service;requirement;time series;transmitter;white spaces (radio)	Ansuman Bhattacharya;Rabindranath Ghosh;Koushik Sinha;Bhabani P.

This paper is more focusing on the OSI Layers 1-2 (physical and media access) and performance analyses, rather than the aspects in the higher OSI layers like radio resource management, load sharing, and resource selection procedures. These were investigated in previous projects. The effect of these processes can be considered by an overhead factor. The default parameters for different RATs and mapping of different services to these technologies are defined and used for simulations, are continuously checked with recommendations and the best practice parameter settings, correspondingly verified and modified. The goal is to use simple, but flexible simulation methods, approximations and propagation models and by using Matlab to investigate typical Multi-RAT network scenarios in macro-, micro-, pico-urban environment fast and efficiently.	approximation;best practice;matlab;osi model;overhead (computing);radio resource management;simulation;software propagation	Shun-Ping Chen;Jens Gebert	2017	2017 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC)	10.1109/CyberC.2017.20	multiple-criteria decision analysis;computer network;macro;resource management;osi model;radio resource management;best practice;computer science;radio access technology;resource allocation	HPC	24.556445785585524	88.97565035540359	183130

This distinction leads to shorter transmission time in general. The satellite provides coverage for u uplink spotbeams and v downlink spotbeams with prescribed limits on the maximum number of available carriers in each spotbeam, subject to a total of K carriers in use at any one time. Earth stations are equipped for simultaneous transmission on and reception of multiple carriers. If U+V is O(K), the number of switching modes required is O(K 2) and a transmission?time optimal schedule can be found in O(K 4) time. Technology considerations are discussed.

2cf868896bdf1986579921465589919397f4697f	traffic steering for sdn-based cellular networks: policy dependent framework		Heterogeneous network is considered as one of the promising solutions for the next-generation cellular network to manage the ever increasing demand of network capacity, and to provide desirable data rate for ensuring user satisfaction. Traffic steering (TS) is recently reported as an emerging technique for diverse objectives in the heterogeneous networks, which can steer the useru0027s traffic to the suitable network entities. In this paper, we propose a universal TS framework, which considers the current status of the networks as well as the current condition and demand of the users to fulfill the desirable objective of the TS policy. The network monitoring capability and global view of the network are introduced by incorporating software-defined networking (SDN) into cellular network to make the dynamic decision for steering the useru0027s traffic to the optimal access point (AP). On the top of the proposed TS framework, an operator defined steering policy assists the TS algorithm. Based on the numerical analysis, it is shown that the proposed TS framework can effectively steer the useru0027s traffic to the optimal destination to achieve the objective of the policy. Our Proposed TS framework can be an effective management tool for the next-generation heterogeneous cellular networks.	algorithm;data rate units;entity;numerical analysis;semantic network;software-defined networking;wireless access point	Md.

In particular, we propose a general analytical framework on the number of channels, in which we consider a new directional antenna model. This antenna model is more general than existing antenna models since other existing antenna models can be regarded as a special case of our model. Besides, it can accurately depict directional antenna with consideration of side-lobes and back-lobes. Moreover, we derive the upper bounds on the number of channels of such networks to ensure collision-free communications. Our results are also insightful to the network design and network deployment.	interference (communication);many antennas;network performance;network planning and design;software deployment	Hao Wang;Hong Xiao	2016			wireless network;computer network;channel allocation schemes;computer science;communication channel	Mobile	17.305960306882632	88.65100686811604	184877

Previous work on realistic scenarios focused on unicast, while broadcast requirements are fundamentally different and cannot be derived from unicast case. Therefore, broadcast protocols must be adapted in order to still be efficient under realistic assumptions. In this paper, we study the well-known multipoint relay protocol (MPR). In the latter, each node has to choose a set of neighbors to act as relays in order to cover the whole 2-hop neighborhood. We give experimental results showing that the original method provided to select the set of relays does not give good results with the realistic model. We also provide three new heuristics in replacement and their performances which demonstrate that they better suit to the considered model. The first one maximizes the probability of correct reception between the node and the considered relays multiplied by their coverage in the 2-hop neighborhood. The second one replaces the coverage by the average of the probabilities of correct reception between the considered neighbor and the 2hop neighbors it covers. Finally, the third heuristic keeps the same concept as the second one, but tries to maximize the coverage level of the 2-hop neighborhood: 2-hop neighbors are still being considered as uncovered while their coverage level is not higher than a given coverage threshold, many neighbors may thus be selected to cover the same 2-hop neighbors.	heuristic (computer science);internet relay chat;minkowski portal refinement;optimized link state routing protocol;performance;requirement;simulation;unicast;unit disk graph;whole earth 'lectronic link	François Ingelrest;David Simplot-Ryl	2006		10.1007/11943952_13	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;graph theory;mobile computing;computer security;computer network	Mobile	15.398935790645588	88.95930954286167	185438

Even though the resultant optimization problem is generally nonconvex, it is proved that the gap with its Lagrange dual problem is zero, so long as the underlying fading distribution function is continuous. The major implication is that separating the design of wireless networks in layers and per-fading state subproblems can be optimal. Subgradient descent algorithms are further developed to effect an optimal separation in layers and layer interfaces.	algorithm;duality (optimization);end-to-end principle;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;resultant;subderivative;subgradient method	Alejandro R.

3c6972263698c70286465bc778f148e41aafbd3b	location aware opportunistic bandwidth sharing between static and mobile users with stochastic learning in cellular networks		In this paper, we consider the problem of location-dependent opportunistic bandwidth sharing between static and mobile (i.e., moving) downlink users in a cellular network. Each cell of the network has some fixed number of static users. Mobile users enter the cell, move inside the cell for some time and then leave the cell. In order to provide higher data rate to the mobile users, we propose location dependent bandwidth sharing between the two classes of static and mobile users; the idea is to provide higher bandwidth to the mobile users at favourable times and locations, and provide higher bandwidth to the static users in other times. Our approach is agnostic to the way the bandwidth is further shared within the same class of users; it can be combined with any particular bandwidth allocation policy employed for one of these two classes of users. We formulate the problem as a long run average reward Markov decision process (MDP) where the per-step reward is a linear combination of instantaneous data volumes received by static and mobile users, and find the optimal policy. The transition structure of this MDP is not known in general, and it may change with time. To alleviate these issues, we propose a learning algorithm based on single timescale stochastic approximation. Also, noting that the MDP problem can be used to maximize the long run average data rate for mobile users subject to a constraint on the long run average data rate of static users, we provide a learning algorithm based on multi-timescale stochastic approximation. We prove asymptotic convergence of the bandwidth sharing policies under these learning algorithms to the optimal policy. The results are extended to address the issue of fair bandwidth sharing between the two classes of static and mobile users, where the notion of fairness is motivated by the popular notion of α-fairness in the literature. Numerical results exhibit significant performance improvement by our scheme, and also demonstrate the trade-off between performance gain and fairness requirement.	algorithm;bandwidth (signal processing);data rate units;fairness measure;machine learning;markov chain;markov decision process;stochastic approximation;telecommunications link;uncompressed video	Arpan Chattopadhyay;Bartlomiej Blaszczyszyn;Eitan Altman	2016	CoRR		real-time computing;simulation;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	ML	23.624406357711763	96.74867806441705	186185

A critical network element impacting the potential performance of 5G networks is the backhaul, which is expected to expand in length and breadth to cater to the exponential growth of small cells while offering high throughput in the order of gigabit per second and less than 1 ms latency with high resilience and energy efficiency. Such performance may only be possible with direct optical fiber connections that are often not available country-wide and are cumbersome and expensive to deploy. On the other hand, a prime 5G characteristic is diversity, which describes the radio access network, the backhaul, and also the types of user applications and devices. Thus, we propose a novel, distributed, self-optimized, end-to-end user-cell-backhaul association scheme that intelligently associates users with candidate cells based on corresponding dynamic radio and backhaul conditions while abiding by users' requirements. Radio cells broadcast multiple bias factors, each reflecting a dynamic performance indicator (DPI) of the end-to-end network performance such as capacity, latency, resilience, energy consumption, and so on. A given user would employ these factors to derive a user-centric cell ranking that motivates it to select the cell with radio and backhaul performance that conforms to the user requirements. Reinforcement learning is used at the radio cells to optimise the bias factors for each DPI in a way that maximise the system throughput while minimising the gap between the users' achievable and required end-to-end quality of experience (QoE). Preliminary results show considerable improvement in users' QoE and cumulative system throughput when compared with the state-of-the-art user-cell association schemes.	backhaul (telecommunications);data rate units;end-to-end principle;gigabit;network performance;optical fiber;provisioning;radio access network;reinforcement learning;requirement;throughput;time complexity;user requirements document	Mona Jaber;Muhammad Ali Imran;Rahim Tafazolli;Anvar Tukmanov	2016	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2566958	user-centered design;simulation;telecommunications;backhaul;computer science;efficient energy use;computer security;computer network	Mobile	22.502313124449994	90.27997503196234	186207

Our objective is to minimize the broadcast latency, which is defined as the total transmission time required for all intended users in a multicast group to receive the packet. Based on the instantaneous channel conditions, BS can send a packet at different transmission rates. Sending at a higher rate allows a shorter packet transmission time, but only a limited number of users with sufficient channel quality can receive the packet. To reach all users in a multicast group, the packet must be transmitted multiple times. We can see that the broadcast latency depends on the transmission rate used and the number of transmissions required. In this paper, we formulate the problem of minimizing broadcast latency as a dynamic programming problem, and a close-loop optimal opportunistic multicast scheduling scheme (OOMS) is derived.	dynamic programming;interrupt latency;multi-user;multicast;network packet;order management system;polynomial-time approximation scheme;scheduling (computing);simulation	Wen Huang;Kwan Lawrence Yeung	2010	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2010.5502060	link state packet;broadcast radiation;real-time computing;multicast;packet analyzer;computer science;operating system;wireless network;distributed computing;transmission delay;source-specific multicast;multimedia broadcast multicast service;xcast;computer network	Mobile	17.696950592816922	95.51348343859355	186421

However, efficient utilization of CAN-FD bandwidth space calls for a systematic strategy. The challenge arises from the nature of the frame sizes stipulated by CAN-FD as well as the heterogeneity of the periods of the messages and the signals. In this paper, we formulate a frame packing problem for CAN-FD with the optimization objective of bandwidth utilization while meeting temporal constraints. As part of the solution, first, we propose a formula to compute the best-case and the worst-case transmission times of the CAN-FD frames. Thereafter, we propose a framework that solves the optimization problem in pseudo-polynomial time. Experiments show the gains achieved by our framework. The results also show that, when applied to standard CAN, our heuristic provides improved results over existing techniques.	best, worst and average case;data rate units;flight director (aeronautics);heuristic;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;polynomial;pseudo-polynomial time;set packing;time complexity	Unmesh D.

Wireless links which are scheduled simultaneously add to the noise levels of each other and cause the overall network capacity to decrease. In this paper we consider a wireless ad hoc network with unicast or multicast routing and simultaneously transmitting nodes along the route. Our major goal is to increase the capacity of the unicast/multicast sessions when all the wireless links are scheduled simultaneously. In addition, we try to minimize the number of active nodes involved in the unicast/multicast session for the purpose of energy efficiency. We assume that all the nodes share the same transmission range if activated and propose several node activation schemes with provable asymptotic bounds on the capacity and energy efficiency of the induced communication graph.

In open networks, they steer the state of the system toward a predetermined and fixed target, while, in closed networks they steer instantaneous throughputs toward a fixed target. In both cases, the proposed policies measure distance from the target using a weighted norm. In open networks, we establish that for an L2 norm the corresponding policies are stable. In closed networks, we establish that with proper target selection the corresponding policy is efficient, that is, attains bottleneck throughput in the infinite population limit. In both open and closed networks, the proposed policies are amenable to distributed implementation using local state information. We exploit the work in a previous paper to select appropriate parameter values and outline how optimal parameter values can be computed. We report numerical results indicating that we obtain near-optimal policies (when the optimal can be computed) and significantly outperform heuristic alternatives. This work has applications in a number of areas including optimizing the processing of information in sensor networks.	approximation;elegant degradation;greedy algorithm;heuristic;local variable;multiprocessing;numerical analysis;polyhedron;population;routing;scheduling (computing);sensor;simulation;the times;throughput	Ioannis Ch.

The target capacity of the proposed system is the transmission of 3 million message data (MD) or more within one hour. To control random access of mobile terminal (MT), Frame Slotted ALOHA is used. Frame Slotted ALOHA cannot provide optimum control, since the hub station (HUB) does not know the number of MTs. For realizing large capacity, we propose Frame Slotted ALOHA with Flag Method in which the HUB can estimate the number of MT quickly. The proposed Flag Method is divided into two modes. The send flag mode can estimate the number of MT within a short time. The send message data mode can control random packet access using estimated number of MD in send flag mode. Computer simulation shows that it is possible to accommodate 3 million MD by using the proposed Flag Method within 48m 19s.	computer simulation;cryptographic hash function;frame language;mobile phone;molecular dynamics;network packet;quasi-zenith satellite system;random access;the hub (forum);usb hub	Tomohide Takahashi;Yuji Miyake;Fumihiro Yamagata;Hiroshi Oguma;Suguru Kameda;Noriharu Suematsu;Tadashi Takagi;Kazuo Tsubouchi	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666713	disaster;telecommunications;distributed computing;computer network	Arch	10.20943100500576	94.40830735198728	187787

We study optimal distributed caching problem for mobile peer-to-peer data dissemination that leverages local cache of mobile nodes and their mobility. The problem accounts for finding the assignment of proportion of nodes to forward a set of data channels so as to maximize the global performance. As the key assumption that facilitates the analysis, we derive a close-form approximation between dissemination time of a data channel and proportion of nodes forwarding that channel. We show optimal distributed caching problem is equivalent to optimization of aggregate dissemination time over all channels whose solution can be obtained by convex optimization. Simulations based on real user mobility trace show that optimal distributed caching outperforms other data caching heuristics, especially when the number of channels is large or when the cache size is small.	aggregate data;approximation;cpu cache;cache (computing);centralized computing;channel (communications);computer simulation;concave function;convex function;convex optimization;digital distribution;distributed cache;fax;heuristic (computer science);ka band;mathematical optimization;optimization problem;peer-to-peer;sequent calculus;social inequality;user experience	Liang Hu	2011	2011 IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	10.1109/VETECF.2011.6093124	convex function;real-time computing;convex optimization;false sharing;computer science;resource management;distributed computing;computer network	Mobile	17.8440764288849	98.18326113889304	188157

With the exception of TV white spaces, secondary users (SUs) can access the medium only intermittently, due to deferring to primary user (PU) transmissions and scanning for new channels. This raises the following questions: (i) what sort of delays can an SU expect on a channel given the PU utilization of this channel? (ii) how do specific characteristics of the PU activity patterns (e.g. burstiness) further affect performance? These questions are of key importance for the design of efficient algorithms for scheduling, spectrum handoff, etc. In this paper, we propose a queueing analytical model to answer them. We model the PU activity pattern as an ON-OFF alternating renewal process with generic ON and OFF durations, and derive a closed form expression for packet delays by solving a variant of the M/G/1 queue. Contrary to the common belief that low utilization channels are good channels, we show that the expected SU delay on a channel, and thus the best channel to use, is a subtle interplay between the ON and OFF duration distributions of the primary users, and the SU traffic load. We validate our analysis against simulations for different PU activity profiles.	algorithm;cognitive network;communications protocol;computer performance;heart rate variability;ibm systems network architecture;interrupt;network packet;one-class classification;primary channel;scheduling (computing);simulation;superuser;synthetic intelligence;white spaces (radio)	Fidan Mehmeti;Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos	2013	2013 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2013.6654977	cognitive radio;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;layered queueing network;queueing theory;computer network	Mobile	10.808442653544157	96.38824260586559	188251

In particular, we develop two distributed mode selection strategies that cater for the time-varying needs of the network terminals.

ea03df210534bdf3eebe3f9a3026d66dc0c7a277	ajrc-mac: an aloha-based joint reservation and cooperation mac for dense wireless networks		The increase in collision and interference induced by the network densification poses the intractable challenge of improving network throughput. Channel reservation and cooperative transmission, two schemes improving the medium access control (MAC) efficiency and transmission reliability respectively, have drawn considerable attention. Joint optimization of reservation and cooperation is theoretically proved to be promising in improving the network throughput in our recent study. However, up to now no practical MAC protocol is proposed to evaluate its effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an ALOHA-based joint reservation and cooperation MAC (AJRC-MAC) protocol which adopts the reservation-based channel access and enables the cooperative transmission simultaneously for the dense wireless network. Simulation results evaluate the effectiveness of the joint reservation and cooperation, and show that a throughput gain of 330%, 250%, 130% can be achieved respectively for AJRC-MAC compared with the basic MAC, cooperation- only MAC and reservation-only MAC.	access control;cooperative mimo;interference (communication);mathematical optimization;maximum throughput scheduling;network packet;simulation	Yongping Zhang;Bo Li;Mao Yang;Zhongjiang Yan;Xiaoya Zuo;Qiao Qu	2017	2017 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)	10.1109/WCNC.2017.7925658	telecommunications;computer security;computer network	Mobile	12.086504339518338	91.7842979471089	189190

eb8662ef94be9dfe2781f46936d971f14b286a2a	popularity-aware caching increases the capacity of wireless networks		In wireless ad hoc networks, due to the interference between concurrent transmissions, the per node capacity generally decreases with the increasing number of nodes in the network. Caching can help improve the network capacity, as it shortens the content transmission distance and reduces the communication interference. However, current researches on the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks with caching generally assume that content popularity follows uniform distribution. They ignore the fact that contents in reality have skewed popularity, which may lead to totally different capacity results. In this paper, we evaluate how the distribution of the content popularity affects the network capacity, and derive different capacity scaling laws based on the skewness of the content popularity. Our results suggest that for wireless networks with caching, when contents have skewed popularity, increasing the number of nodes monotonically increases the per node capacity.	cache (computing);duality (optimization);hoc (programming language);image scaling;interference (communication);optimization problem	Li Qiu;Guohong Cao	2017	IEEE INFOCOM 2017 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057030	wireless network;computer network;popularity;computer science;distributed computing	Mobile	13.91886579645187	89.96166154636518	189806

In these contexts, we provide both protocols called depth exploration protocol and width exploration protocol which are based on the formalism of the MDP (Markov Decision Process) and on alliance principle. The aim of our protocols is to ensure and to adapt dynamically the stability of the agent's coordination teams (coalitions) which take into account the agent's withdrawal and the dynamic evolving of the tasks.

In this respect, correlation in time domain and suitability to the Poisson model assumed in classical teletraffic theory is investigated for voice calls in both directions. In analyses, a set of experimental data obtained from 2G/3G networks is used. An Android operating system-based data collection system is designed and implemented for collecting voice call statistics without affecting users' daily telephone traffic. With this data collection system, network traffic is logged per user (separately for each individual) and calls of a single user's cellphone are separated into sub-groups as incoming (downlink) and outgoing (uplink). Thus, call arrival process can now be characterized separately for each group both as individually and collectively. Using the modified Allan variance (MAVAR), wavelet and autocorrelation function of Hurst parameter estimation methods, it is determined that calls in mentioned groups have statistical properties of white noise and so a call in a second is independent from a call in any other second. In addition, suitability of each call group to Poisson distribution is also shown.	android;apollonian network;autocorrelation;data acquisition;duplex (telecommunications);estimation theory;hurst exponent;mobile phone;modified allan variance;network traffic control;operating system;queueing theory;telecommunications link;wavelet;white noise	Saliha Buyukcorak;Günes Karabulut-Kurt;Guven Toprakkiran	2013	2013, 7th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)	10.1109/ICSPCS.2013.6723910	speech recognition;telecommunications;computer science;computer network	Mobile	11.509525552845664	100.55435355148123	190388

Thus, managing energy efficiency should be the first priority for mobile terminals. In this paper, our aim is to improve the users' energy efficiency in heterogeneous network environments. To this end, we propose a network selection mechanism that exploits both user and network context information in order to efficiently utilize the radio wireless resources in heterogeneous network. The mechanism enables the multi-mode mobile terminal to select and connect to the network of attachment that maximizes its average energy efficiency and guarantees a supported quality of service for its connections. The performance of the proposed mechanism is compared against the maximum battery lifetime scheme and priority LTE access scheme in terms of the energy consumption, the throughput and the energy efficiency. According to simulation results, the system that employs the proposed network selection mechanism achieves better performance improvement in improving the user average throughput and energy efficiency.	algorithm;attachments;compaq lte;mobile phone;quality of service;simulation;throughput	Di Zhang;Pinyi Ren;Yichen Wang;Qinghe Du;Li Sun	2014	2014 Sixth International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2014.6992193	radio access network;embedded system;element management system;wireless wan;heterogeneous network;network management station;imt advanced;public land mobile network;telecommunications;engineering;radio resource management;mobile station;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	23.964216998631333	91.32957836103687	191493

ae0b647398ca74ff8aa4ed8f49c42a3ae6676ab3	multi-criteria handover using modified weighted topsis methods for heterogeneous networks		Ultra-dense small cell deployment in future 5G networks is a promising solution to the ever increasing demand of capacity and coverage. However, this deployment can lead to severe interference and high number of handovers, which in turn cause increased signaling overhead. In order to ensure service continuity for mobile users, minimize the number of unnecessary handovers and reduce the signaling overhead in heterogeneous networks, it is important to model adequately the handover decision problem. In this paper, we model the handover decision based on the multiple attribute decision making method, namely Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The base stations are considered as alternatives, and the handover metrics are considered as attributes to selecting the proper base station for handover. In this paper, we propose two modified TOPSIS methods for the purpose of handover management in the heterogeneous network. The first method incorporates the entropy weighting technique for handover metrics weighting. The second proposed method uses a standard deviation weighting technique to score the importance of each handover metric. Simulation results reveal that the proposed methods outperformed the existing methods by reducing the number of frequent handovers and radio link failures, in addition to enhancing the achieved mean user throughput.	decision problem;interference (communication);overhead (computing);scott continuity;simulation;software deployment;throughput	Mohanad Alhabo;Li Zhang	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846045	reliability engineering;throughput;handover;software deployment;radio link protocol;computer network;decision problem;topsis;heterogeneous network;computer science;weighting	Mobile	23.501713444520142	90.69605780524273	191788

Data transmission over standardized PONs is divided into time slots. Toward the end of PON performance improvement, a critical issue relies on resource management in the upstream transmission from multiple optical network units (ONUs) to the optical line terminal (OLT). This includes resource negotiation between the OLT and the associated ONUs, transmission scheduling, and bandwidth allocation. This article provides an overview of the resource management issues along with the state-of-the-art schemes over time-division multiplexed PONs (TDM-PONs). We categorize the schemes in the literature based on their features, and compare their pros and cons. Moreover, we introduce a unified state space model under which all TDM-PON resource management schemes can be evaluated and analyzed for their system level characteristics.

Then we classify different CRRM levels and propose a categorization framework for CRRM algorithms based on their relationship to load sharing strategies. The proposed model framework based on this systematic view enables a cost-benefit analysis of different CRRM algorithms and architectures. Different centralized or decentralized scenarios can be clearly defined based on five standard components (the radio access system, the environment, the user equipment, the CRRM information manager and the CRRM decider). The costs of CRRM operations are taken into account via chargeable messages. The clarity of the model enables an efficient investigation of CRRM algorithms based on optimization theory, game theory, physical models and other methods. We also describe the implementation concept of the model framework.	algorithm;asymptotic decider;categorization;centralized computing;game theory;information management;mathematical optimization;radio resource management	Andreas Pillekeit;Fariborz Derakhshan;Bruno Müller-Clostermann	2007			game theory;simulation;heterogeneous network;computer science;distributed computing;management science;information management;computer network	DB	22.69112969008711	92.54726148219224	192718

For precise handoff decisions, latest proposed vertical handoff decision algorithms (VHDA) are, however, too complex and do not consider the restricted access to decision metrics of mobile phones with limited system resources. For addressing this issue and to benefit earlier from seamless service provisioning, we present feasible client based VHDA solutions ensuring context-aware QoS (i.e., high throughput, low power consumption) for specific use cases. Unlike related approaches, our solutions run completely locally on mobile phones without any required modifications on network side. In terms of performance analysis, we design a comprehensive simulation model for comparing the suggested VHDA solutions with different complexity levels. Moreover, we analyze the impact of an energy model, which is derived from experimental measurements, on handoff decision quality and the improvement of battery usage. Simulation results illustrate that VHDAs with energy model enhance the QoS of handoff decisions in terms of high throughput and low power consumption compared to a less approach.	algorithm;c shell;cloud computing;decision quality;information retrieval;mobile phone;provisioning;quality of service;rss;requirement;seamless3d;simulation;testbed;throughput	Thang Tran;Maike Kuhnert;Christian Wietfeld	2012	2012 21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289188	throughput;real-time computing;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;measurement;computer network	Mobile	21.793145988846796	90.90209555063517	193000

VSN creates a huge opportuni ty to extend the road-side sensor infrastructure of existing traffic control systems. The efficient use of the wireless communication medium is one of the basic issues in VSN applications development. This paper introduces a novel method of selective data c ollection for traffic control applications, which provides a significant reduction in data amou nts transmitted through VSN. The underlying idea is to detect the necessity of data transfers on the basis of uncertainty determination of the traffic control decisions. Acc ording to the proposed approach, sensor data are transmitted from vehicles to the control n ode only at selected time moments. Data collected in VSN are processed using on-line traffi c simulation technique, which enables traffic flow prediction, performance evaluation of control strategies and uncertainty estimation. If precision of the resulting informati on is insufficient, the optimal control strategy cannot be derived without ambiguity. As a result th e control decision becomes uncertain and it is a signal informing that new traffic data from VSN are necessary to provide more precise prediction and to reduce the uncertainty of decisio n. The proposed method can be applied in traffic control systems of different types e.g. tra ffic signals, variable speed limits, and dynamic route guidance. The effectiveness of this m ethod is illustrated in an experimental study on traffic control at signalised intersection .	algorithm;control system;control theory;experiment;futures studies;fuzzy number;hoc (programming language);online and offline;optimal control;performance evaluation;simulation;uncertainty principle;web-based simulation;zero suppression	Bartlomiej Placzek	2011	CoRR	10.1016/j.trc.2011.12.007	traffic generation model;wireless sensor network;floating car data;computer science;engineering;traffic congestion reconstruction with kerner's three-phase theory;mathematics;transport engineering;computer security;statistics;computer network;data collection	Mobile	13.041283537392463	93.46664247458256	193586

Unlike existing works in the literature, we focus on the beyond wireless body area network (beyond-WBAN) communications. In the considered system, medical packets arrive randomly at each gateway (which ordinarily stands for one patient), and their transmission requests are reported to the network regulator (i.e., the base station) with specific delay sensitivities that reflect their medical signal severities. The base station then determines the order of transmission by formulating a priority queue. With the construction of the packets' utility and the base station's profit functions, we analyze the characteristics of the service system and design an incentive-compatible mechanism such that all gateways will be forced to report the actual delay sensitivities of their medical packets. Theoretical analyses show that our proposed mechanism can maximize the profit of the base station (i.e., minimize the total waiting cost from all medical packet transmissions) while guaranteeing higher service priorities to more emergent medical packets. Numerical results examine the properties of the proposed mechanism, and demonstrate its feasibility in providing economic incentives for all individuals.	emergence;network packet;numerical analysis;priority queue;randomness;scheduling (computing)	Changyan Yi;Attahiru Sule Alfa;Jun Cai	2016	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2500241	real-time computing;logic gate;telecommunications;sensitivity;computer science;operating system;scheduling;priority queue;wireless;computer network	Mobile	10.133085022713646	97.11622612207994	193605

Although these techniques are usually studied independently, their combination offers new alternatives to MNOs for serving their users and could potentially provide them with additional benefits. In this article we introduce the concept of intra-cell roaming-based infrastructure sharing, where the MNOs may switch off their BSs and roam their traffic to active BSs operated by other MNOs in the same cell. Motivated by the coexistence of multiple operators in the same area, we present possible network deployments and architectures in current and future cellular scenarios, discussing their particular characteristics. In addition, we propose an innovative distributed game theoretic BS switching off scheme, employing an integrated cost function that takes into account all the different cases for a given operator to serve its own traffic (i.e. through active BSs of neighboring cells or exploiting intra-cell roaming-based infrastructure sharing). Finally, we demonstrate some indicative simulation results in realistic scenarios to quantify the potential energy and financial benefits that our proposed scheme offers to the MNOs in multi-operator environments, providing them with the necessary incentives to participate in the infrastructure sharing.	coexist (image);loss function;mnos;simulation;theory	Angelos Antonopoulos;Elli Kartsakli;Alexandra Bousia;Luis Alonso;Christos V.

In this paper, we investigate the joint optimal placement of virtual service chains consisting of virtual application functions (components) and the steering of traffic through them, over a 5G multi-technology edge network model consisting of both Ethernet and mmWave links. This problem is NP-hard. We provide a comprehensive “microscopic” binary integer program to model the system, along with a heuristic that is one order of magnitude faster than solving the corresponding binary integer program. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the benefits of managing virtual service chains (by distributing them over the edge network) compared to a baseline “middlebox” approach in terms of overall admissible virtual capacity. We observe significant gains when deploying mmWave links that complement the Ethernet physical infrastructure. Moreover, most of the gains are attributed to only 30% of these mmWave links.	augmented reality;baseline (configuration management);edge computing;heuristic;integer programming;linear programming;middlebox;network model;requirement;robot;solution architecture	Nabeel Akhtar;Ibrahim Matta;Ali Raza;Leonardo Goratti;Torsten Braun;Flavio Esposito	2018	2018 4th IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization and Workshops (NetSoft)	10.1109/NETSOFT.2018.8460097	virtualization;latency (engineering);enhanced data rates for gsm evolution;augmented reality;ethernet;distributed computing;core network;middlebox;computer science;edge computing	HPC	20.51235678418347	89.06557790602683	194673

On one hand, the massive scale of visual data transmission brings a huge challenge to the RAN. On the other, the abundant information in visual big data may improve the spectrum efficiency and robustness of visual communications. In this article, we propose a DaC-RAN architecture for visual communications, which integrates the ideas of SDN and C-RAN. We propose to separate the control and data planes in the conventional infrastructure, and integrate a new data plane specifically designed for visual communications into the virtual base station. We demonstrate the proposed DaC-RAN architecture through a practical visual communication system based on pseudo-analog transmission and CSbased data sampling and reconstruction. The correlation information retrieved from visual big data is utilized as prior knowledge in CS decoding. Preliminary simulation evaluations show that significant gain is achieved in spectrum efficiency over the conventional method.	analog transmission;big data;c-ran;emergence;forwarding plane;radio access network;sampling (signal processing);simulation;software-defined networking;spectral efficiency	Jun Wu;Dian Liu;Chong Luo;Hao Cui;Feng Wu	2015	IEEE Wireless Communications	10.1109/MWC.2015.7143336	iterative reconstruction;big data;visualization;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;world wide web;computer security;computer network	Mobile	23.53807965270164	95.568411840577	194813

Collisions occur when tags using backscatter technology report their IDs to the reader at the same carrier frequency simultaneously. The performance of tag identification is degraded by collisions, so it is important to address the tag collision problem. Several anti-collision protocols have been proposed for reducing tag collisions. They can be categorized into two classes: ALOHA-based and tree-based protocols. This paper proposes a 4-ary query tree-based anti-collision protocol, namely the parallel response query tree (PRQT) protocol, to improve the performance of tag identification. In the PRQT protocol, the tags with the ID prefix matching either the reader’s request bit string or the complementary of the string are arranged to respond in two subcarriers in parallel. The PRQT protocol is analyzed, simulated, and compared with related ones to demonstrate its advantages.	backscatter (email);bit array;carrier frequency;categorization;circuit design;collision problem;iteration;radio-frequency identification;simulation;subcarrier	Ming-Kuei Yeh;Jehn-Ruey Jiang;Shing-Tsaan Huang	2014	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2014.064423	radio-frequency identification;computer science;distributed computing;world wide web	Mobile	10.45072315002689	94.06621694865193	195300

This paper addresses joint multipath rate control and scheduling for SVC-encoded video transmission over wireless mesh networks WMNs. Each video stream is assumed to use multipath routing and to possess a staircase utility function. Using the conflict graph that represents the interference-limited model, we formulate the problem as one of maximising the sum of source utilities subject to transport and link layers constraints. The multipath routing over wireless channels and staircase utilities yield a non-convex optimisation problem. To attain a convex formulation, we adopt multimodal sigmoid approximation and exploit utility-proportional fairness approach. Then, employing dual decomposition, we devise a distributed algorithm for joint multipath rate control and scheduling in WMNs. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our endeavor toward achieving cross-layer optimisation for video transmission in WMNs.	mesh networking;multipath propagation;scheduling (computing);wireless mesh network	Mohammad Hassan Hajiesmaili;Mohammad Sadegh Talebi;Ahmad Khonsari	2014	IJAHUC	10.1504/IJAHUC.2014.061001	real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;computer science;multipath routing;computer network	Mobile	15.065990771853285	94.4197214735333	195537
c752b2de4f79a98a7c197f94648ba89ce492c388	meeting real-time constraint of spectrum management in tv black-space access		The TV set feedback feature standardized in the next generation TV system, ATSC 3.0, would enable opportunistic access of active TV channels in future Cognitive Radio Networks. This new dynamic spectrum access approach is named as black-space access, as it is complementary of current TV white space, which stands for inactive TV channels. TV black-space access can significantly increase the available spectrum of Cognitive Radio Networks in populated urban markets, where spectrum shortage is most severe while TV whitespace is very limited. However, to enable TV black-space access, secondary user has to evacuate a TV channel in a timely manner when TV user comes in. Such strict real-time constraint is an unique challenge of spectrum management infrastructure of Cognitive Radio Networks. In this paper, the real-time performance of spectrum management with regard to the degree of centralization of infrastructure is modeled and tested. Based on collected empirical network latency and database response time, we analyze the average evacuation time under four structures of spectrum management infrastructure: fully distribution, city-wide centralization, national-wide centralization, and semi-national centralization. The results show that national wide centralization may not meet the real-time requirement, while semi-national centralization that use multiple co-located independent spectrum manager can achieve real-time performance while keep most of the operational advantage of fully centralized structure.

With the 5G springing up, the style of how people acquire, manage and engage with information will change. To meet this growing trend, a grouping-oriented admission control is proposed. The traditional heterogeneous network improves itself to realize anti-frequency networking by small base stations deployed in L-TEA and WLAN. The small base stations in one groups working in different frequency enhance the system energy efficiency. The strategy improves the quality of service users markedly. The simulation results shed light on that the admission control strategy really has a good effect on the improvement of the system performance.	compaq lte;control theory;display resolution;fifth generation computer;mathematical optimization;network architecture;program optimization;quality of service;simulation;tea	Rongrong Xing;Jie Zeng;Xin Su;Tiejun Lv;Hui Gao	2015	2015 10th International Conference on Communications and Networking in China (ChinaCom)	10.1109/CHINACOM.2015.7497908	simulation;heterogeneous network;telecommunications;computer science;lte advanced;operating system;computer network	Robotics	24.400029417748115	92.00404533995292	196086

When multiple-group communications are implemented in such networks, the scheduling algorithm should generate appropriate schedule assignments for all the transmissions where the objective aims to reduce the schedule length. In this paper, the problem of producing an efficient schedule sequence for multiple-group communications over a STDMA node scheduling network is referred to as an integrated multiple-group communication and traffic-oriented node scheduling (IMCTNS) problem. It is shown that the IMCTNS problem can be formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. A polynomial-time centralized heuristic scheduling algorithm, designated as Broadcasting Level-by-Level Scheduling (B-LBLS), is proposed for determining the schedule sequence subject to transmission constraints. To enhance the spatial utilization efficiency within each time slot, an advanced version of B-LBLS, designated as Collision-Allowed Level-by-Level Scheduling (CA-LBLS), is proposed based on a modified graph-based interference model. It is shown that compared to existing TDMA- and STDMA-based algorithms, the proposed algorithms provide an effective reduction in the schedule frame length and a significant increase in the spatial utilization within each time slot.	multicast;scheduling (computing)	Jung-Shian Li;Kun-Hsuan Liu;Chien-Hung Wu	2012	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2012.03.016	fair-share scheduling;real-time computing;dynamic priority scheduling;computer science;rate-monotonic scheduling;genetic algorithm scheduling;two-level scheduling;distributed computing;round-robin scheduling;multiprocessor scheduling;computer network	Mobile	12.651455964629221	94.19444775165466	196125

The CRN base station may not know the channel states of all the users. The multiple channels are available at random times. In this setup Opportunistic Splitting can be an attractive solution. A disadvantage of this algorithm is that it requires the metrics of all users to be an independent, identically distributed sequence. However we use a recently generalized version of this algorithm in which the optimal parameters are learnt on-line through stochastic approximation and metrics can be Markov. We provide scheduling algorithms which maximize weighted-sum system throughput or are throughput or delay optimal. We also consider the scenario when some traffic streams are delay sensitive.	approximation algorithm;cognitive radio;markov chain;online and offline;quality of service;real-time clock;real-time transcription;requirement;scheduling (computing);stochastic approximation;throughput	M.

Ensuring QoS is one of the challenges faced by wireless network operators, which include the provision of high mobility speeds, thus the implementation of a seamless and fast handover between network cells is a prominent issue that must be addressed, especially when fulfilling QoS prerequisites. Long Term Evolution (LTE)/LTE-Advance has met these demands of QoS through the use of a new Radio AccessNetwork and distribution ofRadioResourceManagement including the handover decision technique to evolve NodeB instead of relying on centralized control. In this paper, we review the control plane structure of LTE/LTE-A and present a comprehensive discussion of handover procedures such as the phases, techniques, requirements, features, and challenges involved.

Recently, strong physical layer capabilities enabled by multiuser detection techniques have been studied in connection with simple medium access control protocols. We think that neither of these extreme approaches is optimum, in particular for general scenarios where network nodes with different signal processing capabilities coexist. Instead of dealing with interferences in either of the two layers alone, both medium access control and physical layer functionalities should cooperate and complement each other. We discuss several key aspects for designing such a new type of protocol, especially with an emphasis on iterative multiuser detection, which can provide a good tradeoff between performance and complexity. We propose a new protocol which satisfies these key aspects. We analyze its throughput bound and also perform numerical simulations. The results evidence excellent throughput improvements.	access control;channel state information;coexist (image);computer simulation;fairness measure;interference (communication);iterative method;mud;multi-user;network topology;numerical analysis;phy (chip);quality of service;requirement;signal processing;spectral efficiency;throughput	Katsutoshi Kusume;Robert Vilzmann;Andreas Müller;Christian Hartmann;Gerhard Bauch	2007	IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2007.155	vehicular ad hoc network;wireless ad hoc network;optimized link state routing protocol;media access control;mobile ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;ad hoc wireless distribution service;signal processing;distributed computing;multiple access with collision avoidance for wireless;computer network	Mobile	11.417956312163309	91.1308235927804	197073
969abd01513ed516ececb55e21fc6bfd8bb5b1d0	route selection over clustered cognitive radio networks: an experimental evaluation		Abstract Cognitive radio (CR) is the next-generation wireless communication system that allows unlicensed users (or secondary users, SUs) to explore and exploit the underutilized licensed spectrum (or white spaces) owned by licensed users (or primary users, PUs) in an opportunistic manner. This paper proposes a route selection scheme over a clustered cognitive radio network (CRN) that enables SUs to form clusters, and a SU source node to search for a route to its destination node. An intrinsic characteristic of CRN is the dynamicity of operating environment in which network conditions (i.e., PUs’ activities) change as time goes by. Based on the network conditions, SUs form clusters whose cluster sizes are based on the number of available common channels in a cluster, select a common operating channel for each cluster, and search for a route over a clustered CRN using an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning. Majority of the research related to CRNs has been limited to theoretical and simulation studies, and testbed investigation focusing on physical and data link layers. This investigation is a proof of concept focusing on the network layer of a route selection scheme over a clustered CRN in a universal software radio peripheral (USRP)/ GNU radio platform. Experimental results show that the proposed route selection scheme improves cluster stability by reducing the number of route breakages caused by route switches, and network scalability by reducing the number of clusters in the network without significant deterioration of quality of service, including throughput, packet delivery rate, and end-to-end delay.	cognitive radio	Mariam Musavi;Kok-Lim Alvin Yau;Aqeel Raza Syed;Hafizal Mohamad;Nordin Bin Ramli	2018	Computer Communications	10.1016/j.comcom.2018.07.035	throughput;computer network;computer science;quality of service;network layer;universal software radio peripheral;scalability;cognitive radio;network packet;communication channel	Mobile	11.067247602556133	89.55488726422014	197352

Deploying optical fiber in the access network, however, requires a huge investment, therefore optimization of the physical infrastructure plays an important role. In the recent years, algorithmic access network design became viable, mainly due to the existence of digital maps and Geographic Information System (GIS) databases. In the previous work, we have proposed technology-dependent, scalable heuristics for Passive Optical Network (PON) and Active Ethernet (AETH) network design. In this paper, we present a novel technology-independent solution based on the Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristics for tree-based point-to-multipoint optical access network topologies. The newly proposed heuristics deliver competitive results, within 5-10% of the theoretical optimum, even for scenarios with up to thousands of demand points. The key for scalability is the concept Voronoi-diagrams applied for demand point clustering and evaluation within the Simulated Annealing scheme.	access network;algorithm;approximation;cluster analysis;database;display resolution;geographic information system;heuristic (computer science);integer programming;linear programming;map;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;multipoint ground;network planning and design;network topology;next-generation access;next-generation network;optical fiber;passive optical network;point-to-multipoint communication;scalability;simulated annealing;software deployment;theory;voronoi diagram	Attila Mitcsenkov;Peter Bakos;Géza Paksy;Tibor Cinkler	2013	2013 17th International Conference on Optical Networking Design and Modeling (ONDM)		mathematical optimization;voronoi diagram;simulated annealing;computational geometry;computer science;theoretical computer science;heuristics;distributed computing;next-generation access;network topology;computer network;logical topology	EDA	22.74808300313842	95.34725857757961	197827

The problem is formulated as one of a cross layer network utility maximization that considers the interaction of transport, MAC, and physical layers in the protocol stack. Assuming physical model for successful transmission, a tractable formula for link throughput as a function of link attempt rate and power vectors is derived. Considering the effect of self-interference in analysis, an algorithm for adjusting the sessions rate and links state, i.e., links attempt rate and power, is derived. Sessions rate and links state are coordinated by congestion signals feedback to sources and messages broadcasted by links respectively. Analysis and simulation results show that adjusting the link state can mitigate the interference and improve the utilization of network resources. Also, it is shown that for a given link at the equilibrium, the link state should be adjusted on the basis of the link location in the network. This result emphasizes that in MHWN, MAC should be designed by considering both time and space contentions between links, which in turn, are provided by adjusting the links attempt rate and power.	access control;bottleneck (network);cobham's thesis;concave function;convex function;convex optimization;exptime;entropy maximization;expectation–maximization algorithm;interference (communication);link-state routing protocol;loss function;mathematical optimization;network congestion;network utility;numerical analysis;optimization problem;protocol stack;simulation;social inequality;software deployment;throughput;transmitter;transport layer security	Abdorasoul Ghasemi;Karim Faez	2007	IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications	10.1109/ICC.2007.571	wireless application protocol;telecommunications;physical model;computer science;access control;wireless network;distributed computing;link-state routing protocol;spread spectrum;transport layer;physical layer;computer network	Mobile	15.736501495664948	93.98612670125807	198519
e77f4feb9574277a2378a7461846ad1f4b4c40fa	intelligent algorithm for spectrum mobility in cognitive wireless networks		Currently the growing demand for wireless communications users has generated the study and implementation of cognitive wireless networks. To find a channel with the required characteristics for the continuous communication of the secondary users is essential for spectral mobility, in cognitive wireless networks. This paper presents a fuzzy algorithm for the spectrum decision function and in particular for the selection of a backup channel in spectral mobility. The proposed fuzzy algorithm is based on decision-making multiple criteria. This paper proposes a benchmarking of performance of the two spectrum handoff models: Analytical Hierarchical Process and the proposed Fuzzy Algorithm. The metric evaluations used are an accumulative average of failed handoffs, accumulative average of performed handoffs and, average of transmission bandwidth. The proposed algorithm provides an effective frequency channel selection. The results show a reduction of the rate of channel changes in contrast to the AHP selection method. © 2016 The Authors.

e927bad7f6e9338d93fa714f16b6b40dd1495f17	reduced-complexity delay-efficient throughput-optimal distributed scheduling with heterogeneously delayed network-state information		We consider the problem of distributed scheduling in wireless communication networks where heterogeneously delayed queue lengths and channel states of all links are available at all the transmitters. In an earlier work (by Reddy et al. in Queueing Systems, 2012), a throughput-optimal scheduling policy (which we refer to henceforth as the R policy) for this setting was proposed. We study the R policy, and examine its two drawbacks — (i) its huge computational complexity, and (ii) its non-optimal average per-packet queueing delay. We show that the R policy unnecessarily constrains itself to work with information that is more delayed than that afforded by the system. We propose a new distributed scheduling policy that fully exploits the common state information available to all transmitters, thereby greatly improving upon the computational complexity and the delay performance relative to those of the R policy. We also establish the throughput optimality of our policy analytically. We evaluate the performance of the proposed policy and validate our analytical results through extensive numerical simulation. Thus, our work enlarges the ambit of networks for which throughput-optimal scheduling is practicable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

9711c7eaf25058ac8ccf691082e31e3e0eae867c	social-based broadcast in cognitive radio networks: a network coding perspective	social computing;internet of things;decision support systems;handheld computers;conferences;green computing	Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising technology to improve spectrum utilization. However, spectrum availability is uncertain which mainly depends on primary user's (PU's) behaviors. Broadcast is the most basic way to disseminate data from one source node to all the others in multi-channel cognitive radio networks (CRNs), and the retransmission can be a vital factor for improving broadcast performance. Existing works fail to exploit the unique characteristic of reliable broadcast or the broadcast nature of wireless links, which will lead to redundant transmissions and broadcast performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a social-based scheme for network coding based broadcast in CRNs, in which the source node combines all lost packets into a single one for retransmission by random linear network coding (RLNC), considering channel assignment in CRNs. We evaluate and compare the proposed scheme against other traditional retransmission mechanism with channel assignment. It is shown that the proposed scheme, by integrating social feature with network coding can obtain much better results, with respect to the average number of transmissions per packet.	cognitive radio;elegant degradation;linear network coding;network packet;one-class classification;retransmission (data networks)	Xiaoxiong Zhong;Renhao Lu;Li Li	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things (iThings) and IEEE Green Computing and Communications (GreenCom) and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing (CPSCom) and IEEE Smart Data (SmartData)	10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.104	broadcast domain;green computing;embedded system;broadcast radiation;atomic broadcast;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;multimedia broadcast multicast service;computer security;internet of things;social computing;computer network	Mobile	11.407159156064244	89.11957024474367	199238

The OFDM scheduling problem can be modeled as a discrete-time multi-source multi-server queuing system with time-varying connectivity. For such a system, the Max-Weight policy is known to be throughput-optimal and the Server-Side Greedy (SSG) policy has been recently shown to achieve small queue lengths for i.i.d. arrival processes. However, there is often significant difference between queue-length optimality and delay optimality, and there exist arrival patterns such that algorithms with small queue backlog can still lead to large delay. In this work, we propose a new OFDM scheduling algorithm that gives preference to packets with large delay. Assuming ON-OFF channels, we show that for a large class of arrival processes, the proposed policy is rate-function delay-optimal. We substantiate the result via both analysis and simulation.	existential quantification;greedy algorithm;multi-source;scheduling (computing);server (computing);server-side;simulation;symbolic stream generator;telecommunications link;throughput	Manu Sharma;Xiaojun Lin	2011	2011 Information Theory and Applications Workshop	10.1109/ITA.2011.5743589	job shop scheduling;real-time computing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;markov process;scheduling;statistics;computer network	Metrics	18.265564626268098	96.18096723837569	199746
