c3be636bb46b348f70038060222e6bb9048566e7	user location in picocells - a paging algorithm derived from measured data		We present a new paging algorithm for wireless networks with ultra-short-range radio access links (picocells). The ubiquitous office (u-office) network is a good example of such a network, and we present some u-office example applications. In addition, we show that conventional paging algorithms are not feasible in such networks. Therefore, we derived a new paging algorithm from the measurement results of an experimental sensor network with short-range wireless links deployed in our office. We equipped persons with sensors and deployed sensor readers at selected places in our office. The sensors transmit messages to the sensor readers at regular intervals. If no sensor reader is in range, the message is lost. Our main observation is that, if a picocell shows an attraction property to a certain person, the residence time of an attached mobile terminal is not gamma distributed (as described in the literature) and the probability of long-lasting residences increases. Thus, if the residence time is larger than a certain threshold, the probability of a long-lasting residence time increases if a sensor reader location has an attraction property to a person. Based on this observation, our proposed paging algorithm registers the location of the mobile terminal only when the residence time in the cell is longer than a predetermined constant. By appropriately setting this constant, we can significantly reduce the registration message frequency while ensuring that the probability of the network successfully connecting to a mobile terminal remains high. key words: field data analysis, paging, picocells, ubiquitous networks	algorithm;mobile phone;norm (social);paging;sensor	Stephan Wanke;Hiroshi Saito;Yutaka Arakawa;Shinsuke Shimogawa	2010	IEICE Transactions			Mobile	20.340724174807942	71.53579082400125	59013

In contrast to digital positioning based on a three-transistor cell [3], this new approach has the capability of generating multiple bits from a more compact two-transistor cell. The basic properties and reliability aspects of this PUF are studied based on the test chips fabricated in a commercial 40nm CMOS technology. The breakdown positions in high density arrays have been characterized, proving that indeed multiple bits can be generated from a single nFET. Through consecutive measurements, the long-term stability is found to be reduced, due to shrinking of readout window, especially when more bits are generated. Finally, high temperature also negatively impact the stability, indicating that the analog BD-PUF is a lesser promising candidate for PUF application than the previously presented binarized design.	analog;bit cell;blu-ray;cmos;catabolism;crystal structure;disintegration (morphologic abnormality);exanthema;fever;mental suffering;mike lesser;numerous;physical unclonable function;transistor;transistors;window function	K.

As 3D integration is becoming a promising technology for next-generation chip design, recent years have seen a huge proliferation of research literature exploiting it from a security perspective. This paper presents a survey on the current state of 3D integration technology from a security perspective and summarizes its security opportunities and challenges. We report current research work on 3D integration based security in three major applications: supply chain attack prevention, side-channel attack mitigation, and trustworthy computing system design. The security advantages and opportunities of 3D integration in these security applications are highlighted. Besides, the paper discusses new vulnerabilities risen by 3D integration that require researchers' attention. Based on the survey result, we summarize the distinct characteristics of 3D ICs and investigate their impacts on security-aware 3D IC designs.	adversary (cryptography);central processing unit;computation;control plane;emergence;emoticon;focus stacking;global network;hardware trojan;image scaling;input/output;netlist;reverse engineering;schematic;scientific literature;side-channel attack;supply chain attack;systems design;three-dimensional integrated circuit;transistor;trojan horse (computing);trust anchor;trustworthy computing;user (computing)	Yang Xie;Chongxi Bao;Caleb Serafy;Tiantao Lu;Ankur Srivastava;Mark Mohammad Tehranipoor	2016	IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems	10.1109/TMSCS.2016.2550460	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;computer security	Arch	12.034346841870414	61.26658048138977	59320

Evaluations of such methods using benchmarks and academically known attacks are not always equivalent to the dynamic attack scenarios that can arise in the real world. For this reason, we apply a red team/blue team approach to stress-test the abilities of the FANCI prototype.  In the Embedded Systems Challenge (ESC) 2013, teams from research groups from multiple continents created designs with backdoors hidden in them as part of a red team effort to circumvent FANCI. Notably, these backdoors were not placed into a priori known designs. The red team was allowed to create arbitrary, unspecified designs. Two interesting results came out of this effort. The first was that FANCI was surprisingly resilient to this wide variety of attacks and was not circumvented by any of the stealthy backdoors created by the red teams. The second result is that frequent-action backdoors, which are non-stealthy backdoors, were often successful. These results emphasize the importance of combining FANCI with a reasonable degree of validation testing. The blue team efforts also exposed some areas where the FANCI prototype could be made more performant, which motivates further development of the prototype.	algorithm;backdoor (computing);benchmark (computing);embedded system;prototype;stress testing	Adam Waksman;Jeyavijayan Rajendran;Matthew Suozzo;Simha Sethumadhavan	2014	2014 51st ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)	10.1145/2593069.2596666	functional analysis;embedded system;algorithm design;electronic engineering;logic synthesis;simulation;logic gate;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;artificial intelligence;prototype;software testing;computer security;algorithm;intellectual property	EDA	12.118701112857362	63.28024832612029	60084

The energy requirements of such streaming can be prohibitive, given the competing considerations of form factor and battery life requirements. Making intelligent decisions on the node about which data to store or transmit, and which to ignore, is a promising method of reducing energy consumption. Artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers are among several competitive techniques for such data selection. However, no systematic metrics exist for determining if an ANN classifier is suited for a particular resource constrained computing environment of a typical BSN node. An especially difficult task is assessing, at the design stage, which classifier architectures are feasible on a given resource-constrained node, what computational resources are required to execute a given classifier, and what classification performance might be achieved by a particular classifier on a given set of resources. This paper describes techniques for quantifying and predicting the performance of ANN classifiers on wearable sensor nodes using scalable synthetic test data. Additionally, the paper shows a comparison of synthetic data with gait data collected using an inertial BSN node, and classification results of the gait data using a cerebellar model arithmetic computer (CMAC) architecture show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.	artificial neural network;central processing unit;cerebellar model articulation controller;computational resource;data aggregation;naive bayes classifier;one-key mac;requirement;scalability;software deployment;synthetic data;synthetic intelligence;test data;wearable computer	Harry C.

In this paper we consider the problem of tracking in WiMAX networks depending on SCORE observations.

This paper proposes an improved localization scheme, FLEXOR, which divides the localization area into cells to reduce computational overhead and provide two localization modes: region mode and coordinate mode. In the performance evaluations, FLEXOR has been proved to have the advantages of fast localization, flexibility, and it also provides the high localization accuracy as LANDMARC.	global positioning system;interference (communication);internationalization and localization;overhead (computing);radar;radio-frequency identification	Kuen-Liang Sue;Chung-Hsien Tsai;Ming-Hua Lin	2006		10.1007/11919568_31	radio-frequency identification;embedded system;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	22.82098272830924	73.7563503100482	61182
51e8789249a756be6a4b6b33e741856cada68ba2	robust design-for-security architecture for enabling trust in ic manufacturing and test		Due to the prohibitive costs of semiconductor manufacturing, most system-on-chip design companies outsource their production to offshore foundries. As most of these devices are manufactured in environments of limited trust that often lack appropriate oversight, a number of different threats have emerged. These include unauthorized overproduction of the integrated circuits (ICs), sale of out-of-specification/rejected ICs discarded by manufacturing tests, piracy of intellectual property, and reverse engineering of the designs. Over the years, researchers have proposed different metering and obfuscation techniques to enable trust in outsourced IC manufacturing, where the design is obfuscated by modifying the underlying functionality and only activated by using a secure obfuscation key. However, Boolean satisfiability-based algorithms have been shown to efficiently break key-based obfuscation methods, and thus circumvent the primary objectives of metering and obfuscation. In this paper, we present a novel secure cell design for implementing the design-for-security infrastructure to prevent leaking the key to an adversary under any circumstances. Importantly, our design does not limit the testability of the chip during the normal manufacturing flow in any way, including postsilicon validation and debug. Our proposed design is resistant to various known attacks at the cost of a very little (< 1%) area overhead.	adversary (cryptography);algorithm;authorization;boolean satisfiability problem;integrated circuit;outsourcing;overhead (computing);reverse engineering;semiconductor device fabrication;software testability;system on a chip	Ujjwal Guin;Ziqi Zhou;Adit D.

Experimental results demonstrate our proposed algorithm outperforms and more than 20 percent reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) has been achieved, through comparisons with some other existing algorithms. Moreover, it has also been verified that number of training locations can be reduced without too much performance degradation.	algorithm;elegant degradation;experiment;location-based service;mean squared error;rss	Lei Wang;Lawrence Wai-Choong Wong	2012	2012 6th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems	10.1109/ICSPCS.2012.6507962	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	EDA	20.840415314808503	74.28050163344479	61262

To address this problem, we propose utilizing configurable ring oscillators and an orthogonal re-initialization scheme to improve repeatability. An implementation on a Xilinx Spartan-3e field-programmable gate array was tested on nine different chips. Experimental results show that the bit flip rate is reduced from 1.5% to approximately 0 at a fixed supply voltage and room temperature. Over a 20 °C-80 °C temperature range and 25% variation in supply voltage, the bit flip rate is reduced from 1.56% to 3.125×10-7.	digital electronics;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;machine learning;repeatability;server (computing);side-channel attack	Haile Yu;Philip Heng Wai Leong;Qiang Xu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2173770	embedded system;electronic engineering;computer hardware;programmable logic array;computer science;engineering;ring oscillator;field-programmable gate array;integrated circuit design	Arch	13.90813805523665	63.36983484662171	61904

In such a system, video compression and wireless transmission are the major operations on each video node. For a battery-powered wireless video sensor, it is essential to maximize the power efficiency of these two operations. Currently, H.264/AVC is the most widely used ITU-T and ISO/IEC video coding standard. Previous works on determining the trade-off between compression and transmission that minimizes energy consumption consider oversimplified coding configurations, thus not taking full advantage of the flexibility and advanced features of H.264/AVC. Choosing the right configuration and setting parameters that lead to optimal encoding performance is of prime importance for video sensor network (VSN) applications, especially since VSN is constrained in terms of bandwidth and energy resources. This paper studies the relationship between the picture quality, the transmission rate, and the complexity of the encoder to expound the energy consumption trade-off between encoding and transmission in VSN. The results of our study can be used as guidelines in optimizing the overall power consumption of a VSN system as it detailed in the paper.	data compression;encoder;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;iso/iec 646;image quality;performance per watt;video coding format;video sensor technology;visual sensor network	Bambang A.

Perhaps the best known uses of video compression standards are for videoconferencing and for digital storage media and broadcast. In the case of videoconferencing, the field has been dominated by standards issued by the ITU-T, including H.261 and H.263. In the case of compressed video for storage, playback and broadcast, the ISO standards MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 have dominated. Spurred on by third generation cellular and the promise of wideband wireless connectivity, activity in the area mobile multimedia applications has increased dramatically. Wireless networks present a new challenge for multimedia system designers. This is mainly due to the high sensitivity of these bitstreams to channel errors. Many new video compression tools that address error resilience have been included in the latest voluntary international multimedia standard, MPEG-4. This standard combines both the properties of real-time communications and one-way entertainment applications. Furthermore, MPEG4 includes a number of new tools in the realm of video coding which provide error resilient coding for transmission of video over error prone channels. This paper provides an overview of the video error resilience tools of MPEG-4. Results are provided which demonstrate the performance of these tools when operating in a typical wireless environment.

27c77dff25ce6e409de15dff26b987b5ff2dba8c	a survey on silicon pufs and recent advances in ring oscillator pufs		Silicon physical unclonable function (PUF) is a popular hardware security primitive that exploits the intrinsic variation of IC manufacturing process to generate chip-unique information for various security related applications. For example, the PUF information can be used as a chip identifier, a secret key, the seed for a random number generator, or the response to a given challenge. Due to the unpredictability and irreplicability of IC manufacturing variation, silicon PUF has emerged as a promising hardware security primitive and gained a lot of attention over the past few years. In this article, we first give a survey on the current state-of-the-art of silicon PUFs, then analyze known attacks to PUFs and the countermeasures. After that we discuss PUF-based applications, highlight some recent research advances in ring oscillator PUFs, and conclude with some challenges and opportunities in PUF research and applications.	identifier;key (cryptography);physical unclonable function;random number generation;ring oscillator	Jiliang Zhang;Gang Qu;Yong-Qiang Lv;Qiang Zhou	2014	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	10.1007/s11390-014-1458-1	physical unclonable function;computer security	Crypto	13.611723163727959	63.82654204280028	65678

Indoor location information, e.g. which room a user is located, is precious for applications such as location based services, mobility prediction, personal health care, network resource allocation, etc. Since the GPS signal is missing, another form of identification for each location is needed. WiFi is a potential candidate due to its easy availability. However, it is very noisy and missing excessively due to the limited range of access points.

Modern FPGA devices can have part of their logic partially reconfigured during runtime operation, which we propose to exploit to realize a general-purpose, flexible and reconfigurable DPA countermeasure that can be integrated into any FPGA-based system, irrespective of the cryptographic algorithm or implementation. We propose a real-time dynamic closed-loop on-chip noise generation countermeasure which consists of an on-chip power monitor coupled with a low-overhead Gaussian noise generator. The noise generator is reconfigured continuously to update its generated noise amplitude and variance so that is sufficiently hides the computation power consumption. Our scheme and its integration onto an SoC is presented as well as our proposal for evaluating its effectiveness and overhead.	algorithm;computation;cryptography;encryption;field-programmable gate array;general-purpose markup language;noise generator;overhead (computing);real-time clock;reconfigurable computing;system on a chip	Ghada Dessouky;Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi	2016		10.1145/2939918.2942426	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;computer security;noise generator;field-programmable gate array	EDA	12.910900878220067	63.936460735922644	65997

In this paper, we formally describe, design, implement and evaluate a novel localization system, called Spotlight. Our system uses the spatio-temporal properties of well controlled events in the network (e.g., light), to obtain the locations of sensor nodes. We demonstrate that a high accuracy in localization can be achieved without the aid of expensive hardware on the sensor nodes, as required by other localization systems. We evaluate the performance of our system in deployments of Mica2 and XSM motes. Through performance evaluations of a real system deployed outdoors, we obtain a 20cm localization error. A sensor network, with any number of nodes, deployed in a 2500m2 area, can be localized in under 10 minutes, using a device that costs less than $1000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a sub-meter localization error, obtained in an outdoor environment, without equipping the wireless sensor nodes with specialized ranging hardware.	dbpedia;internationalization and localization;sensor	Radu Stoleru;Tian He;John A.

Although many WSN-based SHM systems have been deployed, we notice that the design of many systems has deviated from the real requirements in SHM. For example, many systems focus on energy-efficiency, which is however not the requirements for many SHM applications where only a-few-hour data collection is required. A large portion of the existing systems strives to improve wireless throughput, which we believe, is not a viable approach for data-intensive SHM applications. On the other hand, some real requirements in SHM, such as high-frequency and synchronized sensing with real-time onboard data storage, fast, reliable and unified wakeup of sensor nodes in the presence of some events, and embedding efficient and effective SHM algorithms in resource-limited sensor nodes, etc., have not been fully addressed. In this paper, we designed a practical WSN-based platform called SenetSHM. SenetSHM leverages novel techniques to handle the above problems and can be configured for various SHM applications. We share our experiences by stepping from the hardware and software design of the SenetSHM.	algorithm;computer data storage;data-intensive computing;ibm notes;real-time clock;requirement;scalability;software deployment;software design;stepping level;super high material cd;throughput;vii	Xuefeng Liu;Jiannong Cao;Peng Guo	2016	2016 IEEE International Conferences on Big Data and Cloud Computing (BDCloud), Social Computing and Networking (SocialCom), Sustainable Computing and Communications (SustainCom) (BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom)	10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.68	embedded system;synchronization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;reliability;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;accelerometer;wireless	Embedded	10.717403214320822	73.23557933509232	66916

105c78d9c72f123037ed03752775ce930931fe88	novel bypass attack and bdd-based tradeoff analysis against all known logic locking attacks		Logic locking has emerged as a promising technique for protecting gate-level semiconductor intellectual property. However, recent work has shown that such gate-level locking techniques are vulnerable to Boolean satisfiability (SAT) attacks. In order to thwart such attacks, several SAT-resistant logic locking techniques have been proposed, which minimize the discriminating ability of input patterns to rule out incorrect keys. In this work, we show that such SAT-resistant logic locking techniques have their own set of unique vulnerabilities. In particular, we propose a novel “bypass attack” that ensures the locked circuit works even when an incorrect key is applied. Such a technique makes it possible for an adversary to be oblivious to the type of SAT-resistant protection applied on the circuit, and still be able to restore the circuit to its correct functionality. We show that such a bypass attack is feasible on a wide range of benchmarks and SAT-resistant techniques, while incurring minimal run-time and area/delay overhead. Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) are utilized to analyze the proposed bypass attack and assess tradeoffs in security vs overhead of various countermeasures.	adversary (cryptography);benchmark (computing);binary decision diagram;boolean satisfiability problem;lock (computer science);overhead (computing);semiconductor	Xiaolin Xu;Bicky Shakya;Mark M.

5217eaea6c356ec418928977d38fb15c9eec615f	energy efficient wireless sensor networks utilizing adaptive dictionary in compressed sensing		Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are fundamental blocks of Internet of Things (IoT) which made it to proliferate into many real-time diversified applications. Typically, WSN nodes are small and battery powered devices. Hence, energy efficient data aggregation method which maximizes the network lifetime is the paramount importance. Compressed Sensing (CS) is one of the approaches proves to be very promising for energy efficient data aggregation in WSN. The sparsity of the sensor data can change significantly due to their time varying nature and it affects the recovery of the measured signal. Most of the existing CS aided data aggregation methods for WSN are neither optimized nor address the issue of change in data sparsity, which demands additional energy to maintain low reconstruction accuracy. Thus, variation in the sparsity of the sensor data makes data aggregation to be energy inefficient that inherently reduces network lifetime. To overcome this, we propose an optimal method for CS-WSN where we use a dictionary as a sparsifier that learns with adaptive sparse training data. The proposed method achieves minimum reconstruction error by accounting changes in the data sparsity while data can be delivered to the sink with low energy consumption thereby improving energy efficiency.	compressed sensing;data aggregation;dictionary;internet of things;real-time clock;sparse matrix	Amarlingam Madapu;Pradeep Kumar Mishra;P.

In this paper, we review current on-chip global interconnect structures and develop simple models to analyze their architecture-level performance. We propose a general framework to design and optimize a new category of global interconnect based on on-chip transmission line (T-line) technology. We perform a group of experiments using six different global interconnection structures to discover their differences in terms of latency, energy per bit, throughput, area, and signal integrity over several technology nodes. Our results show that T-line structures have the potential to outperform conventional repeated RC wires at future technology nodes to achieve higher performance while using less power and improving the reliability of wire communication. Our results also show that on-chip equalization is helpful to improve throughput, signal integrity, and power efficiency.	crosstalk;eb/n0;electrical connection;elegant degradation;experiment;flops;flip-flop (electronics);futures studies;high-throughput computing;image scaling;interconnection;linear model;low-power broadcasting;maxima and minima;multidimensional digital pre-distortion;performance per watt;pipeline (computing);profiling (computer programming);signal integrity;single-ended signaling;t-line;throughput;transistor;transistor–transistor logic;transmission line;vii	Yulei Zhang;Xiang Hu;Alina Deutsch;A.

Localisation in WSN plays a crucial role in implementing myriad of applications such as healthcare management, disaster management, environment management, and agriculture management. Localization algorithms have become an essential requirement to enhance the effectiveness of WSNs demonstrating relative estimation of sensor node position of anchor nodes with their absolute coordinates. We have done a comprehensive performance evaluation of some feedforward artificial neural networks (FFANNs) training algorithms for developing efficient localization framework in WSNs. The proposed work utilizes the received signal strength observed by anchor nodes by means of some multi-path propagation effects. This paper aims for best training algorithm output while comparing results of different training algorithms. The FFANNs is designed with 3-dimensional inputs and one hidden layer with variable neurons and two outputs. For hidden layer tansigmoid transfer function while for output layer linear transfer function is used. The best training algorithm of FFANNs based model can provide better position accuracy and precision for the future applications. We have analysed and proposed the usage of training algorithms that improves the accuracy and precision of localization algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and huge potential in optimizing hardware for localization module in sensor nodes.	artificial neural network;feedforward neural network	Ashish Payal;Chandra Shekhar Rai;B.

7093e8d22ba29397d4c2c287ba75039267acb62e	graphloc: a graph-based method for indoor subarea localization with zero-configuration		Indoor subarea localization can facilitate numerous location-based services, such as indoor navigation, indoor POI recommendation and mobile advertising. Most existing subarea localization approaches suffer from two bottlenecks, one is fingerprint-based methods require time-consuming site survey and another is triangulation-based methods are lack of scalability. In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for indoor subarea localization with zero-configuration. Zero-configuration means the proposed method can be directly employed in indoor environment without time-consuming site survey or pre-installing additional infrastructure. To accomplish this, we first utilize two unexploited characteristics of WiFi radio signal strength to generate logical floor graph and then formulate the problem of constructing fingerprint map as a graph isomorphism problem between logical floor graph and physical floor graph. In online localization phase, a Bayesian-based approach is utilized to estimate the unknown subarea. The proposed method has been implemented in a real-world shopping mall, and extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance comparing with existing methods.	fingerprint;graph isomorphism problem;location-based service;radio wave;scalability;zero-configuration networking	Yuanyi Chen;Minyi Guo;Jiaxing Shen;Jiannong Cao	2016	2016 Intl IEEE Conferences on Ubiquitous Intelligence & Computing, Advanced and Trusted Computing, Scalable Computing and Communications, Cloud and Big Data Computing, Internet of People, and Smart World Congress (UIC/ATC/ScalCom/CBDCom/IoP/SmartWorld)	10.1007/s00779-017-1011-7	computer vision	Mobile	18.673520770317026	73.26358079106353	72058
75187b2c4dc382ace98ab13c1cd9ba85915a6886	microdeep: in-network deep learning by micro-sensor coordination for pervasive computing		The conventional wireless sensor networks are designed to gather information from sensors, and pervasive computing systems involve such wireless sensor networks that consist of a number of tiny-/micro-sensors to sense the real-world objects and phenomena. In addition, they also need to conduct training tasks for highly-intelligent processing like pattern recognition and anomaly detection, but doing such tasks in cloud servers may often be impossible or expensive due to lack of communication facility, data transfer overhead, privacy concerns and so on. In this paper, we propose a unique approach to carry out deep learning (both training/testing) among wireless sensors nodes for in-situ, edge-heavy processing. The idea is to appropriately assign neurons of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to wireless nodes, each of which has limited processing capability but can have some power when they are united. For this purpose, we have designed a distributed, restricted version of CNNs. We conducted two experiments using real data; one is for anomaly detection of temperature in an over-1,400m^2 lounge space using 50 temperature sensors to confirm the learning capability as well as communication overhead, and another is for activity recognition using a 6x6 array of thin-, energy-efficient film-type infra-red sensors with micro-processors to demonstrate our concept.	activity recognition;anomaly detection;central processing unit;cloud computing;convolutional neural network;deep learning;experiment;norm (social);overhead (computing);pattern recognition;programming paradigm;sensor;ubiquitous computing;world wide web wanderer	Yuta Fukushima;Daiki Miura;Takashi Hamatani;Hirozumi Yamaguchi;Teruo Higashino	2018	2018 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)	10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2018.00087	anomaly detection;wireless sensor network;convolutional neural network;deep learning;ubiquitous computing;cloud computing;activity recognition;server;distributed computing;artificial intelligence;computer science	Mobile	10.195711860665233	72.76043631974106	72211

This special issue was therefore motivated by the increasing demand for multimedia wireless networking, and by our incomplete (at best) understanding of analytical and computational techniques, as well as best practices, to design resource allocation schemes, communication protocols, and self-organization algorithms for wireless multimedia ad hoc and sensor networks that will deliver, in a predictable and quantifiable fashion, the quality of service and experience required by the end user. We have received 50 responses to our call for papers. As a result of a thorough review process, this special issue consists of 16 outstanding contributions describing stateof-the-art processing and delivery solutions for multimedia in ad hoc and sensor networks. The special issue is organized into two sections. The first section consists of nine papers that present solutions specifically designed for multimedia sensing applications. The second section addresses more general wireless multimedia networking and resource allocation problems that are common to numerous multimedia applications. In-network processing and delivery of multimedia content are not independent and their interaction has a major impact on the levels of quality of service (QoS) delivered by multimedia sensing systems. At the same time, typical existing imaging and video encoders exceed the computational and memory resources of low-complexity wireless sensor nodes. Therefore, efficient processing techniques specifically designed for resource-constrained sensing systems constitute a critical challenge., The first paper, by Rein and Reisslein, ‘‘Performance Evaluation of the Fractional Wavelet Filter: A Low-Memory Image Wavelet Transform for Multimedia Sensor Networks” proposes new efficient image wavelet transform techniques to encode multimedia content on resource-constrained embedded systems.

However, accurate, low power and user acceptable solutions remain elusive. In this paper, we present a novel opportunistic system which estimates the localization information based only on the Doppler information from the user. The Doppler information is collected using the passive radar technique that deploys the RF energy transfer signal which originally intended only to deliver energy to home IoT devices. A low complexity Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is also proposed to predict and track the user's location. A real-time system has been built based on the software defined radio (SDR) platform to verify the proposed methodology. Experimental results indicate that the proposed concepts can be used for indoor localization with a high degree of accuracy.	atm adaptation layer;angularjs;etsi satellite digital radio;extended kalman filter;indoor positioning system;information extraction;rf modulator;radar;real-time clock;real-time computing;selection (genetic algorithm);sensor;sparse matrix;tracking system;velocity (software development)	Wenda Li;Bo Tan;Robert J.

We propose a methodology and a tool (PAFI) to analyse the robustness of circuits under fault attacks using fault injection in simulation.

Future trends in the WLAN industry are targeted towards new applications with higher data rates, wider coverage, and increased QoS requirements. A user tracking system based on the WLAN infrastructure is a new service that helps network operators to monitor different aspects of their networks in addition to providing location aware services to their customers. We provide an overview of traditional location sensing algorithms and compare their performance with the new distance variance (DV) algorithm. These algorithms use the existing IEEE 802.11 infrastructure to locate a terminal. The newly introduced DV algorithm uses indoor radio propagation models to reduce the complexity of the calibration process used in conventional algorithms. The performances of the existing and new algorithm are compared using Monte Carlo simulations based on IEEE 802.11 channel models.	algorithm;location awareness;monte carlo method;performance evaluation;quality of service;rss;requirement;simulation;software propagation;tracking system	Ahmad Hatami;Kaveh Pahlavan	2005	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2005	10.1109/WCNC.2005.1424879	embedded system;wi-fi;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network	Mobile	21.236179355595365	73.50118167647679	72982

It combines the desirable attributes of current memory technologies such as SRAM, DRAM and flash memories. It also solves the key drawbacks of conventional MRAM technology: poor scalability and high write current. In this paper, we analyzed and modeled the failure probabilities of STT MRAM cells due to parameter variations. Based on the model, we developed an efficient simulation tool to capture the coupled electro/magnetic dynamics of spintronic device, leading to effective prediction for memory yield. We also developed a statistical optimization methodology to minimize the memory failure probability.

The sensor readings may also be dual-used for additional purposes. In this paper, we propose to use the inherent spatial variability in physical phenomena, such as temperature or ambient acoustic energy, to support localization and position verification. We first present the problem of localization using general spatial information fields, and then, propose a theory for exploiting this spatial variability for localization. Our Spatial Correlation Weighting Mechanism (SCWM) uses spatial correlation across different phenomena to isolate an appropriate subset of environmental parameters for better location accuracy. We then develop an array of algorithms employing environmental parameters using a two-level approach: first, we develop the strategies on how the subset of parameters should be chosen, and second, we derive mapping functions for position estimation. Our algorithms support our theoretical model for performing localization utilizing environmental properties. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of our approach by using a collection of physical phenomena measured across 100 locations inside a building. Our results provide strong evidence of the viability of using general sensor readings for location-aware applications.	acoustic cryptanalysis;algorithm;algorithmic efficiency;computation;embedded system;existential quantification;experiment;heart rate variability;internationalization and localization;location awareness;map;rss;requirement;sensor;spatial variability;theory;wireless access point	Shu Chen;Yingying Chen;Wade Trappe	2010	IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems	10.1109/TPDS.2009.110	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	15.693772430108378	73.89625401789591	73894

With respect to outdoor techniques, these technologies are more accurate but with smaller covering areas. In this paper, we present the comparison of the existing location techniques in WLAN networks and a novel approach of utilizing artificial neural networks for positioning purposes. In addition to estimating WLAN client's position, neural networks have been employed to estimate the room and type of the room the client resides in. Extensive measurements were conducted to evaluate these approaches and the obtained results indicate performances sufficient for real case use.	artificial neural network;bluetooth;performance;requirement;signal-to-noise ratio	Milos Borenovic;Aleksandar Neskovic;Djuradj Budimir;Lara Zezelj	2008	2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699620	radio-frequency identification;embedded system;algorithm design;telecommunications;computer science;radio;ultrasound;accuracy and precision;bluetooth;artificial neural network;computer network	Mobile	20.662453166242884	72.79954418710136	74251

Traditional positioning solutions, such as GPS or multilateration are not applicable in the micro-world, and maps sharing does not scale. In the literature, if we want a self-reconfiguration of microrobots to a target shape that consists of millions of positions, each microrobot should have a memory capacity of at least million positions. Therefore, this is not scalable. In this paper, nodes do not record any position. We present self-reconfiguration methods where nodes are unaware of their positions and where they do not have the final coordinates of each microrobot. In other words, nodes do not store the coordinates that build the target shape. Therefore, memory usage for each node is hugely reduced to $$O(1)$$ O ( 1 ) and communications are limited to neighboring nodes. These algorithms aim to improve the logical topology of a set of microrobots by restructuring their physical topology. To that end, we consider here the case of restructuring a set of microrobots from a chain to a square and we study two algorithms: the first algorithm ensures the connectivity of the network at the end of the algorithm, where the second guarantees the connectivity of the network through the execution time. The paper presents both analytical and experimental assessments of the algorithms performances using the declarative language $$Meld$$ M e l d and executed under the Dynamic Physical Rendering Simulator (DPRSim).	algorithm;claytronics;declarative programming;fault tolerance;global positioning system;logical topology;map;microbotics;multilateration;performance;robot;run time (program lifecycle phase);scalability;time complexity	Hicham Lakhlef;Hakim Mabed;Julien Bourgeois	2014	The Journal of Supercomputing	10.1007/s11227-014-1196-8	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;simulation;computer science;operating system;distributed computing;computer security	Robotics	13.455287720365506	74.42328983826727	74549
9a0ceb73e80f3047b81001f9a5f76988115ce2c4	an annulus local search based localization (alsl) algorithm in indoor wi-fi environments		With growing demands on location-based services, the indoor localization has attracted great attention in both academia and industry. This paper focuses on improving indoor localization performance based on Wi-Fi signal processing. Specifically, we propose an annulus local search based localization (ALSL) algorithm, which combines the distance fitting and fingerprint-based techniques. First, ALSL derives the relationship between the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Euclidean distance for a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) based on multinomial fitting. Then, an annulus construction scheme is proposed to reduce the online search space for fingerprint-based localization. On this basis, a probability model is derived to estimate the probability of an online point (OP) which is located at certain reference point (RP) based on Bayes theorem. Finally, K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is adopted to compute the final estimated location of an OP. For performance evaluation, we build a prototype of the indoor localization system and implement the ALSL algorithm. We conduct a series of experiments in real-world scenarios, which show that ALSL is able to effectively reduce the computational overhead during the online localization phase with the annulus based local search policy. In addition, our field testing also demonstrates that ALSL can outperform existing competitive solutions in terms of improving the localization accuracy.

a50320c1a0001ed7597ea9e9e03de3569bd70f5e	characterizing mobile telephony signals in indoor environments for their use in fingerprinting-based user location		Fingerprinting techniques have been applied to locate users in indoor scenarios using WiFi signals. Although mobile telephony network is used for outdoor location, it is widely deployed and their signal more stable, thus being also a candidate to be used for fingerprinting. This paper describes the characterization of GSM/UMTS signals in indoor scenarios to check if their features allow to use them for constructing the radio maps needed for fingerprinting purposes. We have developed an Android application to collect the received signal information, such that makes the measurement process cheaper and easier. Measurements show that changes in location and device orientation can be identified by observing the received signal strength of the connected and neighboring base stations. Besides, detecting this variability is easier by using the GSM network than with UMTS technology. Therefore mobile telephony network seems suitable to perform fingerprinting-based indoor location.	radio fingerprinting	Alicia Rodriguez-Carrion;Celeste Campo;Carlos García-Rubio;Estrella M.

e5c66ddf6b00ac3c95628c9ce80fd43f889cc803	quantum-classical access networks with embedded optical wireless links		We examine the applicability of wireless indoor quantum key distribution (QKD) in hybrid quantum-classical networks. We propose practical configurations that would enable wireless access to such networks. The proposed scenarios would allow an indoor wireless user, equipped with a QKD-enabled mobile device, to communicate securely with a remote party on the other end of the access network. QKD signals, sent through wireless indoor channels, are combined with classical ones and sent over the same fiber link to the remote user. Dense wavelength-division multiplexing would enable the simultaneous transmission of quantum and classical signals over the same fiber. We consider the adverse effects of the background noise induced by Raman scattered light on the QKD receivers due to such an integration. In addition, we consider the loss and the background noise that arise from indoor environments. Decoy-state BB84 and measurement device-independent protocols are employed for the secret key rate analysis.

Published approaches to information flow security analysis find all paths from signals for an asset to ports accessible by an adversary, such as a secret key to a point of disclosure. Although this can be beneficial in eliminating areas of the hardware designs that need not be reviewed, what is included is still overwhelmingly large for a proper review for security vulnerabilities. However, it is not necessary to review all of the paths, but instead to review access control mechanisms that limit information flow between adversary and asset. Our method of using multiple information flow paths allows us to identify access control mechanisms and evaluate whether they are used on every access to the asset. Our technique was used commercially in production hardware design to successfully find critical security issues before tape-in by pre-Si validation engineers at Intel.	access control;adversary (cryptography);algorithm;control system;key (cryptography);vulnerability (computing)	David W.

Motes mounted on animals can easily detach. Fixed motes could get displaced by environmental conditions, e.g., heavy rains. These motes could contain valuable data and/or equipment, but finding them out in the wild could be quite challenging. Similar challenges arise in the cases where the placement of nodes is not known a priori, and yet in-field interaction with them (e.g., for data downloading or debugging) is needed. We present MoteHunter, a tool supporting in-field searching for motes, composed of: the Hunter, a special node with custom hardware and software and equipped with a directional antenna, and the Prey, which can be in principle any mote compliant with IEEE 802.15.4, although a special small-footprint software component can be integrated with the application to simplify the search. We illustrate the architecture of MoteHunter and discuss our design choices quantitatively and qualitatively.	component-based software engineering;debugging;download;prey;sensor node;sensor web;software architecture;software deployment	Csaba Király;Gian Pietro Picco	2012	37th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks - Workshops	10.1109/LCNW.2012.6424091	embedded system;neurfon;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Visualization	16.088954630488093	72.52466175333166	77019

58c58da8a01229172e6c13b444877dc45339feb1	efficient, portable template attacks		Template attacks recover data values processed by tamper-resistant devices from side-channel waveforms, such as supply-current fluctuations (power analysis) or electromagnetic emissions. They first profile a device to generate multivariate statistics of the waveforms emitted for each of a set of known processed values, which then identify maximum-likelihood candidates of unknown processed values during an attack. We identify several practical obstacles arising in the implementation of template attacks, ranging from numerical errors to the incompatibility of templates across different devices, and propose and compare several solutions. We identify pooled covariance matrices and prior dimensionality reduction through Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis as particularly efficient and effective, especially where many attack traces can be acquired. We evaluate alternative algorithms not only for the task of recovering key bytes from a hardware implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard; we even reconstruct the value transferred by an individual byte-load instruction, with success rates reaching 85% (or a guessing entropy of less than a quarter bit remaining) after 1000 attack traces, thereby demonstrating direct eavesdropping of eight-bit parallel data lines. Using different devices during the profiling and attack phase can substantially reduce the effectiveness of template attacks. We demonstrate that the same problem can also occur across different measurement campaigns with the same device and that DC offsets (e.g., due to temperature drift) are a significant cause. We improve the portability of template parameters across devices by manipulating the DC content of the eigenvectors that form the projection matrix used for dimensionality reduction of the waveforms.	8-bit;algorithm;antivirus software;atmel avr;bus (computing);byte;central processing unit;cipher;cryptography;dimensionality reduction;encryption;experiment;hamming weight;known-plaintext attack;linear discriminant analysis;local-density approximation;matlab;microcontroller;numerical analysis;offset (computer science);plaintext;principal component analysis;s-box;side-channel attack;software incompatibility;spooling;tamper resistance;tracing (software);window function	Marios O.

In this paper, we study an important spatial crowdsourcing problem, namely information based maximum task matching (IG-MTM), in which each spatial task needs to be performed before its expiration time and workers are dynamically moving. The goal of IG-MTM problem is to maximize the number of spatial tasks that are assigned to workers while satisfying the quality requirement of collected answers. We first define this problem, and then two approximation approaches are proposed, namely greedy and extremum algorithms. Subsequently, in order to improve time efficiency, we propose an optimization methodology. Through extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we evaluate the performance of our proposed approaches.	approximation;crowdsourcing;experiment;greedy algorithm;kullback–leibler divergence;mathematical optimization;maxima and minima;midwoofer-tweeter-midwoofer;mobile device;smart device;synthetic intelligence	Jiantong Zhang;Feilong Tang;Leonard Barolli;Yanqin Yang;Wenchao Xu	2017	2017 IEEE 31st International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)	10.1109/AINA.2017.119	simulation;computer science;machine learning;data mining;database	DB	13.628575704484442	70.9352443078508	77223

In the proposed system, the new wireless beaconing method offers an accurate positioning system using a high-gain beam antenna in the 5 GHz Wi-Fi band. The antenna forms a narrow hotspot of received signal strength (RSSI) in the space immediately below itself; the user devices detect the hotspot by monitoring the RSSI. The beaconing module is also resistant to jamming by other wireless systems and noise. Experimental results show that the proposed system can work in a high density Wi-Fi environment with over 100 Wi-Fi stations, and the positioning error of the proposed system at CDF = 90% is about 3.5 m. The positioning accuracy of the proposed system is slightly inferior to previous systems based on the Wi-Fi fingerprint method, but it achieves a similar function using a user-installable system which is easier to install and maintain than previous systems.

Although RRAM has various advantages in terms of simple design, high density integration and CMOS compatible process flow, it has its own intrinsic constraints in terms of variability and reliability, just as is the case for any other technology. While performance and reliability are both key metrics for any new product or technology design initiative, the critical aspect to investigate is the trade-off involved in improving them, as the measures implemented to boost performance do not necessarily have a positive impact on its reliability (lifetime). Optimization of the RRAM design for commercial applications requires a clear understanding and acknowledgment of these performance – reliability trade-offs.

GPS (Global Positioning System) can provide a fairly accurate position of the user, but it is usually not used indoors because of the degradation of signals due to the structure of the building. Due to the unsteady nature of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), accurate results are hard to generate, in spite of the usage of various alternative WiFi localization techniques. We have attempted to improve the accuracy of localizing the user by implementing wall detection and pixel calculation to trilateration technique in smartphones. The users having WiFi enabled devices like a smartphone can locate their position and request for help in case of emergency with the implementation of WiFi localization on mobile devices. This study proves that the selection of access points used for generating the position of the user substantially affects the accuracy.

However, one of the main challenges in achieving 100% robustness in designs protected by TMR running on programmable platforms is to prevent upsets in the routing from provoking undesirable connections between signals from distinct redundant logic parts, which can generate an error in the output. This paper investigates the optimal design of the TMR logic (e.g., by cleverly inserting voters) to ensure robustness. Four different versions of a TMR digital filter were analyzed by fault injection. Faults were randomly inserted straight into the bitstream of the FPGA. The experimental results presented in this paper demonstrate that the number and placement of voters in the TMR design can directly affect the fault tolerance, ranging from 4.03% to 0.98% the number of upsets in the routing able to cause an error in the TMR circuit.	bitstream;digital filter;fault injection;fault tolerance;field-programmable gate array;optimal design;randomness;robustness (computer science);routing;static random-access memory;triple modular redundancy	Fernanda Gusmão de Lima Kastensmidt;Luca Sterpone;Luigi Carro;Matteo Sonza Reorda	2005	Design, Automation and Test in Europe	10.1109/DATE.2005.229	embedded system;routing;fault tolerance;electronic engineering;real-time computing;digital filter;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;hardware architecture;field-programmable gate array	EDA	11.462942086406612	61.778127028864624	78180

In this paper, we introduce an external hardwarebased clock tuning circuit that can be used to improve synchronization and significantly reduce clock drift over long periods of time without waking up the host MCU. This is accomplished through two main hardware sub-systems. First, we improve upon the circuit presented in [1] that synchronizes clocks using the ambient magnetic fields emitted from power lines. The new circuit uses an electric field front-end as opposed to the original magnetic-field sensor, which makes the design more compact, lower-power, lower-cost, exhibit less jitter and improves robustness to noise generated by nearby appliances. Second, we present a low-cost hardware tuning circuit that can be used to continuously trim a micro-controller's low-power clock at runtime. Most time synchronization approaches require a CPU to periodically adjust internal counters to accommodate for clock drift. Periodic discrete updates can introduce interpolation errors as compared to continuous update approaches and they require the CPU to expend energy during these wake up periods. Our hardware-based external clock tuning circuit allows the main CPU to remain in a deep-sleep mode for extended periods while an external circuit compensates for clock drift. We show that our new synchronization circuit consumes 60% less power than the original design and is able to correct clock drift rates to within 0.01 ppm without power hungry and expensive precision clocks.	central processing unit;clock drift;clock synchronization;interpolation;low-power broadcasting;microcontroller;real-time clock;run time (program lifecycle phase);scheduling (computing);sleep mode	Maxim Buevich;Niranjini Rajagopal;Anthony Rowe	2013	2013 IEEE 34th Real-Time Systems Symposium	10.1109/RTSS.2013.34	microcontroller;clock synchronization;embedded system;synchronization;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;jitter;asynchronous circuit;clock domain crossing;clock skew;interpolation;computer science;self-clocking signal;underclocking;timing failure;clock drift;master clock;synchronous circuit;clock gating;digital clock manager;real-time clock;cpu multiplier	Embedded	15.367733381995823	69.84408305063018	79551
2632df75a055a1058f6935c4079f3bfc23d75e89	a comparative analysis of video codecs for multihop wireless video sensor networks	qa75 electronic computers computer science	Wireless video sensor networks (WVSNs) have drawn significant attention in recent years due to the advent of low-cost miniaturized cameras, which makes it feasible to realize large-scale WVSNs for a variety of applications including security surveillance, environmental tracking, and health monitoring. However, the conventional video coding paradigms are not suitable for WVSNs due to resource constraints such as limited computation power, battery energy, and network bandwidth. In this paper, we evaluated and analyzed the performance of video codecs based on emerging video coding paradigms such as distributed video coding and distributed compressive video sensing for multihop WVSNs. The main objective of this work was to provide an insight into the computational (encoding/decoding) complexity, energy consumption, node and network lifetime, processing and memory requirements, and the quality of reconstruction of these video codecs. Based on the findings, this paper also provides some guidelines for the selection of appropriate video codecs for a given WVSN application.	cs games;codec;computation;computational complexity theory;data compression;distributed concurrent versions system;encoder;group of pictures;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;peak signal-to-noise ratio;personal digital assistant;qualitative comparative analysis;real-time clock;real-time computing;relay;requirement;sensor node;smartphone;video sensor technology	Noreen Imran;Boon-Chong Seet;Alvis Cheuk M.

Digital signature/watermark is one of the most promising solutions among the known protection mechanisms. It provides desirable proof of authorship without rendering the IP useless. However, it makes the watermark detection, which is as important as watermarking, an NP-hard problem. In fact, the tradeoff between hard-to-attack and easy-to-detect and the lack of efficient detection schemes are the major obstacles for digital signatures to thrive. In this paper, the authors propose a new watermarking method which allows the watermark to be publicly detected without losing its strength and security. The basic idea is to create a cryptographically strong pseudo-random watermark, embed it into the original problem as a special (which the authors call mutual exclusive) constraint, and make it public. The authors combine data integrity technique and the unique characteristics in the design of VLSI IPs such that adversaries will not gain any advantage from the public watermarking for forgery. This new technique is compatible with the existing constraint-based watermarking/fingerprinting techniques. The resulting public–private watermark maintains the strength of a watermark and provides easy detectability with little design overhead. The authors build the mathematical framework for this approach based on the concept of mutual exclusive constraints. They use popular VLSI CAD problems, namely technology mapping, partitioning, graph coloring, FPGA design, and Boolean satisfiability, to demonstrate the public watermark’s easy detectability, high credibility, low design overhead, and robustness.	antivirus software;authentication;boolean satisfiability problem;computer-aided design;data integrity;digital signature;field-programmable gate array;fingerprint (computing);graph coloring;integrated circuit;np-hardness;overhead (computing);protection mechanism;pseudorandomness;strong cryptography	Gang Qu	2002	IEEE Trans. on CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2002.804205	embedded system;electronic engineering;computer science;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;operating system;mathematics;very-large-scale integration;watermark;computer security;algorithm;intellectual property;computer network	EDA	11.167482333295643	63.04741554460596	80268

We devised a very reliable multi-cell structure to cope with the large process variation in the DRAM-cell-capacitor type antifuse system. The programming current did not rise above 564µA even in the nine-cell case. The cumulative distribution of the successful rupture in the multi-cell structure could be curtailed dramatically to less than 15% of the single-cellu0027s case and the recovery problem of programmed cells after the thermal stress (300°C) had disappeared. In addition, we also presented a Post-Package Repair (PPR) scheme that could be directly coupled to the external high-voltage power rail via an additional pin with small protection circuits, saving the chip area otherwise consumed by the internal pump circuitry. A 1Gbit DDR SDRAM was fabricated using Samsungu0027s advanced 50nm DRAM technology, successfully proving the feasibility of the proposed antifuse system implemented in it.	antifuse;value-driven design	Jong-Pil Son;Jin Ho Kim;Woo Song Ahn;Seung Uk Han;Satoru Yamada;Byung-Sick Moon;Churoo Park;Hong-Sun Hwang;Seong-Jin Jang;Joo-Sun Choi;Young-Hyun Jun;Soo-Won Kim	2011	IEICE Transactions		embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;recovery;engineering;dram;physics	Vision	19.025180788348496	60.863978315875315	81672

However, the ever growing capabilities of FPGAs and the consequential increasing complexity of their designs ask for a modular development model, where individual IP cores from multiple parties are integrated into a larger system. To enable such a model, the availability of IP protection at the modular level is imperative. In this work, we propose an IP protection mechanism for FPGA designs at the level of individual IP cores, by making use of the self-reconfiguring capabilities of modern FPGAs and deploying a trusted third party to run a metering service, similar to the work of Giineysu et ah and Drimer et at The proposed scheme makes it possible to enforce a pay-per-use licensing scheme which holds considerable advantages, both for IP core providers as well as for system integrators. Moreover, the scheme has a minimal implementation overhead and is the first of its kind to be solely based on primitives that are already available in recent commercially available FPGA devices. This allows for an immediate and feasible deployment, in contrast to earlier proposed solutions."""	field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;overhead (computing);protection mechanism;self-reconfiguring modular robot;semiconductor intellectual property core;software deployment;static random-access memory;trusted third party	Roel Maes;Dries Schellekens;Ingrid Verbauwhede	2012	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2011.2169667	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;computer security;field-programmable gate array	Security	11.081488201584975	63.32681213070617	81757

It consists mainly of two components -- write power and read power. These power dissipations occur due to charging/discharging of large bit line capacitance. On-chip cache size has become increasingly important for high performance applications, and it now presents more of a limit to microprocessor speed than clock rate. The models and methodologies for the design of SRAM, an integral component of microprocessor cache, have changed with time. Presently, continued scaling is threatened by variability in SRAM performance and function. This work addresses the emerging threat of variability keeping active power consumption and speed of operation in consideration.	access time;active directory;addresses (publication format);cache;cell (microprocessor);clock rate;electric capacitance;file system permissions;heart rate variability;image scaling;microprocessor;single-ended signaling;static random-access memory;test scaling;benefit	Aminul Islam;Mohd.

Two techniques, i.e., constant parameter selection and output sequence scrambling, are employed to reduce the computation cost without sacrificing the complexity of the output sequence. Statistical test results show that with only one multiplication, DMLM-PRNG passes all cases in SP800-22. Moreover, it passes most of the cases in Crush, one of the test suites of TesuU01. When compared with solutions based on digitized pseudochaotic maps previously proposed in the literature, in terms of randomness quality, our system is as good as a Rényi-map-based PRNG and better than a logistic-map-based PRNG. Moreover, compared with solutions based on a Rényi-map-based PRNG, DMLM-PRNG is better scalable to high digital resolutions with reasonable area overhead.	computation;logistic map;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);pseudorandom number generator;randomness;scalability;test suite	Shih-Liang Chen;TingTing Hwang;Wen-Wei Lin	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2010.2083170	logistics;statistical hypothesis testing;throughput;discrete mathematics;logistic map;random number generation;computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematics;software testing;pseudorandom number generator;electric generator;statistics	EDA	13.759650998156703	66.37032287331911	83253

In addition to the fact that RSS data collection might be a tedious and time-consuming process, the measured radiomap accuracy and applicability is subject to potential changes in the wireless environment. Therefore, RT becomes a very suitable and efficient solution to tackle this problem. Moreover, in traditional fingerprint-based methods, the underlying radiomap is restricted to the mobile device for which the radiomap has been created. To overcome this limitation, we propose the use of linear data transformation to match the characteristics of various devices. We address both challenges by using 3D RT-generated radiomaps and highlight the efficiency of this approach in terms of the time spent to create the radiomap, the amount of data required to calibrate the radiomap for different devices and the positioning error which is compared against the case of using dedicated radiomaps collected with each device.	3d film;device fingerprint;mobile device;performance evaluation;rss;ray tracing (graphics);simulation;software propagation	Marios Raspopoulos;Christos Laoudias;Loizos Kanaris;Akis Kokkinis;Christoforos Panayiotou;Stavros Stavrou	2012	2012 8th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	10.1109/IWCMC.2012.6314193	embedded system;ray tracing;real-time computing;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	19.605985071850174	73.44470445171773	83375

The bus transmits its location information to the base station frequently and then base station uses this available location information and advanced prediction algorithms to estimate the time of arrival for rest of the stops on the itinerary. This frequent communication between the bus and base station adds a recurring cost to the implementation and management of such a system. In this paper we wish to study performance of the system wherein the bus transmits its information only when it is pulled by base station. Algorithms that determine when to request information are developed for the two scenarios: one where motion on each link on the road network is modeled with a single common statistical model, and another where each link on the road has an individual model for vehicle motion. The second scenario can generate more accurate predictions of vehicle motion, but the algorithms for determining when to request information from the vehicles are more complex. The resulting algorithms are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the performance of the approaches.	algorithm;approximation algorithm;dynamic programming;experiment;hybrid system;information system;mathematical optimization;monte carlo method;optimization problem;schedule (computer science);simulation;statistical model;time of arrival	Rohit Kumar;David A.

632ef1448095dc33d7918425960009119db5591b	analyzing the fault injection sensitivity of secure embedded software		Fault attacks on cryptographic software use faulty ciphertext to reverse engineer the secret encryption key. Although modern fault analysis algorithms are quite efficient, their practical implementation is complicated because of the uncertainty that comes with the fault injection process. First, the intended fault effect may not match the actual fault obtained after fault injection. Second, the logic target of the fault attack, the cryptographic software, is above the abstraction level of physical faults. The resulting uncertainty with respect to the fault effects in the software may degrade the efficiency of the fault attack, resulting in many more trial fault injections than the amount predicted by the theoretical fault attack. In this contribution, we highlight the important role played by the processor microarchitecture in the development of a fault attack. We introduce the microprocessor fault sensitivity model to systematically capture the fault response of a microprocessor pipeline. We also propose Microarchitecture-Aware Fault Injection Attack (MAFIA). MAFIA uses the fault sensitivity model to guide the fault injection and to predict the fault response. We describe two applications for MAFIA. First, we demonstrate a biased fault attack on an unprotected Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) software program executing on a seven-stage pipelined Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor. The use of the microprocessor fault sensitivity model to guide the attack leads to an order of magnitude fewer fault injections compared to a traditional, blind fault injection method. Second, MAFIA can be used to break known software countermeasures against fault injection. We demonstrate this by systematically breaking a collection of state-of-the-art software fault countermeasures. These two examples lead to the key conclusion of this work, namely that software fault attacks become much more harmful and effective when an appropriate microprocessor fault sensitivity model is used. This, in turn, highlights the need for better fault countermeasures for software.	abstraction layer;adversary (cryptography);algorithm;ciphertext;clock signal;computer program;cryptography;differential fault analysis;embedded software;embedded system;encryption software;experiment;fault (technology);fault injection;fault model;field-programmable gate array;glitching;graphic art software;key (cryptography);leon;microarchitecture;microprocessor;requirement;reverse engineering	Bilgiday Yuce;Nahid Farhady Ghalaty;Chinmay Deshpande;Harika Santapuri;Conor Patrick;Leyla Nazhandali;Patrick Schaumont	2017	ACM Trans.

In the existing literature on PUFs, the Hamming Distance Test, denoted by HDT(t), was proposed to evaluate the unpredictability of PUFs, which is a simplified case of the Propagation Criterion test PC(t). The objective of these test schemes is to estimate the output transition probability when there are t or fewer than t bits flips, and ideally this probability value should be 0.5. In this work, we show that aforementioned two test schemes are not enough to ensure the unpredictability of a PUF design. We propose a new test, which is denoted as HDT(e, t). This test scheme is a fine-tuned version of the previous schemes, as it considers the flipping bit pattern vector e along with parameter t. As a contribution, we provide a comprehensive discussion and analytic interpretation of HDT(t), PC(t), and HDT(e, t) test schemes for Arbiter PUF (APUF), Exclusive-OR (XOR) PUF, and Lightweight Secure PUF (LSPUF). Our analysis establishes that HDT(e, t) test is more general in comparison with HDT(t) and PC(t) tests. In addition, we demonstrate a few scenarios where the adversary can exploit the information obtained from the analysis of HDT(e, t) properties of APUF, XOR PUF, and LSPUF to develop statistical attacks on them, if the ideal value of HDT(e, t) = 0.5 is not achieved for a given PUF.

A very common countermeasure consists in randomizing sensitive variables of algorithms by masking techniques. In this paper, we propose a new way to apply this strategy to secure hardware implementations of block ciphers. The main advantage of the proposed solution is that the masked variables and the masking material can be manipulated simultaneously without leaking sensitive information in the Hamming distance model. Moreover, we show that the leaking information stays very limited when the deterministic part of the real leakage slightly deviates from the Hamming distance. Finally, we apply our method to protect an AES hardware implementation and we show that the performances are suitable for practical implementations.	algorithm;block cipher;complexity;first-order predicate;hamming distance;information sensitivity;performance;s-box;side-channel attack;spectral leakage	Houssem Maghrebi;Sylvain Guilley;Emmanuel Prouff;Jean-Luc Danger	2012	2012 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust	10.1109/HST.2012.6224316	gray code;block cipher;hamming distance;telecommunications;computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;mathematics;computer security;statistics	Crypto	11.124310043990874	63.77579460262545	84235

In such a degenerate case, the entropy of the TRNG output bit sequence would be drastically reduced. In this paper, an investigation of the properties regarding interaction between the oscillator rings, the dispersion in the ring frequencies and correlation and dependencies between oscillator rings is carried out in three different FPGA device families. The experiments show that there are interactions and correlation between oscillator rings, and these effects need to be compensated in order to improve the security of such a TRNG design.	crystal oscillator;cyclone;experiment;field-programmable gate array;hardware random number generator;interaction;random number generation;van der pol oscillator	Knut Wold;Slobodan Petrovic	2012	2012 IEEE 15th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems (DDECS)	10.1109/DDECS.2012.6219041	embedded system;electronic engineering;random number generation;computer science;electrical engineering;theoretical computer science;field-programmable gate array	Arch	13.532080272901995	64.81973899120845	85884

Re-calibration is also needed if there is a major change in the propagation environment. The use of propagation models to predict signal fingerprint becomes an interesting preposition. This paper will investigate the influence of predicted fingerprint on the accuracy of indoor location. They include empirical propagation models (i.e. one-slope model and multi-wall model) and a semi-deterministic model. A framework for indoor location with the nearest-neighbour and particle filter are developed to evaluate predicted and measured fingerprints. In order to take advantage of environment description, a map-filtering technique is also elaborated.	fingerprint;particle filter;semiconductor industry;software propagation	Widyawan;Martin Klepal;Dirk Pesch	2007	2007 4th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication	10.1109/WPNC.2007.353626	wi-fi;computer science;operating system	HCI	20.702062345724308	74.37374538902745	86106

Acoustic source localization is a hot research topic with many possible application areas, such as voice enhancement, intruder detection, sniper localization, and automatic tracking of speakers in an e-conferencing environment. Utilization of wireless sensor networks for acoustic source localization can provide good coverage, which not only enhances the accuracy, but also increases the robustness of the overall system. In this paper, we gave an overview of the acoustic source localization based on wireless sensor networks. Firstly, we analyzed the characteristics of acoustic source localization in wireless sensor networks. Then, we classified the existing typical acoustic source localization alogrithms in wireless sensor networks into centralized alogrithms and distributed algorithms. At the same time, we introduced the algorithms and discussed both merits and drawbacks of the algorithms. Finally, we pointed out the design issues of related middleware services.	lateral computing;lateral thinking;yaws	Hao-bin Jiang;Jing-bo Zhao;Long Chen;Da-yu Chen	2007		10.1109/IITA.2007.22	distributed algorithm;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks	Robotics	15.751728943517014	72.66276932016667	86272

However, it is still a difficult task to construct a positioning database to provide high accuracy and vast coverage, especially in probabilistic-based algorithms such as fingerprint-based localization. On the other hand, positioning methods that use the location database of the positioning infrastructure, such as the weighted centroid method, can support terminal-based localization due to lower computational complexity and small database size. Terminal-based positioning has the advantages not only of protecting personal location information, but also of maintaining the network topology among the terminals. The only weak point for positioning database-based methods is that the accurate location of the infrastructure should be known in advance. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the location of infrastructure, especially for Wi-Fi access points. We developed and employed a smartphone application to collect Wi-Fi signals by just walking around the test area. Then, the locations of Wi-Fi access points are estimated efficiently and accurately by selection of the maximum likelihood position that has the most similar path-loss model corresponding to the signal acquisition points. The estimated locations are processed as infrastructure database to support terminal-based positioning. The simulation and experiment result validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The estimated location of access points is within 10 m accuracy in most cases and also the terminal-based positioning results achieve competitive performance comparing with other positioning methods.	algorithm;computation;computational complexity theory;curve fitting;fingerprint;location-based service;mobile app;monte carlo method;network topology;simulation;smartphone;wireless access point	Myungin Ji;Jooyoung Kim;Youngsu Cho;Yang Koo Lee;Sangjoon Park	2013	2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666752	embedded system;simulation;global positioning system;computer science;data mining;maximum likelihood;hybrid positioning system;statistics;detection theory;monte carlo method	Mobile	18.84013943734903	73.3830140979093	86349

Also, the reproducibility of PUFs increase when the transistors are forward body biased. A ring oscillator PUF was tested and it achieved a uniqueness of 47.8% and reproducibility of 100% when operating at a supply voltage of 0.2 V. Compared to a base line configuration, our method improved the uniqueness by 18% and reproducibility by 7%. Therefore, apart from architectural optimizations, circuit level considerations like supply voltage and body bias can improve the reliability of PUFs.	access time;application-specific integrated circuit;cpu power dissipation;inductive coupling;mathematical optimization;power supply;ring oscillator;transistor	Vignesh Vivekraja;Leyla Nazhandali	2009	2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust	10.1109/HST.2009.5225054	control engineering;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering;ring oscillator;threshold voltage;oscillation;transistor	Arch	14.759848238089598	63.01683439290556	86644
e63ccf68b6b1ff5198aee86c2f215bc5ca3ed9fc	study of dynamic factors in indoor positioning for harsh environments		This paper presents a study of the impact of dynamic factors on indoor positioning. A positioning system is presented that provides advanced information services based on two subsystems: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The first subsystem was intended to position users with not very high levels of accuracy and precision, but not too far from reality, and the second one was intended to position users with greater precision. It is designed for use in stations and terminals of public transportation systems in which the conditions are “hostile” or unfavourable. Experimental results demonstrate that, using different devices for both offline and online phase, RSS differences, Euclidean distance and comparing fingerprints with Weighted k-Nearest Neighbours (WKNN) algorithm, the system is able to position users with reasonable values of accuracy and precision: for Wi-Fi, with only 3 samples, depending on the orientation and compared with 3 neighbours, an average accuracy between 4.15 and 4.58 m and a precision in the range 4–7 m or less 90% of the time were obtained; for BLE, best accuracy results were obtained by comparison with 2 neighbours, giving a position error of 1.59 m and a CDF value of 2.83 m or less 90% of the time.	bluetooth;euclidean distance;fingerprint;global positioning system;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;online and offline;rss	Gabriel de Blasio;Alexis Quesada-Arencibia;Carmelo R.

In comments on this problem at the 2002 International Electron Devices Meeting, Intel chairman Andrew Grove cited off-state current leakage in particular as a limiting factor in future microprocessor integration. 1 Off-state leakage is static power, current that leaks through transistors even when they are turned off. It is one of two principal sources of power dis-sipation in today's microprocessors. The other is dynamic power, which arises from the repeated capacitance charge and discharge on the output of the hundreds of millions of gates in today's chips. Until very recently, only dynamic power has been a significant source of power consumption, and Moore's law has helped to control it. Shrinking processor technology has allowed and, below 100 nanometers, actually required reducing the supply voltage. Dynamic power is proportional to the square of supply voltage, so reducing the voltage significantly reduces power consumption. Unfortunately, smaller geometries exacerbate leakage , so static power begins to dominate the power consumption equation in microprocessor design. Historically, complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology has dissipated much less power than earlier technologies such as transistor-transistor and emitter-coupled logic. In fact, when not switching, CMOS transistors lost negligible power. However, the power they consume has increased dramatically with increases in device speed and chip density. The research community has recognized the significance of this increase for some time. Figure 1 shows total chip dynamic and static power consumption trends based on 2002 statistics normalized to the 2001 International Technology Road-map for Semiconductors. 2 The ITRS projects a decrease in dynamic power per device over time. However, if we assume a doubling of on-chip devices every two years, total dynamic power will increase on a per-chip basis. Packaging and cooling costs as well as the limited power capacity of batteries make this trend unsustainable. Figure 1 also shows exponential increases projected for the two principal components of static power consumption: • subthreshold leakage, a weak inversion current across the device; and • gate leakage, a tunneling current through the gate oxide insulation. The ITRS expects the rate of these increases to level out in 2005 but to remain substantial nonetheless. Even today, total power dissipation from chip leakage is approaching the total from dynamic power, and the projected increases in off-state subthreshold leakage show it exceeding total dynamic power consumption as technology drops below the 65-nm feature …	cmos;computer cooling;discharger;emitter-coupled logic;gate oxide;international electron devices meeting;lambert's cosine law;limbo;microprocessor;moore's law;period-doubling bifurcation;processor technology;processor design;semiconductor industry;spectral leakage;time complexity;transistor;tunneling protocol	Nam Sung Kim;Todd M.

To resist DPA attacks, hiding and masking methods are commonly used, but it usually resulted in high area overhead and performance degradation. In this brief, a DPA countermeasure circuit based on digital controlled ring oscillators is presented to efficiently resist the first-order DPA attack. The implementation of the critical S-box of the advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm shows that the area overhead of a single S-box is about 19% without any extra delay in the critical path. Moreover, the countermeasure circuit can be mounted onto different S-box implementations based on composite field or look-up table (LUT). Based on our approach, a DPA-resistant AES chip can be proposed to maintain the same throughput with less than 2K extra gates.	algorithm;critical path method;elegant degradation;encryption;first-order predicate;lookup table;overhead (computing);physical information;s-box;side-channel attack;throughput	Po-Chun Liu;Hsie-Chia Chang;Chen-Yi Lee	2010	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs	10.1109/TCSII.2010.2048400	embedded system;digital control;computer hardware;computer science;control theory;computer security;statistics	EDA	12.144614026773255	62.932417749975265	87668

In particular, we take into account the impact of putting in sleep mode the BS, and also the change of the radiated power. When the BS reduces its power consumption, its lifetime tends to increase, as a consequence of the temperature reduction. However, the change in the power state triggers a negative effect which instead tends to reduce the BS lifetime. We therefore propose a model to evaluate the BS lifetime considering the two aforementioned effects, triggered either by the application of a sleep mode state or a change in the radiated power. Our results, obtained over a representative case study, indicate that the BS lifetime may be negatively affected when power state transitions take place. Therefore, we argue that the lifetime should be considered in the process of deciding how and when to change from a power state to another one.

While template attacks have been a popular form of side-channel analysis in the cryptographic literature, the use of templates in the context of fault attacks has not yet been explored to the best of our knowledge. Our approach involves two phases. The first phase is a profiling phase where we build templates of the fault behavior of a cryptographic device for different secret key segments under different fault injection intensities. This is followed by a matching phase where we match the observed fault behavior of an identical but black-box device with the pre-built templates to retrieve the secret key. We present a generic treatment of our template-based fault attack approach for SPN block ciphers, and illustrate the same with case studies on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA-based implementation of AES-128.	algorithm;black box;block cipher;byte;coefficient;computer security;cryptography;differential fault analysis;directory information tree;fault injection;fault model;field-programmable gate array;generic programming;information security;key (cryptography);profiling (computer programming);redundancy (information theory);side-channel attack;substitution-permutation network;template matching	Ashrujit Ghoshal;Sikhar Patranabis;Debdeep Mukhopadhyay	2018		10.1007/978-3-030-05072-6_2	field-programmable gate array;embedded system;aerospace engineering;engineering;block cipher;template;fault injection;profiling (computer programming);cryptography	Security	11.318436969082253	63.901181733419094	88231

However, compared to the conventional methods, crowdsourcing might collect fewer received signal strength (RSS) values, hence result in greater influence to outliers in RSS values. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to detect such outliers and to substitute them with more suitable RSS values. In particular, we investigate the relationship of RSS values between adjacent locations using a signal propagation model and show that the outliers can be corrected using a signal propagation model. We propose the Signal Propagation-based Outlier Reduction Technic (SPORT) for identifying and adjusting outlier values in both the offline training phase and the online localization phase. Experimental results show that SPORT greatly smoothens the radio map and improves the location accuracy.	algorithm;crowdsourcing;electromagnetic environment;fingerprint;internationalization and localization;mobile device;online and offline;rss;software deployment;software propagation	Liye Zhang;Shahrokh Valaee;Le Zhang;Yubin Xu;Lin Ma	2015	2015 IEEE 26th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)	10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343628	telecommunications;computer science;operating system;internet privacy;silicon;mobile computing;computer security;crowdsourcing	Mobile	20.885194783308567	73.89785629794613	88388

This map is usually built manually by a person holding the mapping device, which results in orientation-dependent fingerprints due to signal attenuation by the human body. To offset this distortion, fingerprints are typically collected for multiple orientations, but this requires a high effort for large localization areas. In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the mapping effort by modeling the WLAN signal attenuation caused by the human body. By applying the model to the captured signal to compensate for the attenuation, it is possible to generate an orientation-independent fingerprint. We demonstrate that our model is location and person independent and its output is comparable with manually created radio maps. By using the model, the WLAN scanning effort can be reduced by 75% to 87.5% (depending on the number of orientations).	distortion;fingerprint;internationalization and localization	Ngewi Fet;Marcus Handte;Pedro José Marrón	2013		10.1145/2493432.2493459	telecommunications	AI	19.322633461303784	74.42032803365889	88918
7f9cf3e49e4f1afc212cadc186910e4b2e7b24b6	practical secret-key generation by full-duplex nodes with residual self-interference		In the upcoming Internet of Things (IoT), encryption of confidential data by secret keys is vital. Secret-key generation from reciprocal wireless channels has received much attention in the research community in recent time. However, most implementations were restricted to half-duplex channel probing only. Communication setups with full-duplex (FD) capability enable new prospects for secret-key generation, since the inherent superposition of FD signals renders the acquisition of secret information more difficult for an eavesdropper. In this work, we demonstrate a practical testbed with FD capability in order to evaluate its advantages for secret-key agreement. We quantify the performance by computing correlation coefficients and mutual information of all channel estimates. Our work provides new insights into the opportunity of downgrading the capabilities of eavesdroppers by using full-duplex nodes.	duplex (telecommunications);interference (communication);key generation	Hendrik Vogt;Kevin Ramm;Aydin Sezgin	2016			duplex (telecommunications);residual;encryption;mutual information;computer security;wireless;testbed;key generation;distributed computing;communication channel;computer science	Vision	24.128993864625855	70.77112431225333	89030

On one hand, sacrificing security for testability by using traditional scan-based DFT restricts its use in privacy sensitive applications. On the other hand, sacrificing testability for security by abandoning scan-based DFT hurts product quality. The security of a crypto chip comes from the small secret key stored in a few registers and the testability of a crypto chip comes from the data path and control path implementing the crypto algorithm. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel scan DFT architecture called secure scan that maintains the high test quality of traditional scan DFT without compromising the security. We used a hardware implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to show that the traditional Scan DFT scheme can compromise the secret key. We then showed that by using secure scan DFT, neither the secret key nor the testability of the AES implementation is compromised.	algorithm;design for testing;encryption;fault coverage;key (cryptography);multiplexer;overhead (computing);software testability	Bo Yang;Kaijie Wu;Ramesh Karri	2005	Proceedings. 42nd Design Automation Conference, 2005.	10.1145/1065579.1065617	embedded system;computer architecture;electronic engineering;computer science;engineering;information security;design for testing	EDA	11.635079408788462	62.865108989236205	89694

However, line-of-sight (LoS) blockage and excess propagation delay affect ranging measurements thus drastically reducing the localization accuracy. In this paper, we first characterize and derive models for the range estimation error and the excess delay based on measured data from real ranging devices. These models are used in various multilateration algorithms to determine the position of the target. Using measurements in a real indoor scenario, we investigate how the localization accuracy is affected by the number of beacons and by the availability of priori information about the environment and network geometry. We also examine the case where multiple targets cooperate by measuring ranges not only from the beacons but also from each other. An iterative multilateration algorithm that incorporates information gathered through cooperation is then proposed with the purpose of improving the localization accuracy. Using numerical results, we demonstrate the impact of cooperation on the localization accuracy.	algorithm;estimation theory;iterative method;least squares;line-of-sight (missile);multilateration;multipath propagation;numerical analysis;offset binary;propagation delay;software propagation;statistical model	Davide Dardari;Andrea Conti;Jaime Lien;Moe Z.

bc75f30df8f9db1835df1415056fc88540fa6de3	implementation of a chaotic true random number generator based on fuzzy modeling		The present work demonstrates a new approach to design a chaos-based random number generator, for high-security communications and cryptographic applications. In our approach, a single-scroll chaotic system is modeled by a fuzzy logic circuit, with the support of physical entropy sources. Because of a strong dependence on the initial conditions of the chaotic system, physical entropy sources are chosen to enrich the randomness of the overall signal outcome. The modeling of the chaotic map by fuzzy logic circuits enhance the system immunity to noise and assure a certain degree of parameter deviation robustness. The frequency, operating up to 10 MHz, provides high throughput random sequences, which pass the test of full NIST random number test suite. The system is implemented in an analog circuit using a standard CMOS 65nm technology to verify the advantages of the proposed system.

The large device variations and the thermal-induced switching randomness of the magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) introduce the persistent and non-persistent errors in STT-RAM operations, respectively. Modeling these statistical metrics generally require the expensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the combined magnetic-CMOS models, which is hardly integrated in the modern micro-architecture and system designs. Also, the conventional bottom-up design method incurs costly iterations in the STT-RAM design toward specific system requirement. In this work, we propose Loadsa1: a yield-driven top-down design method to explore the design space of STT-RAM array from a statistical point of view. Both array-level semi-analytical yield model and cell-level failure-probability model are developed to enable a top-down design method: The system-level requirements, e.g., the chip yield under power and area constraints, are hierarchically mapped to array-and cell-level design parameters, e.g., redundancy, ECC scheme, and MOS transistor size, etc. Our simulation results show that Loadsa can accurately optimize the STT-RAM based on the system and cell-level constraints with a linear computation complexity. Our method demonstrates great potentials in the early design stage of memory or micro-architecture by eliminating the design integrations, while offering a full statistical view of the design even when the common yield enhancement practices are applied.	algorithm;cmos;computation;iteration;level design;microarchitecture;nonvolatile bios memory;point of view (computer hardware company);random access;random-access memory;randomness;redundancy (engineering);requirement;scheme;semiconductor industry;simulation;system requirements;top-down and bottom-up design;transistor;tunneling protocol	Wujie Wen;Yaojun Zhang;Lu Zhang;Yiran Chen	2013	2013 18th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)	10.1109/ASPDAC.2013.6509611	embedded system;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;electrical engineering;operating system;cmos;statistics;monte carlo method	EDA	17.537500534338463	60.85751747161756	90236
abd7adea2ac1f4672b679e61eff733dbe58b2adc	performance of distance based and path loss based weighted centroid localization algorithms for video capsule endoscope		In this paper, we propose distance and path loss based weighted centroid localization (WCL) algorithms for video capsule endoscope (VCE) using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). We evaluate the performance of both algorithms considering real channel characteristics of human body. One of the major challenge in RSSI based VCE localization is the shadow fading and multi-path propagation effects of non-homogeneous medium of human body for which the measured RSSI is highly random resulting in high localization error. Again, due to the complex environment of experiment, accurate estimation of the channel parameters is quite difficult. We evaluate the performance of both algorithms in presence of randomness in path loss and estimation errors in channel parameters. To address the randomness issue, we estimate the smoothed path loss using moving averaging filter. Then, we introduce 10–50% errors in channel parameters to analyze the performance of both algorithms. We develop a simulation tool using MATLAB to visualize the results and to compare the performance. We observe significant improvement in performance by applying moving averaging method of smoothed path loss estimation using both algorithms. We also observe that the accuracy of distance based WCL decreases significantly in presence of errors in channel parameters. Whereas path loss based WCL is robust to the errors in channel parameters as it estimates the positions by using the estimated path loss directly without prior precise knowledge of channel parameters.	algorithm;matlab;multipath propagation;randomness;sensor;simulation;smoothing;software propagation;video coding engine	Umma Hany;Lutfa Akter	2017	2017 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)	10.1109/ICSIPA.2017.8120591	computer science;computer vision;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;fading;randomness;algorithm;image processing;path loss;centroid;endoscope;communication channel;shadow	Vision	22.86748485666934	72.32459868167452	90830
449e7ebd90a52b588ff7c9ad5e4f10f0229af90f	multiple tags identification for short id rfid networks	radiofrequency identification	Utilization of radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to localize objects in real time requires the collection of the identities (IDs) of the tags within a short time. This paper presents a novel orthogonal group identification (Ogrid) method that addresses the above requirement. When queried, multiple tags with mutually orthogonal IDs respond, such that these tag IDs can be separated at the reader without using spread spectrum technique. Ogrid yields a small and fixed identification delays for any given tag ID size B. Ogrid is especially suitable for dense networks where the tag ID sizes are relatively short. In the case of B = 16 bits, which supports at most 65536 tags, Ogrid incurs a fixed identification delay of about 4 seconds regardless of the number of tags present, whereas several existing protocols incur average delays of 20 and 100 seconds to identify 10,000 and 50,000 tags, respectively. Results for a dynamic system with tag arrivals and departures further demonstrate the consistently low identification delay of Ogrid.	collision problem;correctness (computer science);dynamical system;physical design (electronics);power of two;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;real-time locating system;simulation	Hongbo Guo;Victor C.

In contrast to standard methods, speed can be inferred without the use of any additional hardware like accelerometer, gyroscope or position estimator. The strength of Wi-Fi signal is considered herein to compute the time-domain features such as mean, minimum, maximum, and autocorrelation. The experiments are carried out in different environments like academic area, residential area and in open space. The complexity of the algorithm in training and testing phase are quadratic and linear with the number of Wi-Fi samples respectively. The experimental results indicate that the average error in the estimated speed is 12 % when the maximum signal strength features are taken into account. The proposed method is cost-effective and having a low complexity with reasonable accuracy in a Wi-Fi or cellular environment. Additionally, the proposed method is scalable that is the performance is not affected in a multi-smartphones scenario.	algorithm;autocorrelation;experiment;gyroscope;quadratic function;scalability;smartphone	Pavan Kumar Pedapolu;Pradeep Kumar;Vaidya Harish;Satvik Venturi;Sushil Kumar Bharti;Vinay Kumar;Sudhir Kumar	2016	CoRR		econometrics;statistics	ML	19.335936198886703	73.1193162592541	91666

Inductive type usually has higher efficiency but requires short distance and precise alignment between the transmitter and receiver. From the viewpoint of convenience, resonant type has much better freedom from distance and alignment under a handicap of somewhat less efficiency. Among the numerous resonant wireless power transfer (RWPT) mechanisms, the one using 6.78MHz or 13.56MHz band for fRS has been a the mainstream option [1-2]. Major sources of power loss related to efficiency degradation are the transmitter circuits, receiver circuits, and resonant tanks of both sides. The efficiency of the receiver circuit is more important since it is especially related to the thermal emission of hands-on mobile devices and has to meet a strict value because the recent mobile phones already spend most of their thermal margins on the application processor. In this paper, we suggest a new receiver circuit for RWPT with simple structure and high efficiency.	battery charger;elegant degradation;hands-on computing;inductive type;mobile device;mobile phone;rectifier;resonance;transmitter	Jun-Han Choi;Sung-Ku Yeo;Chang-Byong Park;Seho Park;Jeong Seok Lee;Gyu-Hyeong Cho	2013	2013 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference Digest of Technical Papers	10.1109/ISSCC.2013.6487638	embedded system;electronic engineering;resonant inductive coupling;telecommunications;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	23.71345173964791	64.27773765727292	91912
33d31b449e7ff1f0eb6c6c62d7bc7806e0399e6d	a sensor node with energy harvesting	irregular;gpu;performance characterization;microarchitectural	Ideally, sensing nodes should be autonomous and able to harvest ambient energy from vibrations, light, electromagnetic radiation, or heat. Thus energy harvesting nodes for wireless communications [3] are of great interest. Here we study nodes that have packet buffers and energy storage buffers (e.g. capacitors or batteries) and we use the Energy Packet(EP) [1, 2] abstraction so that one EP is the amount of energy needed to transmit a Data Packet (DP). Ideally the energy flow into the device, expressed as EPs per unit time, should balance the flow of DPs that are assembled for transmission so that DPs are not held up. However we show that if EP and DP flows are exactly balanced, the system exhibits an unstable behaviour so that both the backlog of packets and the amount of stored energy saturate their respective storage, and derive results concerning the performance of the system when the energy and work flows are unbalanced. Consider a system that at time t contains K(t) DPs to transmit and M(t) EPs in storage. Let the data buffer capacity be B DPs, while the energy storage device can store up to E EPs. The state of the system is then the pair (K(t),M(t)) and are interested in its probability distribution p(n,m, t) = Pr[K(t) = n,M(t) = m). Arrival of DPs to the data buffer follows a Poisson process of rate λ, while the EPs arrive into the energy buffer as a Poisson process of rate Λ corresponding to some rate of a joules/second, where a is the energy required to transmit one packet. We assume that the rates at which energy is harvested and data collected is slow as compared to the rate at which DPs are transmitted by the device, e.g. it may take many milliseconds to get enough energy from the harvester while it may just take a few microseconds or nanoseconds, to transmit a packet, we assume that the transmission time is zero. Similarly in such a device the rate at which packets are formed must not exceed the rate at which energy is being harvested. Note that an EP is exactly the amount of energy needed to transmit a packet. As a consequence if the system perchance enters some state (K(t),M(t)) with K(t) > 0, M(t) > 0 then it will instantaneously (in zero time) transit to the either the state (0,M(t) − K(t)) if M(t) ≥ K(t), or to the state (K(t) −M(t), 0) if K(t) ≥ M(t). Thus we need only consider for p(n,m, t) the state space of integers pairs S = { (0, 0), (n, 0), (0,m) : n > 0, m > 0 }.

Device pairing is critical for bootstrapping secure communication between two previously unassociated devices over the wireless channel. Using auxiliary out-of-band channels involving visual, acoustic, tactile, or vibrational sensors has been proposed as a feasible option to facilitate device pairing. However, these methods usually require users to perform additional tasks, such as copying, comparing, and shaking. It is preferable to have a natural and intuitive pairing method with minimal user tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new method, called MagPairing, for pairing smartphones in close proximity by exploiting correlated magnetometer readings. In MagPairing, users only need to naturally tap the smartphones together for a few seconds without performing any additional operations in authentication and key establishment. Our method exploits the fact that smartphones are equipped with tiny magnets. Highly correlated magnetic field patterns are produced when two smartphones are close to each other. We design MagPairing protocol and implement it on Android smartphones. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate MagPairing. Experiments verify that the captured sensor data on which MagPairing is based has high entropy and sufficient length, and is nondisclosure to attackers more than few centimeters away. Usability tests on various kinds of smartphones by totally untrained users show that the whole pairing process needs only 4.5 s on average with more than 90% success rate.	acoustic cryptanalysis;android;authentication;bootstrapping (compilers);experiment;key exchange;mobile computing;on the fly;out-of-band agreement;secure communication;sensor;shared secret;simulation;smartphone;usability	Rong Jin;Liu Shi;Kai Zeng;Amit Pande;Prasant Mohapatra	2016	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2015.2505626	embedded system;magnetometer;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;wireless	Mobile	22.40233554547947	70.82906081772454	92171

However, process variations may significantly impact the achievable yield in STT-MRAM. To this end, several yield enhancement techniques that improve STT-MRAM failures at the bit-cell, and at the architecture level of design abstraction have been proposed in the literature. However, these techniques may lead to a suboptimal design because they do not consider the impact of design choices at every level of design abstraction. In this paper, we propose a unified device-circuit-architecture co-design framework to optimize and enhance the yield of STT-MRAM. We studied the interaction between device parameters (viz. energy barrier height) and bit-cell level parameters (viz. transistor width), together with different Error Correcting Codes (ECC) to optimize the robustness and energy efficiency of STT-MRAM cache. The advantages of our proposed approach to STT-MRAM design are explored at the 32nm technology node. We show that for a target yield of 500 Defects Per Million (DPM) for an example array with 64-bit word length, our proposed approach with realistic parameters can save up to 15% and 13% in cell area and total power consumption, respectively, in comparison with a design that does not use any array level yield enhancement technique.	64-bit computing;bit cell;magnetoresistive random-access memory;memory barrier;non-volatile memory;random access;semiconductor device fabrication;transistor;viz: the computer game;volatile memory	Zoha Pajouhi;Xuanyao Fong;Kaushik Roy	2015	2015 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE)		electronic engineering;computer hardware;computer science;electrical engineering;magnetoresistive random-access memory	EDA	17.024362252375447	60.871682187494955	92910

Globalization raises the question of trust in an integrated circuit. It is for the every chip maker to ensure there is no malicious inclusion in the design, which is referred as Hardware Trojans. Malicious inclusion can occur by an in-house adversary design engineer, Intellectual Property (IP) core supplied from the third party vendor or at untrusted manufacturing foundry. Several researchers have proposed hardware Trojan detection schemes in the recent years. Trust-Hub provides Trojan benchmark circuits to verify the strength of the Trojan detection techniques. In this work, our focus is on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Trojan benchmarks, which is most vulnerable block cipher for Trojan attacks. All 21 Benchmarks available in Trusthub are analyzed against standard coverage driven verification practices, synthesis, DFT insertion and ATPG simulations. The analysis reveals that 19 AES benchmarks are weak and Trojan inclusion can be detected using standard procedures used in ASIC design flow. Based on the weakness observed design modification is proposed to improve the quality of Trojan benchmarks. The strength of proposed Trojan benchmarks is better than existing circuits and their original features are also preserved after design modification.	adversary (cryptography);application-specific integrated circuit;benchmark (computing);block cipher;design flow (eda);encryption;hardware trojan;semiconductor intellectual property core;simulation;standard operating procedure;trojan horse (computing)	K.

Even in presence of on-board misbehavior detection system (MDS), the reliability of the same is subject to various limitations. In this paper, a MDS-based trust estimation model has been proposed to estimate the trustworthiness of event-reporting vehicles. An efficient algorithm has been proposed for estimating the trust value of event reporting node(s) based on MDS-based feedback of the peers.

The location of the MT of the extended KF positioning algorithm is extracted from the constant-speed trajectory and the radio propagation model. The observation information of the KF tracker is extracted from the empirical and RPM positioning methods. Specifically, a sensor-assisted method employs an RFID system to adapt the sequential selection cluster algorithm. As compared with the empirical method, not only can the RPM algorithm reduce the number of training data points and perform on-line calibration in the signal space, but the RPM and KF algorithms can alleviate the problem of aliasing. In addition, the KF tracker with the RFID-assisted scheme can calibrate the location estimation and improve the corner effect. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed location-tracking algorithm using KF with the RFID-assisted scheme can achieve a high degree of location accuracy (i.e., more than 90% of the estimated positions have error distances of less than 2.1 m).

Regarding the security, physical unclonable function (PUF) as forgery prevention technology has attracted attention. PUF utilizes the random physical feature of semiconductor as unique ID. From a viewpoint of feasibility of PUF, evaluation of tamper resistance is important. The evaluation accuracy depends on modeling accuracy of PUF. The modeling requires information of the detailed architecture of PUF. On the other hand, genetic programming (GP) based analysis which can analysis without PUF models has been proposed recently.

c64f9c53523ebb6e3088d2c5111a280b2a57b2b1	an accelerometer lossless compression algorithm and energy analysis for iot devices		The Internet of Things promises to enable numerous future applications spanning many domains, including health care, and is comprised of devices that are constrained in terms of computational and energy resources. A specific health care application is to ascertain patients' activity of daily living while at home using accelerometer data from non-invasive wearables. It is often necessary to store this data on the device to be retrieved later for analysis. However, the devices typically store far more data than can be transmitted with commonly used low power radios. To mitigate the problem, this paper proposes an energy efficient, lossless compression algorithm that uses an offline frequency distribution to create a symbol-code lookup table. Using an extensive set of data from a previous study, an analysis of the entropy of activities of daily living accelerometer data is presented. The compression algorithm is compared against this estimated entropy. Energy being critical for IoT devices, the trade-off between energy cost for compression versus energy saved during transmission is also analysed.	algorithm;bluetooth;code;computation;data compression;entropy (information theory);expectation propagation;file spanning;huffman coding;internet relay chat;internet of things;lempel–ziv–storer–szymanski;lookup table;lossless compression;online and offline;transmitter;wearable computer	James Pope;Antonis Vafeas;Atis Elsts;George Oikonomou;Robert J.

The main goal of a WSN is data collection. As the amount of the collected data increases, it would be essential to develop some techniques to analyze them. In this paper, we propose an in-network optimization algorithm based on Nelder-Mead simplex (NM simplex) to incrementally do regression analysis over distributed data. Then improve the regression accuracy by the use of re-sampling in each node. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only increases the accuracy to more than that of the centralized approach, but is also more efficient in terms of communication compared to its counterparts.	nelder–mead method;sampling (signal processing);simplex algorithm	Parisa Jalili Marandi;Muharram Mansoorizadeh;Nasrollah Moghaddam Charkari	2008		10.1007/978-3-540-88582-5_40	embedded system;mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;computer science;artificial intelligence;machine learning;brooks–iyengar algorithm;statistics	Embedded	12.48597145288857	74.36513387747435	94986

73430fddc2580c2e083867050b10dc50da0a4609	a secure test solution for sensor nodes containing crypto-cores		There is a tradeoff between the requirements for security and testability for a sensor node hardware. To test a sensor, it is desired to have access to the internal circuitry of the Device-Under-Test (DUT) to apply test stimuli and observe its responses. While such unrestricted access to the DUT is desired for testing, it can undermine the security. To secure a sensor node from attacks by malicious attackers, it is imperative to limit user access once the device has been adopted for in-field use. Efficient design-for-testability (DFT) techniques have been developed without taking into consideration the security threats posed by them. For instance, scan structure which is widely deployed in modern digital circuits, can be used as an effective tool to wage an attack and extract critical information from cryptographic cores. In this work, a new solution is presented to protect sensor nodes containing crypto-cores against scan-based attacks without compromising their testability at the manufacturing phase. In the proposed solution, a built-in self-test (BIST) technique is developed to carry out in-field tests for crypto-cores while a scan-based test method is utilized for manufacturing test. The proposed method prevents scan-based attacks without compromising testability during the manufacturing phase.	built-in self-test;cryptography;design for testing;device under test;digital electronics;electronic circuit;imperative programming;requirement;sensor node;software testability	Shoaleh Hashemi Namin;Ankit Mehta;Parham Hosseinzadeh Namin;Rashid Rashidzadeh;Majid Ahmadi	2017	2017 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050885	cryptography;testability;built-in self-test;real-time computing;digital electronics;computer science;sensor node;test method	EDA	11.811219999140652	63.113987706471576	95212

One of the significant field of the chaotic signal oscillators are random number generators. In this paper, an FPGA-based new true random number generator system using discrete-time chaotic signal generator is presented. The system designed incorporates the Sprott 94 G chaotic system based on an FPGA deployed with IEEE 754 standard. In order to produce random bits a quantification process has been performed on the results produced by the chaotic oscillator unit. Furthermore, the XOR method has been determined as restoring function to obtain a true random bit generator. The maximum operating frequency of FPGA-based true random number generator has been able to reach up to 399,383 MHz. The 20,000-bit sequence has been generated by the designed system and they have been saved to the test result file. They have been tested using NIST test suite and FIPS-140-1 standards and successful results have been obtained. It is concluded that the FPGA-based system is able to be used in cryptologic applications.	chaos theory;clock rate;cryptography;exclusive or;fips 140;field-programmable gate array;hardware random number generator;random number generation;test suite	Ismail Koyuncu;Ahmet Turan Özcerit;Ihsan Pehlivan;Erdinc Avaroglu	2014	2014 22nd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)	10.1109/SIU.2014.6830209	embedded system;nist;computer science;theoretical computer science;signal processing;lavarand;field-programmable gate array	Embedded	13.850966763786802	66.22942940138705	96048

We investigate """"wave dynamic differential logic'' (WDDL), a logic-level counter-measure based on leakage hiding thanks to balanced dual-rail logic. First of all, we report a CAD methodology for achieving WDDL in FPGA. An experimental security evaluation of the DES (or triple-DES) encryption algorithm in WDDL shows that the usage of positive logic is mandatory to resist to straightforward attacks. Second, we discuss how to reduce the size overhead associated with WDDL. The efficiency of some synthesizers is assessed.

a4d7b5e286a04c5852a1b4b749e0c55e61f5a165	a new autonomous data transmission reduction method for wireless sensors networks		The inherent limitation in energy resources and computational power for sensor nodes in a Wireless Sensor Network, poses the challenge of extending the lifetime of these networks. Since radio communication is the dominant energy consuming activity, most presented approaches focused on reducing the number of data transmitted to the central workstation. This can be achieved by deploying both on the workstation and the sensor node a synchronized prediction model capable of forecasting future values. Thus, enabling the sensor node to transmit only the values that surpasses a predefined error threshold. This mechanism offers a decrease in the cost of transmission energy for a price of an increase in the cost of computational energy. Therefore, finding the right trade­off between complexity and efficiency is very important to achieve optimal results. In this paper, we present a novel data reduction method that outperforms other state of the art data reduction approaches. We demonstrated the efficiency of our algorithm using simulation on real-world data sets collected at our laboratory. The obtained results show that our method was able to achieve a data suppression ratio ranging between 93.2% and 99.8%.	algorithm;autonomous robot;complexity;dspace;sensor node;simulation;software deployment;workstation;zero suppression	Gaby Bou Tayeh;Abdallah Makhoul;Jacques Demerjian;David Laiymani	2018	2018 IEEE Middle East and North Africa Communications Conference (MENACOMM)	10.1109/MENACOMM.2018.8371030	wireless sensor network;real-time computing;data transmission;wireless;data reduction;ranging;sensor node;data set;computer science;transmission (mechanics)	Mobile	11.808477806774675	73.86385484933099	97135

However, current smartphone-based localization solutions are limited mainly to outdoor, mostly missing practical, robust and accurate indoor location solutions. Despite significant efforts on indoor localization in both academia and industry in the past two decades, highly accurate and practical smartphone-based indoor localization remains an open problem. To enable indoor location-based services (ILBS), e.g., step-by-step navigation for the Blind and visually impaired, there are several stringent requirements: highly accurate (foot-level); no additional hardware components or extensions on users' smartphones; scalable to massive concurrent users. Current GPS, Radio RSS (e.g. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee), or Fingerprinting based solutions can only achieve meter-level or room-level accuracy. In this paper, we propose a practical and accurate solution that fills the long-lasting gap of smartphone-based fine-grained indoor localization. Specifically, we design and implement an indoor localization ecosystem Guoguo. Guoguo consists of an anchor network with a coordination protocol to transmit modulated localization beacons using high-band acoustic signals, a realtime processing app in a smartphone, and a backend server for indoor contexts and location-based services. We further propose approaches to improve its coverage, accuracy, and location update rate with low-power consumption. Our prototype shows centimeter-level localization accuracy in several typical indoor environments. Such precise indoor localization is expected to have high impact in the future ILBS and our daily activities.	acoustic cryptanalysis;bluetooth;ecosystem;global positioning system;location-based service;low-power broadcasting;modulation;prototype;rss;radio fingerprinting;requirement;scalability;server (computing);smartphone	Kaikai Liu;Xinxin Liu;Xiaolin Li	2016	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2451628	embedded system;synchronization;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;accuracy and precision;mobile computing;computer network	Mobile	18.3886432567503	71.7944151405067	97291

Such systems reduce the deployment cost and privacy concerns that expert-based site survey systems can create. However, the main bottleneck of such crowd-sourcing localization systems is a bootstrapping stage, where lack of contributions by users results in no accuracy guarantee and frequent unnecessary prompting for users' input, even for explored areas. In this paper, we propose a crowd-sourcing localization system that uses both Wi-Fi scene analysis and Bluetooth beacons to address the insufficient contribution challenge. After prompting for user input, the mobile device not only submits Wi-Fi fingerprint to a map server, but also enables Bluetooth beacons to disseminate/share its location and fingerprint information to quickly populate the signal map. Then, subsequent user devices entering the area can discover the Bluetooth beacons and are able to instantly obtain room-level location information without causing unnecessary prompting to users. We implement our proposed system in the Linux OS and evaluate the prototype extensively through both experiments and simulation. Our evaluation results show that using Bluetooth beacons help to improve signal map growth, while maintaining reasonable localization accuracy.	bluetooth;bootstrapping (compilers);crowdsourcing;discriminator;experiment;fingerprint;indoor positioning system;internationalization and localization;linux;mobile device;operating system;population;privacy;prototype;radio frequency;server (computing);simulation;software deployment;usability testing	Jindan Zhu;Kai Zeng;Kyu-Han Kim;Prasant Mohapatra	2012	2012 9th Annual IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks (SECON)	10.1109/SECON.2012.6275790	embedded system;image analysis;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;interference;accuracy and precision;bluetooth;linux kernel;measurement;computer network	Mobile	19.31106028235143	72.31487111101563	97611

Microchannel-based liquid cooling, however, can substantially increase the on-chip thermal gradients, which are undesirable for reliability, performance, and cooling efficiency. In this paper, we present GreenCool, an optimal design methodology for liquid-cooled 3-D MPSoCs. GreenCool simultaneously minimizes the cooling energy for a given system while maintaining thermal gradients and peak temperatures under safe limits. This is accomplished by tuning the heat transfer characteristics of the microchannels using channel width modulation. Channel width modulation is compatible with the current process technologies and incurs minimal additional fabrication costs. Through an extensive set of experiments, we show that channel width modulation is capable of complementing and enhancing the benefits of temperature-aware floorplanning. We also experiment with a 16-core 3-D system with stacked dynamic random-access memory, for which GreenCool improves energy efficiency by up to 53% with respect to no channel modulation.	coefficient;computer cooling;dynamic random-access memory;experiment;floorplan (microelectronics);gradient;liquid-crystal display;mpsoc;mathematical optimization;modulation;multiprocessing;optimal design;pumping (computer systems);random access;scalability;system on a chip;water cooling	Mohamed M.

Different approaches have been undertaken to reduce such deployment/update efforts, but the performance degrades when the fingerprinting load is reduced below a certain level. In this paper, we propose an indoor localization scheme that requires as low as 1% fingerprinting load. This scheme employs unsupervised manifold alignment that takes crowd sourced RSS readings and localization requests as source data set and the environment's plan coordinates as destination data set. The 1% fingerprinting load is only used to perturb the local geometries in the destination data set. Our proposed algorithm was shown to achieve less than 5 m mean localization error with 1% fingerprinting load and a limited number of crowd sourced readings, when other learning based localization schemes pass the 10 m mean error with the same information.	algorithm;crowdsourcing;fingerprint (computing);manifold alignment;perturbation theory;rss;semiconductor industry;software deployment;source data;unsupervised learning	Khaqan Majeed;Sameh Sorour;Tareq Y.

In this paper, in order to estimate the geographic locations of nodes in the wireless sensor networks where most sensors are without an effective self-positioning functionality, a new graph embedding method is presented based on polynomial mapping. The algorithm is used to compute an explicit subspace mapping function between the signal space and the physical space by a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. To alleviate the inaccurate measurement in the complicated environment and obtain the high dimensional localization data, we view the wireless sensor nodes as a group of distributed devices and use the geodesic distance to measure the dissimilarity between every two sensor nodes. Then employing the polynomial mapping algorithm, the relative locations of sensor nodes are determined and aligned to physical locations by using coordinate transformation with sufficient anchors. In addition, the physical location of a new coming unknown node is easily obtained by the sparse preserving ability of the polynomial embedding manifold. At last, compared with several existing approaches, the performances of the presented algorithm are analyzed under various network topology, communication range and signal noise. The simulation results show the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of location estimation error. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The EMI-strength-based system is composed of four EMI detectors and estimates an ESD event position using an enhanced trilateration method. The RSSI-based system consists of three stationary wireless sensor nodes and one mobile wireless sensor node. The stationary nodes provide reference positions, whereas the mobile node is equipped with an EMI detector, which is used to detect an ESD event throughout the manufacturing line. Subsequently, the ESD event position is estimated by an RSSI-based localization method. In this RSSI-based system, a new method is also introduced to compensate the attenuated RSSI values by using a neural network and various transmission powers. Both systems were evaluated in a real HDD setting, and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed here. The evaluation results indicate that both systems worked well. However, the RSSI-based system can support a larger area compared with the EMI-strength-based system.	artificial neural network;discharger;disk storage;emi;electrostatic loudspeaker;hard disk drive;interference (communication);mobile phone;online locator service;sensor node;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;stationary process	Kittikhun Thongpull;Nattha Jindapetch;Wiklom Teerapabkajorndet	2013	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2012.2227911	electromagnetic interference;embedded system;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;electrostatic discharge;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;artificial neural network	Mobile	22.103576938979735	72.69456462925315	98727

This paper addresses the fact that small-scale changes in the position and orientation of the antenna of each RF sensor can dramatically affect imaging and localization performance of an RTI system. However, the best placement for a sensor is unknown at the time of deployment. Improving performance in a deployed RTI system requires the deployer to iteratively “guess-and-retest”, i.e., pick a sensor to move and then re-run a calibration experiment to determine if the localization performance had improved or degraded. We present an RTI system of servo-nodes, RF sensors equipped with servo motors which autonomously “dial it in”, i.e., change position and orientation to optimize the RSS on links of the network. By doing so, the localization accuracy of the RTI system is quickly improved, without requiring any calibration experiment from the deployer. Experiments conducted in three indoor environments demonstrate that the servo-nodes system reduces localization error on average by 32% compared to a standard RTI system composed of static RF sensors.	experiment;internationalization and localization;prototype;rss;radio frequency;run-time infrastructure (simulation);sensor;servo;software deployment;tomography	Maurizio Bocca;Anh Luong;Neal Patwari;Thomas Schmid	2014	2014 Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON)	10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990400	multipath propagation;embedded system;telecommunications;statistics	Mobile	19.23080589994956	73.73003383363604	98790

These large data sets may cause network traffics slow unnecessarily. The unfiltered transmission of raw data will also consume the WSN batteries inefficiently. In recent years, a few techniques have been developed for event-driven WSNs and sensor collaborations. For example, in traffic surveillance camera systems, video clips are transmitted in the event of car collision noises. Event-driven services run as a preset parameter of surveillance sensing. It is likely that there may be a false-positive event which drives video data to be transmitted unnecessarily, or false-negative event which misses alarms, both leading to accurate surveillance. This paper proposes an adaptive technique for event-driven WSNs, in which learning from a classification process is employed to fine-tune pre-defined data-driven WSNs. Unlike to traditional data classification techniques, outliers of collected sensor data will be one of the critical data points. The proposed technique functions more proactively by being aware of the environmental situation changes. The contribution of this paper includes an adaptive technique of acquiring and utilizing sensor data.	closed-circuit television;data mining;data point;event-driven programming;sensor;video clip	Jong P.

The existing SCAs generally require the knowledge of the corresponding cryptographic algorithm and implementation adopted in the target; therefore, they are not fully suitable for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel SCA—polar differential power attack (polar DPA). We found that DPA peaks have different biases for different cryptographic algorithms and implementations. Based on these biases, we can successfully attack a block cipher, assuming that the cipher algorithm uses a secret key in its first round, without the knowledge of the cipher algorithm or implementation. Other rounds can be treated as a black box. We present a detailed theoretical analysis and experiment to demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of our scheme. Furthermore, our scheme has demonstrated an improvement over the leakage evaluation scheme due to Ichikawa et al. (CHES 2005). Our evaluation method can be used in electronic design automatic (EDA) flows and can help security circuit designers to understand the data leakage due to SCAs.	algorithm;black box;block cipher;cmos;correctness (computer science);cryptography;electronic design automation;encryption;exclusive or;key (cryptography);lazy evaluation;logic gate;pre-charge;spectral leakage	Ming Tang;Zhenlong Qiu;Si Gao;Yi Mu;Shubo Liu;Huanguo Zhang;Yingzhen Jin	2012	Science China Information Sciences	10.1007/s11432-012-4588-5	telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;evaluation;side channel attack;polar;power;differential;computer security	Crypto	12.280529709059518	63.93763921028967	99629

Improving the quality of electronic healthcare and the prospects of ‘ageing in place’ through WSNs requires solving difficult problems in scale, energy management, and data acquisition. Medical and pervasive healthcare application (or mobile healthcare application) based on WSNs is influenced by many factors such as transmission errors and power consumption. We propose a multivariate context forwarding model that achieves energy-efficient WSN operation. A node adopts multivariate autoregression for forecasting contextual information (bio-signals or vital parameters) and locally decides whether context retransmission is required or not. This scheme is applied in patient telemonitoring systems where accurate yet energy-aware transmission of bio-signals to a remote control unit is crucial. Simulation results are reported indicating the capability of the proposed model in minimizing energy consumption in WSNs having as application domain the electronic healthcare systems.	application domain;autoregressive model;british informatics olympiad;concurrent versions system;control unit;data acquisition;download;emergence;low-power broadcasting;meta content framework;pervasive informatics;propagation of uncertainty;remote control;retransmission (data networks);sensor;simulation;software propagation;time series;zero suppression	Christos Anagnostopoulos;Stathes Hadjiefthymiades;Antonis Katsikis;Ilias Maglogiannis	2012	Personal and Ubiquitous Computing	10.1007/s00779-012-0621-3	multivariate statistics;data mining;efficient energy use;autoregressive model;computer security;parameter;statistics;computer network	Mobile	11.890048102822137	73.38880979149862	100110

This model is used to analytically evaluate the result of a multi-bit Differential Power Attack (DPA) to the address bus of cryptographic ICs running the DES algorithm. This attack to the address bus is based on the observation of its power consumption, and is well known to be a major threat to the security of the confidential information stored or processed by SmartCards. The results allow to achieve a quantitative model of the DPA attack effectiveness, and is useful as a theoretical basis to understand the trade-offs involved in DPA attacks. This deeper understanding is useful to identify the cases where a SmartCard under attack is weaker with respect to DPA attacks, i.e. when the power consumption reveals the maximum amount of information. Cycle-accurate simulations on DES encryption algorithm running on a MIPS32® architecture are used to validate the model and the underlying assumptions.	address bus;algorithm	Massimo Alioto;Massimo Poli;Santina Rocchi;Valerio Vignoli	2006		10.1007/11847083_58	embedded system;computer science;cryptography;electrical engineering;integrated circuit;interconnection;computer security;algorithm	EDA	11.299182610944499	64.55726080351805	100439

One of the most important signals for monitoring in WBANs is the electrocardiography (ECG) signal. The design of an accurate and energy efficient ECG telemonitoring system can be achieved by: i) reducing the amount of data that should be transmitted ii) minimizing the computational operations executed at any transmitter/receiver in a WBAN. To this end, compressed sensing (CS) approaches can offer a viable solution. In this paper, we propose two novel CS based ECG reconstruction algorithms that minimize the samples that are required to be transmitted for an accurate reconstruction, by exploiting the block structure of the ECG in the time domain (TD) and in an uncorrelated domain (UD). The proposed schemes require the solutions of second-order cone programming (SOCP) problems that are usually tackled by computational demanding interior point (IP) methods. To solve these problems efficiently, we develop a path-wise coordinate descent based scheme. The reconstruction accuracy is evaluated by the percentage root-mean-square difference (PRD) metric. A reconstructed signal is acceptable if and only if PRD < 9 % . Simulation studies carried out with real electrocardiographic (ECG) data, show that the proposed schemes, operating in both the TD and in the UD as compared to the conventional CS techniques, reduce the Compression Ratio (CR) by 20 % and 44 % respectively, offering at the same time significantly low computational complexity.	algorithm;compressed sensing	Aris S.

I-MAC has a periodic wakeup time synchronized with the actual time, and thus we take the wave clock. However, a frequency of a crystal oscillator varies along with temperature, which incurs a time difference among nodes. We present a time correction algorithm to address this problem, and shorten the time difference. Thereby, the preamble length in I-MAC can be minimized, which saves communication power. For further power reduction, a lowpower crystal oscillator is also proposed, as a physical-layer design. We implemented I-MAC on an off-the-shelf sensor node to estimate the power saving, and verified that the proposed cross-layer design reduces 81% of the total power, compared to Low Power Listening. key words: cross-layer design, crystal oscillator, long-wave standard time code, low power listening, MAC	algorithm;crystal oscillator;low-power broadcasting;sensor node	Takashi Takeuchi;Yu Otake;Masumi Ichien;Akihiro Gion;Hiroshi Kawaguchi;Chikara Ohta;Masahiko Yoshimoto	2008	IEICE Transactions	10.1093/ietcom/e91-b.11.3480	embedded system;telecommunications;computer science;oscillation	EDA	14.937379667893103	70.47595525023607	100780

1c5cb8c47591b70f1eaa47283bb978a56732e0a3	active exploration of sensor networks from a robotics perspective		Traditional algorithms for robots who need to integrate into a wireless network often focus on one specific task. In this work we want to develop simple, adaptive and reusable algorithms for real world applications for this scenario. Starting with the most basic task for mobile wireless network nodes, finding the position of another node, we introduce an algorithm able to solve this task. We then show how this algorithm can readily be employed to solve a large number of other related tasks like finding the optimal position to bridge two static network nodes. For this we first introduce a meta-algorithm inspired by autonomous robot learning strategies and the concept of internal models which yields a class of source seeking algorithms for mobile nodes. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated in real world experiments using a physical mobile robot and standard 802.11 wireless LAN in an office environment. We also discuss the differences to conventional algorithms and give the robotics perspective on this class of algorithms. Then we proceed to show how more complex tasks, which might be encountered by mobile nodes, can be encoded in the same framework and how the introduced algorithm can solve them. These tasks can be direct (cross layer) optimization tasks or can also encode more complex tasks like bridging two network nodes. We choose the bridging scenario as an example, implemented on a real physical robot, and show how the robot can solve it in a real world experiment.	algorithm;autonomous robot;bridging (networking);design review (u.s. government);encode;experiment;interaction;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic;mobile phone;mobile robot;robot learning;robotics	Christian Blum;Verena V.

It is especially more suitable for complicated indoor environments. However, higher positioning accuracy is still expected for it to match the capabilities of other mature techniques such as GPS. This paper presents a new algorithm for improving the positioning accuracy of the Nearest Neighbour (NN) algorithm from a Wi-Fi-based fingerprinting method. The new algorithm initially used the NN algorithm to identify the initial position estimate of the user being tracked. Then two distance correction values in two roughly perpendicular directions were calculated by the path loss model based on the two signal strength indicator (RSSI) values observed. The errors from the path loss model were eliminated through differencing two calculated distances which were derived from a similar environment. The new algorithm was tested and the results evaluated against that of the NN algorithm. The preliminary results from 24 test points showed that the positioning accuracy of the new approach has improved consistently and the root mean square accuracy improved to 3.4 m from 3.8 m with the NN algorithm.	autoregressive integrated moving average;fingerprint (computing);global positioning system;location-based service;mean squared error;nearest neighbour algorithm;nearest-neighbor interpolation;scalability	Yuntian Brian Bai;Mani Williams;Falin Wu;Allison Kealy;Kefei Zhang	2014	2014 International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)	10.1109/DSAA.2014.7058060	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	Robotics	20.799385876338206	73.91063912621058	101752

In contrast to central-oriented positioning systems, which transmit raw data to a base station, decentralized indoor localization pushes application-level knowledge into the MS. A decentralized position solution has thus a strong feasibility to increase energy efficiency and to prolong the lifetime of the MS. In this article, we present a complete architecture and an implementation for a decentralized positioning system. Furthermore, we introduce a technique for the synchronization of the observed magnetic field on the MS with the artificially-generated magnetic field from the coils. Based on real-time clocks (RTCs) and a preemptive operating system, this method allows a stand-alone control of the coils and a proper assignment of the measured magnetic fields on the MS. A stand-alone control and synchronization of the coils and the MS have an exceptional potential to implement a positioning system without the need for wired or wireless communication and enable a deployment of applications for rescue scenarios, like localization of miners or firefighters.	1-cyclohexyl-3-dodecylurea;algorithm;architecture as topic;clock generator;computation (action);control display unit;convergence (action);deploy;global positioning system;indoor positioning system;kernel;magnetic fields;microsoft outlook for mac;operating system;rate of convergence;real-time clock;requirement;sampling - surgical action	Zakaria Kasmi;Abdelmoumen Norrdine;Jörg Blankenbach	2015		10.3390/s151229799	embedded system;synchronization;text mining;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;architecture;nanotechnology	Mobile	13.083171117664616	71.79801783788072	103180

Kanso. It consists of three registers of length l, m and n bits. The first register controls the clocking of the two others. The two other registers are clocked r times (or not clocked) (resp. s times or not clocked) depending on the clock-control bit in the first register. The special case r = s = 1 is the original and well known Alternating Step Generator. Kanso claims there is no efficient attack against the ASG(r, s) since r and s are kept secret. In this paper, we present an Alternating Step Generator, ASG, model for the ASG(r, s) and also we present a new and efficient algebraic attack on ASG(r, s) using 3(m + n) bits of the output sequence to find the secret key with O((m2+n2)2l+1+m32m−1+n32n−1) computational complexity. We show that this system is no more secure than the original ASG, in contrast to the claim of the ASG(r, s)'s constructor.	asg software solutions;characteristic polynomial;clock rate;computational complexity theory;constructor (object-oriented programming);key (cryptography);linear algebra;need to know;processor register	Mehdi M.

In some applications, however, only the relative positions of the tags are needed instead of the exact locations. In this paper, we propose a RFID based localization scheme that estimates the row and column indexes of tags that are spread in a two-dimensional matrix using the movement of an RFID reader. The movement of a reader brings changes in the set of tags that are scanned in consecutive read operations. Based on the changes, the proposed scheme estimates relative positions of tags in a tag matrix. Proposed scheme does not need additional equipment such as reference tags and readers. Therefore it can be easily applied to various applications that need relative positions among tagged objects.

ebdab92ced1efeb607eb6f21c3fa23967bb2caae	cail: cross-calibration for accurate indoor localization without extensive site survey		WiFi-based indoor localization is a complex problem due to high variations of radio frequency (RF) signals in indoor environment. Many popular techniques based on RF fingerprinting require an extensive site survey, which involves time intensive logging of Received Signal Strength (RSS). This paper presents CAIL, a smartphone-based indoor localization system, that utilizes the site survey done by a phone to create an RF fingerprint which is utilized by new phones for location prediction. CAIL neither makes any assumptions about the site and placement of access points (APs) nor does it require any additional infrastructure. CAIL provides these new phones a minimal set of best locations to log at, thereby reducing the war-driving efforts for these phones. CAIL was tested in a building of six floors. Experimental results show that CAIL provides an accuracy of 76%, comparable to the accuracy of 81% on complete site survey, with an 84% reduction in effort.	algorithm;fingerprint (computing);indoor positioning system;interpolation;mobile phone;rss;radio frequency;recursion;smartphone;software deployment;wardriving;wireless access point	Geetali Tyagi;Shweta Sood;Vinayak S.

To solve the high sampling cost problem, an automatic radio-map construction algorithm based on crowdsourcing is proposed. The algorithm employs the crowd-sourced information provided by a large number of users when they are walking in the buildings as the source of location fingerprint data. Through the variation characteristics of users' smartphone sensors, the indoor anchors (doors) are identified and their locations are regarded as reference positions of the whole radio-map. The AP-Cluster method is used to cluster the crowdsourced fingerprints to acquire the representative fingerprints. According to the reference positions and the similarity between fingerprints, the representative fingerprints are linked to their corresponding physical locations and the radio-map is generated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the cost of fingerprint sampling and radio-map construction and guarantees the localization accuracy. The proposed method does not require users' explicit participation, which effectively solves the resource-consumption problem when a location fingerprint database is established.	algorithm;coupled cluster;crowdsourcing;door (physical object);extensibility;fingerprint;k-means clustering;matching;online and offline;rss;recursion;sampling (signal processing);sampling - surgical action;smartphone;sensor (device)	Ning Yu;Chenxian Xiao;Yinfeng Wu;Renjian Feng	2016	Sensors	10.3390/s16040504	computer science;engineering;data mining;internet privacy;world wide web;crowdsourcing	Web+IR	17.720877569687698	72.93249559606551	104617
5ab869d12043648c95bc13ad49551881ac424d36	circuit design challenges of highly-integrated mm-wave radar-based sensors in soi based technologies		The number of emerging applications based on millimeter-wave radar sensors is continuously increasing. Several consumer applications offer potential of achieving mass volume production. These can be for example motion detectors for lighting control and door openers, gesture sensing in smart phones, MIMO sensors for traffic monitoring or presence detection in railway stations. Driven by the demand for module size reduction, the operating frequencies of the radar modules keep on increasing, as one can integrate antennas in package and reduce the chip size. Furthermore, driven by the demand for cost reduction, the level of integration of the System on Chip (SoC) is always increasing. The amount of external components shall be reduced by integrating more and more analog, digital, power management and RF functional blocks on the same chip, on a smallest chip area and at a lowest price. Advanced silicon-based semiconductor technologies enable such integration, and provide excellent characteristics at mm-wave frequencies. However, in view of these trends, one need to evaluate what is the right technology for a particular mm-waver radar application in terms of RF performance and costs. The right choice of the technology is not necessarily straightforward, as it often depends on the expected product volume and the development of mask costs and wafer costs.	analog signal;circuit design;digital data;gesture recognition;lighting control system;mimo;motion detector;power management;radar;radio frequency;semiconductor;sensor;silicon on insulator;smartphone;system on a chip	Vadim Issakov	2018	2018 48th European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)	10.1109/ESSCIRC.2018.8494281	system on a chip;chip;radio frequency;power management;radar;computer science;electronic engineering;wave radar;cost reduction;cmos	EDA	23.932279165452073	64.09167299820089	105210

Side-channel attacks, by taking advantage of physical vulnerabilities of cryptosystems, aim to gain secret information. Several approaches have been proposed to analyze side-channel information, among which machine learning is known as a promising method. Machine learning in terms of neural networks learns the signature (power consumption and electromagnetic emission) of an instruction, and then recognizes it automatically. In this paper, a novel experimental investigation was conducted on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), to explore the efficiency of side-channel information characterization based on a learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network. The main characteristics of LVQ as a multi-class classifier are that it has the ability to learn complex non-linear input-output relationships, use sequential training procedures, and adapt to the data. Experimental results show the performance of multi-class classification based on LVQ as a powerful and promising approach of side-channel data characterization.	algorithm;artificial neural network;confusion matrix;cryptosystem;elliptic curve cryptography;field-programmability;field-programmable gate array;learning vector quantization;machine learning;multiclass classification;nonlinear system;overfitting;side-channel attack	Ehsan Saeedi;Yinan Kong;Md.

We present a random ized algorithm that (re)elects a leader in O(D logn) rounds with high probability, whereD is a bound on the dynamic diameter of the network andn is the maximum number of nodes in the network at any point in ti me. We assume a model of broadcast-based communication where a node can sen d only 1 message of O(logn) bits per round and is not aware of the receivers in advance. Thus, our r es lts also apply to mobile wireless adhoc networks, improving over the optimal (for deterministi c algorithms)O(Dn) solution presented at FOMC 2011.

Compared to traditional communication system, the WVSN operates under a set of unique resource constraints, including limitations with respect to energy supply, on-board computational capability, and transmission bandwidth. The objective of this paper is to study the resource utilization behavior of a wireless video sensor and analyze its performance under the resource constraints. More specifically, we develop an analytic power-rate-distortion (P-R-D) model to characterize the inherent relationship between the power consumption of a video encoder and its rate-distortion performance. Based on the P-R-D analysis and a simplified model for wireless transmission power, we study the optimum power allocation between video encoding and wireless transmission and introduce a measure called achievable minimum distortion to quantify the distortion under a total power constraint. We consider two scenarios in wireless video sensing, small-delay wireless video monitoring and large-delay wireless video surveillance, and analyze the performance limit of the wireless video sensor in each scenario. The analysis and results obtained in this paper provide an important guideline for practical wireless video sensor design.	closed-circuit television;data compression;distortion;encoder;on-board data handling;profiling (computer programming);scalability;video sensor technology	Zhihai He;Dapeng Wu	2006	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	10.1109/TCSVT.2006.873154	wireless wan;wireless sensor network;wireless site survey;telecommunications;computer science;resource management;computational intelligence;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wi-fi array;fixed wireless;computer network	Mobile	11.449542298605994	69.6624953128528	106629

Recently, there is an increase interest in positioning techniques based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems so we focus on the performance evaluation of a positioning algorithm. The current method of solving for GPS user's position is to linearize the pseudorange equations and calculate the user position iteratively, starting with a user provided initial position guess. We implement an Iterative Least Squares (ILS) algorithm by means of data structures and show that five iterations are required to obtain a convergent solution. The algorithm automatically combines all available GPS pseudorange measurements when more than four satellites are observed. Experimental results show that reliable absolute positioning is achieved by using the algorithm. By weighting each satellite's contribution in user position evaluation process by means of Carrier-to-noise-density ratio (C/No) is achieved an improvement on the position estimation mostly in the vertical component.	algorithm;carrier-to-noise-density ratio;data structure;gps navigation device;galileo (satellite navigation);global positioning system;iteration;least squares;performance evaluation;profiling (computer programming);pseudorange;satellite navigation;video post-processing	Alban Rakipi;Enik Shytermeja;Shkelzen Cakaj;Rozeta Miho;Bexhet Kamo	2013	2013 Eighth International Conference on Broadband and Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications	10.1109/BWCCA.2013.31	dilution of precision;receiver;global positioning system;data structure;pseudorange;computer science;precise point positioning;iterative method;algorithm;statistics	Robotics	22.08727697661562	73.83936545166635	107460

In contrast, power delay profile fingerprinting (PDP-F) thrives on multipath propagation. This multipath extension of T(D)oA is based on matching an estimated power delay profile from one or several base stations (BSs) (or other transmitters (broadcast, ...)) with a memorized power delay profile map for a given cell. It is obvious that the overall location accuracy depends strongly of the quality of the PDP estimation. We propose exploiting the prior knowledge on the received signal structure to enhance the PDP estimation and increase the localization accuracy. Depending on the propagation environment, we propose a deterministic and Bayesian framework for PDP estimation. And, we investigate the application to fingerprinting based mobile localization.	fingerprint (computing);kernel density estimation;line-of-sight (missile);mobile phone;multipath propagation;software propagation;transmitter	Mahdi Triki;Dirk T.

A memristive device offers several advantages: nonvolatility, good scalability, effectively no leakage current, and compatibility with CMOS technology, both electrically and in terms of manufacturing. Several models for memristive devices have been developed and are discussed in this paper. Digital applications such as memory and logic require a model that is highly nonlinear, simple for calculations, and sufficiently accurate. In this paper, a new memristive device model is presented-TEAM, ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor model. This model is flexible and can be fit to any practical memristive device. Previously published models are compared in this paper to the proposed TEAM model. It is shown that the proposed model is reasonably accurate and computationally efficient, and is more appropriate for circuit simulation than previously published models.	algorithmic efficiency;cmos;computer memory;electronic circuit simulation;memristor;neuromorphic engineering;nonlinear system;scalability;spectral leakage	Shahar Kvatinsky;Eby G.

The signal sensitivity levels can be dynamically adjusted after each clock cycle based on proposed signal sensitivity transition rules. The development of data secrecy properties and theorem generation functions makes the translation process from security properties to Coq theorems independent of target circuits and, for the first time, makes it possible to construct a property library, facilitating (semi) automation of the proof. The proposed cycle accurate information assurance scheme is successfully demonstrated on cryptographic circuits with various complexities from a small-scale DES encryption core to a state-of-the-art AES encryption design prohibiting the leakage of sensitive information caused by hardware Trojans inserted in RTL codes.	clock signal;code;coq (software);cryptography;encryption;hardware description language;information assurance;information sensitivity;production (computer science);proof assistant;register-transfer level;semiconductor industry;spectral leakage;trojan horse (computing)	Yier Jin;Bo Yang;Yiorgos Makris	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)	10.1109/HST.2013.6581573	real-time computing;computer science;cryptography;theoretical computer science;computer security;statistics;integrated circuit design	Arch	11.88710094195226	62.223907277029994	108324

To facilitate short time-to-market and reduced non-recurring engineering costs, automatic systems that can rapidly generate hardware bearing both power and performance in mind are extremely attractive. This paper proposes the BLADES (Better-than-worst-case Loop Accelerator Design) system for automatically designing self-tuning hardware accelerators that dynamically select their best operating frequency and voltage based on environmental conditions, silicon variation, and input data characteristics. Errors in operation are detected by Razor flip-flops, and recovery is initiated. The architecture efficiently supports detection, rollback, and recovery to provide a highly adaptable and configurable loop accelerator. The overhead of deploying Razor flip-flops is significantly reduced by automatically chaining primitive computation operations together. Results on a range of loop accelerators show average energy savings of 32% gained by voltage scaling below the nominal supply voltage.	best, worst and average case;clock rate;computation;dynamic voltage scaling;embedded system;flops;flip-flop (electronics);hardware acceleration;image scaling;overhead (computing);phase-locked loop;razor;requirement;rollback (data management);self-tuning	Ganesh S.

Our correlation-adaptive scheme follows the characteristics of real sensor data, and fills the gap of the correlation models addressed by most of previous research with inherent support for related data gathering algorithms. A core solution module of this architecture is devised, and theoretical analysis and simulation studies are conducted on real-world datasets. Through the real-world data experiments in terms of accuracy and energy-consumption evaluation, the correlation-adaptive scheme is shown to work well in multi-scale processing sensor networks.	algorithm;emergence;experiment;sensor;simulation	Xiaoning Cui;Baohua Zhao;Qing Li	2007		10.1145/1366804.1366849	embedded system;wireless sensor network;data processing;computer science;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;database	AI	10.64753816071107	74.37032499448306	108654

Such networks occur in wireless communication between sites (e.g., stations or sensors) situated in a terrain. Network stations are represented by points in the Euclidean plane, where a station is connected to all stations at distance at most 1 from it. A message transmitted by a station reaches all its neighbors, but a station hears a message (receives the message correctly) only if exactly one of its neighbors transmits at a given time step. One station of the network, called the source, has a message which has to be disseminated to all other stations. Stations are unaware of the network topology. Two broadcasting models are considered. In the conditional wake up model, the stations other than the source are initially idle and cannot transmit until they hear a message for the first time.In the spontaneous wake up model, all stations are awake (and may transmit messages) from the beginning.  It turns out that broadcasting time depends on two parameters of the UDG network, namely, its diameter D and its granularity g, which is the inverse of the minimum distance between any two stations. We present a deterministic broadcasting algorithm which works in time O(Dg) under the conditional wake up model and prove that broadcasting in this model cannot be accomplished by any deterministic algorithm in time better than Ω(D√g). For the spontaneous wake up model, we design two deterministic broadcasting algorithms: the first works in time O(D + g2) and the second intime O(Dlog g). While none of these algorithms alone is optimal for all parameter values, we prove that the algorithm obtained by interleaving their steps, and thus working in time O(min{D +g2,Dlogg}), turns out to be optimalby establishing a matching lower bound.	deterministic algorithm;forward error correction;network topology;sensor;situated;spontaneous order;unit disk graph	Yuval Emek;Leszek Gasieniec;Erez Kantor;Andrzej Pelc;David Peleg;Chang Su	2007	Distributed Computing	10.1007/s00446-008-0075-z	wireless ad hoc network;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;computer network	Theory	18.662523691640097	67.18049954014208	108689

We further propose to use light to track moving objects in WSNs. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to study multiple objects tracking using light sensors and general light sources.

020c8c6bdf4aa800e9863b0be3ca38deccbac529	rapid clock synchronisation for ubiquitous sensing services involving multiple smartphones		This paper investigates the precision of rapid clock synchronisation for ubiquitous sensing services which consist of multiple smartphones. Specifically, we consider scenarios where multiple smartphones are used to sense physical phenomena, and subsequently the sensor data from multiple distributed devices is aggregated. We observe that the accumulated clock drift for smartphones can be more than 150ms per day in the worst case. We show that solutions using the public Network Time Protocol (NTP) can be noisy with errors up to 1800ms in one request. We describe a rapid clock synchronisation technique that reduces drift to 10ms on average (measured by linear regression) and achieves pair-wise synchronisation between smartphones with an average of 27ms (measured by accelerometer), following a Gaussian-like distribution. Our results provide a lower bound for rapid clock synchronisation as a guide when developing ubiquitous sensing services using multiple smartphones.	best, worst and average case;clock drift;clock synchronization;smartphone	Chu Luo;Henri Koski;Mikko Korhonen;Jorge Gonçalves;Theodoros Anagnostopoulos;Shin'ichi Konomi;Simon Klakegg;Vassilis Kostakos	2017		10.1145/3123024.3124432	embedded system;network time protocol;linear regression;synchronization;computer science;real-time computing;mobile device;accelerometer;clock drift	Mobile	18.026215560982326	71.65526301000892	109067

Many deep-submicron effects including increased leakage power, process variability, noise-level, power- density and integration density are thought of to be liabilities for integrated design. However, we show how they may instead be an asset for certain types of secure circuits. These circuits are useful for secure embedded systems design, where stringent cost-, power- and implementation constraints, as well as the increased risk towards physical attacks, are among the design issues. We also conclude that not all deep sub-micron liabilities are secure-circuit assets, and point out some of the open challenges in secure circuit design.	cmos;circuit design;embedded system;random number generation;requirement;side-channel attack;spatial variability;spectral leakage;systems design;very-large-scale integration	Patrick Schaumont;David D.

31453140763938c1bd76da731023dd156288be77	a low-overhead adaptive image compression technique for energy-constrained wmsn		Abstract Advancement of low-cost hardware capable of processing multimedia data coupled with efficient short range radio communication has led to the development of Wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). We consider post-disaster situation analysis application where the nodes in a WMSN capture disaster images from the affected area. Energy is one of the scarcest resources for such a network especially for disaster application where power supply for charging the battery of a node is nearly impossible. In this paper we exploit such facts and propose an energy saving multimedia (image) data processing scheme for its subsequent transmission over energy-constrained WMSN. Unlike conventional image processing, it saves energy by reducing the data to be transmitted at the cost of segmentation-less adaptive compression. Finally, the comparative performance of the scheme shows its dominance over all the competing schemes. Precisely, our scheme saves on an average 34% energy over all the competing schemes.	image compression;overhead (computing)	Tamal Pal;Sipra Das Bit	2018	Computers & Electrical Engineering	10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.09.006	computer science;image compression;wireless sensor network;real-time computing;computer network;wireless;image processing;adaptive compression;exploit;image segmentation	HCI	10.573278793564455	69.44214801450029	109684

This solution requires slight modifications to current TCAMs including the elimination of the built-in encoder. Overall, the solution presented reduces the insertion problem to lookup speed while maintaining similar clock rates and storage requirements of the traditional TCAMs.	encoder;lookup table;network packet;priority encoder;requirement;routing table;sorting algorithm;static random-access memory;telecommunications access method	Raymond W.

b3e7f053ed5ff0b5396e7af3e45a99c626e45f78	an efficient task assignment mechanism for crowdsensing systems		Crowdsensing has attracted more and more attention in recent years, which can help companies or data demanders to collect large amounts of data efficiently and cheaply. In a crowdsensing system, the sensing tasks are divided into many small sub-tasks that can be easily accomplished by smartphone users, and the companies take advantage of the data collected by all the smartphone users to improve the quality of their services. Efficient task assignment mechanism design is very critical for crowdsensing under some realistic constraints. However, existing studies on task assignment issue are still have many limitations, such as most of them are failed to consider the time budget of smartphone users. Therefore, this work studies the optimal task assignment problem in crowdsensing systems, which can maximize the task completion rate with consideration of the time budget of users. We also prove that the optimal task assignment problem is NP-hard, thus we adopt the linear relaxation and greedy techniques to design a near-optimal crowdsensing task assignment mechanism. We also empirically evaluate our mechanism and show that the proposed task assignment mechanism is efficient.	activity selection problem;assignment problem;crowdsensing;greedy algorithm;linear programming relaxation;np-hardness;smartphone	Zhuan Shi;Tingwen Huang;Yu-e Sun;Xiaocan Wu;Fanzhang Li;Miaomiao Tian	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-48674-1_2	real-time computing;crowdsensing;mechanism design;assignment problem;computer science;distributed computing;completion rate	HCI	13.470408862019712	71.10638616297138	110137

To resist these attacks, special balanced dual-rail gates have been developed which have equal power consumption for all valid data values and transitions. A limitation of existing designs is that they require balanced routing of the dual-rail interconnect between gates. Natural process variation and suboptimal routing tools make it practically impossible to perfectly match the capacitances of the dual-rail pair making the balanced routing constraint difficult to satisfy. We present a general method and designs which achieve power balance in dual-rail circuits without requiring matching of gate output load capacitances or random masking. The method and design are based on a directional discharge protocol which ensures that both rails are always fully discharged and charged in each cycle.	asynchronous circuit;discharger;glitch;noise margin;overhead (computing);routing;semiconductor industry	Konrad J.

1b11566b6f827b9960b9dc6e01a5effdfb1d42f5	cleaning environmental sensing data streams based on individual sensor reliability		Environmental sensing is becoming a significant way for understanding and transforming the environment, given recent technology advances in the Internet of Things (IoT). Current environmental sensing projects typically deploy commodity sensors, which are known to be unreliable and prone to produce noisy and erroneous data. Unfortunately, the accuracy of current cleaning techniques based on mean or median prediction is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a cleaning method based on incrementally adjusted individual sensor reliabilities, called influence mean cleaning (IMC). By incrementally adjusting sensor reliabilities, our approach can properly discover latent sensor reliability values in a data stream, and improve reliability-weighted prediction even in a sensor network with changing conditions. The experimental results based on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy than the mean and median-based approaches after some initial adjustment iterations.	plasma cleaning	Yihong Zhang;Claudia Szabo;Quan Z.

Dimensionality reduction, obtained simply from the outputs of the neural-networks clustering algorithms, leads to lower communication costs and energy savings. Two different data aggregation architectures are presented, with algorithms which use wavelets for initial data-processing of the sensory inputs and artificial neural-networks which use unsupervised learning methods for categorization of the sensory inputs. They are analyzed on a data obtained from a set of several motes, equipped with several sensors each. Results from deliberately simulated malfunctioning sensors show the data robustness of these architectures.	algorithm;artificial neural network;categorization;cluster analysis;clustered file system;computation;data aggregation;dimensionality reduction;distributed computing;requirement;sensor;unsupervised learning;wavelet	Andrea Kulakov;Danco Davcev;Goran P.

IEEE 802.15.4a is an alternative PHY for IEEE 802.15.4, which is used for wireless sensor networks, and it can be applied to ranging applications. Through CSS ranging, the coordinate of a CSS node can be calculated by using trilateration. This approach is usually used for mobile robot localization. In the case of mobile robot localization, the dynamics of a mobile robot can be modeled as a state-space equation because a robot is an artificial object manufactured by designers. Therefore, the coordinate of a mobile robot can be estimated by using the Kalman filter. However, in the case of localization of a mobile node whose movement cannot be predicted, the dynamics of the mobile node are difficult to model. Therefore, we propose a strategy that regards the un-modeled dynamics as the process noise of the state-space equation. Further, we propose a method for determining the statics of the process noise based on some reasonable assumptions. Through the localization experiment, we verify the proposed method and discuss the results.	algorithm;cascading style sheets;chirp;displacement mapping;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;internationalization and localization;kalman filter;mobile robot;phy (chip);robotic mapping;state space	Hyeonwoo Cho;Jewon Lee;Younghun Lee;Sang Woo Kim	2010	2010 International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications	10.1109/ICCSA.2010.54	kalman filter;mobile robot;embedded system;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;artificial intelligence;operating system;machine learning;mobile computing;spread spectrum	Robotics	21.650760168882	74.0786435889407	110795

If video cameras are equipped with circuits that receive and convert energy from regenerative sources such as solar cells, an effective power management becomes essential for the design of small sized and perpetually powered devices, which can be deployed unattended for years and feature smart vision applications. In this paper we present a simple but optimal power management tailored for multi-modal video sensor nodes and based on model predictive controller (MPC) principles. The system is designed for low-power and low-cost video surveillance and exploits small solar cells for battery recharging and Pyroelectric InfraRed (PIR) sensors to provide low-power monitoring when the camera is not needed. The aim of this work is to show how an adaptive controller helps the system to improve its performance while outperforming naive power management policies.

We can distinguish whether the signal transmitters are primary users or PUEAs by obtaining the locations of transmitters through processing the received signal strength (RSS) readings. Since the RSS has redundancy in spatial domain, we employ CS theory to save the number of measurement sensors and messages need to be collected. Additionally, the number of measurements is dominated by the number of PUEA being sensed, the conventional algorithms with fixed measurement number have poor performances in physical situations where number of PUEA is unknown and changing. So, we propose an adaptive orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (AOMP) to adapt to the changing cases of PUEA. Simulation results show that the location reconstruction of changing PUEA by AOMP algorithm outperforms traditional OMP algorithm with better accuracy. As a result, the channel utilization can be greatly improved.	algorithm;cognitive radio;compressed sensing;computation;computational complexity theory;emulator;genetic algorithm;matching pursuit;openmp;performance;rss;sensor;simulation;throughput;transmitter	Manman Dang;Zhifeng Zhao;Honggang Zhang	2013	2013 International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing	10.1109/WCSP.2013.6677144	electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Mobile	13.032282016210543	73.5437430887781	111600
2c2132d7a3da46369602f6134b928e18469f7768	a dfa-resistant and masked present with area optimization for rfid applications		Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tag-based applications are usually resource constrained and security sensitive. However, only about 2,000 gate equivalents in a tag can be budgeted for implementing security components [27]. This requires not only lightweight cryptographic algorithms such as PRESENT (around 1,000 gate equivalents) but also lightweight protections against modern Side Channel Attacks (SCAs). With this budget, the first-order masking and fault detection are two suitable countermeasures to be developed for PRESENT. However, if both countermeasures are applied without any optimization, it will significantly exceed the given area budget. In this work, we optimize area to include both countermeasures to maximize the security for PRESENT within this RFID area budget. The most area-consuming parts of the proposed design are the masked S-boxes and the inverse masked S-boxes. To optimize the area, we have deduced a computational relationship between these two parts, which enables us to reuse the hardware resource of the masked S-boxes to implement the inverse masked S-boxes. The proposed design takes up only 2,376 gates with UMC 65nm CMOS technology. Compared with the unoptimized design, our implementation reduces the overall area by 28.45%. We have tested the effectiveness of the first-order Differential Power Analysis (DPA) and Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) -resistant countermeasures. Experimental results show that we have enhanced the SCA resistance of our PRESENT implementation.	algorithm;cmos;computation;countermeasure (computer);cryptography;differential fault analysis;fault detection and isolation;first-order predicate;gate equivalent;mathematical optimization;radio-frequency identification;s-box	Yi Wang;Yajun Ha	2017	ACM Trans.

ff7a26705a6ff28d1bcce208d1a442ef2b7bd0fd	sram circuits for true random number generation using intrinsic bit instability		This paper describes a novel approach to a true random number generator (TRNG) using SRAM circuits. The principles of operation are described in the context of past work on integrated circuit TRNGs. The required modifications to standard SRAM arrays are minor and have little impact on the area. Experimental results from large 1-Mbit SRAM arrays fabricated on a 55-nm process using the foundry supplied SRAM cell layouts show good results. Simple helper functions, suitable for very small hardware implementation, allow improvement, including the ability for the resulting binary strings to pass all of the National Institute of Standards randomness tests. We describe the circuits, their principle of operation and statistical behavior, as well as the underlying physical mechanisms providing the entropy.	cell (microprocessor);entropy (information theory);hardware random number generator;instability;integrated circuit;random number generation;randomness tests;static random-access memory	Lawrence T.

Most of the tracking schemes are based on trilateration, which requires each point in the monitoring area to be covered by at least three anchors. However, due to the inadequate deployment of costly anchors and environment constraints, the target might not always be detected by three or more anchors simultaneously, resulting in intermittent localization failures and performance degradation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a tracking method called Bubble Trace (BT) for insufficient anchor coverage and asynchronous networks. By fully extracting the location information embedded in dual, single and zero anchor coverage, we develop a bidirectional bounding algorithm to offer the bubble-shaped regions that indicate the possible locations of the target. Moreover, instead of separately estimating each position point of the target, we construct the trace by finding a maximum-likelihood path in a graph. The design is evaluated through extensive simulation and a test-bed experiment with 20 MicaZ nodes. Results show that the proposed scheme improves the tracking accuracy without using additional hardware under insufficient anchor coverage.	algorithm;bidirectional search;elegant degradation;embedded system;html element;simulation;software deployment;testbed	Pengpeng Chen;Ziguo Zhong;Tian He	2011	2011 31st International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	10.1109/ICDCS.2011.56	real-time computing;simulation;graph theory;maximum likelihood;computer security;statistics	Robotics	16.953519737665214	73.65260345689576	112664

However, most of these algorithms have been implemented and evaluated in simulation frameworks. In this paper, we evaluate the implementation of these algorithms to manage the energy of real-world LoRaWAN IoT nodes. We measure and compare the performance of the different energy budget estimation methods on a commercial LoRaWAN IoT platform. Results show that in this use-case, the choice of algorithm impacts the system Quality of Service by less than 15 %.

6375817d42c66856d1a1dc2226eb93918971df71	density based multisensor data fusion for multiapplication wireless sensor networks		The trend in the design of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has recently shifted from an application-specific approach to a virtualization and resource-sharing view. Current WSNs allow the sensing and communication infrastructure to be shared among multiple applications thus optimizing the use of resources. However, as the number of applications sharing the WSN infrastructure grows, storing and analyzing requirements of all applications at the network level becomes unfeasible. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we proposed a multisensor data fusion method that requires no knowledge of the application specific requirements. For performing the analysis of the data, in our proposal we leverage concepts of the area of pattern recognition to create abstract sensors based on intervals in the monitored data. Considering that sensed data have a measuring range, given by their maximum and minimum values, our proposed methods group the data samples in abstract sensors based on density and peaks on the dataset. Both real and simulated experiments have shown that our proposal is accurate and reduce energy consumption.	experiment;maxima and minima;pattern recognition;requirement;sensor	Claudio Miceli de Farias;Luci Pirmez;Flávia Coimbra Delicato	2018	2018 IEEE 16th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 16th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 4th Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech)	10.1109/DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTec.2018.00-24	real-time computing;virtualization;wireless sensor network;energy consumption;sensor fusion;computer science	Mobile	10.70510307729609	73.99864525720383	114321

Applications of acoustic monitoring with EnviroMic range from the study of mating rituals and social behavior of animals in the wild to audio surveillance of military targets. EnviroMic is designed for disconnected operation, where the luxury of having a basestation cannot be assumed. We implement the system on a Tiny OS-based platform and systematically evaluate its performance through both indoor testbed experiments and a preliminary outdoor deployment.

That such things are possible is explained by sophisticated theorems that demonstrate the possibility of efficiently reducing computational errors introduced by reasonably well-behaved noise. My thesis is about the problem of determining whether noise in prototype quantum information processors is sufficiently well-behaved for fault-tolerant quantum computing to be possible. My work is divided into two themes. The first theme is the interpretation of average gate fidelity, a quantity that has become the standard performance metric for assessing progress towards fault tolerance. I have elucidated the connection between average gate fidelity and the requirements of fault-tolerant quantum computing by demonstrating the limits of fidelity as a proxy for error rate, the usual metric in fault-tolerance literature. I thereby conclude that information additional to fidelity is required to assess progress towards fault-tolerance. The second theme is the characterization of two-level defect systems, a particularly deleterious kind of noise that can affect superconducting-integrated-circuit-based quantum computing prototypes. I have designed statistical experimental design algorithms that can rigorously assess the influence of these defect systems, and I helped develop a proposal to mitigate their influence. I thereby demonstrate that existing experimental techniques can become much more powerful by employing advanced data collection procedures. My work has immediate implications for current research efforts towards the first working quantum computer. Theoretical work should be directed at assessing noise sources using metrics other than average gate fidelity, and future experimental characterization techniques should become more modular in order to incorporate advanced statistical inference techniques like the ones I develop herein.	algorithm;central processing unit;computation;computer;design of experiments;fault tolerance;integrated circuit;our world;prototype;quantum computing;quantum information science;requirement;software bug;theme (computing)	Yuval Sanders	2016			quantum simulator;quantum information;computer science;theoretical computer science;quantum network;quantum technology;distributed computing;quantum computer;quantum mechanics;quantum error correction	DB	17.493133879124002	64.27713582632202	114572

Thus, high FPGA design security is needed with low performance penalties and low realization and maintenance costs. Using a novel circuit modification method, common circuits were augmented with decoy circuits for protection. Security values for the original and modified circuits were calculated, and the original and modified circuits' execution times, power consumptions, and resource usages were collected from simulations. For the modified circuits, security improved by six orders of magnitude, yet execution times, power consumption, and resource usage increased by less than one order of magnitude.

96a39f3d57f28511c910b5bae6701ee4954d23b9	a novel system for wifi radio map automatic adaptation and indoor positioning		WiFi fingerprinting-based indoor positioning system (IPS) using received signal strength (RSS) has been considered to be one solution for indoor positioning. However, there are two major bottlenecks that hamper its large-scale implementation. One widely recognized problem is the construction of a proper fingerprint database with high efficiency and accuracy. Second is to improve the online positioning accuracy on the basis of the fingerprint database. To address these issues comprehensively, this paper proposes a novel system—Digital navigation center IPS (DncIPS), an IPS that enables automatic online radio map construction, and step-by-step positioning, aiming for the high-accuracy RSS estimation and high-precision positioning. DncIPS can capture WiFi data packets transmitted in WiFi traffic so that they obtain the MAC addresses, frequency, and RSS of any WiFi access point (AP) at any point. DncIPS uses Gaussian process regression model based on a fireworks algorithm to approximate the RSS distribution of an indoor environment and to estimate the location of APs increasing the flexibility of DncIPS work environment. This system also consists of a coarse localizer detecting the outliers and dividing clustering area and a fine localizer followed to improve the online positioning accuracy. Extensive experiments results indicate the proposed system DncIPS leads to improvement on radio map updating and localization accuracy.	approximation algorithm;cluster analysis;experiment;fingerprint (computing);fireworks algorithm;gaussian process;indoor positioning system;kriging;network packet;rss;sensor;wireless access point	Ye Tao;Long Zhao	2018	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology	10.1109/TVT.2018.2867065		Mobile	19.185935675822453	73.59124580237831	115150

In this paper, we review the literature regarding the positioning under non-line-of-sight conditions and analyze a range of topics from explicit modeling to empirical data collection. The variety of research indicates the growing interest in reliable and accurate localization in urban areas. Moreover, the development and application of different techniques also suggest the existence of many avenues for further exploration. Accordingly, we develop a taxonomy of the technical design for GNSS applications dealing with NLOS and a typology of the measuring instruments based on an extensive analysis of the state of the art. Thus, the goal of this work is to provide a starting point regarding the state of the art for further research activities in robust GNSS positioning.	application domain;biological anthropology;explicit modeling;gnss applications;galileo (satellite navigation);global positioning system;ground truth;internationalization and localization;line-of-sight (missile);satellite navigation;usability	Julia Bressler;Pierre Reisdorf;Marcus Obst;Gerd Wanielik	2016	2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795701	simulation;gnss augmentation;geography;telecommunications;remote sensing	Robotics	20.103992855267858	74.49239840376613	115619
5e83df79d7c06d38db647852f3658a0550216e2d	sensor virtualization for underwater event detection	event detection;underwater wireless sensor network;compressive sensing;virtual sensor	Distributed event detection is a popular application in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs). The Base Station (BS) collects the measurements from multiple sensor nodes, and makes a decision based on the sensors' reports. However, due to the unpredictable moving of underwater sensor nodes and interference among multiple events, it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of event detection. In this paper, we propose a sensor virtualization approach to deal with the event detection problem in UWSNs. The final decision making at the BS will be implemented with the reports of multiple virtual sensors. Although the events may happen in a large scale, the locations where the events happen are relatively sparse in the underwater environment. Consider the sparse property of events, we employ the technique of compressive sensing to recover the original signal from the correlated sensors' measurements. Through a proper signal reconstruction, the accurate event detection can be reached with a remarkable low sensing overhead. We implement the sensor virtualization based on the compressive sensing technique. Our approach is suitable for the high dynamic topology of UWSN, and it can improve the accuracy of event detection and reduce energy consumption in UWSNs.

afc02bb961605148d0b783fd634e3e63de3fa949	an efficient distributed data extraction method for mining sensor networks data		A wide range of Sensor Networks (SNs) are deployed in real world applications which generate large amount of raw sensory data. Data mining technique to extract useful knowledge from these applications is an emerging research area due to its crucial importance but still it’s a challenge to discover knowledge efficiently from the sensor network data. In this paper we proposed a Distributed Data Extraction (DDE) method to extract data from sensor networks by applying rules based clustering and association rule mining techniques. A significant amount of sensor readings sent from the sensors to the data processing point(s) may be lost or corrupted. DDE is also estimating these missing values from available sensor reading instead of requesting the sensor node to resend lost reading. DDE also apply data reduction which is able to reduce the data size while transmitting to sink. Results show our proposed approach exhibits the maximum data accuracy and efficient data extraction in term of the entire network’s energy consumption.	association rule learning;cluster analysis;data mining;dynamic data exchange;missing data;retransmission (data networks);sensor node;transmitter	Azhar Mahmood;Ke Shi;Shaheen Khatoon	2013	CoRR		data science;machine learning;data mining;database;data stream mining;visual sensor network	DB	10.914391202197637	74.2798514290945	116719

The pseudorandom bit sequence is generated by the linear feedback shift register to represent the redundant bits. Additionally, the ring oscillator with a divider and a multiplexer produces a programmable operation frequency. Such approach not only protects the transmitted data under fairly low power consumption, but it also can integrate with the other encryption methods, such as the advanced encryption standard (AES) and the data encryption standard (DES), to further enhance security.

This paper establishes a complete process of electromagnetic analysis attack based on correlation between energy traces and intermediate data in AES encryption algorithm. A novel method of preprocessing energy traces, which combines wavelet reconstruction with low-pass filtering, is proposed to enhance the capability to obtain correct key information of AES. Correlation-based power analysis attack (CPA) and electromagnetic analysis attack (CEMA) are implemented on the unprotected AES encryption circuit in the SAKURA-G FPGA board. The results clearly show that only 972 and 1069 energy traces are required to find all 16-byte keys. With only collecting 200 traces, CEMA presents more efficient attack capability than CPA. Thus, our proposed method is appropriate for obtaining key information of cryptographic devices.	algorithm;byte;cryptography;encryption;field-programmable gate array;haar wavelet;low-pass filter;preprocessor;side-channel attack;tracing (software)	Aiguo Bu;Wentao Dai;Minyi Lu;Hao Cai;Weiwei Shan	2018	2018 17th IEEE International Conference On Trust, Security And Privacy In Computing And Communications/ 12th IEEE International Conference On Big Data Science And Engineering (TrustCom/BigDataSE)	10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00288	wavelet;power analysis;computer network;field-programmable gate array;cryptography;filter (signal processing);theoretical computer science;haar wavelet;advanced encryption standard;side channel attack;computer science	EDA	11.819930495274406	65.3329346188715	117976
3bc2e509b4ebe5dc7342bae4c1fd13fc3b683d59	cloud-based pvt monitoring system for iot devices		Reliability of an IC, concerning if an IC can function reliably over its designated lifetime in the field, has become more and more important in today's safety-critical applications. It is known that reliability can be affected by PVT effects, (Process, Voltage, Temperature). These effects not only depend on the physical locations where an IC is operated, but also vary over time. In this work, we present a cloud-based PVT monitoring system for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, by taking advantage of its inherent internet connectivity. By doing so, one can know of the PVT status of any IoT device remotely and continually at any time and any place. With the obtained information, a potential PVT-induced failure can be alarmed in advance before it actually strikes, and thereby pre-cautious actions (such as adaptive measures, online repair, or even manual replacement) can be taken in advance to avoid unnecessary system down time.	clock rate;cloud computing;downtime;integrated circuit;internet access;internet of things;reliability engineering;server (computing);virtual private server	Guan-Hao Lian;Shi-Yu Huang;Wei-yi Chen	2017	2017 IEEE 26th Asian Test Symposium (ATS)	10.1109/ATS.2017.26	real-time computing;internet access;cloud computing;computer science;downtime;internet of things;server	Embedded	16.325709469935262	67.28438412795144	117978
0e55332bae2052ccb5beacf2d8df9e6590f01fa9	real-time event detection with water sensor networks using a spatio-temporal model		Event detection with the spatio-temporal correlation is one of the most popular applications of wireless sensor networks. This kind of task trends to be a difficult problem of big data analysis due to the massive data generated from large-scale sensor networks like water sen- sor networks, especially in the context of real-time analysis. To reduce the computational cost of abnormal event detection and improve the response time, sensor node selection is needed to cut down the amount of data for the spatio-temporal correlation analysis. In this paper, a con- nected dominated set (CDS) approach is introduced to select backbone nodes from the sensor network. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal model is proposed to achieve the spatio-temporal correlation analysis, where Markov chain is adopted to model the temporal dependency among the different sensor nodes, and Bayesian Network (BN) is used to model the spatial dependency. The proposed approach and model have been applied to the real-time detection of urgent events (e.g. water pollution incidents) with water sensor networks. Preliminary experimental results on simulated data indicate that our solution can achieve better perfor- mance in terms of response time and scalability, compared to the simple threshold algorithm and the BN-only algorithm.	real-time clock	Yingchi Mao;Xiaoli Chen;Zhuoming Xu	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-32055-7_17	real-time computing;computer science;data mining;computer security	Robotics	11.417756675249823	72.32341181084686	118698

The unique characteristics and constraints of wireless sensor networks (WSN) make this problem especially challenging. Sensors can detect outliers for a plethora of reasons and these reasons need to be inferred in real time.

Central to Walkie-Markie is a novel exploitation of the WiFi infrastructure to define landmarks (WiFi-Marks) to fuse crowdsourced user trajectories obtained from inertial sensors on users’ mobile phones. WiFi-Marks are special pathway locations at which the trend of the received WiFi signal strength changes from increasing to decreasing when moving along the pathway. By embedding these WiFi-Marks in a 2D plane using a newly devised algorithm and connecting them with calibrated user trajectories, Walkie-Markie is able to infer pathway maps with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that Walkie-Markie is able to reconstruct a high-quality pathway map for a real office-building floor after only 5-6 rounds of walks, with accuracy gradually improving as more user data becomes available. The maximum discrepancy between the inferred pathway map and the real one is within 3m and 2.8m for the anchor nodes and path segments, respectively.	algorithm;crowdsourcing;discrepancy function;displacement mapping;experiment;gene regulatory network;graph embedding;linear programming relaxation;map;mobile phone;rss;sensor;wireless access point	Guobin Shen;Zhuo Chen;Peichao Zhang;Thomas Moscibroda;Yongguang Zhang	2013			computer vision;simulation	Mobile	17.977383314921443	73.00898354814154	119091

We will show that, because of the occurrence of internal faults, some of these structures may become useless, with consequent dramatic impact on test effectiveness and product quality. We borrow the Fault Secure property, that is well known for Self-Checking Circuits, for DFT structures. We will show that it guarantees that no escapes or false acceptance of faulty products may occur because of faults affecting the employed DFT structures. We will discuss the Fault Secureness of the considered DFT structures. We will provide some examples of how the non Fault Secure ones can be modified to meet the Fault Secure goal, thus avoiding their prospected detrimental effect on next generation high performance microprocessors test effectiveness and quality.	design for testing;microprocessor;next-generation network;processor design;software bug	Cecilia Metra;T.

e3bcdd8b78cbac7cef6b69682ab7e0c916f0d8fb	two-phase grouping-based resource management for big data processing in mobile cloud computing	mobile cloud computing;resource management;two phase grouping;big data	Big data is generated from recent social network services, and distributed processing techniques have been studied to analyze it. In particular, because of the fast spread of mobile devices, a huge amount data is generated in a mobile environment. The distributed processing technologies such as MapReduce are applied to mobile devices, thanks to the improved computing power of mobile devices. However, mobile devices have several problems such as the movement problem and the utilization problem. Especially, the utilization problem and the movement problem of mobile devices cause system faults more frequently because of dynamic changes, and system faults prevent applications using mobile devices from being processed reliably. Therefore, to cope with these significant problems of mobile devices, we propose a grouping technique based on the utilization and movement rates. In our proposed scheme, mobile devices are separated into groups by cut-off points based on entropy values. We also propose a two-phase grouping method in order to reduce the overhead of group management. The experimental result shows that our algorithm outperforms traditional grouping techniques with maintaining stable big data processing and managing reliable resource.

We analyze the resistance of XMEGA crypto engines to side channel attacks. We reveal the relatively strong side channel leakage of the AES engine that enables full 128-bit AES secret key recovery in a matter of several minutes with a measurement setup cost about 1000 USD. 3000 power consumption traces are sufficient for the successful attack. Our analysis was performed without knowing the details of the crypto engine internals; quite the contrary, it reveals some details about the implementation. We sketch other feasible side channel attacks on XMEGA and suggest the counter-measures that can raise the complexity of the attacks but not fully prevent them.	128-bit;8-bit;atmel avr;general-purpose markup language;key (cryptography);key escrow;microcontroller;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;tracing (software)	Ilya Kizhvatov	2009		10.1145/1631716.1631724	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	Crypto	11.888181776753573	64.20744826439696	119905

The platform uses the Time-Difference-Of-Arrival (TDOA) of multiple ultrasonic chirps broadcast from a network of beacons placed throughout the environment to find an initial location as well as synchronize a receiver's clock with the infrastructure. These chirps encode identification data and ranging information that can be used to compute the receiver's location. Once the clocks have been synchronized, the system can continue performing localization directly using Time-of-Flight (TOF) ranging as opposed to TDOA. This provides similar position accuracy with fewer beacons (for tens of minutes) until the mobile device clock drifts enough that a TDOA signal is once again required. Our hardware platform uses RF-based time synchronization to distribute clock synchronization from a subset of infrastructure beacons connected to a GPS source. Mobile devices use a novel time synchronization technique leverages the continuously free-running audio sampling subsystem of a smartphone to synchronize with global time. Once synchronized, each device can determine an accurate proximity from as little as one beacon using TOF measurements. This significantly decreases the number of beacons required to cover an indoor space and improves performance in the face of obstructions. We show through experiments that this approach outperforms the Network Time Protocol (NTP) on smartphones by an order of magnitude, providing an average 720μs synchronization accuracy with clock drift rates as low as 2ppm.	chirp;clock drift;clock synchronization;encode;experiment;global positioning system;microphone;mobile device;modulation;multilateration;radio frequency;requirement;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor research corporation;simultaneous localization and mapping;smartphone;transmitter	Patrick Lazik;Niranjini Rajagopal;Bruno Sinopoli;Anthony Rowe	2015	21st IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium	10.1109/RTAS.2015.7108422	clock synchronization;embedded system;synchronization;real-time computing;jitter;global positioning system;telecommunications;computer science	Embedded	18.37425778779493	71.75391645358798	120028

The fundamental premise for our work is that in multimedia applications, different bits in the same SRAM word are usually not equally significant, and hence deserve different protection levels. The key innovation in our work includes (i) a novel metric, word mean squared error, to measure the reliability of a SRAM word when different bits are not equally significant and (ii) an optimization algorithm based on dynamic programming to construct the UEPECC that assigns different protection levels to bits according to their significance. The advantage of the UEPECC over the traditional equal-error-protection ECC is demonstrated using two representative multimedia applications. For the same area, power, and encoding/decoding latency, SRAMs with UEPECC increase the peak signal-to-noise ratio by 8 dB in image processing and incur 60% less errors on average in optical flow (motion vector) computation.	algorithm;cell (microprocessor);central processing unit;circuit design;code;computation;computer data storage;computer-aided design;design automation conference;dynamic programming;dynamic random-access memory;error detection and correction;failure analysis;field-programmable gate array;forward error correction;graphics;ibm journal of research and development;ieee 754-1985;image processing;image quality;information theory;integrated circuit;low-power broadcasting;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;neural networks;optical flow;peak signal-to-noise ratio;programming paradigm;scalability;solid-state drive;springer (tank);static random-access memory;structural similarity	Xuebei Yang;Kartik Mohanram	2011	2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)		electronic engineering;real-time computing;error detection and correction;peak signal-to-noise ratio;computer science;theoretical computer science;dynamic programming;optical flow;mean squared error;mobile computing;statistics	EDA	19.687497591944513	62.751806728188335	120047

These solutions rely on the reciprocity and spatial channel correlation principles. This work aims at presenting empirical studies on the aforesaid properties. First, we verify the UWB reciprocity for different multipath scenarios. In these experiences, the reciprocity is always valid independently of distance between the receiver and emitter. However, we show that using an asymmetric hardware in up and down links, can affect the channel similarity. Secondly, we report measurements of spatial correlation in near and far field channel. Various experimental scenarios are tested to validate location channel variations. We observe that in very close and far receiver's locations, there is no correlation. This variation is not depending on distance but mainly on the indoor environment. In addition, various channel parameters: channel impulse response, channel envelope, and power delay profile have been investigated. We show that channel properties rely on these parameters.	ambiguous name resolution;committed information rate;key (cryptography);key derivation function;key generation;lambert's cosine law;multipath propagation;software propagation;spatial variability;transceiver	Sana Tmar Ben Hamida;Jean-Benoît Pierrot;Claude Castelluccia	2010	21st Annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	10.1109/PIMRC.2010.5671596	spatial correlation;telecommunications;computer science;information security;antenna;ultra-wideband;empirical research;transient response;correlation;wireless;computer network	Mobile	23.9028512290413	70.97516808747348	120058

One of the outstanding hybrid approaches is the Radio Frequency Identification(RFID) assisted inertial navigation system, which is notable for its low cost, simple implementation and extraordinary accuracy. Previous work on such hybrid system fails to find out the correlation between the deployment of the multiple calibration points and the indoor localization accuracy. In this paper, we use the Android smart phone to build a hybrid localization platform and conduct measurements with multiple RFID calibration tags. Based on the measurement results, we define a mathematical model which includes the calibration point number, RFID tag density and the RFID tag-to-corner distance to describe the deployment effect on the localization accuracy. Such model facilitates the future study on algorithm design, system evaluation and application development.	algorithm design;android;hybrid system;inertial navigation system;mathematical model;mathematical optimization;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;smartphone;software deployment;tag cloud	Guanxiong Liu;Yishuang Geng;Kaveh Pahlavan	2015	2015 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)	10.1109/ICCNC.2015.7069473	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	19.70221339581801	74.44596418708016	120091

The cross-domain VC extends the synchronous VC in a single clock domain to multiple clock domains. The synchronous VCs reserve cyclic time slots at each node from source to destination for a traffic flow to use shared links without contention based on the assumption that all nodes share the same notion of time. However, when VCs pass multiple clock domains with different phases and frequencies, the assumption of global synchrony is not valid any more and consequently they cannot function correctly. This paper addresses this problem based on a typical FIFO clock domain interface. We give the conditions and a realization scheme to ensure correct packet delivery with QoS for VCs crossing multiple clock domains. We apply network calculus to analyze and derive the bounds of the packet delay and the FIFO size.	clock signal;fifo (computing and electronics);global serializability;multiplexing;network calculus;network packet;quality of service;toad data modeler;virtual circuit	Zhonghai Lu	2011	Proceedings of the Fifth ACM/IEEE International Symposium	10.1145/1999946.1999980	embedded system;real-time computing;quality of service;telecommunications;clock domain crossing;clock skew;computer science;traffic flow;network on a chip;synchronous circuit;virtual circuit;digital clock manager;time-division multiplexing;computer network	Embedded	18.138670823368006	66.1335894612884	120839

The virtual sensor implements a piecewise-affine (PWA)-based model to estimate the sensed variable. The measurement is authenticated with the keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) standard. To ensure the integrity of the sensor, the static random access memory (SRAM) required by the sensor is also used as physical unclonable function (PUF). Implementation results of the design in a 90-nm CMOS technology show that the security blocks occupy 5.1% of the area occupied by the required PWA blocks and consume 15.4% of the power consumed by the required PWA blocks. The sensor is able to provide trusted outputs in 106.3 microseconds when working at 100 MHz.	cmos;hash-based message authentication code;logic synthesis;physical unclonable function;picasa web albums;random access;sampling (signal processing);sensor;static random-access memory	Macarena C.

In this paper, we propose path loss based VCE localization algorithm using weighted average of the sensors position. The main challenge in path loss based localization in human body is the scattered random deviation of path loss caused by the shadowing and multipath propagation of non-homogeneous medium. To address the randomness issue of the scattered path loss, we propose three non-parametric methods of path loss estimation using moving averaging, local weighted regression and local Gaussian weighted average. Then we use the degree based estimated path loss to calculate the weight of the sensors position. We propose a heuristic method of degree estimation for the estimated path loss. We develop a simulation platform using MATLAB to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods. The results show significant improvement in accuracy without any prior knowledge of distance related channel parameters.	algorithm;benchmark (computing);heuristic;internationalization and localization;matlab;mean squared error;multipath propagation;randomness;sensor;simulation;smoothing;software propagation;tract (literature);video coding engine	Umma Hany;Lutfa Akter	2018	IJWIN	10.1007/s10776-017-0379-7	multipath propagation;mathematical optimization;real-time computing;randomness;computer science;path loss;nonparametric statistics;communication channel;weighted arithmetic mean	AI	22.849360318380292	72.31692079764647	121391

Equally, smartphone manufacturers are mounting several wireless communication and localization technologies, inertial sensors as well as powerful processing capability, to cater to such LBS applications. A hybrid of wireless technologies is needed to provide seamless localization solutions and to improve accuracy, to reduce time to fix, and to reduce power consumption. The review of localization techniques/technologies of this emerging field is therefore important. This article reviews the recent research-oriented and commercial localization solutions on smartphones. The focus of this article is on the implementation challenges associated with utilizing these positioning solutions on Android-based smartphones. Furthermore, the taxonomy of smartphone-location techniques is highlighted with a special focus on the detail of each technique and its hybridization. The article compares the indoor localization techniques based on accuracy, utilized wireless technology, overhead, and localization technique used. The pursuit of achieving ubiquitous localization outdoors and indoors for critical LBS applications such as security and safety shall dominate future research efforts.	android;anytime algorithm;application programming interface;autonomous robot;course (navigation);crowdsourcing;displacement mapping;emergence;fingerprint (computing);instability;internationalization and localization;kalman filter;location-based service;overhead (computing);positioning system;satellite navigation;seamless3d;sensor;shattered world;smartphone;spontaneous order;time of arrival;usb on-the-go	Halgurd S.

Several Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), which utilizes the variation when manufacturing, are proposed as a countermeasure for imitation electronics. An arbiter PUF is one of the most popular PUFs. The operation of an arbiter PUF can be expressed by using a delay model. An arbiter PUF is reported to be attacked by forcing them to learn the delay model. Almost all of previous studies used SVM for the learning. This study proposes a new attack method using a deep learning technique.

4a5641cd6b537ecfdf6d54496a09d5ff7cd97adf	puf-fsm: a controlled strong puf		Existing strong controlled physical unclonable function (PUF) designs are built to resist modeling attacks and they deal with noisy PUF responses by exploiting error correction logic. These designs are burdened by the costs of the error correction logic and information shown to leak through the associated helper data for assisting error corrections; leaving the design vulnerable to fault attacks or reliability-based attacks. We present a hybrid PUF–finite state machine (PUF-FSM) construction to realize a controlled strong PUF. The PUF-FSM design removes the need for error correction logic and related computation, storage of the helper data and loading it on-chip by only employing error-free responses judiciously determined on demand in the absence of the underlying PUF—an Arbiter PUF—with a large challenge response pair space. The PUF-FSM demonstrates improved security, especially to reliability-based attacks and is able to support a range of applications from authentication to more advanced cryptographic applications built upon shared keys. We experimentally validate the practicability of the PUF-FSM.	arbiter (electronics);challenge–response authentication;computation;cryptography;differential fault analysis;error detection and correction;experiment;finite-state machine;low-power fsm synthesis;physical unclonable function	Yansong Gao;Hua Ma;Said F.

In this paper, we propose a novel design of dynamically reconfigurable PUF based on Phase Change Memory (PCM) technology to yield refreshed cryptographic keys whenever the need arises to achieve enhanced security. A dedicated circuit framework is also introduced to reinforce the diversity of the CRP sets and improve the stability of the proposed PUF. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed work promises a clean delineation from the security bottlenecks faced by the state-of-the-art PUF designs.	challenge–response authentication;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;key (cryptography);key generator;leased line;phase-change memory;physical unclonable function;reconfigurability;simulation;trusted computing	Le Zhang;Zhi-Hui Kong;Chip Hong Chang	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS2013)	10.1109/ISCAS.2013.6572128	embedded system;programming;physical unclonable function;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;cryptography;resistance;computer security	EDA	13.459512662270662	64.10285390406708	124301

Accurate estimation of the sensor position can be crucial in many of these applications. In this research, we propose a localization algorithm based on probabilistic fuzzy logic systems (PFLS) for range-free localization. The algorithm utilizes received signal strength (RSS) from the anchor nodes embedded with variant degrees of environmental noise. The proposed system is compared with another algorithm based on Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLS) against variant amount of noise. Simulation results demonstrate that FLS can be much more accurate than PFLS method if the environment is noise-free. However, as the environmental noise increases, the PFLS reaches better performance.	algorithm;embedded system;formal system;free library of springfield township;fuzzy logic;rss;simulation;vehicle tracking system	Mahnaz Kadkhoda;Mohammad R.

In contrast to the traditional approach which uses the pulse that guarantees writes for all cells, the proposed technique uses multiple short pulses. Individually, these pulses result in high probability of write error therefore multiple attempts are made until a successful write for all bits. Average write energy is significantly reduced because the average write duration is far shorter than the worst-case duration. We developed a self-validation write circuit that allows bit-wise validation and current de-activation without adding energy and area overhead. We evaluated the proposed circuit using a compact STT-RAM model targeting an implementation in a 10nm technology node. Results indicate that the proposed architecture reduces write energy by 94.6% compared to the conventional design. Compared to the best previously known architectures that rely on write-read-verify strategy we reduce write energy by 2.1X without area overhead.	best, worst and average case;error message;overhead (computing);random-access memory;reduction strategy (lambda calculus);semiconductor device fabrication	Jaeyoung Park;Michael Orshansky	2016	2016 International Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI (GLSVLSI)	10.1145/2902961.2903015	spin-transfer torque;electronic engineering;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer hardware;computer science;write buffer;write combining	EDA	17.08874693084982	61.3842222080171	125748

According to the anticontrol principle of dynamical systems, first, an 8-D discretetime chaotic map-based system is constructed, which possesses the required property of 1-1 surjection in the integer range [0, N - 1], where N is the number of frame pixels, suitable for position scrambling of each video frame. Then, an 8-D discretetime hyperchaotic system is designed for encryption-decryption of red, green, and blue (RGB) tricolor pixel values. Using the ARM-embedded platform super4412 model with Cortex-A9 processor, together with the standard QT cross-platform, an integrated chaotic map-based real-time secure video communication system is designed, implemented, and evaluated. In addition, the security performance of the designed system is tested using criteria from the National Institute of Standards and Technology statistical test suite. The main feature of this method is that, both scrambling-antiscrambling of RGB tricolor pixel positions and encryption-decryption of pixel values are realized simultaneously for enhancing the security. As is well known, compared with numerical simulations, hardware implementation for such a secure video communication system is very difficult to achieve, but we successfully implemented and tested in a real-world network environment. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the feasibility and real-time performance of the new secure video communication system.	arm cortex-a9;chaos theory;computer simulation;dynamical system;embedded system;encryption;numerical analysis;performance;pixel;real-time clock;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;requirement;test suite;tricolorability	Zhuosheng Lin;Simin Yu;Jinhu Lu;Shuting Cai;Guanrong Chen	2015	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology	10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2369711	embedded system;real-time computing;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;video tracking;encryption	Embedded	13.238645087090536	66.39381845978971	125771

Introducing minimal changes to the last round of the algorithm, we make it capable of detecting faults with a very high probability. In addition, by reusing the existing resources, we significantly reduce both performance losses and area overhead compared to other methods in this scenario.

Specifically, the format used to encode an HDTV picture will not be fixed. Instead, a variety of transmission formats will be available, unlike the current (NTSC) system. Furthermore, although a basic set of formats will exist initially, it is possible that this set can change over time, depending on the evolution of relevant technologies. This article will consider various topics related to the current and future transmission formats associated with HDTV systems in the United States. This article discusses the usefulness of allowing multiple transmission formats and describes the formats which will be immediately available for HDTV broadcasting, as agreed upon by the Grand Alliance. The relationship between source formats, transmission formats, and display formats are discussed, with reference to some of the signal processing modules required to convert between formats. Finally, the migration of HDTV to incorporate additional formats is addressed. This report describes a method of achieving this migration in a backward-compatible manner, so that the basic HDTV receivers will not become obsolete.	backward compatibility;encode;ntsc;signal processing;terrestrial television	Jae S.

4f2eb8902bbea3111b1ec2a974eab31e92bb1435	fundamental limits of rss fingerprinting based indoor localization		Indoor localization has been an active research field for decades, where the received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting based methodology is widely adopted and induces many important localization techniques such as the recently proposed one building the fingerprint database with crowd-sourcing. While efforts have been dedicated to improve the accuracy and efficiency of localization, the fundamental limits of RSS fingerprinting based methodology itself is still unknown in a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we present a general probabilistic model to shed light on a fundamental question: how good the RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization can achieve? Concretely, we present the probability that a user can be localized in a region with certain size, given the RSS fingerprints submitted to the system. We reveal the interaction among the localization accuracy, the reliability of location estimation and the number of measurements in the RSS fingerprinting based location determination. Moreover, we present the optimal fingerprints reporting strategy that can achieve the best accuracy for given reliability and the number of measurements, which provides a design guideline for the RSS fingerprinting based indoor localization facilitated by crowdsourcing paradigm.	crowdsourcing;fingerprint (computing);ibm notes;programming paradigm;rss;statistical model	Yutian Wen;Xiaohua Tian;Xinbing Wang;Songwu Lu	2015	2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)	10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218637	telecommunications;world wide web;computer security	Vision	19.31763478335986	74.13604669099962	127873

Current solutions are mostly based on temporal per-frame channel measurements of signal strength and suffer from low key generate rate (KGR), large budget in channel probing, and poor secrecy if a channel does not temporally vary significantly. This paper designs a cross-layer solution that measures noise-free per-symbol channel dynamics across both time and frequency domain and derives keys from the highly fine-grained per-symbol reciprocal channel measurements. This solution consists of merits that: (1) the persymbol granularity improves the volume of available uncorrelated channel measurements by orders of magnitude over per-frame granularity in conventional solutions and so does KGR; 2) the solution exploits subtle channel fluctuations in frequency domain that does not force users to move to incur enough temporal variations as conventional solutions require; and (3) it measures noise-free channel response that suppresses key bit disagreement between trusted users. As a result, in every aspect, the proposed solution improves the security performance by orders of magnitude over conventional solutions. The performance has been evaluated on both a GNU SDR testbed in practice and a local GNU Radio simulator. The cross-layer solution can generate a KGR of 24.07 bits per probing frame on testbed or 19 bits in simulation, although conventional optimal solutions only has a KGR of at most one or two bit per probing frame. It also has a low key bit disagreement ratio while maintaining a high entropy rate. The derived keys show strong independence with correlation coefficients mostly less than 0.05. Furthermore, it is empirically shown that any slight physical change, e.g. a small rotation of antenna, results in fundamentally different cross-layer frequency measurements, which implies the strong secrecy and high efficiency of the proposed solution.	coefficient;etsi satellite digital radio;entropy rate;gnu radio;information security;shared secret;simulation;strong secrecy;testbed	Lixing Song;Shaoen Wu	2014	2014 23rd International Conference on Computer Communication and Networks (ICCCN)	10.1109/ICCCN.2014.6911744	binary erasure channel;telecommunications;computer network;channel	Mobile	24.08224900455102	70.7759487369238	128042

In the scenario considered here, ͻ out of ; nodes sense the phenomenon and produced ͻ information packets. Due to usually hazardous environment and limited resources, e.g. energy, sensors in the network are vulnerable. Also due to the large size of the network, gathering information from a few central hopes is not feasible. Flooding is not a desired option either due to limited memory of each node. Therefore the best approach to increase data persistency is propagating data throughout the network by random walks. The algorithm proposed here is based on distributed LT (Luby Transform) codes and it benefits from the low complexity of encoding and decoding of LT codes. In previous algorithms the essential global information (e.g., ; and ͻ) are estimated based on graph statistics, which requires excessive transmissions. In our proposed algorithm, these values are obtained without additional transmissions. Also the mixing time of random walk is enhanced by proposing a new scheme for generating the probabilistic forwarding table of random walk. The proposed method uses only local information and it is scalable to any network topology. By simulations the improved performance of developed algorithm compared to previous ones has been verified.	algorithm;computation;information retrieval;luby transform code;michael luby;network packet;network topology;scalability;sensor;simulation;soliton distribution	Saber Jafarizadeh;Abbas Jamalipour	2012	CoRR		programming;performance;telecommunications;data management;computer science;graph theory;theoretical computer science;mathematics;distributed computing;random walk;algorithm;statistics	Mobile	13.840679520441393	72.40624127978758	128658

PUFs have been used in the design of cryptographic primitives for applications like device authentication, key generation and intellectual property protection. Due to its small cost and design simplicity, delay-based Arbiter PUFs (APUFs) have been considered a cryptographic engine candidate for the integration into low-cost IoT devices (e.g. RFID tags). Although APUFs have been extensively studied in the literature, not much work has been done in understanding how to improve its response variability using VLSI design techniques. This paper uses extensive AMS 350nm SPICE-based Monte-Carlo simulation to analyze how the proper selection of arbiter element and gate sizing can affect the delay variability of APUFs. Experimental results show that the combination of the appropriate arbiter and gate sizing configuration can considerably improve the Hamming Weight distribution of the APUF response, thus resulting in more reliable and less biased designs.	and gate;arbiter (electronics);authentication;cryptographic primitive;cryptography;hamming weight;heart rate variability;key generation;monte carlo method;radio-frequency identification;spice;semiconductor device fabrication;simulation;spatial variability;verilog-ams;very-large-scale integration;window function	Jefferson Capovilla;Mario L.

In order to improve the accuracy of node localization, the energy consumption must be considered in conjunction with security. Improving the accuracy of node localization as much as possible under the premise of ensuring the security of the localization process forms the basis of location-based applications in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, a secure localization method of nodes based on the congruity of time is proposed. This method does not need to meet time synchronization conditions between user nodes and base stations. It calculates the congruity of time according to the communication delay between nodes, and then estimates the location of the user node. It can ensure the accuracy of localization and the security of localization processes.	access control;internationalization and localization;location-based service;overhead (computing);requirement;simulation	Yongzhao Zhan;Chunxia Li;Xinsheng Wang;Yuan Zhou;Lu Liu;Hussain Al-Aqrabi	2012	2012 IEEE 11th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications	10.1109/TrustCom.2012.57	sensor node;telecommunications;engineering;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer security;computer network	Mobile	15.823218775765922	73.48997480778725	128764

e783ef0cee787c8f3325c943db840e4667a03c15	reliable and energy-efficient transmission on the internet-of-video-things		Due to the rapid development of smart homes, smart grid, and intelligent transportation, Internet-of-Video-Things (IoVT) have become increasingly important. IoVT is considered as a part of Internet-of-Things that can effectively deal with large volumes of data, such as image and video. In IoVT, reliable and energy-efficient transmission is extremely important. The reliability guarantees all data are properly transferred in the network, while the energy efficiency allows a large amount of data to be processed at low power consumption. In this paper, a hardware platform based on Raspberry Pi Zero (RPz) is proposed. RPZ is exploited due to its integrated H.264 hardware encoder/decoder. A source node is composed of a RPZ, a camera, and an Atmel RF, whereas a sink node excludes the camera. The input is a 640×480@30fps video, and the output is the 300-Kbps H.264 encoded bit stream. Based on various experiments, we concluded that data were properly transferred and the energy per bit was approximately 6.4 nJ/bit.	access control;bitstream;clock rate;data rate units;encoder;experiment;h.264/mpeg-4 avc;internet;mathematical optimization;microcontroller;peak signal-to-noise ratio;rf modulator;radio frequency;raspberry pi 3 model b (latest version)	Yuichiro Mori;Xuan-Thuan Nguyen;Cong-Kha Pham	2017	2017 17th International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies (ISCIT)	10.1109/ISCIT.2017.8261237	the internet;pi;encoder;real-time computing;computer network;smart grid;sink (computing);efficient energy use;computer science;bitstream;intelligent transportation system	Embedded	11.277866730313104	69.52395202526542	129876

The DPA countermeasure circuit is combined with a self-generated random number generator to eliminate an extra circuit for generating random bits. The cell area for the DPA-resistant AES crypto engine is 0.104 mm2 in UMC 90 nm CMOS technology, which is only 6.2% larger than an unprotected AES engine. The maximum operating frequency of the AES engine is 255 MHz, resulting in 2.97 Gb/s throughput. Since the DPA countermeasure circuit works in parallel with the AES engine, no throughput degradation is incurred with the proposed architecture. The proposed DPA-resistant AES engine has significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art designs.	cmos;clock rate;elegant degradation;gigabyte;random number generation;throughput	Po-Chun Liu;Ju-Hung Hsiao;Hsie-Chia Chang;Chen-Yi Lee	2011	2011 Proceedings of the ESSCIRC (ESSCIRC)	10.1109/ESSCIRC.2011.6044917	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;random number generation;computer science;cryptography;random sequence	Arch	15.447277768074787	63.344173362033935	129972
83f5c8c7f4bb98348a80895c890d60969b5571a1	the first thorough side-channel hardware trojan		Hardware Trojans have gained high attention in academia, industry and by government agencies. The effective detection mechanisms and countermeasures against such malicious designs are only possible when there is a deep understanding of how hardware Trojans can be built in practice. In this work, we present a mechanism which shows how easily a stealthy hardware Trojan can be inserted in a provably-secure sidechannel analysis protected implementation. Once the Trojan is triggered, the malicious design exhibits exploitable side-channel leakage leading to successful key recovery attacks. Such a Trojan does not add or remove any logic (even a single gate) to the design which makes it very hard to detect. In ASIC platforms, it is indeed inserted by subtle manipulations at the sub-transistor level to modify the parameters of a few transistors. The same is applicable on FPGA applications by changing the routing of particular signals, leading to null resource utilization overhead. The underlying concept is based on a secure masked hardware implementation which does not exhibit any detectable leakage. However, by running the device at a particular clock frequency one of the requirements of the underlying masking scheme is not fulfilled anymore, i.e., the Trojan is triggered, and the device’s side-channel leakage can be exploited. Although as a case study we show an application of our designed Trojan on an FPGA-based threshold implementation of the PRESENT cipher, our methodology is a general approach and can be applied on any similar circuit.	adversary (cryptography);application-specific integrated circuit;cipher;clock rate;dicom;embedded system;exploit (computer security);fault injection;field-programmable gate array;glitch;hardware trojan;key escrow;malware;overclocking;overhead (computing);phase-locked loop;power supply;provable security;requirement;routing;side-channel attack;spectral leakage;threat (computer);transistor;trojan horse (computing)	Maik Ender;Samaneh Ghandali;Amir Moradi;Christof Paar	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-70694-8_26	trojan;computer science;clock rate;application-specific integrated circuit;theoretical computer science;field-programmable gate array;hardware trojan;real-time computing;leakage (electronics);side channel attack;government	Security	11.935477734232599	63.304754091434965	130273

IEEE 802.15.4a wireless networks offer an inexpensive facility for localizing mobile devices by time-based range measurements. The main problems of time-based range measurements in indoor environments are errors by multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signal propagation. This paper describes indoor tracking using range measurements and an Extended Kalman Filter with NLOS mitigation. The commercially available nanoLOC wireless network is utilized for range measurements.

To resist these attacks, the Wave Dynamic Differential Logic (WDDL) has been proposed. However, the limitation of this technique is that it requires balanced routing of the dual rail interconnect between gates, to obtain equal propagation delays and power consumption on differential signals. This paper addresses the problem of routing balance in Mesh FPGA. First, we perform a dual placement in cluster based Mesh FPGA. Then, we propose a differential routing method which achieves a perfectly balanced routed signals in terms of wire length and switch number.	algorithm;differential signaling;field-programmable gate array;propagation delay;routing;software propagation	Emna Amouri;Zied Marrakchi;Habib Mehrez	2011	6th International Workshop on Reconfigurable Communication-Centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)	10.1109/ReCoSoC.2011.5981528	embedded system;routing;static routing;real-time computing;logic gate;computer science;dynamic source routing;theoretical computer science;field-programmable gate array;computer network	EDA	13.007112271539931	62.333540394208846	130522
03fb2af116552ad814624ec8ae881d665050e834	wireless key exchange using frequency impairments		Security methods have traditionally been deployed in the upper layers of the protocol stack. Therefore, the properties of the physical layer, like the wireless channel, have remained unexplored for authentication and confidentiality purposes. Some methods to expand the security mechanisms to lower levels have been suggested and thoroughly analyzed. The usage of the wireless channel for the development of key exchange protocols is based on two main properties: reciprocity and multipath propagation on fading channels. Several methods on how to extract and generate common secrecy using these properties have already been proposed. However, some security drawbacks have also been identified. In this paper, we propose to increase the security of these techniques by additionally utilizing hardware-related properties, namely the impairments in the transceivers’ local oscillators. The validation of this technique is performed in an experimental setup using the USRP/GNU Radio software-defined radio platform.	key exchange	Jörn Müller-Quade;Antonio Sobreira de Almeida	2014		10.1007/978-3-319-15087-1_22	telecommunications;computer network	Crypto	23.955805623212544	70.88429064468583	130557

The fastest power state transition is implemented by a global synchronous clock pause that gates dynamic power consumption without any loss of system state. Extensive use of CMOS circuit topologies, with low static power consumption, provides maximum power savings when the clocks are paused. The memory controller forwards a half bit-rate clock to the memory for synchronous communication, which is similarly paused in the low power state. Thus, dynamic interface power on the memory itself naturally responds to the clock pausing, without any explicit communication from the controller or special low-power state on the memory. Low-swing differential signaling based on a push-pull voltage mode driver results in good signal integrity and power efficiency at peak activity. Test-chips fabricated in a 40 nm low-power CMOS technology achieve 3.3 mW/Gb/s power efficiency at 4.3 GB/s data bandwidth, and support better than 5 mW/Gb/s operation over a range from 0.03 to 4.3 GB/s.	amortized analysis;cmos;differential signaling;fastest;flash memory;gigabyte;low-power broadcasting;maximum power transfer theorem;memory controller;performance per watt;signal integrity	Brian S.

We show that using thin-body double-gate fully depleted SOI transistors, the shift in threshold voltage that can be produced by modulating the back-gate bias is sufficient to reduce subthreshold leakage power by a factor of more than 10/sup 4/ in typical circuits. Using TBFDSOI devices in spatial computing architectures will allow overall power to be greatly reduced while maintaining high performance.	compiler;dataflow;discontinuous galerkin method;handshaking;high-level programming language;offset binary;silicon on insulator;spectral leakage;topological insulator;transistor	Paul Beckett	2005	2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/ISCAS.2005.1465095	embedded system;data flow diagram;parallel processing;electronic circuit;electronic engineering;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;operating system;frequency;silicon on insulator;threshold voltage;low-power electronics	Arch	15.696676321510838	60.831803156298534	130987

In this work we present a number of new CMOS logic families, Charge Recovery Logic (CRL) as well as the much improved Split-Level Charge Recovery Logic (SCRL), within which the transfer of charge between the nodes occurs quasistatically. Operating quasistatically, these logic families have an energy dissipation that drops linearly with operating frequency, i.e., their power consumption drops quadratically with operating frequency as opposed to the linear drop of conventional CMOS. The circuit techniques in these new families rely on constructing an explicitly reversible pipelined logic gate, where the information necessary to recover the energy used to compute a value is provided by computing its logical inverse. Information necessary to uncompute the inverse is available from the subsequent inverse logic stage. We demonstrate the low energy operation of SCRL by presenting the results from the testing of the rst fully quasistatic 8 8 multiplier chip (SCRL-1) employing SCRL circuit techniques.

To overcome limitations in existing solutions, this paper formally describes, designs, implements, and evaluates a Convex Optimization-based Method for Event-Driven Localization, i.e., COMEDL, in large-scale wireless sensor networks. The key idea behind COMEDL is to estimate the two-dimensional location coordinates of sensor nodes by processing multiple one-dimensional node sequences that can be easily obtained via loosely guided localization event distributions. The proposed design is evaluated through theoretical analysis, extensive simulations, and physical experiments (an indoor test-bed with 44 MICAz sensor nodes). Evaluation results demonstrate that COMEDL can effectively localize nodes with improved accuracy and flexibility.	column generation;convex optimization;embedded system;event generator;event-driven architecture;event-driven programming;experiment;linear programming;optimizing compiler;program optimization;sensor node;simulation;software propagation;testbed	Naigao Jin;Ziguo Zhong;Tian He	2013	2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MASS.2013.58	convex function;algorithm design;mathematical optimization;estimation;real-time computing;convex optimization;wireless sensor network;computer science;linear programming;theoretical computer science;discrete event simulation;mathematics;accuracy and precision;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	16.472011916870194	74.50179171171075	131283

Gaps in the coverage of the fingerprint can lead to significant errors. We propose a localization scheme that minimizes these faults. By using Gaussian Processes (GP) we are able to incorporate model knowledge and empirically measured data, with correct uncertainty handling and Bayesian parameter estimation. This approach leads to a hybrid localization technique, that outperforms several other procedures. We evaluate our method on two huge datasets, while focusing on measurement gaps in the available data. This provides a realistic and challenging scenario, compared to randomly selected missing data. We show that we are able to significantly reduce the localization error especially for increasingly sparse data sets.	bayesian network;best, worst and average case;data point;estimation theory;fingerprint (computing);gaussian process;global positioning system;indoor positioning system;internationalization and localization;location-based service;marginal model;missing data;rss;randomness;software propagation;sparse matrix;wireless access point	Martin Schussel;Florian Pregizer	2015	2015 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2015.7346752	engineering;machine learning;data mining;statistics	Robotics	19.004126688707604	73.69274931066752	131593

A PUF has the potential to become an important security solution due to its ability to generate volatile secret keys. Before a PUF can be integrated into a system, its critical quality factors, including uniqueness, reliability and resiliency to different types of attacks, must be ensured. The uniqueness of a PUF is determined by the random inter-die process variations. However, manufacturing process variations have another component, called correlated intra-die variations. This component becomes significant in deep-submicron device technology below 90nm. In this paper, we show that the quality of a ring oscillator (RO) based PUF is affected by correlated intra-die process variation. We present experiments on 90nm FPGA devices and analyze the experimental data to quantify the effect and also propose a method to improve the quality of an RO-PUF by minimizing the effect of correlated intra-die variations.	challenge–response authentication;experiment;field-programmable gate array;frequency response;physical unclonable function;ring oscillator;very-large-scale integration	Abhranil Maiti;Patrick Schaumont	2009		10.1145/1508128.1508201	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;ring oscillator;process variation;q factor;field-programmable gate array	EDA	13.740686142021328	63.656792518370324	132296
e2d7092f69abc488cae48fc28c673b7e3e1e82f2	proposal and evaluation of secure device pairing method with camera and accelerometer		With the advancement of wireless short-range technology, the number of mobile devices is also increasing. Consequently, devices often exchange information using wireless communications, but this communication has vulnerabilities, such as eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attack. Therefore, it is necessary to perform secure pairing between devices before wireless communication begin. In this paper, we assume that devices are securely paired in limited space, such as a room using wireless communication. The method for secure pairing using Received signal strength (RSS) is simple, but RSS is easy to change due to environmental factors. Recently, pairing methods using camera and accelerometer are studied. However, these methods do not directly detect inclination of the device. We propose the one of secure device pairing method using camera and accelerometer. Our proposed method make the camera read a marker on the display of the device. The marker's inclination corresponds to the device's inclination, hence, we assume that the accuracy is higher than that of existing methods.

This is the first watermarking method where the signature is extracted in this way. We are able to sign IP cores at the net list as well as the bitfile level, so a wide spectrum of cores can be p rotected. In principle, the proposed power watermarking method works for all kinds of FPGAs. For Xilinx FPGAs, we demonstrate in detail that we can integrate the watermarking algorithms and the signature into the functionality of the watermarked core. So it is very hard to remove the watermark without destroying the core. Furthermore, we introduce a detection algorithm which can decode the signature from a voltage trace with high reliabilty. Additionally, two enhanced robustness algorithms are intr oduced which improve the detection probability in case of consider able noise sources. Using these techniques, it is possible to dec ode the signature even if other cores operate on the same device at th e same time.	algorithm;digital watermarking;field-programmable gate array;power supply;semiconductor intellectual property core;watermark (data file)	Daniel Ziener;Jürgen Teich	2008	Signal Processing Systems	10.1007/s11265-007-0136-8	embedded system;spectrum;real-time computing;power analysis;digital watermarking;computer science;theoretical computer science;signature;field-programmable gate array;statistics	EDA	12.258810927219924	62.889407808774834	133884
682cb47c1c929cc134a3d6d9fe1f83e5bf97f95c	mxpuf: secure puf design against state-of-the-art modeling attacks		Silicon Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have been proposed as an emerging hardware security primitive in various security applications such as device identification, authentication, and cryptographic key generation. Current so-called ‘strong’ PUFs, which allow a large challenge response space, are compositions of Arbiter PUFs (APUFs), e.g. the x-XOR APUF. Wide scale deployment of state-ofthe-art compositions of APUFs, however, has stagnated due to various mathematical and physical attacks leading to software models that break the unclonability property of PUFs. The current state-of-the-art attack by Becker, CHES 2015, shows that the XOR APUF can be broken by modeling its APUF components separately thanks to CMA-ES, a machine learning algorithm, based on reliability information of measured XOR APUF responses. Thus, it is an important problem to design a strong PUF which can resist not only traditional modeling attacks but also Becker’s attack. In this paper, we propose a new strong PUF design called (x, y)-MXPUF, which consists of two layers; the upper layer is an n-bit x-XOR APUF, and the lower layer is an (n+1)-bit y-XOR APUF. The response of x-XOR APUF for an n-bit challenge c in the upper layer is inserted at the middle of c to construct a new (n + 1)-bit challenge for the y-XOR APUF in the lower layer giving the final response bit of the (x, y)-MXPUF. The reliability of (x, y)-MXPUF can be theoretically and experimentally shown to be twice the reliability of (x + y)-XOR PUF. In the context of traditional modeling attacks, when we keep the same hardware size, the security of (x, y)-MXPUF is only slightly weaker than that of (x+ y)-XOR PUF. Our main contribution proves that the (x, y)-MXPUF is secure against Becker’s attack.	algorithm;arbiter (electronics);cma-es;challenge–response authentication;cryptography;donald becker;exclusive or;experiment;key (cryptography);key generation;machine learning;physical unclonable function;software deployment	Phuong Ha Nguyen;Durga Prasad Sahoo;Chenglu Jin;Kaleel Mahmood;Marten van Dijk	2017	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		computer science	Security	13.639537873242354	64.42104493712594	133900

A major challenge with respect to such networks is to figure out the correct network layout, that is, avoid global flips where a part of the network folds on top of another. Our algorithm first selects landmarks on network boundaries with sufficient density, then constructs the landmark Voronoi diagram and its dual combinatorial Delaunay complex on these landmarks. The key insight is that the combinatorial Delaunay complex is provably globally rigid and has a unique realization in the plane. Thus an embedding of the landmarks by simply gluing the Delaunay triangles properly recovers the faithful network layout. With the landmarks nicely localized, the rest of the nodes can easily localize themselves by trilateration to nearby landmark nodes. This leads to a practical and accurate localization algorithm for large networks using only network connectivity. Simulations on various network topologies show surprisingly good results. In comparison, previous connectivity-based localization algorithms such as multidimensional scaling and rubberband representation generate globally flipped or distorted localization results.	algorithm;computer simulation;delaunay triangulation;image scaling;internationalization and localization;multidimensional scaling;network topology;voronoi diagram	Sol Lederer;Yue Wang;Jie Gao	2008	IEEE INFOCOM 2008 - The 27th Conference on Computer Communications	10.1145/1614379.1614383	embedded system;combinatorics;wireless sensor network;topology;multidimensional scaling;computer science;mathematics;geometry	Vision	15.056581693080243	73.49467509261883	135291

In this paper, we propose a position estimation technique using directional antennas to assist the detection of wireless access points. Using an asymmetric model for estimation, our technique can radicalize probability distribution quicker than using a symmetric model. Our technique consists of three steps. The first measures the current position of the user, the direction of the antenna and the received signal strength of a target wireless access point. The second step estimates the position of the wireless access point from measured data using a signal strength model based on directivity. And the final step presents estimated results that assist the user. These steps are repeated for real-time assistance. We also conducted an evaluation experiments to clarify the effectiveness of our proposed technique.	experiment;lazy evaluation;multipath propagation;real-time clock;wireless access point	Hirokazu Satoh;Seigo Ito;Nobuo Kawaguchi	2005		10.1007/11426646_14	telecommunications;computer science;antenna;wireless distribution system;ubiquitous computing;statistics	Mobile	22.297946345309594	74.20856675894696	135308

Scalable video coding will be one of the elementary solutions in this domain. This type of coding allows to adapt an encoded video sequence to the limitations of the network or the receiving device by means of very basic operations. Algorithms for creating fully scalable video streams, in which multiple types of scalability are offered at the same time, are becoming mature. On the other hand, research on applications that use such bitstreams is only recently emerging. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model for describing such bitstreams. In addition, we show how we can model applications that use scalable bitstreams by means of definitions that are built on top of this model. In particular, we chose to describe a multicast protocol that is targeted at scalable bitstreams. This way, we will demonstrate that it is possible to define an abstract model for scalable bitstreams, that can be used as a tool for reasoning about such bitstreams and related applications.	data compression;multicast;scalability;scalable video coding	Sam Lerouge;Robbie De Sutter;Peter Lambert;Rik Van de Walle	2004		10.1117/12.525642	computer science;theoretical computer science;mathematical model;multimedia;statistics;computer network	Networks	23.6694025378489	66.97438459589577	135553

It uses the continuous Naive Bayes classifier to incorporate different sources of signal in a single probability estimate. The algorithm assumes that the signals are distributed normally in each location, and the parameters of these distributions (i.e. mean value and standard deviation) depend on the location only. Its accuracy of room-level positioning reached 97.1%, which exceeds the performance of other systems (Redpin, WASP, ProbIN) tested under similar conditions. This system does not require any auxiliary infrastructure, but due to its heterogeneous nature can benefit from it. For example, stationary sensors with locations known a priori can be used to provide a constantly updating reference for the signal levels in different locations. The system can also easily incorporate other sources of signals such as cellular signal or stationary Bluetooth beacons.	algorithm;bluetooth;context-aware pervasive systems;fingerprint;gps signals;global positioning system;ground truth;indoor positioning system;mobile device;mobile phone;naive bayes classifier;sensor;server (computing);spaces;stationary process;wasp;wireless access point	Maxim Kovalev	2014	2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN)	10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275500	embedded system;electronic engineering;local positioning system;geography;telecommunications;precise point positioning;assisted gps;hybrid positioning system	Mobile	20.294772158985843	72.81568694547681	136278

While the majority of Received-Signal-Strength (RSS)-fingerprint-based wireless indoor localization approaches suffer from the labor-intensive and time-consuming site-survey and the low localization accuracy, barometer-based floor localization is another promising direction due to the increasing availability of the barometer-sensor-equipped smartphones. This paper is the first indoor localization work that exploits the combination of Wi-Fi RSS and barometric pressure for accurate floor localization. Compared with an art-of-the-state algorithm, B-Loc, the highlight of the proposed Bar Fi approach is that it does not need all client smartphones but only low percentage of them equipped with barometer sensors. Using crowd sourcing, Bar Fi eliminates the need of war-driving of site-survey and prior knowledge about both the Wi-Fi infrastructure and the floor plans of buildings. The key novelty of Bar Fi is a two-phase clustering method proposed to train the RSS fingerprint floor map with the aid of barometer, which consists of a barometer-based hierarchical clustering phase and a Wi-Fi-based K-Means clustering phase. The real-world evaluation shows Bar Fi achieves satisfying performance that its accuracy reaches 96.3% when the proportion of smartphones equipped with barometer sensors is 12% out of the total.	algorithm;cluster analysis;crowdsourcing;fingerprint;hierarchical clustering;k-means clustering;location-based service;rss;sensor;smartphone;two-phase locking;wardriving	Xingfa Shen;Yueshen Chen;Jianhui Zhang;Landi Wang;Guojun Dai;Tian He	2015	2015 IEEE 12th International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems	10.1109/MASS.2015.103	gsm;embedded system;barometer;telecommunications;computer science;computer security;crowdsourcing	Mobile	19.45653535766614	72.24678730608332	136320

Computationally efficient situational-awareness algorithms are implemented on the low-power microcontroller present on each flexible node. The detected events are wirelessly transmitted to a base station, directly, as well as forwarded by other on-body nodes. For each node, a dual-polarized textile patch antenna serves as a platform for the flexible electronic circuitry. Therefore, the system is particularly suitable for comfortable and unobtrusive integration into garments. In the meantime, polarization diversity can be exploited to improve the reliability and energy-efficiency of the wireless transmission. Extensive experiments in realistic conditions have demonstrated that this new autonomous, body-centric, textile-antenna, wireless sensor network is able to correctly detect different operating conditions of a firefighter during an intervention. By relying on four network nodes integrated into the protective garment, this functionality is implemented locally, on the body, and in real time. In addition, the received sensor data are reliably transferred to a central access point at the command post, for more detailed and more comprehensive real-time visualization. This information provides coordinators and commanders with situational awareness of the entire rescue operation. A statistical analysis of measured on-body node-to-node, as well as off-body person-to-person channels is included, confirming the reliability of the communication system.	algorithm;anatomic node;antenna device component;autonomous robot;awareness;dual;electronic circuit;embedded system;embedding;experiment;firefighters;hearing loss, high-frequency;imagery;low-power broadcasting;microcontroller;network packet;node - plant part;population parameter;protective clothing;real-time locating system;real-time transcription;sensor node;sensor web;software propagation;textiles;transmitter;wearable computer;wireless access point;accelerometers;disease transmission;sensor (device)	Peter Vanveerdeghem;Patrick Van Torre;Christiaan Stevens;Jos Knockaert;Hendrik Rogier	2014		10.3390/s141018583	embedded system;situation awareness;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;bioinformatics;engineering;electrical engineering;body area network;system;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network	Mobile	12.974736403454216	71.86683979139056	137406

This observation has led us to propose a DCT architecture where the signal paths that are less contributive to PSNR improvement are designed to be longer than the paths that are more contributive to PSNR improvement. It should also be noted that robustness with respect to parameter variations and low power operation typically impose contradictory requirements in terms of architecture design. However, the proposed architecture lends itself to aggressive voltage scaling for low-power dissipation even under process parameter variations. Under a scaled supply voltage and/or variations in process parameters, any possible delay errors would only appear from the long paths that are less contributive towards PSNR improvement, providing large improvement in power dissipation with small PSNR degradation. Results show that even under large process variation and supply voltage scaling (0.8V), there is a gradual degradation of image quality with considerable power savings (62.8%) for the proposed architecture when compared to existing implementations in 70 nm process technology."""	approximation algorithm;coefficient;computation;data compression;digital image;discrete cosine transform;dynamic voltage scaling;elegant degradation;image compression;image quality;image scaling;low-power broadcasting;peak signal-to-noise ratio;quality of service;requirement;signal processing	Nilanjan Banerjee;Georgios Karakonstantis;Kaushik Roy	2007	2007 Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition		data compression;computer vision;electronic engineering;peak signal-to-noise ratio;computer science;theoretical computer science;algorithm;statistics	EDA	19.876067769007495	62.5609743314306	137704

Using Received Signal Strength (RSS), the paper also proposes an approach for obstacle localization, mapping and classification. The latter is done by firstly estimating the positions of virtual anchor nodes (VANs), known as mirrors of the real anchor with respect to obstacle. Then, the obstacle position and dimensions are found via the estimation of the reflector points on the obstacle. Using Snell's law and the relation between RSS and reflection coefficient, different obstacles can be classified as per their material composition. Simulation results have shown the accuracy of the proposed approach in context inference and mapping.

Estimation of the mobility parameters is performed by applying the Yule-Walker equations to the training data. Estimation of the mobility state, which consists of the position, velocity, and acceleration of the mobile station is accomplished via an extended Kalman filter using measurements from the wireless network. The integration of mobility state and model parameter estimation results in an efficient and accurate real-time mobility tracking scheme that can be applied in a variety of wireless networking applications. The mobility estimation scheme can also be used to generate realistic mobility patterns to drive computer simulations of mobile networks. We validate the proposed mobility estimation scheme using mobile trajectories collected from drive-test data obtained from a live cellular network.	amiga walker;autoregressive model;computer simulation;estimation theory;extended kalman filter;first-order predicate;real-time clock;real-time locating system;test data;time of arrival;velocity (software development)	Zainab R.

In this paper, we provide new approaches to localization and characterization operations of GNSS jamming signals in both cooperative and distributed architectures. As for localization, Differential Received Signal Strength (DRSS) and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) are exploited. With respect to characterization, two approaches are envisaged, both based on exploiting the Karhunen-Loève Expansion (KLE). In the first, the nodes estimate and reconstruct the received jamming signal and share this data between themselves or with a Fusion Center (FC), which exploits KLE for data aggregation. In the second approach, signal estimation and reconstruction are performed at the FC, thus decreasing the nodes' complexity. The performance of the localization and characterization algorithms are analyzed in terms of Mean Localization Error (MLE) and Mean Square Error (MSE), respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms provide good performance.	algorithm;data aggregation;extended kalman filter;interference (communication);internationalization and localization;mean squared error;radio jamming;satellite navigation;simulation	Marco Bartolucci;Roberta Casile;Giovanni Emanuele Corazza;Alessandro Durante;Giulio Gabelli;Alessandro Guidotti	2013	2013 International Conference on Localization and GNSS (ICL-GNSS)	10.1109/ICL-GNSS.2013.6577274	computer vision;electronic engineering;telecommunications;mathematics	Robotics	23.599490720299258	73.03728757413886	139306

Sensor nodes participating in our system organize in a RELOAD-based P2P overlay network. Nodes sharing similar properties further organize in P2P data sharing groups and share data using CoAP. To achieve self-learning and self-configuration, our mechanism utilizes SOMs. P2P data sharing is used to speed up the training of SOMs. The mechanism makes use of two levels of SOMs, one for filtering and one for classification. We evaluate the performance of the mechanism through simulations and measurements and show that the mechanism enables a considerable performance improvement and is feasible to run on embedded systems.	autonomous robot;constrained application protocol;decade (log scale);embedded system;finalize (optical discs);overlay network;peer-to-peer;prototype;scalability;simulation;statistical classification	Jouni Mäenpää	2013	2013 IEEE 10th Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	10.1109/CCNC.2013.6488539	embedded system;communications protocol;wireless sensor network;computer science;data mining;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;world wide web;computer network	Mobile	10.092874703068873	73.87109993972913	139366

An important feature of a PUF is the reliance on minute random variations in the fabricated hardware to derive a trusted random key. Currently, most PUF designs focus on exploiting process variations intrinsic to the CMOS technology. In recent years, progress in emerging nanoelectronic devices has demonstrated an increase in variation as a consequence of scaling down to the nanoregion. To date, emerging PUFs with nanotechnology have not been fully established, but they are expected to emerge. Initial research in this area aims to provide security primitives for emerging integrated circuits with nanotechnology. In this paper, we review emerging nanotechnology-based PUFs.

This paper proposes to combine a hyperchaotic pseudo-random number generator with the SNOW-3G stream cipher to enhance its security level and improve the randomness of the output keystream. The new proposed approach combines the perturbation technique with a nonlinear four-dimensional continuous chaotic system. The originality of this new scheme is that it provides a good tradeoff between high security, performance and hardware resources. Numerical simulations, hardware digital implementation and experimental results using Xilinx FPGA Virtex technology have demonstrated the feasibility and the efficiency of our secure solution while promising technique can be applied to secure the new generation mobile standards. Thorough NIST experimental tests are carried out with detailed analysis, demonstrating the high security of the new scheme compared to the SNOW-3G standard while still able to resist statistical and short keystream data set analysis attacks.	algorithm;chaos theory;compaq lte;confidentiality;data rate units;field-programmable gate array;linear-feedback shift register;lorenz system;nonlinear system;numerical linear algebra;perturbation theory;plaintext;pseudorandom number generator;pseudorandomness;random number generation;randomness;requirement;simulation;stream cipher;throughput;virtex (fpga)	Mahdi Madani;Ilyas Benkhaddra;Camel Tanougast;Salim Chitroub;Loïc Siéler	2017	2017 4th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)	10.1109/CoDIT.2017.8102758	field-programmable gate array;randomness;theoretical computer science;nist;block cipher mode of operation;virtex;keystream;pseudorandom number generator;real-time computing;stream cipher;computer science	EDA	13.351662646781385	66.33149315252847	140383

Such IPs cannot be assumed trusted as hardware Trojans can be maliciously inserted into them and could be used in military, financial and other critical applications. It is extremely difficult to detect Trojans in third-party IPs (3PIPs) simply with conventional verification methods as well as methods developed for detecting Trojans in fabricated ICs. This paper first discusses the difficulties to detect Trojans in 3PIPs. Then a complementary flow is presented to verify the presence of Trojans in 3PIPs by identifying suspicious signals (SS) with formal verification, coverage analysis, removing redundant circuit, sequential automatic test pattern generation (ATPG), and equivalence theorems. Experimental results, shown in the paper for detecting many Trojans inserted into RS232 circuit, demonstrate the efficiency of the flow.	formal verification;rs-232;semiconductor intellectual property core;sensor;test card;trojan horse (computing);trust (emotion);turing completeness	Xuehui Zhang;Mark Mohammad Tehranipoor	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust	10.1109/HST.2011.5954998	embedded system;benchmark;real-time computing;logic gate;formal verification;computer science;automatic test pattern generation;computer security;intellectual property;measurement	Arch	12.01565052585061	62.36469717687558	140390

The core requirement of both the steps is an accurate and robust algorithm to match two time-series that may contain significant noise and perturbation due to differences in mobility, devices, and environments. To achieve this, we develop an enhanced Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) alignment, and apply it to RSS, channel state information, or magnetic field measurements collected from a trajectory.

Our work analyzes the quality of crowdsourced cellular signal measurements in the context of basestation localization, using large international public datasets (419M signal measurements and ∼1M cells) and corresponding ground truth values. Performing localization using raw received signal strength (RSS) data produces poor results and very high variance. Applying supervised learning improves results moderately, but variance remains high. Instead, we propose feature clustering, a novel application of unsupervised learning to detect hidden correlation between measurement instances, their features, and localization accuracy. Our results identify RSS standard deviation and RSSweighted dispersion mean as key features that correlate with highly predictive measurement samples for both sparse and dense measurements respectively. Finally, we show how optimizing crowdsourcing measurements for these two features dramatically improves localization accuracy and reduces variance.	cluster analysis;crowdsourcing;ground truth;rss;sparse matrix;supervised learning;unsupervised learning	Zhijing Li;Ana Nika;Xinyi Zhang;Yanzi Zhu;Yuanshun Yao;Ben Y.

We introduce a toolkit for automatically constructing outdoor radio-maps. Our toolkit can easily be carried by delivery personnel and security guards during their normal work duties to obtain signal readings. The scattered data readings are then fed into an interpolation algorithm to construct a more complete grid that can be used as the radio-map.	algorithm;cross-validation (statistics);data point;interpolation;location awareness;location-based service;user experience;wireless access point	Kay Connelly;Yong Liu;Dan Bulwinkle;Adam Miller;Ian Bobbitt	2005	International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing (ITCC'05) - Volume II	10.1109/ITCC.2005.48	embedded system;telecommunications;engineering;computer network	EDA	19.303925191904444	72.87790529306758	142670

WiFi-based solutions such as FingerPrinting (FP) are the most widely adopted techniques for positioning and provide better results if compared to other approaches. They require to compare WiFi Received Signal Strength (RSS) with an pre-computed radio map called fingerprint. The recently proposed Smart Probabilistic FingerPrinting (P-FP) algorithm reduces the computational complexity of the traditional FP approach without any accuracy detriment. On the other hand, fog computing has emerged as a new promising paradigm in the recent years, which extends traditional mobile cloud computing capabilities towards the edge of the network and enables location-aware services. In this paper we propose to offload Smart P-FP computation over a fog platform exploiting a novel distributed algorithm. Performance evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach with the analysis of: i) the amount of power saved and ii) the efficiency of candidate selection process for offloading. Having 2 or more devices in the vicinity contributing to the computation makes offloading beneficial from a power standpoint. The offloading effectiveness increases with the number of devices willing to contribute and the amount of data to be transferred. Power savings can be as high as 80% if compared with local computation.	computation;computational complexity theory;distributed algorithm;fingerprint;fog computing;location awareness;mobile cloud computing;performance evaluation;precomputation;programming paradigm;rss	Andrea Sciarrone;Claudio Fiandrino;Igor Bisio;Fabio Lavagetto;Dzmitry Kliazovich;Pascal Bouvry	2016	2016 5th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking (Cloudnet)	10.1109/CloudNet.2016.43	embedded system;simulation;telecommunications;engineering	Mobile	17.440706545603586	72.80511842517042	142850

Firstly, using Bluetooth measurements the zone where the target object is located is enclosed. Afterwards, processing WiFi measurements the RSS readings are compared only against the fingerprints of the points within the previously determined zone for the precise determination of the object position. In a recent work, we approached this problem by constructing simulated Bluetooth and WLAN maps and assuming that Bluetooth measurements determine precisely the zone where the object is located. Here we present a new algorithm to cope with erroneous identification of the preselected region. The performance of this method has been tested experimentally and the comparison between the localization results obtained using both technologies and using only WiFi is presented.	algorithm;bluetooth;experiment;fingerprint;rss	Sofía Aparicio;Javier Pérez;Ana M.

However, signal strength information alone provides very rough location estimates. In this paper we consider supplementing the receiver of each user with a ranging unit required for accurate positioning. By allowing range-based cooperation between the users, it becomes possible to increase the positioning accuracy without the need of a fully deployed network of ranging anchors. To this end, we propose a fully distributed localization algorithm that uses belief propagation for fusing signal strength and ranging information. Extensive simulations, using 3D ray tracing to provide accurate radio maps, show that the proposed fusion of measurements results in a very scalable localization solution, where the localization performance smoothly transitions in accuracy, depending on the available infrastructure.	belief propagation;gaussian process;html element;hybrid algorithm;rss;ray tracing (graphics);scalability;seamless3d;simulation;smoothing;software propagation	Samuel Van de Velde;Gundeep Arora;Luigi Vallozzi;Hendrik Rogier;Heidi Steendam	2015	2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)	10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247276	ray tracing;calibration;telecommunications;computer science;distributed computing;accuracy and precision;statistics	Robotics	18.980598152794066	74.4061351505773	145072
66bb4f9ea83fd9288802db72075bf01ca8091ee5	scansat: unlocking obfuscated scan chains		While financially advantageous, outsourcing key steps such as testing to potentially untrusted Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) companies may pose a risk of compromising on-chip assets. Obfuscation of scan chains is a technique that hides the actual scan data from the untrusted testers; logic inserted between the scan cells, driven by a secret key, hide the transformation functions between the scan-in stimulus (scan-out response) and the delivered scan pattern (captured response). In this paper, we propose ScanSAT: an attack that transforms a scan obfuscated circuit to its logic-locked version and applies a variant of the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based attack, thereby extracting the secret key. Our empirical results demonstrate that ScanSAT can easily break naive scan obfuscation techniques using only three or fewer attack iterations even for large key sizes and in the presence of scan compression.

cff134fcab7a64187d353ef539af7bd791294d16	localizing low-power backscatter tags using commodity wifi		Location information is crucial for enabling many applications in the era of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Localizing IoT devices using existing ubiquitous WiFi infrastructure enables rapid and universal deployment of IoT devices empowered with localization service. However, current WiFi-based localization systems require the target, that needs to be localized, to be equipped with a WiFi radio that actively transmits WiFi signals. Since a WiFi radio consumes lots of power for data transmission, such radio cannot be used in energy-impoverish IoT devices (for example, locating a pill bottle in an elder's apartment). This paper presents WiTag, the first system that reuses existing WiFi infrastructures for localizing low-power backscatter tags. We build upon recent work on low power tags that communicate via backscattering ambient WiFi signals and introduce novel modeling of the backscattered signal received at WiFi access points to localize the target IoT device. We prototype WiTag using off-the-shelf WiFi chips and a customized backscatter tag and show that it achieves sub-meter localization error. Thus, WiTag achieves localization error comparable to that of state-of-the-art WiFi based localization systems while consuming orders of magnitude lower power at the target IoT devices.	backscatter (email);internationalization and localization;low-power broadcasting;prototype;software deployment;transmitter;wireless access point	Manikanta Kotaru;Pengyu Zhang;Sachin Katti	2017		10.1145/3143361.3143379	computer network;backscatter;computer science;data transmission;software deployment;internet of things	Mobile	18.7751118811695	72.5462415391438	145593

In this paper, we analyze the performance of soft NMR and compare it with that of NMR and algorithmic noise-tolerance (ANT). An 8-b multiplier and a DCT-based still image compression system in a commercial 45nm CMOS process is considered. Two metrics of system performance: system reliability Pe,sys, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are analyzed. We show that soft NMR always outperforms NMR and that our analysis predicts Pe,sys and SNR to within 4.2% and 2.7dB on average, respectively, of the results of Monte Carlo simulations.	cmos;digital signal processor;discrete cosine transform;image compression;monte carlo method;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;triple modular redundancy	Eric P.

More sensible electronic devices are also more prone to external in?uences by energizing radiation. Additionally not only natural causes of faults are a concern of today's chip designers. Especially smart cards are exposed to complex attacks through which an adversary tries to extract knowledge from a secured system by putting it into an undefined state. These problems make it increasingly necessary to test a new design for its fault robustness. Several previous publications propose the usage of single bit injection platforms, but the limited impact of these campaigns might not be the right choice to provide a wide fault attack coverage. This paper first introduces a new in-system fault injection strategy for automatic test pattern injection. Secondly, an approach is presented that provides an abstraction of the internal fault injection structures to a more generic high level view. Through this abstraction it is possible to support the task separation of design and test-engineers and to enable the emulation of physical attacks on circuit level. The controller's generalized interface provides the ability to use the developed controller on different systems using the same bus system. The high level of abstraction is combinable with the advantage of high performance autonomous emulations on high end FPGA-platforms.	abstraction layer;adversary (cryptography);autonomous robot;dependability;differential fault analysis;emulator;experiment;fault injection;fault model;field-programmable gate array;full scale;high-level programming language;operational amplifier;scalability;smart card;test card;undefined behavior	Johannes Grinschgl;Armin Krieg;Christian Steger;Reinhold Weiss;Holger Bock;Josef Haid	2011	2011 14th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design	10.1109/DSD.2011.76	embedded system;real-time computing;fault coverage;computer science;information security;stuck-at fault;field-programmable gate array	EDA	10.96862879784878	62.64105521629595	148461

Writing adaptive algorithms to tune these parameters in dynamic network conditions is a challenging task that requires expert knowledge, and many design-test-rewrite cycles. This paper proposes a novel nature-inspired paradigm, termed discrete Gene Regulatory Network (dGRN), for configuring sensor networks. The idea is that nodes should regulate their parameters based on their local state and state communicated from neighbor nodes, in a similar manner that cells regulate their behavior based on local levels of protein concentrations, and proteins diffused from neighbor cells. The proposed dGRN paradigm has two major strengths: 1) it is general-purpose, and can be applied to a variety of parameter tuning problems; and 2) it generates parameter tuning code automatically removing the need for a human expert. We demonstrate the feasibility of the dGRN approach in a scenario where nodes must tune their sampling rates to track a moving target with a certain accuracy. The automatically generated code exhibits properties similar to the ones that one would expect from expert-designed code, such as aggressive sampling when the target moves fast and the sensing range is low, and relaxed sampling otherwise. Moreover, the automatically generated code causes nodes to communicate with each other to coordinate their tuning tasks, as one would expect from expert-designed code. The resulting dGRN code is evaluated both in a simulation environment, and in a real environment with eight T-Mote Sky nodes tracking a light-emitting target.	algorithm;duty cycle;expect;gene regulatory network;general-purpose modeling;local variable;node (computer science);programming paradigm;rewrite (programming);sampling (signal processing);sensor node;simulation	Andrew Markham;Agathoniki Trigoni	2010	2010 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2010.5462162	real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;computer network	Mobile	12.842758218634868	72.1943334306697	148518
f65d2c6208e022c4511f644c5561274940b74f34	energy-efficient all-spin cache hierarchy using shift-based writes and multilevel storage	cache architecture;domain wall memory;multilevel bit cell;spintronic memory	Spintronic memories are considered to be promising candidates for future on-chip memories due to their high density, nonvolatility, and near-zero leakage. However, they also face challenges such as high write energy and latency and limited read speed due to single-ended sensing. Further, the conflicting requirements of read and write operations lead to stringent design constraints that severely compromises their benefits.  Recently, domain wall memory was proposed as a spintronic memory that has a potential for very high density by storing multiple bits in the domains of a ferromagnetic nanowire. While reliable operation of DWM memory with multiple domains faces many challenges, single-bit cells that utilize domain wall motion for writes have been experimentally demonstrated [Fukami et al. 2009]. This bit-cell, which we refer to as Domain Wall Memory with Shift-based Write (DWM-SW), achieves improved write efficiency and features decoupled read-write paths, enabling independent optimizations of read and write operations. However, these benefits are achieved at the cost of sacrificing the original goal of improved density. In this work, we explore multilevel storage as a new direction to enhance the density benefits of DWM-SW. At the device level, we propose a new device--multilevel DWM with shift-based write (ML-DWM-SW)--that is capable of storing 2 bits in a single device. At the circuit level, we propose a ML-DWM-SW based bit-cell design and layout. The ML-DWM-SW bit-cell incurs no additional area overhead compared to the DWM-SW bit-cell despite storing an additional bit, thereby achieving roughly twice the density. However, it requires a two-step write operation and has data-dependent read and write energies, which pose unique challenges. To address these issues, we propose suitable architectural optimizations: (i) intra-word interleaving and (ii) bit encoding. We design “all-spin” cache architectures using the proposed ML-DWM-SW bit-cell for both general purpose processors as well as general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs). We perform an iso-capacity replacement of SRAM with spintronic memories and study the energy and area benefits at iso-performance conditions. For general purpose processors, the ML-DWM-SW cache achieves 10X reduction in energy and 4.4X reduction in cache area compared to an SRAM cache and 2X and 1.7X reduction in energy and area, respectively, compared to an STT-MRAM cache. For GPGPUs, the ML-DWM-SW cache achieves 5.3X reduction in energy and 3.6X area reduction compared to SRAM and 3.5X energy reduction and 1.9X area reduction compared to STT-MRAM.	bit cell;cpu cache;central processing unit;computer graphics;data dependency;experiment;forward error correction;general-purpose computing on graphics processing units;graphics processing unit;magnetoresistive random-access memory;overhead (computing);read-write memory;requirement;shattered world;single-ended signaling;spectral leakage;spintronics;static random-access memory	Rangharajan Venkatesan;Mrigank Sharad;Kaushik Roy;Anand Raghunathan	2015	JETC	10.1145/2723165	embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;cache coloring;computer hardware;computer science;write-once;operating system;write buffer;write combining;cache algorithms;cache pollution;cache-only memory architecture	Arch	16.587066401231468	60.9265885202157	148662
58212a311314a88b223e381819eda5450ee4e913	reliable memory puf design for low-power applications		This paper presents a reliable memory-based Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) design for operating at low supply voltages, which is typically demanded in emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications with stringent energy constraints. PUF is a promising approach for generating unique and secure IDs based on the intrinsic uncontrollable manufacturing process variation. A common approach is to use the power-up values of SRAM memory arrays as the PUF response. However, reliability of the PUF response is a major concern for such designs, in particular, at low supply voltage values where the impact of noisy operating environment becomes significant. As a result, a noisy PUF response due to the non-ideal reliability at low supply voltages, has to be transformed into a stable high-entropy key by a key extractor circuitry, which imposes significant area and power overhead. The proposed PUF design in this paper has the advantage of being highly reliable at low supply voltages allowing aggressive supply voltage reduction for lower power consumption and better energy efficiency with lower area and overhead of key extractor. In this paper, we first evaluate the reliability of the SRAM-based PUFs over a wide range of supply voltages from the super-threshold voltage regime down to the Near-Threshold Voltage (NTV) regime. Based on this analysis, we propose a new memory-based PUF design which provides higher reliability (2.6× improvement) while consuming less power (∼ 2×) compared to the traditional SRAM PUF designs in the NTV region.	electronic circuit;internet of things;low-power broadcasting;operating environment;overhead (computing);physical unclonable function;randomness extractor;static random-access memory	Mohammad Saber Golanbari;Saman Kiamehr;Rajendra Bishnoi;Mehdi Baradaran Tahoori	2018	2018 19th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED)	10.1109/ISQED.2018.8357289	static random-access memory;voltage;voltage reduction;real-time computing;electronic engineering;efficient energy use;extractor;process variation;computer science;physical unclonable function;operating environment	Arch	14.858508053950427	62.812322775181	149162

Both techniques leak information to the surroundings during operation. This information has been used in literature for estimating pedestrian flows, b ut t he c orrelation t o g round truth has not yet been evaluated. Thus, a reliable deployment in real world scenarios is rather difficult. To fill in this gap, we use ground truth provided by the security check process at a major airport and evaluate the quality of crowd information gathered from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth captures. We analyze estimated pedestrian flows and present three approaches improving the accuracy compared to a naive count of captured MAC addresses. Such counts only showed an impractical Pearson correlation of 0.53 for Bluetooth and 0.61 for Wi-Fi. The presented approaches yield a better correlation and allow for a practical estimation of pedestrian flows.	approximation;best, worst and average case;bluetooth;enterprise application integration;experiment;ground truth;mobile device;privacy;signal-to-noise ratio;smartphone;software deployment;tracking system	Lorenz Schauer;Martin Werner	2015	EAI Endorsed Trans.

Our main conclusion is that efficiency (or randomness) gains always come at a cost, either in terms of composability or in terms of resistance against horizontal attacks. Our evaluations should therefore allow a designer to select a masking scheme based on implementation constraints and security requirements. They also highlight the increasing feasibility of (very) high-order masking that are offered by increasingly powerful embedded devices, with new opportunities of highsecurity devices in various contexts.	32-bit;composability;embedded system;performance;randomness;requirement	Junfeng Fan;Benedikt Gierlichs	2018		10.1007/978-3-319-89641-0		EDA	12.5326399511202	65.21132703341193	149501

One major problem encountered in indoor wireless location is the effects caused by non-line of sight (NLOS) propagation. To mitigate the NLOS effects, an unconstrained nonlinear optimization approach is utilized to process time-of-arrival (TOA) and received signal strength (RSSI) in the location system. Path loss models and geometrical cell layout based on the TOA's are used in formulating the LOS/NLOS decision boundary. The weighting factors, used in solving the objective function in the unconstrained nonlinear optimization approach, are related to the credibility of the TOA measurements, and are determined from the LOS/NLOS identification. Computer simulations are conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed technique in different scenarios of the NLOS errors. The results show that the proposed technique outperforms other algorithms and achieves improved location accuracy under severe NLOS conditions.	algorithm;computer simulation;decision boundary;loss function;mathematical optimization;nonlinear programming;nonlinear system;optimization problem;software propagation;time of arrival;ultra-wideband	Chin-Der Wann;Hao-Chun Chin	2007	2007 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference	10.1109/WCNC.2007.720	wireless sensor network;telecommunications;nonlinear programming;length measurement;computer science;noise measurement;non-line-of-sight propagation;path loss;time of arrival;diffraction;wireless;computer network	Mobile	21.143219530179117	74.41845257580545	149563

f833fc66e174f074f6a949bd6c239873189049ef	secure ranging with message temporal integrity		In this paper, we address the problem of delay attacks on radio frequency time of arrival (ToA) secure ranging. In secure ranging, two mutually trusted devices try to determine their distance in the presence of an attacker. A delay attack consists of delaying the ranging messages exchanged between the devices, resulting in an increase of the measured message arrival times and thus in an increase of the measured distance. In this work, we propose the first secure ranging protocol that enables the detection of delay attacks on ranging. This protocol therefore enables two trusted devices to obtain a secure estimate of their mutual distance; existing solutions enabled the devices only to obtain an upper bound on their mutual distance. We further discuss possible implementations of our secure ranging protocol using Ultra-Wide-Band radio technology. Finally, we introduce and formally define the notion of message temporal integrity, a message security property which relates to message delay and advancement.	modulation;radio frequency;secure multi-party computation;time of arrival;ultra-wideband	Nils Ole Tippenhauer;Kasper Bonne Rasmussen;Srdjan Capkun	2009	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive		implementation;radio frequency;computer network;time of arrival;ranging;upper and lower bounds;computer science	Security	22.190286596195158	71.99588599644788	151854

To provide valuable services, it is necessary to estimate the location of users or objects. Outdoor location tracking is achieved by Global Positioning System (GPS), but due to its poor indoor coverage, there is a need for alternative technologies in buildings. Since multiple wireless sensors may be situated in the environment, they can be used for location estimation and tracking.

Video compression is computationally intensive and energy-consuming. However, the portable device, powered with batteries, has limited energy supply for data processing. One of the central challenging issues in portable video communication system design is how to maximize the operational lifetime. Based on our previous work on power-rate-distortion (P-R-D) analysis, in this work, we study how we could trade """"bits"""" for """"jouls"""" (energy) to minimize the energy consumption of video compression using optimum bit allocation. Our results, both theoretically and experimentally, show that using the proposed P-R-D video encoding technology, the operational lifetime of the portable device can be doubled or even tripled.

This paper presents an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN)-based machine condition monitoring (MCM) system capable of overcoming a false indication caused by temporary loss of data, signal interference, or invalid data. We use multisensor fusion driven by a quality parameter, which is produced by each sensor node according to the data history outliers and the actual state of the node. The fusion node provides a quality evaluation on its output as well. This novel approach enables the propagation of information about the uncertainty of a measured value from the source node to the sink node. Thus, potential degradation of acquired or transferred diagnostic information is minimized. Instead of raw data, the signal features are transferred, so that bandwidth savings are rapidly improved. The proposed concept was experimentally verified on real wireless sensor network (WSN) hardware. The performance evaluated using the signal-to-noise ratio and false-alarm rate detection demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	decibel;elegant degradation;experiment;fast fourier transform;fusion camera system;interference (communication);multi-chip module;oracle fusion architecture;randomness;redundancy (engineering);sensor node;signal-to-noise ratio;simulation;software propagation;throughput	Ondrej Kreibich;Jan Neuzil;Radislav Smid	2014	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2013.2293710	maintenance engineering;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;sensor node;soft sensor;computer science;engineering;sensor fusion;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;mobile wireless sensor network;detection theory;computer network	Mobile	12.708369280197166	73.56812119295151	153122

In this study, the authors present a comparison between different inertial systems, investigating the impacts of on-body placement of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and, consequently, of different algorithms for the estimation of the travelled path on the navigation accuracy. In particular, the system performance is investigated considering two IMU placements: (i) on the feet and (ii) on the lower back. Sensor fusion is then considered in order to take advantage of the strengths of each placement. The results are validated through an extensive data collection in indoor and outdoor environments.	inertial navigation system	Nicolo Strozzi;Federico Parisi;Gianluigi Ferrari	2018	IET Wireless Sensor Systems	10.1049/iet-wss.2017.0087	data collection;real-time computing;inertial measurement unit;units of measurement;inertial frame of reference;inertial navigation system;sensor fusion;computer science	Robotics	19.94176257219839	74.39280240218964	153356

In this approach, only the basic assumptions that are realistic in most types of Ad Hoc/Sensor networks are required, which means that this system is implementable in most kinds of Ad Hoc/Sensor networks. By introducing the idea of cell-based location identification method into the system, some drawbacks to the TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) system are resolved. More importantly, by employing the new theory, the location estimation accuracy of the proposed system is improved without costing extra resources. Finally, simulations show that the proposed Hybrid TDOA (HTDOA) location estimation system performs better in different environments compared with the current TDOA method.	dilution of precision (navigation);discrepancy function;hoc (programming language);line-of-sight (missile);multilateration;propagation time;radio frequency;simulation;software propagation	Yifan Zhao;Chung-Horng Lung;Ioannis Lambadaris;Nishith Goel	2009	2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware	10.1109/MDM.2009.82	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;computer performance;statistics;computer network	Robotics	21.637008126886947	74.29034979516918	153488

An important criterion on the design and operation of these devices is their energy consumptions. Two factors that affect the energy consumption of the sensor network are computation and communication. The simple strategy of locally processing the acquired data and to transmit them, is not optimal from the energy consumption point of view, relative to other strategies based on distributed processing and successive transmission of partially processed data. In this paper, we analyze the energy tradeoff between computation and communication resources in order to minimize the total energy consumption. We propose a heuristic solution to the stated sensor network problem for a multimedia application using Strong Arm RISC processors [3] to perform certain data compression algorithm.	algorithm;central processing unit;computation;data compression;distributed computing;heuristic;low-power broadcasting;point of view (computer hardware company)	Daniela Maniezzo;Kung Yao;Gianluca Mazzini	2002		10.1109/MWCN.2002.1045791	data compression;embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science;theoretical computer science;operating system;brooks–iyengar algorithm;sensor fusion;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wireless;computer network;visual sensor network	Mobile	11.288945655250265	69.69465589416694	153822

The new model offers a higher degree of accuracy compared with conventionally existing techniques in VLC, such as trilateration. In the proposed model, the current position of the receiver is estimated based on the positions of the k-NN (known as reference points) pre-defined and recorded in a lookup table. The Euclidean distances from the actual receiver to the reference points are weighted in order to improve accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms the trilateration method by 36 and 50% accuracy with and without ambient light interference, respectively.	k-nearest neighbors algorithm;vlc media player	Manh The Van;Nguyen Van Tuan;Tran The Son;Hoa Le Minh;Andrew Burton	2017	IET Communications	10.1049/iet-com.2016.0961	mathematics;computer vision;real-time computing;euclidean distance;telecommunications;visible light communication;artificial intelligence;interference (wave propagation);trilateration;lookup table	HCI	20.89049838006761	74.07148335702091	153999

The fingerprinting method of Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) from WiFi Access Points (AP) has been employed to discriminate and uniquely identify a position. The discrimination process of the reference points with its orientation have been analyzed with 0.9, 1.8, and 2.7 meter resolution.

The goal is the best use of the already installed SCAs experimental bench by performing the robustness test of ECC devices against SPA as well as the estimate of its energy and dynamic power consumption. Both operations are tested: point multiplication over Koblitz curves and doubling points over binary curves, with respectively affine and projective coordinates. The experimental results and its comparison with simulation ones are presented.

These adders show different operational profiles, some of them are inspired by biological networks or the probabilistic nature of nanometric devices (such as the Lower-part OR Adder (LOA) and the Probabilistic Full Adder (PFA)). This paper deals with the reliability assessment and comparison of these sequential adder implementations. A new metric referred to as the mean error distance (MED) is proposed as a unified figure for evaluating the reliability of both probabilistic and deterministic adders. Reliability is analyzed using the so-called sequential probability transition matrices (S-PTMs) with respect also to error masking (as occurring due to the sequential nature of the addition process). A baseline sequential adder implementation, referred to as the Lower-bit Ignored Adder (LIA), is used as a benchmark for evaluating the other implementations. It is shown that compared with the LIA, the PFA has a better reliability at a small gate error rate, but at the cost of a larger overhead in area and therefore static power consumption. The LOA achieves a good tradeoff between reliability, area, power and delay compared to the LIA and PFA implementations.	adder (electronics);approximation algorithm;baseline (configuration management);benchmark (computing);critical path method;iso/iec 10967;library oriented architecture;overhead (computing);predictive failure analysis;prime-factor fft algorithm;simulation;soft computing	Jinghang Liang;Jie Han;Fabrizio Lombardi	2011	2011 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems	10.1109/DFT.2011.54	biological network;electronic engineering;logic synthesis;word error rate;computer science;theoretical computer science;probability;reliability;mean squared error;soft computing;carry-save adder;algorithm;adder;statistics	Arch	21.88184966925781	60.47730540619352	154784
cc203a5113ad3568f2bbc8e2918a109b3e9c84cb	reliable and modeling attack resistant authentication of arbiter puf in fpga implementation with trinary quadruple response		Field programmable gate array (FPGA) is a potential hotbed for malicious and counterfeit hardware infiltration. Arbiter-based physical unclonable function (A-PUF) has been widely regarded as a suitable lightweight security primitive for FPGA bitstream encryption and device authentication. Unfortunately, the metastability of flip-flop gives rise to poor A-PUF reliability in FPGA implementation. Its linear additive path delays are also vulnerable to modeling attacks. Most reliability enhancement techniques tend to increase the response predictability and ease machine learning attacks. This paper presents a robust device authentication method based on the FPGA implementation of a reliability enhanced A-PUF with trinary digit (trit) quadruple responses. A two flip-flop arbiter is used to produce a trit for metastability detection. By considering the ordered responses to all four combinations of first and last challenge bits, each quadruple response can be compressed into a quadbit that represents one of the five classes of trit quadruple response with greater reproducibility. This challenge-response quadruple classification not only greatly reduces the burden of error correction at the device but also enables a precise A-PUF model to be built at the server without having to store the complete challenge-response pair (CRP) set for authentication. Besides, the real challenge to the A-PUF is generated internally by a lossy, nonlinear, and irreversible maximum length signature generator at both the server and device sides to prevent the naked CRP from being machine learned by the attacker. The A-PUF with short repetition code of length five has been tested to achieve a reliability of 1.0 over the full operating temperature range of the target FPGA board with lower hardware resource utilization than other modeling attack resilient strong PUFs. The proposed authentication protocol has also been experimentally evaluated to be practically secure against various machine learning attacks including evolutionary strategy covariance matrix adaptation.	arbiter (electronics);authentication protocol;bitstream;cma-es;challenge–response authentication;encryption;error detection and correction;experiment;flops;field-programmable gate array;flip-flop (electronics);least significant bit;lossy compression;machine learning;most significant bit;nibble;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);physical unclonable function;quadruple-precision floating-point format;repetition code;server (computing);ternary numeral system;utility functions on indivisible goods	Siarhei S.

The space dependent information is defined as the unique information for a specific place such as set of service set identifier (SSID) from Wireless LAN (WLAN) access points (APs). Existing location-based services (LBSs) mainly use Global Positioning System (GPS) to identify a place. However, GPS cannot work well in an indoor environment. SmartLocService realizes exact place identifications in indoors by using space dependent information. SmartLocService can be applied to various sophisticated location-based services in indoor such as reminders, call bliss and geo-fencing. We implement SmartLocService on smart phones, and evaluate its performance about registration time and location accuracy. As a result, since the accuracy of location is within five meters, we show that SmartLocService is useful to realize location-based services even in indoors.	bliss;global positioning system;identifier;location-based service;smartphone;wireless access point	Tatsuro Hachiya;Masaki Bandai	2014	2014 28th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops	10.1109/WAINA.2014.95	embedded system;telecommunications;hybrid positioning system;computer network	Mobile	20.61995118985829	72.78765106232707	155890

In this paper we discuss concerns and provide guidelines to consider when developing a coverage testing methodology for large-scale wireless networks. We propose a method which complies with these guidelines and apply it to a large municipal mesh network in Portland, Oregon. This approach is at the same time simple, costeffective, and rigorous. We use commodity hardware to perform both high and low-layer tests at a random sample of points. Our method provides insights into the “expected” performance and coverage of the network. We find that a greater density of nodes is required in Portland to provide the required level of coverage, but that at coverered areas, the performance is within specification. We are able to make these extrapolations with high statistical confidence, on a large network, using only 53 measurement points and a single measurement device which cost less than $200 USD to build.	code coverage;commodity computing;effective method;fault coverage;mesh networking;requirement;sampling (signal processing);software performance testing;wireless mesh network	Caleb T.

0b7fbc8d923b76a73db0c2a8ef3a6b9a1c4c8b99	mathematical model for a collaborative indoor position system (ips) and movement detection of devices within iot environment		The growth in the number of connected devices enabled the creation of a new ecosystem called Internet of Things. This environment provides new opportunities and challenges, such as the autonomous classification and location of devices within this environment. This paper proposes a mathematical model that allows to address the location problem in a systematic way using captured data of discoverable devices on a wireless network. The data capture is done using a collaborative wireless sensors network that provides data about detected devices, geographical location, and time stamp of the sensor in the environment. We have also done a simple classification between mobile and fixed devices. The calculation of the estimated position is obtained through simulation of a set of devices in a given area and shows a high rate of accuracy in the classification of agents and a reasonable level of accuracy about the estimated position. These results suggest that the proposal has good potential to be used as a basis for the development of sensor movement detection and location engines in the environment of the Internet of Things.	autonomous robot;basic stamp;discoverability;ecosystem;internet of things;location (geography);mathematical model;sensor;simulation	Danilo Reis de Vasconcelos;F.

Private circuits II is a proven protection against a strong attacker, able to read and write on a finite number of chosen internal nodes. In practice, side-channel analyses and fault injections are less accurate: typically, classical injection techniques (clock and power glitches, electromagnetic pulses, etc.) can be reproducible, but they do not allow to choose the targeted nodes (the situation is different for software dual-rail with precharge logic, such as [1], [2], where (0, 1) /spl harr/ (1, 0) bitflips are easier to achieve, since the computation is fully sequentialized [3]). So, a priori, private circuits II should be a secure protection against such classical fault injection attacks. In this paper, we provide the first implementation of private circuits II in FPGA, secure against read and/or reset of one internal wire chosen by the attacker. Our implementation is a manually coded netlist which instantiates LUT6_2 (with dual outputs, as required for private circuits II). Our design is a SIMON block cipher programmed in a Spartan 6 Xilinx FPGA. It features a throughput of 142 Mbit/s. We perform a security analysis, and notice that some exploitable ciphertexts can be outputted despite the countermeasure. Our analysis reveals that correlated faults exist because LUT6_2 outputs are produced almost simultaneously. In particular, the critical path actually consists in a dual-rail pair, which is consistently faulted together. If this pair is late with respect to the clock rising edge, then the previous value can be latched instead of the new one. Such fault behaves like a toggle ((01)2 becomes (10)2 or vice-versa) of licit values. They propagate to the ciphertext which becomes by the same token susceptible to a differential fault attack. Nonetheless, we emphasize that such faults require a steady fault injection setup: otherwise, multiple critical paths are violated, resulting in non-exploitable (fully zeroized) ciphertexts.	block cipher;ciphertext;computation;critical path method;cryptography;differential fault analysis;encryption;exploit (computer security);fail-safe;fault injection;fault model;feature toggle;field-programmable gate array;glitch;logic level;megabit;multiplexer;netlist;overclocking;side-channel attack;signal edge;spartan;throughput;zeroisation	Henitsoa Rakotomalala;Xuan Thuy Ngo;Zakaria Najm;Jean-Luc Danger;Sylvain Guilley	2015	2015 International Conference on ReConFigurable Computing and FPGAs (ReConFig)	10.1109/ReConFig.2015.7393338	embedded system;real-time computing;logic gate;computer science;operating system;field-programmable gate array	EDA	12.354360240458085	63.55194378228239	156447
95d579b5fe4eb68fb4711f0c56b9f459343d6b93	distributed function evaluation in the presence of transmission faults	distribution function	We consider the problems of computing functions and of reaching an agreement in a distributed synchronous network of processors in the presence of dynamic transmission faults. We characterize the maximum number of transmission faults per clock cycle that can be tolerated for the computation of arbitrary or specific functions, with several types of faults. The n processors communicate by sending messages through dedicated communication links. Each processor has a one-way link to each other processor. In each clock cycle, each processor may send one message. The message is received in the same clock cycle by all other processors apart from those to which it travels on faulty communication links. Each link may be faulty at some points in time, and operate correctly at others. In a transmission, a faulty link can either omit a message (a message is sent, but none arrives), corrupt a message (a message arrives that is different from the message that was sent), or add a message (a message arrives, but none was sent). Messages are words over a finite alphabet, varying from single bits to strings of arbitrary length.

cadacb61f580712cf43d38f69dbb9f9579ca7086	an energy-quality scalable wireless image sensor node for object-based video surveillance		Wireless image sensor nodes are required to deliver better visual information of the region-of-interest (ROI) under tight energy constraints. The energy-quality scalability of the sensor node can be improved by incorporating ROI-based image processing. This paper presents an energy-quality scalable wireless image sensor node using ROI-based processing for object-based surveillance. After detecting the ROI using a low-power noise-robust method, frame images are encoded by a low-complexity ROI coding scheme with better rate-quality performance. The ROI-based processing parameters are controlled by a simple on-line rate controller to minimize the buffer requirement. We integrate the proposed approach into the wireless image sensor node, and analyze the performance assuming a base station with human operators and deep neural networks. The results show that the proposed approach provides higher quality under the available energy budget. Better energy-quality scalability yields higher energy-accuracy performance for the intelligent surveillance system with deep neural networks.	artificial neural network;closed-circuit television;deep learning;image processing;image sensor;low-power broadcasting;object-based language;online and offline;overhead (computing);reliable messaging;scalability;sensor node	Jong Hwan Ko;Taesik Na;Saibal Mukhopadhyay	2018	IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems	10.1109/JETCAS.2018.2832439	image processing;wireless sensor network;real-time computing;image sensor;object detection;scalability;artificial neural network;computer science;base station;sensor node	Mobile	10.598768337488831	69.46718354045895	156886

The main objective is to ensure that nodes in the Circuit Under Test (CUT) are controllable and observable. While such comprehensive access is highly desirable for testing, it is not acceptable for secure chips as it is subject to exploitation. In this work, a new method is presented to protect the sensitive information from attackers using scan chains. The access through the scan chain to the circuit containing the secret information has been severely limited to reduce the risk of a scan-based attack. To ensure the testability of the circuit, a built-in self-test utilizing an LFSR is considered. The proposed scheme can be used as countermeasure against side channel attacks with a low area overhead as compared to the reported solutions.	built-in self-test;computer security;design for testing;digital electronics;emoticon;exploit (computer security);flops;flip-flop (electronics);information sensitivity;linear-feedback shift register;observable;overhead (computing);side-channel attack;simulation;software testability;test card	Ankit Mehta;Darius Saif;Rashid Rashidzadeh	2016	2016 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)	10.1109/ISCAS.2016.7538894	embedded system;electronic engineering;scan chain;boundary scan;computer science;engineering;cryptography;automatic test pattern generation;operating system;test compression;computer security	EDA	11.811462419433452	62.96195160995849	157316
15e17c6f3c5c7b9f313b523cedc1edbab4d19323	a novel use of approximate circuits to thwart hardware trojan insertion and provide obfuscation		Hardware Trojans have become in the last decade a major threat in the Integrated Circuit industry. Many techniques have been proposed in the literature aiming at detecting such malicious modifications in fabricated ICs. For the most critical circuits, prevention methods are also of interest. The goal of such methods is to prevent the insertion of a Hardware Trojan thanks to ad-hoc design rules. In this paper, we present a novel prevention technique based on approximation. An approximate logic circuit is a circuit that performs a possibly different but closely related logic function, so that it can be used for error detection or error masking where it overlaps with the original circuit. We will show how this technique can successfully detect the presence of Hardware Trojans, with a solution that has a smaller impact than triplication.	approximation algorithm;boolean algebra;error detection and correction;hardware trojan;hoc (programming language);integrated circuit;logic gate;sensor;trojan horse (computing)	Honorio Martín;Luis Entrena;Sophie Dupuis;Giorgio Di Natale	2018	2018 IEEE 24th International Symposium on On-Line Testing And Robust System Design (IOLTS)	10.1109/IOLTS.2018.8474077	hardware trojan;real-time computing;error detection and correction;electronic circuit;masking (art);logic gate;obfuscation;integrated circuit;computer science	EDA	12.085535419694581	63.353399940852555	157515

It is shown that a previously proposed algorithm which trades off between the expected number of handoffs and the expected number of signal degradations suffers from excessive handoff delay. Therefore, the optimal tradeoff between handoff delay and number of handoffs is investigated. The corresponding suboptimal algorithm provides near ideal performance: exactly one handoff and no delay.

However, accurate thermal analysis can impose high computation costs during the IC design process. We analyze the performance and accuracies of a variety of time-domain dynamic thermal analysis techniques and use our findings to propose a new analysis technique that improves performance by 38--138x relative to popular methods such as the fourth-order globally adaptive Runge-Kutta method while maintaining accuracy. More precisely, we prove that the step sizes of step doubling based globally adaptive fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg methods always converge to a constant value regardless of the initial power profile, thermal profile, and error threshold during dynamic thermal analysis. Thus, these widely-used techniques are unable to adapt to the requirements of individual problems, resulting in poor performance. We also determine the effect of using a number of temperature update functions and step size adaptation methods for dynamic thermal analysis, and identify the most promising approach considered. Based on these observations, we propose FATA, a temporally-adaptive technique for fast and accurate dynamic thermal analysis.	algorithm;codec;computation;converge;integrated circuit design;norm (social);numerical methods for ordinary differential equations;period-doubling bifurcation;requirement;runge–kutta methods;runge–kutta–fehlberg method;solver;steady state;thermal profiling	Xi Chen;Robert P.

The algorithm is fully distributed over an unstructured network, does not require a fusion center, does not rely on fixed terrestrial infrastructure, and is thus suitable for ad-hoc deployment. The proposed message passing algorithm, named hybrid sum-product algorithm over a wireless network (H-SPAWN), is described and analyzed. A novel parametric message representation is introduced, to reduce computational and communication overhead. Through simulation, we show that H-SPAWN improves positioning availability and accuracy, and outperforms hybrid positioning algorithms based on conventional estimation techniques.	algorithm;belief propagation;extended kalman filter;factor graph;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);iterative method;least squares;maxima and minima;message passing;nonlinear system;overhead (computing);peer-to-peer;satellite navigation;simulation;software deployment;software propagation;terrestrial television	Mauricio A.

9f6fc909a5e22ac125210d2f5dcd17cfec413d67	localizing access point through simple gesture		It is important to obtain the location of an access point (AP), such as in the scenario of finding rogue AP in public places or designing indoor positioning system based on AP locations. Most of the existing AP localization methods depend on additional equipment with high cost or the path loss model suffering from indoor multipath. In this paper, an AP localization algorithm based on channel state information and Fresnel zone is proposed, which can just draw a semicircle with one hand to estimate the AP location. The algorithm is divided into two phases: preparations and positioning. Preparations’ phase includes calibrating AP direction and identifying Fresnel zone cutting points which are obtained by combining the least squares fitting method in the time domain. Positioning phase consists of AP direction determination and AP position determination; the final AP position is confirmed according to the geometrical information. The experimental results show that the median error of our algorithm can achieve to 0.58 m, which significantly improve the AP positioning performance than other methods.	algorithm;channel state information;indoor positioning system;internationalization and localization;least squares;mean squared error;multipath propagation;rogue access point;wireless access point	Yongle Chen;Xiaojian Wang;Dan Yu;Yuli Yang;Jian Chen	2018	IEEE Access	10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2853599	fresnel zone;distributed computing;channel state information;multipath propagation;fresnel equations;computer science;control theory;path loss;indoor positioning system;time domain;least squares	Mobile	21.14495157932073	74.50256757315394	160453

Over the time of deployment, sensors are exposed to harsh conditions, causing some of them to fail or to deliver less accurate data. If such a degradation remains undetected, the usefulness of a sensor network can be greatly reduced. We present an approach that learns spatio-temporal correlations between different sensors, and makes use of the learned model to detect misbehaving sensors by using distributed computation and only local communication between nodes. We introduce SODESN, a distributed recurrent neural network architecture, and a learning method to train SODESN for fault detection in a distributed scenario. Our approach is evaluated using data from different types of sensors and is able to work well even with less-than-perfect link qualities and more than 50% of failed nodes.	artificial neural network;computation;distributed computing;elegant degradation;fault detection and isolation;network architecture;node (computer science);recurrent neural network;sensor;software deployment	Oliver Obst	2009	2009 International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks	10.1145/1602165.1602204	embedded system;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;machine learning;brooks–iyengar algorithm;distributed computing;artificial neural network	Robotics	11.17885179782579	73.27817978362788	160575

In determining the position of the target node from TOA parameters, linear or nonlinear least-squares (LS) estimation techniques can be employed. Although the linear LS techniques are suboptimal in general, they facilitate low- complexity position estimation. In this paper, performance of various linear LS techniques are compared, and suboptimality of the linear approach is quantified in terms of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Simulations are performed to compare the performance of the linear LS approaches versus the CRLBs for linear and nonlinear techniques.	computer simulation;non-linear least squares;nonlinear system;time of arrival	Sinan Gezici;Ismail Güvenç;Zafer Sahinoglu	2008	2008 IEEE International Conference on Communications	10.1109/ICC.2008.789	mathematical optimization;wireless sensor network;cramér–rao bound;computer science;taylor series;time of arrival;non-linear least squares;estimation theory;computational complexity theory;statistics	EDA	21.927445531475808	74.38230475352621	161989

New high and medium-end FPGA devices have built-in mechanisms that, exploiting encryption primitives, are able to avoid IP piracy by preventing cloning and reverse engineering, but low-end FPGA families still lack security solutions. Recently, in the literature, a great researching effort has been done on physically unclonable functions (PUFs), which are eligible to be a fundamental means for authenticating integrated circuits. They can be adopted to guarantee protection against IP violations by implementing locking finite state machines (FSMs) on any device. In this paper, we show two implementations of the Anderson PUF, a good scalable and high reliable PUF architecture, on the Xilinx Spartan-3E family, which can be adopted to introduce the locking mechanism.

Solutions that involve algorithmic, structural or physical transformations are sought. The focus is on developing low-power circuits without affecting too much the performance (area, latency, period). For CMOS circuits most power is dissipated as dynamic power for charging and discharging node capacitances. This is why many promising results in low-power design are obtained by minimizing the number of transitions inside the CMOS circuit. While it is generally accepted that because of the large capacitances involved much of the power dissipated by an IC is at the U 0 little has been specifically done for decreasing the U 0 power dissipation. We propose the Bus-Znvert method of coding the U 0 which lowers the bus activity and thus decreases the U 0 peak power dissipation by 50% and the U 0 average power dissipation by up to 25%. The method is general but applies best for dealing with buses. This is fortunate because buses are indeed most likely to have very large capacitances associated with them and consequently dissipate a lot of power.	algorithm;bus (computing);cmos;low-power broadcasting;very-large-scale integration	Mircea R.

96acdc8f06643f4e28a238035c99c6a97e927cfb	improving the security of split manufacturing using a novel beol signal selection method		Split manufacturing of integrated circuits (IC) was proposed as a possible defense against security issues arising from the use of potentially untrusted foundries. However, split manufactured designs were shown to be vulnerable to a new form of attack known as the proximity attack which attempts to reverse engineer the BEOL (Back End of Line) signals. Hence, care must be exercised in identifying the BEOL signals and their placement and routing. In this paper, we present a secure BEOL signal selection algorithm to defeat proximity attacks. Our method is based on two novel features: First, we introduce a new metric for signal selection based on the effect each signal has on the outputs. Second, we use a multiway partitioning algorithm to find a 'secure' cut-set which is the set of signals assigned to the BEOL layers. Our approach increases the number of BEOL nets while minimizing the impact on performance. We present experimental results which show significant improvement in security (on average by 800%) with only a modest effect on performance (less than 4% on average).	back end of line;integrated circuit;place and route;reverse engineering;routing;selection algorithm	Suyuan Chen;Ranga Vemuri	2018		10.1145/3194554.3194564	selection algorithm;real-time computing;computer science;back end of line;reverse engineering;integrated circuit	EDA	12.729093418369587	61.620985154072486	163695

In this paper, we have proposed a method based on Semi-supervised Locally Linear Embedding for indoor wireless networks. Previous methods for location estimation in indoor wireless networks require a large amount of labeled data for learning the radio map. However, labeled instances are often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain, as they require great efforts, meanwhile unlabeled data may be relatively easy to collect. So, the use of semi-supervised learning is more feasible. In the experiment 101 access points (APs) have been deployed so, the RSS vector received by the mobile station has large dimensions (i.e. 101). At first, we use Locally Linear Embedding to reduce the dimensions of data, and then we use semi-supervised learning algorithm to learn the radio map. The algorithm performs nonlinear mapping between the received signal strengths from nearby access points and the user’s location. It is shown that the proposed scheme has the advantage of robustness and scalability, and is easy in training and implementation. In addition, the scheme exhibits superior performance in the nonline-of-sight (NLOS) situation. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed SSLLE algorithm.	nonlinear dimensionality reduction	Vinod Kumar Jain;Shashikala Tapaswi;Anupam Shukla	2012	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-011-0416-2	simulation;telecommunications;distributed computing	Mobile	18.521754932213994	73.36638637048144	163873

However, their distinctive features also raise new questions concerning the security and communication capabilities of an FPGA-based hardware platform. In this paper, we explore the some of the limits of FPGA side-channel communication. Specifically, we identify a previously unexplored capability that significantly increases both the potential benefits and risks associated with side-channel communication on an FPGA: an in-device receiver. We designed and implemented three new communication mechanisms: speed modulation, timing modulation and pin hijacking. These non-traditional interfacing techniques have the potential to provide reliable communication with an estimated maximum bandwidth of 3.3 bit/sec, 8 Kbits/sec, and 3.4 Mbits/sec, respectively.	black hat;covert channel;data rate units;experiment;field-programmable gate array;megabit;microsoft forefront;modulation;overhead (computing);prototype;side-channel attack	Ji Sun;Ray Bittner;Ken Eguro	2011		10.1145/1950413.1950462	thermal;embedded system;parallel computing;real-time computing;computer science;operating system;phase;field-programmable gate array	Security	10.38883342699262	65.1805300559896	164371

Data is available as never before in many fields of study; practitioners are now burdened with the challenge of doing data-rich research rather than being data-starved. In-situ sensors can be prone to errors, links between nodes are often unreliable, and nodes may become unresponsive in harsh environments, leaving to researchers the onerous task of deciphering often anomalous data. Presented here is the REDFLAG fault detection service for WSN applications, a Run-timE, Distributed, Flexible, detector of faults, that is also Lightweight And Generic. REDFLAG addresses the two most worrisome issues in data-driven wireless sensor applications: abnormal data and missing data. REDFLAG exposes faults as they occur by using distributed algorithms in order to conserve energy. Simulation results show that REDFLAG is lightweight both in terms of footprint and required power resources while ensuring satisfactory detection and diagnosis accuracy. Because REDFLAG is unrestrictive, it is generically available to a myriad of applications and scenarios.	debugging;distributed algorithm;fault detection and isolation;missing data;performance evaluation;requirement;sensor;simulation;tinyos	Iñigo Urteaga;Kevin Barnhart;Qi Han	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications	10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912766	embedded system;distributed algorithm;real-time computing;wireless sensor network;computer science;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Embedded	10.618528847734405	73.3971172388365	164525

Among existing MRAM technologies, the Thermally Assisted Switching (TAS) MRAM technology offers several advantages such as selectivity, single magnetic field and high integration density. In this paper, we analyze resistive-bridge defects that may affect the TAS-MRAM architecture. Electrical simulations were performed on a hypothetical 16-words TAS-MRAM architecture enabling any sequences of read/write operations. Results show that both read and write operations may be affected by these defects. Especially, we demonstrate that resistive-bridge defects may have a local (single cell) or global (multiple cells) impact on the TAS-MRAM functioning. As these analysis results will be further used to develop effective test algorithms targeting faults related to actual resistive bridge-defects that may affect TAS-MRAM architecture.

dde8bd2677c16b6ee87c37fdc30df905ef4a7f72	employing genetic algorithm and particle filtering as an alternative for indoor device positioning		Radio signals may contribute to seamless interactions with physical objects providing means to guide users from their position to a particular object within a room or store for instance. To achieve such a goal, a mechanism is needed to allow users to identify and locate objects of interest. Trilateration, fingerprinting and particle filter are usually employed as mechanisms for position estimation in indoor environments. This paper explores the the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) combined with Particle Filter (PF) mechanism as an alternative to estimate indoor object position. The proposed scheme, named EPF (Evolutionary Particle Filter) has been compared to particle filter and trilateration. Simulation results show that the proposed EPF improves positioning accuracy by 1.5 cm (10%) and 30 cm (300%) over particle filter and trilateration, respectively.

A conventional ANT system employs an explicit estimator block to compensate for the large magnitude errors in the main block. The estimator presents area and power overheads, as large as 40% of the main block, to the system. In this paper, we propose ARCH-ANT, an architectural level embedded algorithmic noise-tolerance technique. ARCH-ANT achieves the same error compensation functionality as the conventional ANT by embedding the estimator block into the main block. Such embedding eliminates the estimator block and thus improves the system energy efficiency. A general optimization framework is proposed to design ARCH-ANT systems. Simulation results show that when applied to a multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit, 15.9%~69.4% and 59.2%-72.75% energy savings can be achieved by an 8 ×8 and 16 × 16 ARCH-ANT system, which is 5%~21.6% more than that of conventional ANT system, with no increase in mean square error (MSE).	ant colony optimization algorithms;apache ant (another neat tool);cmos;digital signal processing;embedded system;error detection and correction;mathematical optimization;mean squared error;multiply–accumulate operation;requirement;resilient packet ring;simulation	Sai Zhang;Naresh R.

Among the various indoor positioning techniques, WLAN-based location fingerprinting has attracted considerable attention because of the wide availability of WLAN and relatively high resolution of the fingerprint-based positioning techniques. This paper introduces methods and tools to construct a GIPS by using WLAN fingerprinting. An unsupervised learning-based method is adopted to construct radio maps using fingerprints collected via crowdsourcing, and a probabilistic indoor positioning algorithm is developed for the radio maps constructed with the crowdsourced fingerprints. Along with these techniques, collecting indoor and radio maps of buildings in villages and cities is essential for a GIPS. This paper aims to collect indoor and radio maps from volunteers who are interested in deploying indoor positioning systems for their buildings. The methods and tools for the volunteers are also described in the process of developing an indoor positioning system within the larger GIPS. An experimental GIPS, named KAIST indoor locating system (KAILOS), was developed integrating the methods and tools. Then indoor navigation systems for a university campus and a large-scale indoor shopping mall were developed on KAILOS, revealing the effectiveness of KAILOS in developing indoor positioning systems. The more volunteers who participate in developing indoor positioning systems on KAILOS-like systems, the sooner GIPS will be realized.	algorithm;crowdsourcing;fingerprint (computing);fingerprint recognition;global positioning system;image resolution;indoor positioning system;map;randomness;unsupervised learning	Suk-Hoon Jung;Gunwoo Lee;Dongsoo Han	2018	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems	10.1109/TSMC.2016.2626797	indoor positioning system;remote sensing;machine learning;artificial intelligence;simulation;computer science;crowdsourcing	HCI	19.359877972318937	72.60617250425204	165401

Compared to existing approaches, ours adopts complex computations in exchange for high localization accuracy while needing low hardware investment and moderate set-up cost. To that end, we use full distributional information on signal measurements at a set of discrete locations, termed landmarks. Positioning of a mobile device is done relative to the resulting landmark graph and the device can be found near a landmark or in the area between two landmarks. Key elements of our approach include profiling the signal measurement distributions over the coverage area using a special interpolation technique; a two-tier statistical positioning scheme that improves efficiency by adding movement detection; and joint clusterhead placement optimization for both localization and movement detection. The proposed system is practical and has been implemented using standard wireless sensor network hardware. Experimentally, our system achieved an accuracy equivalent to less than 5 meters with 95 percent success probability and less than 3 meters with an 87 percent success probability. This performance is superior to well-known contemporary systems that use similar low-cost hardware.	algorithm;ccir system a;computation;decision theory;experiment;global positioning system;information theory;interpolation;mathematical optimization;mobile device;multitier architecture;networking hardware;portable document format;profiling (computer programming);sensor web	Keyong Li;Dong Guo;Yingwei Lin;Ioannis Ch.

It is relatively easy to classify activity by the number of transitions, i.e. Hamming Distance (HD). In this paper we consider layout dependent phenomena, such as capacitive crosstalk to derive a more precise power model. We show that for an 8 bit data bus, crosstalk may improve detection performance from 2.5 bits (HD based detector) to theoretical 5.7 bits and simulated 5.0 bits (crosstalk based detector) of information pr sample. Thus we have shown that a layout specific phenomenon (capacitance) must be considered when analyzing security implications of power and electromagnetic side channels. A small case study has also been carried out that support our simulations/theoretical results.

Previous work on evaluating watermarking security is mainly based on the assumption that the host is Gaussian distributed and ignores the impact of the non-Gaussian characteristics of natural images. This paper presents a theoretical analysis on the security of spread-spectrum based watermarking with the incorporation of the statistics of natural images. By calculating the Cramer-Rao Bound and Modified Cramer-Rao Bound of the estimation of secret carriers under Known Message Attack and Watermarked Only Attack, this paper investigates factors such as the number of observations, the length of secret carriers, the embedded power, and the distribution of embedded messages that may influence the security of spread-spectrum based watermarking algorithms. Results obtained in this paper are very helpful for designing the new generation of secure and robust watermarking systems.

df772a9ebda71843632d1bc022da185c12913df6	scaling trends for dual-rail logic styles against side-channel attacks: a case-study		Dual-rail logic styles have been considered as possible alternatives to CMOS for the design of cryptographic circuits (more) secure against side-channel attacks. The state-of-the-art view on this approach is contrasted as they reduce the exploitable side-channel signal while not being sufficient to fully prevent the attacks. Since the limitations of dual-rail logic styles are essentially due to implementation challenges (e.g. the need of well-balanced capacitances), a natural question is to find out how they evolve with technology scaling. In this paper, we discuss this issue based on the relevant case study of an AES S-box implemented in CMOS and a dual-rail logic style, for two (65 nanometer and 28 nanometer) technologies. Our evaluations show that the security vs. performance tradeoff of our dual-rail logic style does not scale well compared to CMOS. It also shows that the scaling trends for CMOS are more positive (i.e. smaller technologies and supply voltages reduce the energy consumption and the side-channel signal). So these results suggest that dual-rail logic style may not be a sustainable approach for side-channel signal reduction as we move towards lower technology nodes.	2.5d;cmos;cipher;clock signal;cryptography;die shrink;image scaling;level of measurement;noise (electronics);s-box;scalability;side-channel attack;signal-to-noise ratio	Kashif Nawaz;Dinal Kamel;François-Xavier Standaert;Denis Flandre	2017		10.1007/978-3-319-64647-3_2	cryptography;real-time computing;theoretical computer science;electronic circuit;scaling;energy consumption;side channel attack;computer science;cmos	Security	13.572234104481222	62.817261994870385	166938

Generally, existing systems mostly focuses on the localization of the mobile entity. In fact, area information is also an important requirement for some applications, such as intelligent museum explanation, etc. Also, the area information may help to improve the location precision. This paper introduces the Area-Point Indoor Tracking (AIT) system which we have designed and developed on the platform with 22 MicaZ motes. The significant difference from the previous systems is that the proposed tracking procedure is divided into two major steps, i.e., area decision and point localization. And the beacon-correlation algorithm (BCA) and the shadowing-grid localization (SGL) algorithm are designed to solve the above two challenging problems respectively. The evaluation results on the platform show that the BCA algorithm can improve the precision of area decision of MERIT from 71% to 86%, and the SGL algorithm decreases 32% location error compared with Ecolocation algorithm.	advanced intelligent tape;algorithm;internationalization and localization;radio frequency	Hongli Xu;Liusheng Huang;Tao Xu;Yongkai Huo;Yang Wang	2009	2009 6th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication	10.1109/WPNC.2009.4907829	embedded system;electronic engineering;wireless sensor network;telecommunications;computer science	Mobile	20.205586223906035	73.19150161708116	167079

Therefore, no statistical artifacts that would aid anyone trying to crack the code are introduced. However, the limitation of capacity has led us to think about an improved approach which can be achieved through hardware implementation systems on a help of a programmable gate array (FPGA) board.	field-programmable gate array	Hesham Abdel Slam Aly Elzouka	2008		10.1109/ITNG.2008.235	embedded system;computer science;information security;theoretical computer science;computer security;field-programmable gate array	EDA	11.499310276549146	66.8245315734171	167873
814fc2edbd427a470e4ccfd7152f4e8b93a0ac31	locus: an indoor localization, tracking and navigation system for multi-story buildings using heuristics derived from wi-fi signal strength		The holy grail in indoor location technology is to achieve the milestone of combining minimal cost with accuracy, for general consumer applications. A low-cost system should be inexpensive both to install and maintain, requiring only available consumer hardware to operate and its accuracy should be room-level or better. To achieve this, current systems require either extensive calibration or expensive hardware. Moreover, very few systems built so far have addressed localization in multi-story buildings. We explain a heuristics based indoor localization, tracking and navigation system for multi-story buildings called Locus that determines floor and location by using the locations of infrastructure points, and without the need for radio maps or calibration. It is an inexpensive solution with minimum setup and maintenance expenses. Initial experimental results in an indoor space spanning 175,000 square feet, show that it can determine the floor with 99.97% accuracy and the location with an average location error of 7m.	heuristic (computer science);locus	Preeti Bhargava;Shivsubramani Krishnamoorthy;Aditya Karkada Nakshathri;Matthew Mah;Ashok K.

Therefore, acoustic microphone geometry calibration has recently become a very active field of research. This article provides an application-oriented, comprehensive survey of existing methods for microphone position self-calibration, which will be categorized by the measurements they use and the scenarios they can calibrate.

86db34a7865fad0941d33895bea670381301b494	simplified pedestrian tracking filters with positioning and foot-mounted inertial sensors		Pedestrian tracking is one of the bases for many ubiquitous context-aware services, but it is still an open issue in indoor environments or when GPS estimations are not optimal. In this paper, we propose two novel different data fusion algorithms to track a pedestrian using current positioning technologies (i.e., GPS, received signal strength localization from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth networks, etc.) and low cost inertial sensors. In particular, the algorithms rely, respectively, on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a simplified complementary Kalman filter (KF). Both approaches have been tested with real data, showing clear accuracy improvement with respect to raw positioning data, with much reduced computational cost with respect to previous high performance solutions in literature. The fusion of both inputs is done in a loosely coupled way, so the system can adapt to the infrastructure that is available at a specific moment, delivering both outdoors and indoors solutions.	global positioning system;sensor	Henar Martín;Juan A.

Trying to find efficient HT detection methods is necessary. However, before detecting them, HTs need to be created with an efficient method and their effects need to be understood. There are very few studies which describe HTs implementation methods and the methods used are not convenient for systematic study of HTs effects. The Trust-Hub website, known for hardware security in general, had published a full HT implementation tutorial, which is not completely satisfying. This study proposes a stealthy and reusable HT implementation method on field programmable gate arrays at the layout level adapted for the study of different HTs with the same non-infected circuit. Created for a systematic study of the effects brought by different HTs, the proposed approach allows designers to insert stealthy HTs inside the same circuit in order to create different realistic infected circuits. HTs implementation results on an advance encryption standard system and detection experiments based on side-channel are also presented in this study. The implementation method the authors propose can be used with scripts in order to accelerate the insertions of HTs variants.	side-channel attack	Cédric Marchand;Julien Francq	2014	IET Computers & Digital Techniques	10.1049/iet-cdt.2014.0034	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;operating system;computer security;field-programmable gate array;hardware security module	EDA	12.079349708473625	63.26334396619728	168879

The scheme is especially optimized for the application systems with the star-topology master-slave network, i.e., the network formed by a portable data-logger (master) and several sensor nodes (slaves). The proposed scheme eliminates “non-effective” operation energy consumption in the power-critical slave nodes, by means of “moving” the energy-hungry operations to the master node. Compared to the conventional protocols, the proposed scheme can greatly save energy and lengthen the lifetime of the slave nodes which are usually supplied by miniature button batteries, with the cost of affordable extra power consumption in the master node. The prototype verification shows that energy efficiency and lifetime can be improved by at least 50% for slave sensor nodes with a typical operation duty cycle.	application-specific integrated circuit;cmos;data logger;duty cycle;field-programmable gate array;master/slave (technology);prototype;radio frequency;sensor node;star network	Xiaoyu Zhang;Hanjun Jiang;Chun Zhang;Zhihua Wang	2010	2010 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems	10.1109/APCCAS.2010.5774923	control engineering;embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;operating system;efficient energy use	Mobile	16.252515213784854	68.09126585026446	169222
f28308216125e2247a7cb56453d7f98fee6faf83	participant selection for t-sweep k-coverage crowd sensing tasks		With the popularization of wireless networks and mobile intelligent terminals, mobile crowd sensing is becoming a promising sensing paradigm. Tasks are assigned to users with mobile devices, which then collect and submit ambient information to the server. The composition of participants greatly determines the quality and cost of the collected information. This paper aims to select fewest participants to achieve the quality required by a sensing task. The requirement namely “t-sweep k-coverage” means for a target location, every t time interval should at least k participants sense. The participant selection problem for “t-sweep k-coverage” crowd sensing tasks is NP-hard. Through delicate matrix stacking, linear programming can be adopted to solve the problem when it is in small size. We further propose a participant selection method based on greedy strategy. The two methods are evaluated through simulated experiments using users’ call detail records. The results show that for small problems, both the two methods can find a participant set meeting the requirement. The number of participants picked by the greedy based method is roughly twice of the linear programming based method. However, when problems become larger, the linear programming based method performs unstably, while the greedy based method can still output a reasonable solution.	big data;data quality;experiment;focus stacking;greedy algorithm;linear programming;mobile device;newton's method;online and offline;programming paradigm;requirement;selection (genetic algorithm);selection algorithm;server (computing);set cover problem;simulation;time complexity	Zhiyong Yu;Jie Zhou;Wenzhong Guo;Longkun Guo;Zhiwen Yu	2017	World Wide Web	10.1007/s11280-017-0481-x	computer science;artificial intelligence;wireless network;machine learning;data mining;mobile device;linear programming;matrix (mathematics)	Mobile	13.556723720786138	71.04932103842565	169268

Nowadays, wireless LAN hardware supports the variation of the transmission power in a wide range. In this paper, two novel algorithms suitable for extension of common wireless LAN-based positioning systems are presented. These novel algorithms exploit the additional information that can be gained by using one or more non-standard transmission power levels. Our findings indicate that the overall positioning accuracy and reliability can be increased with such an approach.	algorithm;database;experiment;fingerprint;global positioning system;live usb;location-based service;quality of service;radio fingerprinting	Hendrik Lemelson;Thomas King;Stephan Kopf;Wolfgang Effelsberg	2007			embedded system;real-time computing;computer science;location-based service;hybrid positioning system;wi-fi array;service quality;computer network	Mobile	20.246597278977443	74.02759893993502	169317

The ring oscillator PUF relies on pairs of ring oscillators which have sufficiently large difference in delay to generate reliable bits. Current RO PUF approaches use redundancy to provide reliability under different operating temperature and thus have very high hardware cost.We propose a temperature-aware cooperative (TAC) RO PUF implementation to reduce such cost. The basic idea is to allow a pair of ring oscillators to generate an unreliable bit as long as we can find means to convert it to a reliable bit. We define bit generation rules that explicitly take temperature into consideration and pair up the ring oscillator pairs so they can cooperate. Experiments on FPGA show that our approach can significantly improve the efficiency of the RO PUF implementation. With the same hardware that the current state-of-art approach requires to generate one reliable bit, our TAC RO PUF approach can generate as high as 1.8 reliable bits, that is, an 80% improvement in hardware utilization.	experiment;field-programmable gate array;redundancy (engineering);ring oscillator;semiconductor device fabrication	Gang Qu	2009	2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust	10.1109/HST.2009.5225055	embedded system;electronic engineering;computer hardware;computer science;engineering;information security;field-programmable gate array	Arch	14.009498985224731	63.33981304120818	169379

Typically, path delay or side channel methods rely on comparisons to a golden, or trusted, sample. However, golden standards are affected by inter-and intra-die variations which limit the confidence in such comparisons. Symmetry is a way to detect modifications to an IC with increased confidence by confirming subcircuit consistencies within as it was originally designed. The difference in delays from a given path to a set of symmetric paths will be the same unless an inserted HT breaks symmetry. Symmetry can naturally exist in ICs or be artificially added. We describe methods to find and measure path delays against symmetric paths, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of this method. We discuss results of examples from benchmark circuits demonstrating the detection of hardware Trojans.	benchmark (computing);hardware trojan;integrated circuit;side-channel attack;symmetry breaking;trojan horse (computing)	Norimasa Yoshimizu	2014	2014 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)	10.1109/HST.2014.6855579	embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;logic gate;sensitivity;mathematics;transistor	Arch	12.437701300608879	63.17942525244987	169442

With these techniques, an eavesdropper can monitor people's behavior from outside of the room without the need to access the room. This introduces a severe privacy-leakage issue. To address this issue, we propose Aegis, an interference-negligible RF sensing shield that i) incapacitates the RF sensing of eavesdroppers that work at any unknown locations outside of the protected area; ii) has minimum interference to the ongoing WiFi communication; and iii) preserves authorized RF sensing inside the private region. Our extensive evaluation shows that when Aegis is activated, it i) has a negligible impact on the legitimate sensing system; ii) effectively prevents the illegitimate sensing system from sensing human motions. Moreover, the ongoing data communication throughput is even increased.	alice and bob;authorization;camera serial interface;catastrophic interference;channel state information;entropy (information theory);eve;interference (communication);kinesiology;rf modulator;rss;radio frequency;sensor;spectral leakage;throughput	Yao Yao;Yan Li;Xin Liu;Zicheng Chi;Wei Wang;Tiantian Xie;Ting Zhu	2018	IEEE INFOCOM 2018 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications	10.1109/INFOCOM.2018.8485883	computer network;throughput;radio frequency;interference (wave propagation);computer science;distortion	Mobile	22.068703254129908	70.63225875428003	170261

It uses Wi-Fi for rough positioning and BLE for fine positioning. It is designed for use in public transportation system stations and terminals where the conditions are """"hostile"""" or unfavourable due to signal noise produced by the continuous movement of passengers and buses, data collection conducted in the constant presence thereof, multipath fading, non-line of sight (NLOS) conditions, the fact that part of the wireless communication infrastructure has already been deployed and positioned in a way that may not be optimal for positioning purposes, variable humidity conditions, etc. The ultimate goal is to provide a service that may be used to assist people with special needs. We present experimental results based on scene analysis; the main distance metric used was the Euclidean distance but the Mahalanobis distance was also used in one case. The algorithm employed to compare fingerprints was the weighted k-nearest neighbor one. For Wi-Fi, with only three visible access points, accuracy ranged from 3.94 to 4.82 m, and precision from 5.21 to 7.0 m 90% of the time. With respect to BLE, with a low beacon density (1 beacon per 45.7 m²), accuracy ranged from 1.47 to 2.15 m, and precision from 1.81 to 3.58 m 90% of the time. Taking into account the fact that this system is designed to work in real situations in a scenario with high environmental fluctuations, and comparing the results with others obtained in laboratory scenarios, our results are promising and demonstrate that the system would be able to position users with these reasonable values of accuracy and precision."""	bluetooth;data collection;environmental resource management;euclidean distance;exposure to humidity;fingerprint;gene distance metric;global positioning system;indoor positioning system;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;multipath propagation;noise (electronics);single linkage cluster analysis;wireless access point	Gabriel de Blasio;Alexis Quesada-Arencibia;Carmelo R.

Due to the limitation and complexity of the indoor environment, the solution to achieve a low-cost and accurate positioning system remains open. This article presents a WiFibased positioning technique that can improve the localization performance from the bottleneck in ToA/AoA. Unlike the traditional approaches, our proposed mechanism relaxes the need for wide signal bandwidth and large numbers of antennas by utilizing the transmission of multiple predefined messages while maintaining high-accuracy performance. The overall system structure is demonstrated by showing localization performance with respect to different numbers of messages used in 20/40 MHz bandwidth WiFi APs. Simulation results show that our WiFi-based positioning approach can achieve 1 m accuracy without any hardware change in commercial WiFi products, which is much better than the conventional solutions from both academia and industry concerning the trade-off of cost and system complexity.	bandwidth (signal processing);big data;bluetooth;cloud computing;communications protocol;compaq lte;computer science;ecmascript;gigabit;indoor positioning system;internationalization and localization;internet of things;microsoft research;radio-frequency identification;simulation;software-defined networking;super-resolution imaging;systems design;ultra-wideband;uncompressed video;yang	Chouchang Yang;Huai-Rong Shao	2015	IEEE Communications Magazine	10.1109/MCOM.2015.7060497	transmitter;telecommunications;computer science;fingerprint recognition;bandwidth;time;computer network	Mobile	20.311743535872992	73.83722559139764	170895

In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization scheme based on curve fitting (CF) and location search. In the offline phase, we divide the whole environment into some subareas and create a fingerprint for each subarea. We then apply the CF technique to construct a fitted RSS-distance function for each transmitter in each subarea. The online positioning phase consists of two steps. In the first step, we determine a subarea to which a mobile device belongs. In the second step, we propose two location search algorithms, namely exhaustive search and gradient descent search, to find a location within the selected subarea such that the sum of distance errors can be minimized. We conduct field experiments to examine the proposed algorithms. The results show that our algorithms can obtain approximately 20% improvement in localization accuracy compared with the classical fingerprinting-based and lateration-based localization algorithms.	brute-force search;curve fitting;deployment environment;experiment;fingerprint (computing);gradient descent;internationalization and localization;mobile device;multilateration;online and offline;rss;search algorithm;software deployment;transmitter	Bang Wang;Shengliang Zhou;Wenyu Liu;Yijun Mo	2015	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	10.1109/TIE.2014.2327595	embedded system;electronic engineering;telecommunications	Mobile	18.881886897385733	73.07654956165564	171529

To enable power savings for such a problem, we introduce a compelling new data streaming problem that we call the Bad Santa problem. Our results on this problem apply for any situation where: 1) a node can listen to a set of n nodes, out of which at least half are non-faulty and know the correct message; and 2) each of these n nodes sends according to some predetermined schedule which assigns each of them its own unique time slot. In this situation, we show that in order to receive the correct message with probability 1, it is necessary and sufficient for the listening node to listen to a Θ(√n) expected number of time slots. Moreover, if we allow for repetitions of transmissions so that each sending node sends the message O(log* n) times (i.e. in O(log* n) rounds each consisting of the n time slots), then listening to O(log* n) expected number of time slots suffices. We show that this is near optimal.  We describe an application of our result to the popular grid model for a radio network. Each node in the network is located on a point in a two dimensional grid, and whenever a node sends a message, all awake nodes within L∞ distance r receive the message. In this model, up to t< r/2 (2r+1) nodes within any 2r+1 by 2r+1 square in the grid can suffer Byzantine faults. Moreover, we assume that the nodes that suffer Byzantine faults are chosen and controlled by an adaptive adversary that knows everything except for the random bits of each non-faulty node. This type of adaptive adversary models worst-case behavior due to malicious attacks on the network; mobile nodes moving around in the network; or static nodes losing power or ceasing to function. Let n=r(2r+1). We show how to solve the broadcast problem in this model with each node awake only an expected O(1/√n) fraction of the time. Moreover, if we allow each node to send O(log* n) times, we can increase the energy savings so that each node is awake only an expected O((log* n)/ n) fraction of the time. This compares favorably with previous protocols that required each node to be awake for every time step.	adversary (cryptography);best, worst and average case;byzantine fault tolerance;malware	Valerie King;Cynthia A.

The localization technique is applicable in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) when global positioning system (GPS) is not available (GPS denied environments). The localization CEP of the technique is derived theoretically and verified via simulations. In addition, we theoretically derive the localization CEP of GPS-aided TOA fusion and GPS-aided DOA fusion techniques, which are also applicable in MANETs. Finally, we compare these three localization techniques theoretically and via simulations. The comparison confirms that in moderate scale MANETs, the multinode TOA-DOA fusion localization technique achieves the best performance; while in large scale MANETs, GPS-aided TOA fusion leads to the best performance.	direction of arrival;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);internationalization and localization;simulation;time of arrival	Zhonghai Wang;Seyed Alireza Zekavat	2008	EURASIP J.

4f2d5cb86b83a3e57de6cf02caeb1731286c1969	variation-aware adaptive tuning for nanophotonic interconnects		Short-reach nanophotonic interconnects are promising to solve the communication bottleneck in data centers and chip-level scenarios. However, the nanophotonic interconnects are sensitive to process and thermal variations, especially for the microring structures, resulting in significant variation of an optical link's bit error rate (BER). In this paper, we propose a power-efficient adaptive tuning approach for nanophotonic interconnects to address the variation issues. During the adaptive tuning process, each nanophotonic interconnect is adaptively allocated just enough power to meet the BER requirement. The proposed adaptive tuning approach could reduce the photonic receiver power by 8% - 34% than the worst-case based fixed design while achieving the same BER. Our evaluation results show that the adaptive tuning approach scales well with the process variation, the thermal variation and the number of communication nodes, and can accommodate different types of NoC architectures and lasers.	best, worst and average case;bit error rate;data center;electrical connection;network on a chip;speaker wire;x.690	Rui Wu;Chin-Hui Chen;Cheng Li;Tsung-Ching Huang;Fan Lan;Chong Zhang;Yun Pan;John E.

Specifically, this is investigated in the context of facilitating the in vitro thermal stimulation of single neurons. The paper analyses the electro-thermal response (by means of COMSOL simulations) and reliability issues (such as melting and electromigration) of different microheater designs. The analysis shows that a small-area heater is more efficient in terms of power, but it has more reliability problems essentially due to electromigration effects. For the proposed heater designs, the expected lifetime is a few days (in continuous operation) in the worst scenario, which is still generally acceptable for LOC applications.	altered level of consciousness;cmos;circuit complexity;continuous operation;electromigration;image resolution;simulation;source lines of code	Ferran Reverter;Themistoklis Prodromakis;Yan Liu;Pantelis Georgiou;Konstantin Nikolic;Timothy G.

Since almost no control of the manufacturing is possible, backdoors to both, hard- and software, can be introduced easily with little chance of being detected by current detection approaches. Due to the irreversible dependency from COTS products and marginal possibilities for a medium term improvement, new techniques are necessary to discover COTS manipulations (e.g., data leakage and malicious COTS devices). Therefore, this publication contains first results of a new architecture for supervising COTS products which is currently under development.	backdoor (computing);marginal model;spectral leakage	Robert Koch;Mario Golling;Gabi Dreo Rodosek	2013	2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)	10.1109/CNS.2013.6682749	embedded system;operating system;computer security	Mobile	12.350083980540324	62.450939452491504	172415

Particularly, a Decentralized Delayed-State Information Filter (DDSIF) is described, where full-state trajectories (that is, delayed states) are considered to fuse the information. This approach allows obtaining an estimation equal to that provided by a centralized system and reduces the impact of communications delays and latency into the estimation. The sparseness of the information matrix maintains the communication overhead at a reasonable level. The method is applied to cooperative tracking and some results in disaster management scenarios are shown. In this kind of scenarios the target might move in both open field and indoor areas, so fusion of data provided by heterogeneous sensors is beneficial. The paper also shows experimental results with real data and integrating several sources of information. Email addresses: jescap@cartuja.us.es (J. Capitán), lmercab@upo.es (L.

GPS and similar systems determine location today, but they require substantial infrastructure in the environment or on sensor nodes to locate nodes in a physical coordinate system. For many applications, logical location - the relationship of nodes with each other and their environment - can be more important than physical location. For example, distance along a road and presence of intersections may be more relevant than Euclidean coordinates for applications that track or guide drivers. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, deployment order, for logical location determination. Deployment order exploits node deployment patterns and simple user interactions to define logical topologies in a completely distributed manner. With minimal user interaction it can establish arbitrarily complex logical topologies. We illustrate the algorithm through the """"follow-me"""" application, which is an easy-to-deploy sensornet guidance system suitable for use in office buildings as well as inhospitable environments (underground, in damaged buildings, etc.). Finally, we demonstrate how the addition of landmarks allows the conversion from logical locations to approximate physical locations."""	approximation algorithm;geographic coordinate system;global positioning system;guidance system;interaction;location awareness;software deployment	Xi Wang;Fabio Silva;John S.

6352b7eaf7284f6fd0c315d2c710cc124bf8600d	using principal component analysis for practical biasing of power traces to improve power analysis attacks		Researchers have focused significant attention on side-channel attacks since the first power analysis attack was introduced. To date, several ideas have been introduced to efficiently analyze cryptographic modules. A power trace selection method for improving attack efficiency was recently presented; however, applying it involves many restrictions. Therefore, we propose a new selection method to improve power analysis attacks using principal component analysis. Our method is a practical one for biasing power traces. Our experimental results show that the proposed method improves attack efficiency in terms of the number of traces used for finding the secret key.	biasing;digital footprint;principal component analysis	Yongdae Kim;Haengseok Ko	2013		10.1007/978-3-319-12160-4_7	embedded system;real-time computing;computer science	Crypto	11.933324236704244	64.88923037415942	173304

In many watermarking schemes, often only one watermarking signature is used in the embedding of hidden information. This paper introduces new multiple sequence families with good autoand cross-correlation properties, which are ideal in the application of digital watermarking. It is also envisaged that this good cross-correlation property of these multiple families of sequences allows for the use of multiple signatures in a watermarking scheme. Multiple signatures increases the robustness of the watermarking scheme and also retrieving for independent signatures is straightforward due to the low cross-correlation property of member sequence.	antivirus software;code;congruence of squares;cross-correlation;digital watermarking;quadratic residue	C.

08b910589c13bf7978313968244ed74627d2807f	use of simulators for side-channel analysis		Side-channel attacks are among the most powerful and cost-effective attacks on cryptographic systems. Simulators that are developed for side-channel analysis are very useful for preliminary analysis of new schemes, in depth analysis of existing schemes as well as for analysis of products onearly stages of development. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. We present a first survey of existing simulators that were build for side-channel analysis. We present a new open-source simulator SAVRASCA that can generate simulated power traces based on compiled binary files for many popular AVR microcontrollers. We show how to use our simulator onthe example of DPA Contest 4 and we find a new vulnerability that allows an attacker to mount a differential power analysis (or even simple electromagnetic analysis) attack on the scheme. Our simulator can be used during development of new products in order to test their resistance against side-channel analysis. We also focus the attention of readers on questions ofwhy and how simulators are useful in this domain and try to highlight main issues related to simulators that were developed by the community.	algorithm;atmel avr;binary file;byte;compiler;cryptography;glitch;microcontroller;most significant bit;open-source software;side-channel attack;simulation;spectral leakage;tracing (software)	Nikita Veshchikov;Sylvain Guilley	2017	2017 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops (EuroS&PW)	10.1109/EuroSPW.2017.59	power analysis;theoretical computer science;microcontroller;algorithm design;cryptography;mount;real-time computing;computer science;side channel attack	Security	11.645241157500315	64.60894545502617	173990

Recently proposed 3D vertical cross-point ReRAM (3D-VRAM) architecture is an encouraging development in ReRAM's evolution as a cost-competitive solution, and thus attracts a lot of attention in both industry and academia. In this work, an array-level model to estimate the read/write energy and characterize the vertical access transistor is developed. We use the model to study a range of design trade-offs by tuning the cell-level characteristics and the read/write schemes. The design space exploration addresses several critical issues that are either unique to 3D-VRAM or have substantially different concerns from the 2D cross-point array design. It provides insights on the design optimizations of the array density and access energy, and several important conclusions have been reached. Then we propose multi-directional write driver to mitigate the writer circuitry overhead, and use remote sensing scheme to take full advantage of limited on-die sensing resources. The benefits of these optimizations are evaluated and validated in our macro-architecture model. With trace-based simulations, system-level comparisons between 3D-VRAM and a wide spectrum of memories are performed in mixed aspects of performance, cost, and energy. The results show that our optimized 3D-VRAM design are better than other contenders for storage memory in both performance and energy.	computer data storage;design space exploration;electronic circuit;file system permissions;flash memory;overhead (computing);peripheral;random access;read-write memory;resistive random-access memory;simulation;transistor;video ram (dual-ported dram)	Cong Xu;Pai-Yu Chen;Dimin Niu;Yang Zheng;Shimeng Yu;Yuan Xie	2014	2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)		embedded system;electronic engineering;computer hardware;computer science;engineering;sensor;electrical engineering;electrode;resistance;reinforcement learning;transistor	EDA	16.74541623864067	60.84034425361436	174159

The time between two successive measurements is a critical parameter to set during the WSN configuration because it can impact the WSN's lifetime, the wireless medium contention and the quality of the reported data. As trends in monitored parameters can significantly vary between scenarios and within time, identifying a sampling interval suitable for several cases is also challenging. In this work, we propose a dynamic sampling rate adaptation scheme based on reinforcement learning, able to tune sensors' sampling interval on-the-fly, according to environmental conditions and application requirements. The primary goal is to set the sampling interval to the best value possible so as to avoid oversampling and save energy, while not missing environmental changes that can be relevant for the application. In simulations, our mechanism could reduce up to 73% the total number of transmissions compared to a fixed strategy and, simultaneously, keep the average quality of information provided by the WSN. The inherent flexibility of the reinforcement learning algorithm facilitates its use in several scenarios, so as to exploit the broad scope of the Internet of Things.	adaptive sampling;algorithm;algorithmic learning theory;data aggregation;data compression;experiment;internet of things;machine learning;online and offline;oversampling;q-learning;reinforcement learning;requirement;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;software deployment	Gabriel Martins Dias;Maddalena Nurchis;Boris Bellalta	2016	2016 IEEE 3rd World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)	10.1109/WF-IoT.2016.7845391	real-time computing;simulation;wireless sensor network;temperature measurement;computer science;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;wireless;time	Mobile	11.350638535135143	74.39555266197863	174171

For so-called strong PUFs, the number of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) increases exponentially with the required chip area in the ideal case. They can provide a mechanism to authenticate chips which is inherently unique for every manufactured sample. Modeling of the CRP behavior through Machine Learning (ML) has shown to be a threat however. In this paper, we exploit repeatability imperfections of PUF responses as a side channel for model building. We demonstrate that 65nm CMOS arbiter PUFs can be modeled successfully, without utilizing any ML algorithm. Data originates from real-world measurements and hence not from simulations. Modeling accuracies exceeding 97% are obtained, which is comparable with previously published ML results. Information leakage through the exploited side channel should be considered for all strong PUF designs. Combined attack strategies, whereby repeatability measurements facilitate ML, might be effective and are recommended for further research.	algorithm;arbiter (electronics);cmos;challenge–response authentication;information leakage;machine learning;repeatability;side-channel attack;simulation;spectral leakage	Jeroen Delvaux;Ingrid Verbauwhede	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)	10.1109/HST.2013.6581579	embedded system;electronic engineering;physical unclonable function;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;cmos	Arch	13.584915937937593	64.28404273317443	174475

Most MemPUFs in the literature have unreliable bit generation and/or are incapable of generating more than one response-bit per cell. Hence, we propose a novel MemPUF exploiting the unique characteristics of spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) that can overcome these issues. Bit generation in our STT-MRAM-based MemPUF is stabilized using a novel automatic write-back technique. In addition, the alterability of the magnetic tunneling junction state is exploited to expand the response-bit capacity per cell. Our analysis demonstrated the advantage of our scheme in reliability enhancement (bit-error rate from ~10-1 to ~10-6 in the worst case under varying conditions) and response-bit capacity per cell improvement (from 1 to 1.48 bit). In comparison with the conventional MemPUFs, our approach is also better in terms of the average chip area and energy for producing a response-bit.	best, worst and average case;bit error rate;cache (computing);hash function;magnetoresistive random-access memory;physical unclonable function;sandy bridge;tunneling protocol;x.690	Le Zhang;Xuanyao Fong;Chip Hong Chang;Zhi-Hui Kong;Kaushik Roy	2015	IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security	10.1109/TIFS.2015.2421481	embedded system;magnetization;computer science;reliability;resistance;statistics	Visualization	17.09722504124452	60.9568849821226	174617

The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by making comparisons using RSS data from a simulated grid-based urban propagation model, RSS data generated by a network planning tool applied to a rural environment, and RSS data from real city environment. The proposed scheme first uses an optimal clustering scheme to portion the large outside area into different small regions based on the use of RSS deviations from the path loss model. For each region, a fine RSS distribution model is built to provide a good support for further positioning. An improved intersection method is then presented to find the most likely geographical area to further estimate a mobile user's location. A comparison between cluster-based and grid-based environment partitioning is made. The experimental results show that the proposed clustering scheme gives good support for location estimation and the positioning accuracy is significantly improved.	radio fingerprinting	Chao Ning;Rui Li;Kejiong Li	2016	Wireless Personal Communications	10.1007/s11277-016-3270-4	fingerprint;telecommunications;computer science;intersection;data mining;cluster analysis;computer security	Mobile	17.985779775103072	74.4057055012557	174718

The technique is based on combining the propagation delay with relative signal strength. In our study, the propagation delay involves the absolute and simulated delays that played a leading role in the geolocation decision algorithms. The relative signal strength, on the other hand, is the received signal strength differences measured at the user from a number of the neighboring base transceiver stations. By collecting the results from the field trials carried out in a commercial wireless cellular network, it is evident that the proposed technique is able to estimate the user's geolocation with better accuracy and thereby enable location-based services and applications in wireless cellular networks	algorithm;computation;geolocation;imperative programming;location-based service;propagation delay;software propagation;transceiver	Bo-Chieh Liu;Ken-Huang Lin	2006	IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference, 2006.

Under a scaled supply voltage and/or variations in process parameters, any possible delay errors appear only from the long paths that are designed to be less contributive to output quality. The proposed architecture allows a graceful degradation in the peak SNR (PSNR) under aggressive voltage scaling as well as extreme process variations. Results show that even under large process variations (±3σ around mean threshold voltage) and aggressive supply voltage scaling (at 0.88 V, while the nominal voltage is 1.2 V for a 90-nm technology), there is a gradual degradation of image quality with considerable power savings (71% at PSNR of 23.4 dB) for the proposed architecture, when compared to existing implementations in a 90-nm process technology.	algorithm;computation;discrete cosine transform;dynamic voltage scaling;elegant degradation;fault tolerance;image compression;image quality;image scaling;low-power broadcasting;maximal set;overhead (computing);peak signal-to-noise ratio;quality of service;requirement;signal processing	Georgios Karakonstantis;Nilanjan Banerjee;Kaushik Roy	2010	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2025279	image quality;embedded system;algorithm design;fault tolerance;electronic engineering;real-time computing;scalability;degradation;peak signal-to-noise ratio;telecommunications;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;dissipation;power electronics;discrete cosine transform;threshold voltage;low voltage;process variation;implementation;signal-to-noise ratio;algorithm;low-power electronics;integrated circuit design	Arch	19.87919447765184	62.47168656752734	174813
56b0134dde84470542ed66f3870bf2f5d271043f	low cost and high accuracy data gathering in wsns with matrix completion		Matrix completion has emerged very recently and provides a new venue for low cost data gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Existing schemes often assume that the data matrix has a known and fixed low-rank, which is unlikely to hold in a practical system for environment monitoring. Environmental data vary in temporal and spatial domains. By analyzing a large set of weather data collected from 196 sensors in ZhuZhou, China, we reveal that weather data have the features of low-rank, temporal stability, and relative rank stability. Taking advantage of these features, we propose an on-line data gathering scheme based on matrix completion theory, named MC-Weather, to adaptively sample different locations according to environmental and weather conditions. To better schedule sampling process while satisfying the required reconstruction accuracy, we propose several novel techniques, including three sample learning principles, an adaptive sampling algorithm based on matrix completion, and a uniform time slot and cross sample model. With these techniques, our MC-Weather scheme can collect the sensory data at required accuracy while largely reducing the cost for sensing, communication, and computation. We perform extensive simulations based on the data traces from weather monitoring and the simulation results validate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed scheme.	adaptive sampling;algorithm;computation;low-rank approximation;online and offline;sampling (signal processing);sensor;simulation;tracing (software);venue (sound system)	Kun Xie;Lele Wang;Xin Wang;Gaogang Xie;Jigang Wen	2018	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2017.2775230	data matrix;wireless sensor network;data collection;cost database;matrix completion;sampling (statistics);sparse matrix;data mining;real-time computing;distributed computing;computer science;adaptive sampling	Mobile	11.952032424114437	73.85664551413336	175111

Here, we propose a scan-protection scheme that provides testing facilities both at production time and over the course of the circuit's life. The underlying principles to scan-in both input vectors and expected responses and to compare expected and actual responses within the circuit. Compared to regular scan tests, this technique has no impact on the quality of the test or the model-based fault diagnosis. It entails negligible area overhead and avoids the use of an authentication test mechanism.	algorithm;authentication;computer security;cryptography;fault coverage;overhead (computing);test case	Jean DaRolt;Giorgio Di Natale;Marie-Lise Flottes;Bruno Rouzeyre	2014	IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems	10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2257903	testability;embedded system;logic synthesis;real-time computing;computer science;engineering;information security;design for testing;computer security;quantum mechanics	EDA	11.67823297628552	63.11193612907375	176570

For the very large grids in modern designs, incremental verification is highly desirable, because it allows one to skip the verification of a certain section of the grid (internal nodes) and instead, verify only the rest of the grid (external nodes). We propose an efficient approach for incremental verification in the context of vectorless constraints-based grid verification, under dynamic conditions. The traditional difficulty is that the dynamic case requires iterative analysis of both the internal and external sections. This has been previously overcome for simulation purposes, but we provide the first solution for verification, through two key contributions: 1) a bound on the internal nodes' voltages is developed that eliminates the need for iterative analysis, and 2) a multi-port Norton approach is used to construct a reduced macromodel for the internal section. As a result, we demonstrate significant reductions in runtime, with speed-ups in the range of 3-8x, with negligible impact on accuracy.	best, worst and average case;continuous design;integrated circuit;iteration;iterative method;limit analysis;macromodel;simulation;verification and validation	Abhishek;Farid N.

Most radio-based solutions require a process of site survey, in which radio signatures of an interested area are annotated with their real recorded locations. Site survey involves intensive costs on manpower and time, limiting the applicable buildings of wireless localization worldwide. In this study, we investigate novel sensors integrated in modern mobile phones and leverage user motions to construct the radio map of a floor plan, which is previously obtained only by site survey. On this basis, we design LiFS, an indoor localization system based on off-the-shelf WiFi infrastructure and mobile phones. LiFS is deployed in an office building covering over 1600m2, and its deployment is easy and rapid since little human intervention is needed. In LiFS, the calibration of fingerprints is crowdsourced and automatic. Experiment results show that LiFS achieves comparable location accuracy to previous approaches even without site survey.	antivirus software;crowdsourcing;fingerprint;indoor positioning system;mobile phone;pervasive informatics;sensor;software deployment	Zheng Yang;Chenshu Wu;Yunhao Liu	2012		10.1145/2348543.2348578	simulation;wireless site survey;telecommunications;floor plan;computer security;local system;computer network	Mobile	19.145808100944148	72.75302021645345	177317

Bluetooth positioning has received increasing attention from both academia and industry due to its wide availability, ease of deployment, and low power consumption. However, Bluetooth positioning is primarily based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which has been shown to be an unreliable indicator of distance. In this work, we present measurements to highlight various challenges in using RSSI for localization and the impact of these challenges on localization accuracy. Further, we propose and evaluate a novel multi-ranges beaconing approach to address RSSI-based ranging challenges.	bluetooth;context-sensitive language;location awareness;software deployment	Mehdi Golestanian;Christian Poellabauer	2016		10.1145/2942358.2942414	embedded system;internationalization and localization;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;computer network	Mobile	19.753526362064004	74.09330301971204	177579

In this work, we have used ideas from evolutionary computation, specifically genetic programming, to build accurate and compact mathematical models to approximate the response of FPGA-based ring oscillator PUFs (RO-PUFs). Hence, we have demonstrated the feasibility of a computationally simple scheme to model FPGA-based PUFs, and we believe this work will pave the way for similar attempts to attack more sophisticated PUF implementations.	approximation algorithm;best, worst and average case;computational model;evolutionary computation;field-programmable gate array;genetic programming;iteration;mathematical model;ring oscillator	Indrasish Saha;Ratan Rahul Jeldi;Rajat Subhra Chakraborty	2013	2013 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)	10.1109/HST.2013.6581563	electronic engineering;physical unclonable function;computer science;engineering;theoretical computer science;computer security;field-programmable gate array;statistics;evolutionary computation	Security	13.42057982748661	64.18554939154964	177616
a01dd3459f8c3f88880277030bde0e035c03fb1f	bias scheme reducing transient currents and speeding up read operations for 3-d cross point pcm		3-D cross point phase change memory (PCM) is a promising emerging nonvolatile memory in changing the current memory-storage hierarchy. However, dynamic performances of 3-D cross point PCM are limited and the role of bias scheme is unknown. Previous studies on bias schemes for planar memories use static analyses to assess static array performances. Here we use dynamic analyses to assess dynamic chip performances with device parameters, bias schemes, arrays and circuits. A high peak transient read current is found to result in a long read access time. Three factors which contribute to the high peak read current are analyzed. Among them, the high voltage variation of half-selected cells on the bit line is optimized by scheme design. The proposed 2V/3 bias scheme and a single-reference parasitic-matching sensing circuit are utilized in a 64Mbit 3-D cross point PCM. The maximum value of read current is 160.27{\mu}A and reduced by 41.7% compared to the conventional V/2 scheme. And the sensing time is 30.89ns which is reduced by 22.5%. The chip shows zero read error in Monte Carlo simulations. Designing bias schemes through dynamic analyses paves the way for the development of high-performance 3-D PCM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems.	access time;memory hierarchy;monte carlo method;non-volatile memory;performance;phase-change memory;scheme;simulation;static program analysis	Yu Lei;Meng Liu;Houpeng Chen;Xi Li;Qian Wang;Zhitang Song	2018	CoRR			Arch	17.15343507470027	60.50753108680805	177735

Modern advances in measurement and instrumentation have required increasingly sophisticated visual representations, to ensure that scientists can quickly and accurately interpret increasingly complex data. Most recently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as a technology which is capable of collecting a vast amount of data over space and time. The sheer volume of the data makes it difficult to be interpreted by humans into meaningful insights. This presents a number of challenges for developers of visualisation techniques which seek to ``map'' the data sensed by a network. Visualisation techniques helps to turn large amounts of raw data into credible visual information such as graphs, charts, or maps, that can assist in understanding of the meaning of that data. In this paper we propose a map as a suitable data visualisation and extraction tool. We aim to develop an in-network distributed information extraction and visualisation service. Such a service would greatly simplify the production of higher-level information-rich representations suitable for informing other network services and the delivery of field information visualisation.	chart;contour line;data visualization;graph (discrete mathematics);information extraction;information visualization;instrumentation (computer programming);interpolation;map;relevance;sensor;web mapping	Mohammad Hammoudeh;Robert M.

While only recently studied, IC piracy has now become a major challenge for the electronics and defense industries [6].  We propose a novel comprehensive technique to end piracy of integrated circuits (EPIC). It requires that every chip be activated with an external key, which can only be generated by the holder of IP rights, and cannot be duplicated. EPIC is based on (i) automatically-generated chip IDs, (ii) a novel combinational locking algorithm, and (iii) innovative use of public-key cryptography. Our evaluation suggests that the overhead of EPIC on circuit delay and power is negligible, and the standard flows for verification and test do not require change. In fact, major required components have already been integrated into several chips in production. We also use formal methods to evaluate combinational locking and computational attacks. A comprehensive protocol analysis concludes that EPIC is surprisingly resistant to various piracy attempts.	algorithm;authorization;combinational logic;formal methods;integrated circuit;lock (computer science);offset binary;overhead (computing);public-key cryptography;semiconductor device fabrication;two-phase locking	Jarrod A.

The major drawback of LF is the requirement of having an updated fingerprint database. Gaussian Process (GP) is a non-parametric modeling technique which can be used to model the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and create the fingerprint database based on few training data. In this paper we use a parametric pathloss model for the GP mean and a flexible non-parametric covariance function, so we can get reliable estimates with low fingerprinting effort. In our experiment, we show that with 23 fingerprint locations we perform as well as traditional fingerprinting with over 230 fingerprinted locations for an office space of 2500m2.	fingerprint (computing);gaussian process;internationalization and localization;radio fingerprinting;wireless access point	Simon Yiu;Marzieh Dashti;Holger Claussen;Fernando Pérez-Cruz	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	10.1109/ICC.2016.7511152	data modeling;computer science;sensor;theoretical computer science;machine learning;data mining;probabilistic logic	Robotics	19.03850011076102	73.41933314201515	181631
7217f5ba7e4e25ab378f3431e37eb1fede212296	physical characterization of arbiter pufs	arbiter puf;physical characterization;photonic emission analysis;backside	As intended by its name, Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are considered as an ultimate solution to deal with insecure storage, hardware counterfeiting, and many other security problems. However, many different successful attacks have already revealed vulnerabilities of certain digital intrinsic PUFs. Although settling-state-based PUFs, such as SRAM PUFs, can be physically cloned by semi-invasive and fully-invasive attacks, successful attacks on timing-based PUFs were so far limited to modeling attacks. Such modeling requires a large subset of challenge-response-pairs (CRP) to successfully model the targeted PUF. In order to provide a final security answer, this paper proves that all arbiter-based (i.e. controlled and XOR-enhanced) PUFs can be completely and linearly characterized by means of photonic emission analysis. Our experimental setup is capable of measuring every PUF-internal delay with a resolution of 6 picoseconds. Due to this resolution we indeed require only the theoretical minimum number of linear independent equations (i.e. physical measurements) to directly solve the underlying inhomogeneous linear system. Moreover, we neither require to know the actual PUF challenges nor the corresponding PUF responses for our physical delay extraction. On top of that devastating result, we are also able to further simplify our setup for easier physical measurement handling. We present our practical results for a real arbiter PUF implementation on a Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) from Altera manufactured in a 180 nanometer process.	arbiter (electronics);challenge–response authentication;complex programmable logic device;exclusive or;linear system;semiconductor industry;static random-access memory	Shahin Tajik;Enrico Dietz;Sven Frohmann;Jean-Pierre Seifert;Dmitry Nedospasov;Clemens Helfmeier;Christian Boit;Helmar Dittrich	2014	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-662-44709-3_27	physical unclonable function;real-time computing;computer security	Security	13.858128720887482	63.93609965565206	181668

The primary challenge to validate hybrid memory system with both CMOS and NVM devices is to develop a SPICE-like simulator that can simulate the dynamic behavior accurately and efficiently. Since memristor, spin-transfer-toque magnetic-tunneling-junction (STT-MTJ) and phase-change-memory (PCM) devices are the most promising candidates of next generation of NVM devices, it is under great interest in including these new devices in the standard CMOS design flow. The previous approaches either ignore dynamic effect without consideration of internal states for dynamic behavior, or need complex equivalent circuits to represent those devices. This paper proposes a new modified nodal analysis for NVM devices with identified internal state variables for dynamic behavior. As such, compact SPICE-like implementation can be derived for all three new NVM devices in the design of large-scale memory circuits. As demonstrated by a number of examples on hybrid memory circuits with both CMOS and NVM devices, our newly developed SPICE-like simulator can capture dynamic behaviors of memristor, STT-MTJ and PCM devices, and can also reduce CPU runtime by 20-69 times when compared to the previous equivalent circuit based approaches.	cmos;central processing unit;equivalent circuit;memristor;modified nodal analysis;next-generation network;non-volatile memory;nonvolatile bios memory;phase-change memory;spice;simulation;tunneling protocol	Yang Shang;Wei Fei;Hao Yu	2012	IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers	10.1109/TCSI.2011.2180441	electronic engineering;parallel computing;memristor;computer hardware;computer science;quantum mechanics	EDA	18.04933779749401	60.78164265033556	182187
23c05ab0705da1bd8bcbe3c4484f9a0f4e94efb7	informative path planning for location fingerprint collection		Fingerprint-based indoor localization methods are promising due to the high availability of deployed access points and compatibility with commercial-off-the-shelf user devices. However, to train regression models for localization, an extensive site survey is required to collect fingerprint data from the target areas. In this paper, we consider the problem of informative path planning (IPP) to find the optimal walk for site survey subject to a budget constraint. IPP for location fingerprint collection is related to the well-known orienteering problem (OP) but is more challenging due to edge-based non-additive rewards and revisits. Given the NP-hardness of IPP, we propose two heuristic approaches: a Greedy algorithm and a genetic algorithm. We show through experimental data collected from two indoor environments with different characteristics that the two algorithms have low computation complexity, can generally achieve higher utility and lower localization errors compared to the extension of two state-of-the-art approaches to OP.	computation;fingerprint;genetic algorithm;greedy algorithm;heuristic;high availability;information;motion planning;np-hardness;utility functions on indivisible goods;whole earth 'lectronic link;wireless access point	Y.

For both applications it is imperative that PUFs provide enough entropy. The aim of this paper is to propose a new model for binary-output PUFs such as SRAM, DFF, Latch and Buskeeper PUFs, and a method to accurately estimate their entropy. In our model the measurable property of a PUF is its set of cell biases. We determine an upper bound on the """"extractable entropy"""", i.e. the number of key bits that can be robustly extracted, by calculating the mutual information between the bias measurements done at enrollment and reconstruction.  In previously known methods only uniqueness was studied using information-theoretic measures, while robustness was typically expressed in terms of error probabilities or distances. It is not always straightforward to use a combination of these two metrics in order to make an informed decision about the performance of different PUF types. Our new approach has the advantage that it simultaneously captures both of properties that are vital for key storage: uniqueness and robustness. Therefore it will be possible to fairly compare performance of PUF implementations using our new method. Statistical validation of the new methodology shows that it clearly captures both of these properties of PUFs. In other words: if one of these aspects (either uniqueness or robustness) is less than optimal, the extractable entropy decreases. Analysis on a large database of PUF measurement data shows very high entropy for SRAM PUFs, but rather poor results for all other memory-based PUFs in this database."""	digital forensics framework (dff);imperative programming;information theory;mutual information;static random-access memory	Robbert van den Berg;Boris Skoric;Vincent van der Leest	2013	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1145/2517300.2517301	physical unclonable function;theoretical computer science;mathematics;computer security;algorithm	Crypto	13.943993679696419	64.20870006887445	182381

It also discusses metastability which arises in the system due to the existence of asynchronous inputs. The motivation for the new design, details of the design and its modelling are also covered. Finally the jitter generated by the synchronizer is analysed. SYNCHRONIZATION IN NETWORK TIMING APPLICATIONS When considering timing issues, digital communication networks may be viewed as consisting of digital transmission links and processing nodes. Thing impairments introduced by the links include wander due to variations in delay along and between links and repeater jitter due to the use of regenerative repeaters. Jitter may also be introduced as a result of node processing such as multiplexing and rate adaptation. External Timing Source Injection In data networks based on shared media, the transfer of a good quality timing reference signal is a demanding task. In these networks, nodes may operate with autonomous clocks, which OverComes repeater bit jitter accumulation but introduces frame level jitter accumulation 181. Data entering a node is written to a buffer at the rate of the upstream node's clock. whereas data leaving the node is read out at the rate of the node's own clock. Stuffing mechanisms [2,3,7,81 are used to adjust the average read clock frequency to the incoming frequency and prevent buffer overflow or underflow. Unfortunately, the use of stuffing introduces jitter to the frame, which, after a series of nodes, and depending upon the frequency differentials involved, may build up to high levels and contain undesirable low frequency components. One way of preventing the accumulation of stuffing jitter is to inject a clean external timing source (XTS) at appropriate points in a subnetwork. The XTS supplied by a public network can also be used to Antonio cantoni Australian Telecommunications Research Institute Curtin University of Technology Bentley WA 6102 Australia (41) 9 351 3243 cantoni@atri.curtin.edu.au establish the basic subnetwork timing so that information can be exchanged with the public network. The frame timing of the subnetwork can be locked to an XTS connection by using a frame sampling synchronizer. Such a device is simpler to implement than the conventional method of synchronization which requires a buffer and control blocks to monitor buffer fill and carry out stufEng. The frame sampling synchronizer samples the XTS at the rate of the autonomous clock thus synchronizing it to the edges of this clock. The two signals are asynchronous, as shown in Figure 1, so the position in time of the XTS with respect to the local clock is continuously variable and can occur arbitrarily close to the local clock edge. Figure I Source Rate Encoding The support of constant bit rate (CBR) services over a network requires some method of accepting data from a CBR source and delivering the same data at the m e c t rate at the destination. The synchronous residual time stamp method (SRTS) [l. 91 is proposed for encoding the source rate of CBR services to allow their transport over the ATM Adaptation Layer type 1 (AAL 1) of the B-ISDN. The method encodes the number of cycles of a locally available network reference clock which occur during the nth period (T,,) of the source clock divided by N.

Since the hybrid measurements can help to improve the positioning accuracy, several hybrid localization methods have been proposed in the literature. However, the high performance estimator with the closed-form solution and complete performance analysis for time-of-arrival/signal strength (TOA/SS) localization technique is still an opening issue. Two TOA/SS localization algorithms with the closed-form solutions are proposed for the cases with or without uncertainty in the positions of base stations. Furthermore, performance analysis for the TOA/SS localization technique is presented. Both the theoretical variances and Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) are derived and the relationship between the cases with or without uncertainty is given. The paper also proves that the TOA/SS scheme has a lower CRLB than the TOA (or SS) scheme.

We propose LSVM-a novel solution with the following merits. First, LSVM localizes the network based on mere connectivity information (that is, hop counts only) and therefore is simple and does not require specialized ranging hardware or assisting mobile devices as in most existing techniques. Second, LSVM is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. Although SVM is a classification method, we show its applicability to the localization problem and prove that the localization error can be upper bounded by any small threshold given an appropriate training data size. Third, LSVM addresses the border and coverage-hole problems effectively. Last but not least, LSVM offers fast localization in a distributed manner with efficient use of processing and communication resources. We also propose a modified version of mass-spring optimization to further improve the location estimation in LSVM.

9bd9bc77ecff1fc7d437ab12f0073eddf6c6bcdd	indoor localization system for mobile target tracking based on visible light communication		In this paper, a positioning system is designed based on the visible light communication (VLC) technology for the tracking of mobile target in the indoor environment. The practical received signal strength (RSS) can be measured for subsequent positioning algorithm by using the designed system. Based on the practical measurements, an empirical equation is proposed to estimate the target's distances relative to the referenced LEDs. Then, taking advantage of the relative distances, the location estimation can be obtained by the trilateration method. Furthermore, Kalman Filter is used for improving the positioning result computed by trilateration method. Finally, experimental results show that the average location errors by adopting the derived empirical formula and trilateration can reach to 3.4cm, and the accuracy of positioning can be promoted to 2.6cm by using Kalman Filter in a real wireless environment.	algorithm;indoor positioning system;kalman filter;rss;tracking system;vlc media player	Zhiming Guo;Ziyan Jia;Weiwei Xia;Yueyue Zhang;Lianfeng Shen	2017	2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring)	10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108342	signal strength;electronic engineering;positioning system;computer science;kalman filter;computer vision;wireless;artificial intelligence;trilateration;visible light communication	Mobile	20.907493525041495	74.0998411147432	185186

However, software based information flow tracking implementations have drawbacks in preciseness and performance. As a result, researchers have begun to explore tracking information flow in hardware, and more specifically, understanding the interference of individual bits of information through logical functions. Such gate level information flow tracking (GLIFT) can track information flow in a system at the granularity of individual bits. However, the theoretical basis for GLIFT, which is essential to its adoption in real applications, has never been thoroughly studied. This paper provides fundamental analysis of GLIFT by introducing definitions, properties, and the imprecision problem with a commonly used shadow logic generation method. This paper also presents a solution to this imprecision problem and provides results that show this impreciseness can be tolerated for the benefit of lower area and delay.	boolean algebra;brute-force search;comparator;computer security;essence;false precision;information flow (information theory);interference (communication);logic gate;logic programming;multiplexer;non-interference (security);overhead (computing);sensor	Wei Hu;Jason Oberg;Ali Irturk;Mohit Tiwari;Timothy Sherwood;Dejun Mu;Ryan Kastner	2011	IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/TCAD.2011.2120970	electronic engineering;real-time computing;logic gate;computer science;information security;theoretical computer science;computer security;algorithm	Arch	12.158148726555906	62.98424061428018	185705
1676c5593086533b3bce5efbfc49ba68f5d78fa9	évaluation par simulation de la sécurité des circuits face aux attaques par faute. (evaluation by simulation of circuits security against fault attacks)		Microelectronic security devices are more and more present in our lives (smartcards, SIM cards) and they contains sensitive informations that must be protected (account number, cryptographic key, personal data). Recently, attacks on cryptographic algorithms appeared, based on the use of faults. Adding a fault during a device computation enables one to obtain a faulty result. Using a certain amount of correct results and the corresponding faulty ones, it is possible to extract secret data and, in some cases, complete cryptographic keys. However, physical perturbations used in practice (laser, radiations, power glitch) rarely match with faults needed to successfully perform theoretical attacks. In this work, we propose a methodology to test circuits under fault attacks, using simulation. The use of simulation enables to test the circuit before its physical realization, but needs a lot of time. That is why our methodology helps the user to choose the most important faults in order to significantly reduce the simulation time. The tool and the corresponding methodology have been tested on a cryptographic circuit (AES) using a delay fault model. We showed that use of delays to make faults can generate faults suitable for performing known attacks.	algorithm;computation;cryptography;differential fault analysis;electronic circuit simulation;fault model;glitch;international bank account number;key (cryptography);linear algebra;personally identifiable information;smart card;software bug;subscriber identity module	Olivier Faurax	2008				Security	11.504065950893201	64.13265624682329	185785

Positioning enables new networking and application solutions, but suffers from insufficient positioning accuracy. We present a way for improving the accuracy of a global positioning system by adding a local positioning system giving relative positions of a group of mobile entities more accurate than the global system communicated among the mobile entities. The improvement is based on transforming the global coordinate system into the local coordinate system and back by translation and rotation operations. In this paper, we detail the geometric operations and present a novel derivation of how to compute the optimal rotation angle based on covariance measures. Further, we provide estimates for the overall prediction error when using the local positioning system in addition to a global one and a proof of the convergence of the approach. Two major results are the fact that error correlations in the global positioning system increase the prediction error, while error correlations in the local positioning system decrease the overall prediction error. In a case study, we present results from randomized experiments, as well as from GPS and Differential GPS (DGPS) measurements. Both sets of experiments confirm the theoretical findings.	access time;computer;differential gps;entity;experiment;global positioning system;hoc (programming language);on-board data handling;randomized algorithm;smartphone	Helmut Hlavacs;Karin Anna Hummel	2013	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2012.197	computer vision;simulation;mobile telephony;global positioning system;computer science;precise point positioning;accuracy and precision;mobile computing;satellite;statistics;measurement uncertainty	Robotics	17.91915535223298	73.97526975061976	185874
9659117257b20546813e18279bba296d1313bf63	faceme: face-to-machine proximity estimation based on rssi difference for mobile industrial human–machine interaction		In the mobile industrial human–machine interaction (HMI), to establish the data connection, the engineer has to manually select the target machine from a long list, which may lead to wrong connection and waste of time. We observe that the engineer should face to the machine during the interaction to ensure that the machine works accurately, and this characteristic makes the proximity estimation algorithm suitable to simplify the data connection. However, due to the densely deployed machines, the existing algorithms cannot provide sufficient accuracy with limited latency. In this paper, we implement a testbed to evaluate the performance in the mobile industrial HMI. Based on the experimental results, we propose the definition of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) difference and then use it to design the face-to-machine proximity estimation (FaceME) algorithm. The experimental results prove that FaceME can provide guaranteed estimation accuracy and low-time complexity.	algorithm;human–computer interaction;testbed;time complexity;user interface	Zhezhuang Xu;Rongkai Wang;Xi Yue;Ting Liu;Cailian Chen;Shih-Hau Fang	2018	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics	10.1109/TII.2018.2829847	time complexity;signal strength;computer science;latency (engineering);real-time computing;wireless;human–machine system;bluetooth;testbed	EDA	18.96726137390899	72.34486146653431	185926

Applying wireless vibration sensor networks (WVSNs) to this class is challenging due to severe resource constraints (e.g., bandwidth and energy). State-of-the-art data reduction approaches (e.g., signal processing, in-network aggregation) suggested to improve these constraints do not satisfy application-specific requirements, e.g., high quality of data (QoD) collection or quality of monitoring (QoM). In this paper, we propose <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$v\text{Collector}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, a general approach to vibration data collection and monitoring in a resource-constrained WVSN. We enable each sensor to reduce the amount of data (before transmission) in a decentralized manner in two stages: the data acquisition stage and data transmission stage. In the first, we propose a solution to low-complexity signal processing; each sensor analyzes signals using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) under the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and then applies an idea from the Goertzel algorithm (first proposed by Goertzel in 1958) so that the sensor can reduce a significant amount of data without sacrificing the QoD. In the second stage, we propose a decision-making algorithm by which each sensor can make a decision on its acquired data (considered <italic>event-sensitive data</italic> if it has information about <italic>harmful vibrations</italic> ) so that <italic>event-insensitive data</italic> communication is reduced. Evaluation results (obtained by simulations using our empirical data traces and by a real system deployment) demonstrate that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""""LaTeX"""">$v\text{Collector}$</tex-math></inline-formula> significantly reduces energy consumption and guarantees QoM in a WVSN."""	data acquisition;data quality;display resolution;fast fourier transform;goertzel algorithm;modulation;requirement;sensor;signal processing;simulation;software deployment;system deployment;tracing (software)	Md.

The ranging errors are modeled as a zero-mean random component plus a bias component that is assumed to be a linear function of the range. Through minimizing the mean-square error of the position estimation, an expression for the optimal estimate of the bias parameter is obtained. Both range and pseudo-range-based positioning are considered. Simulations and experimentation are conducted which show that a significant accuracy gain can be achieved for range-based positioning using the enhanced least-squares algorithm. It is also observed that the pseudo-range-based least-squares algorithm is little affected by the choice of the bias parameter. The results demonstrate that the experimental 5.8-GHz ISM band positioning system can achieve positional accuracy of around half a meter when using the proposed algorithm.	algorithm;computer simulation;experiment;image scaling;implicit shape model;indoor positioning system;iterative method;least squares;linear function;mean squared error;mesh networking;multipath propagation;positioning system;pseudorange;requirement;software propagation	Ian Sharp;Kegen Yu	2013	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2012.124	algorithm design;simulation;mobile telephony;telecommunications;computer science;base station;accuracy and precision;statistics;measurement uncertainty	Mobile	21.686242323832808	74.46275668597157	187535

A device is an atomic analogue cell that performs an elementary and standard function such as the differential pair and the current mirror. A device is smart since it can be electrically and physically adapted. In the proposed method, the device sizes and biases are first computed using dedicated sizing operators based on the MOS transistor model and the foundry Design Kit. Once transistor sizes are computed, they are fed to a layout generation tool which offers different layout styles for the same device. The layout is generated with the layout dependent parasitics, including stress effects. These parasitics are then taken into account by the sizing operators. Therefore a loop between sizing and layout generation can be set and executed until the device specifications are met. The method is applied to a differential pair with several layout styles and two distinct technologies.	cmos;current mirror;differential signaling;process migration;seamless3d;transistor model	Stephanie Youssef;Farakh Javid;Damien Dupuis;Ramy Iskander;Marie-Minerve Louërat	2011	2011 20th European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)	10.1109/ECCTD.2011.6043356	computer simulation;nanoelectronics;system on a chip;layout;embedded system;aspect ratio;electronic engineering;semiconductor device modeling;ic layout editor;computer science;engineering;electrical engineering;process modeling;design layout record;proximity effect;integrated circuit layout;stress;cmos;computational model;engineering drawing;transistor	EDA	22.15204449035441	62.116987616886284	187550

In particular, WDDL logic style is a gate-level countermeasure, to Power Analysis Attacks exploiting dynamic Power. It has been demonstrated that, in deep sub-micron technologies, the static power consumption is no more negligible as in the past and malicious attackers can benefit from the dependability of the static power consumption on the processed data: Leakage Power Analysis (LPA) has been proposed to recover sensible information. The possibility to recover the secret key from a protected secure implementation exploiting static power is not a minor threat, and we analyze this vulnerability with actual security metrics and with an information theoretic approach, showing that gate level countermeasures such as WDDL can be successfully attacked exploiting static power instead of dynamic power.	block cipher;cmos;coefficient;cost per action;cryptography;dependability;emoticon;information theory;key (cryptography);logic family;mtd-f;malware;mutual information;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral leakage;theory	Davide Bellizia;Giuseppe Scotti;Alessandro Trifiletti	2016	2016 MIXDES - 23rd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems	10.1109/MIXDES.2016.7529734	electronic engineering;real-time computing;engineering;computer security	EDA	12.649036464087592	63.19056729684168	188033
c5ce7ae53984a7cf091d183227757de9d976e988	information flow tracking in analog/mixed-signal designs through proof-carrying hardware ip		Information flow tracking (IFT) is a widely used methodology for ensuring data confidentiality in electronic systems and numerous such methods have been developed at various software or hardware description levels. Among them, proof-carrying hardware intellectual property (PCHIP) introduced an IFT methodology for digital hardware designs described in hardware description languages (HDLs). The risk of accidental information leakage, however, is not restricted to the digital domain. Indeed, analog signals originating from sources of sensitive information, such as biometric sensors, as well as analog outputs of a circuit, could carry or leak secrets. Moreover, similar to digital designs, analog circuits can also be contaminated with malicious information leakage channels capable of evading traditional manufacturing test. Compounding the problem, in analog/mixed-signal circuits such information leakage channels can cross the analog/digital or digital/analog interface, making their detection even harder. To this end, in this paper we introduce a PCHIP-based methodology which enables systematic formal evaluation of information flow policies in analog/mixed-signal designs. As we demonstrate, by integrating IFT across the digital and analog domain, our method is able to detect sensitive data leakage from the digital domain to the analog domain and vice versa, without requiring any modification of the current analog/mixed-signal circuit design flow.	abstraction layer;analog signal;analog-to-digital converter;analogue electronics;biometrics;circuit design;confidentiality;digital data;digital electronics;embedded system;error-tolerant design;hardware description language;information flow;information leakage;information sensitivity;mixed-signal integrated circuit;sensor;spectral leakage;transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation;transistor	Mohammad-Mahdi Bidmeshki;Angelos Antonopoulos;Yiorgos Makris	2017	Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2017		mixed-signal integrated circuit;embedded system;electronic engineering;real-time computing;analog image processing;telecommunications;sensitivity;analogue electronics;computer science;electrical engineering;information security;operating system;transistor;analog multiplier	EDA	12.211532468819135	63.15196973693019	188490

However, the environment has changed dramatically since the original algorithms using only a few Access Points (APs). A typical building with densely deployed APs might contain hundreds of APs. The explosive growth of the number of APs introduces new challenges to these WiFi-based localization algorithms. This paper presents an empirical study of WiFi fingerprint-based indoor localization algorithms in a real-world environment with hundreds of APs. Our study aims to answer several important research questions regarding the influence of the number of APs, time variance and device variance. The study implements four existing algorithms and also proposes a new algorithm called LCS that is designed specifically for an AP-intensive environment. We compare the localization accuracy of different algorithms with different variances in the experimental results, which shows that the proposed LCS algorithm is able to efficiently resist diverse variances in an AP-intensive setup.	algorithm;densely packed decimal;fingerprint;internationalization and localization;performance;rss	Xin Chen;Junjun Kong;Yao Guo;Xiangqun Chen	2014	2014 IEEE Global Communications Conference	10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036860	wireless ad hoc network;embedded system;algorithm design;prediction;telecommunications;computer science;accuracy and precision;statistics;computer network	Mobile	18.80889093421094	73.02181173545925	189247
2e2242b99526246e3a12c90d19638a2065711f69	new impossible differential search tool from design and cryptanalysis aspects		In this paper, a new tool searching for impossible differentials against symmetric-key primitives is presented. Compared to the previous tools, our tool can detect any contradiction between input and output differences, and it can take into account the property inside the S-box when its size is small e.g. 4 bits. In addition, several techniques are proposed to evaluate 8-bit S-box. With this tool, the number of rounds of impossible differentials are improved from the previous best results by 1 round for Midori128, Lilliput, and Minalpher. The tool also finds new impossible differentials of ARIA and MIBS. We manually verify the impossibility of the searched results, which reveals new structural properties of those designs. Our tool can be implemented only by slightly modifying the previous differential search tool using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), while the previous tools need to be implemented independently of the differential search tools. This motivates us to discuss the usage of our tool particular for the design process. With this tool, the maximum number of rounds of impossible differentials can be proven under reasonable assumptions and the tool is applied to various concrete designs.	8-bit;impossible differential cryptanalysis;input/output;integer programming;linear programming;s-box;symmetric-key algorithm	Yu F Sasaki;Yosuke Todo	2016	IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive	10.1007/978-3-319-56617-7_7	theoretical computer science;computer security;algorithm	Logic	11.360058535295693	65.66278618932918	189442

Unlike most previous proposals, the mobile device (MD) determines its own position based only on ultrasonic signals received at a compact sensor array and sent by a fixed independent beacon. No radio frequency or wired timing reference signal is used. Furthermore, the system is privacy aware and one way in that the receive-only MD determines its own position based on ultrasonic signals received from fixed transmit-only beacons. The MD uses a novel hybrid angle of arrival (AoA)-time of flight (ToF) with timing lock algorithm to determine its location relative to the beacons with high accuracy. The algorithm utilizes an AoA-based location method to obtain an initial estimate of its own location. Based on this, it estimates the timing offsets (TOs) between the MD clock and the beacon transmissions. The average TO and the known periodicities of the beacon signals are then used to obtain a second more accurate MD location estimate via a ToF method. The system utilizes wideband spread spectrum ultrasonic signaling in order to achieve a high update rate and robustness to noise and reverberation. A prototype system was constructed, and the algorithm was implemented in software. The experimental results show that the method provides 3-D accuracy better than 9.5 cm in 99% of cases, an 80% accuracy improvement over the conventional AoA-only method.		Mohamed M. Saad;Chris J.

Many applications gain benefits from knowing the exact position of an RFID-tagged object. Existing localization algorithms in wireless network, however, can hardly be directly employed due to tag's limited capabilities in terms of energy and memory. In this paper, we propose BackPos, a fine-grained backscatter positioning technique using the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID products with detected phases. Our studies show that the phase is a stable indicator highly related to tag's position and preserved over frequency or tag orientation, but challenged by its periodicity and tag's diversity. We attempt to infer the distance differences from phases detected by antennas under triangle constraint. Further, hyperbolic positioning using the distance differences is employed to shrink the tag's candidate positions until finding out the real one. In combination with interrogation zone, we finally relax the triangle constraint and allow arbitrary deployment of antennas by sacrificing the feasible region. We implement a prototype of BackPos with COTS RFID products and evaluate this design in various scenarios. The results show that BackPos achieves the mean accuracy of 12:8cm with variance of 3:8 cm.	access control;algorithm;backscatter (email);feasible region;internationalization and localization;logistics;multilateration;positioning system;prototype;quasiperiodicity;radio frequency;radio-frequency identification;regular language description for xml;software deployment;tag (game)	Tianci Liu;Yunhao Liu;Lei Yang;Yi Guo;Cheng Wang	2016	IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing	10.1109/TMC.2015.2424437	radio-frequency identification;feasible region;simulation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;antenna;accuracy and precision;mobile computing;backscatter	Mobile	19.541725386347675	71.79852188204148	189515
c7e7d2dc1827a3863ad963a880b45391012c2bd8	detection of ijtag attacks using ldpc-based feature reduction and machine learning		IEEE 1687 standard (IJTAG), as an extension to the IEEE 1149.1, facilitates efficient access to embedded instruments by supporting reconfigurable scan networks. Specifically, IJTAG allows each IP to be wrapped by a test data register (TDR) whose access is controlled by a segment insertion bit (SIB) or a scan-mux control bit (SCB). Because the TDRs and the SIB/SCB network are typically not public, but critical for accessing embedded instruments, they might be used for illegitimate purposes, such as dumping credential data and reverse engineering IP design. Machine learning has been proposed to detect such attacks, but the large number of instruments and parallel execution enabled by the IJTAG produce high-dimensional data, which poses a challenge to on-chip detection. In this paper, we propose to reduce the high-dimensional but sparse data using a low-density parity-check (LDPC) matrix. Experiments using a modified version of the OpenSPARC T2 to include IJTAG functionality demonstrate that the use of feature reduction eliminates 91% of the features, leading to 43% reduction in circuit size without affecting detection accuracy. Also, the on-chip detector adds moderate overhead (∼ 8%) to the IJTAG.	credential;embedded system;experiment;jtag;low-density parity-check code;machine learning;opensparc;overhead (computing);reconfigurable computing;reverse engineering;sparse matrix;test data;time-domain reflectometer;ultrasparc t2	Xuanle Ren;R.

04405a9f46c49ae81d746bfd7410fad890ba6d59	data approximation for time series data in wireless sensor networks		Data prediction approaches are proposed in many fields to approximate time series data with a tolerable error. These approaches typically build prediction functions based on assumptions of the data variation. Nonetheless, if the variation of real-world time series data does not follow the assumption, the performance of data prediction will be limited. This paper presents a lightweight data approximation approach for time series data. This approach utilizes binary codes to represent original values, directly shortening their lengths in the cost of data precision. Then the author implements this approach in the WSN scenario. Two types of application layer messages and their transmission scheme are presented. These approaches are employed in WSN applications to: (1) report abnormal conditions in time, and (2) reduce data transmissions independently of data variations. Series of simulations are built on the basis of five real datasets. Simulation results based on five real datasets validate the performances of the proposed approach.

The IP address of IPv6 extends to 128 bits, where the prefix bits store `0' or `1' and the remaining bits store `X' (don't care). Most prefixes are much shorter than 128 bits, so many TCAM cells store `X'. The proposed data-relocation TCAM (DR-TCAM) increases the number of IP addresses stored in the TCAM by relocating the data in the prefix bits into `X' cells. The DR-TCAM has four types of banks. The type-0 bank is empty and inactivated. The type-1 and type-2 banks store four 32 bit words and two 64 bit words instead of a 128 bit word in the type-3 bank, respectively. Therefore, the type-1 and type-2 banks store four and two times larger IP addresses, respectively. In the simulation, the area and power consumption of the DR-TCAM decreased to 34% and 36% of those of the conventional TCAM for 4 K IP addresses, respectively. The DR-TCAM chip with 256 × 128 bit TCAM cells and 8 banks was fabricated using a 1.2 V 0.13 μm CMOS process. Its area was 0.87 mm 2 . Its energy/bit/search was 1.3 fJ at 200 MHz clock frequency when 4 banks were activated to store 256 IP addresses.	128-bit;32-bit;64-bit computing;cmos;clock rate;content-addressable memory;dr-dos;don't-care term;low-power broadcasting;relocation (computing);simulation;telecommunications access method	Byung-Do Yang	2015	IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits	10.1109/JSSC.2015.2457908	parallel computing;real-time computing;computer hardware;computer science;operating system;bit field;processor register;computer-aided manufacturing	Arch	14.644973930955619	60.563154583892285	190671
08ce96d505c7bdb4dffcb86dcfcd8fb18f305be0	evaluating obfuscation performance of novel algorithm-to-architecture mapping techniques in systolic-array-based circuits		Systolic-array-based very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits are widely used in many high-performance applications. Due to their features such as high regularity and modularity, thorough investigation of employing current obfuscation (or encryption) techniques to protect the systolic-array-based circuits from counterfeiting by others, however, are not well carried out. Therefore, in this paper, we have conducted a series of explorations on deriving efficient strategies to enhance the obfuscation performance for systolic-based circuits. Unlike existing strategies mainly focus on the improving of obfuscation techniques, we began our investigation from the design point of view for systolic structures, i.e., algorithm-to-architecture mapping techniques. Firstly, a brief analysis revealed two main critical issues related to the success of obfuscation in systolic-based circuits. Two novel algorithm-to-architecture mapping techniques for systolic (or systolic-like/semi-systolic) structures are then proposed to improve the shortages exist in current mapping strategies for obfuscation applications. Detailed experiments have also been carried out and it is shown that the proposed schemes can improve the obfuscation level with small complexity overhead, i.e., increase the difficulty and decryption time for the potential attackers (e.g., at most increases the decryption time by 35%). We have also discussed the strengths and limitations of our mapping techniques and suggested future directions to improve security level of systolic-based circuits.	algorithm;encryption;experiment;integrated circuit;obfuscation (software);overhead (computing);semiconductor industry;systolic array;very-large-scale integration	Xiaojun Zhou;Jiafeng Xie	2017	2017 Asian Hardware Oriented Security and Trust Symposium (AsianHOST)	10.1109/AsianHOST.2017.8354007	systolic array;real-time computing;very-large-scale integration;computer science;theoretical computer science;economic shortage;architecture;security level;electronic circuit;encryption;obfuscation	EDA	12.350682391704344	64.82718361966275	191365

However, due to the heterogeneity of the devices, ergo the heterogeneity of information available, novel indoor positioning algorithms capable to account for different types of information must be designed. Differently from the vast majority of localization solutions currently available which rely on one specific type of observation, e.g. range information only, in this article we consider the localization problem of multiple sources from range and angle measurements. To this end we first study the benefit of heterogeneous information via the rigidity theory and the Cramèr-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) and then we show how to utilize an extension of the Euclidean-kernel, i.e. the Edge-kernel, to perform robust positioning under Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions. In particular with reference to the latter contribution it is shown how to exploit the robust principal component analysis theory to improve the edge-kernel recovery and in turn the estimated target's locations.	algorithm;ergo proxy;internationalization and localization;internet of things;kernel (operating system);robust principal component analysis	Davide Macagnano;Giuseppe Destino;Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu	2014	2014 IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)	10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803133	embedded system;simulation;human–computer interaction;telecommunications;computer science;machine learning;data mining;computer security;internet of things;principal component analysis	Mobile	19.618442698522575	73.59475044596242	191863

Sensors used in the sensor networks often suffer from random or systematic errors such as drift and bias. Even if they are calibrated at the time of deployment, they tend to drift as time progresses. Consequently, the progressive manual calibration of such a large-scale sensor network becomes impossible in practice. In this article, we address this challenge by proposing a collaborative framework to automatically detect and correct the drift in order to keep the data collected from these networks reliable. We propose a novel scheme that uses geospatial estimation-based interpolation techniques on measurements from neighboring sensors to collaboratively predict the value of phenomenon being observed. The predicted values are then used iteratively to correct the sensor drift by means of a Kalman filter. Our scheme can be implemented in a centralized as well as distributed manner to detect and correct the drift generated in the sensors. For centralized implementation of our scheme, we compare several kriging- and nonkriging-based geospatial estimation techniques in combination with the Kalman filter, and show the superiority of the kriging-based methods in detecting and correcting the drift. To demonstrate the applicability of our distributed approach on a real world application scenario, we implement our algorithm on a network consisting of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) hardware. We further evaluate single as well as multiple drifting sensor scenarios to show the effectiveness of our algorithm for detecting and correcting drift. Further, we address the issue of high power usage for data transmission among neighboring nodes leading to low network lifetime for the distributed approach by proposing two power saving schemes. Moreover, we compare our algorithm with a blind calibration scheme in the literature and demonstrate its superiority in detecting both linear and nonlinear drifts.	algorithm;centralized computing;interpolation;kalman filter;kriging;nonlinear system;sensor;software deployment	Dheeraj Kumar;Sutharshan Rajasegarar;Marimuthu Palaniswami	2015	TOSN	10.1145/2736697	electronic nose;embedded system;anomaly detection;simulation;interpolation;computer science;brooks–iyengar algorithm;data mining;reliability;statistics;technology	Mobile	12.079602272644527	74.00466514085853	192288
879c9183f7ee6d7131d33112842c7df7ec45d253	design of accurate stochastic number generators with noisy emerging devices for stochastic computing		Stochastic computing (SC) is an unconventional computing paradigm that operates on stochastic bit streams. It has gained attention recently because of the very low area and power needs of its computing core. SC relies on stochastic number generators (SNGs) to map input binary numbers to stochastic bit streams. A conventional SNG comprises a random number source (RNS), typically an LFSR, and a comparator. It needs far more area and power than the SC core, offsetting the latter's main advantages. To mitigate this problem, SNGs employing emerging nanoscale devices such as memristors and spintronic devices have been proposed. However, these devices tend to have large errors in their output probabilities due to unpredictable variations in their fabrication processes and noise in their control signals. We present a novel method of exploiting such devices to design a highly accurate SNG. It is built around an RNS that generates uniformly distributed random numbers under ideal (nominal) conditions. It also has a novel error-cancelling probability conversion circuit (ECPCC) that guarantees very high accuracy in the output probability under realistic conditions when the RNS is subject to errors. An ECPCC can also be used to generate maximally correlated stochastic streams, a useful property for some applications.	binary number;comparator;exploit (computer security);image noise;linear-feedback shift register;memristor;programming paradigm;random number generation;residue number system;social network game;spintronics;stochastic computing;unconventional computing	Meng Meng Yang;John P.

Energy harvesting is a promising option to mitigate battery replacement, but the current energy harvesting methods still rely on batteries or equivalent and power converters for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Unfortunately, batteries are subject to wear and tear, which is a primary factor to prevent from being maintenance free. Power converters are expensive, heavy and lossy as well. In this paper, we introduce a novel energy harvesting and management technique to power the IoT, which does not require any long-term energy storages nor voltage converters unlike traditional energy harvesting systems. Extensive simulations and measurements from our prototype demonstrate that the proposed method harvests 8% more energy and extends the operation time of the device 60% more during a day. This paper also demonstrates a UV (ultraviolet) level meter for skin protect, named SmartPatch, using the proposed energy harvesting method. The proposed method is not limited to photovoltaic energy harvesting but applicable to most energy harvesting IoT power supplies that require impedance tracking.	characteristic impedance;energy drift;internet of things;lossy compression;maximum power transfer theorem;operation time;power management unit;power supply;prototype;quality of service;simulation	Hyung Gyu Lee;Naehyuck Chang	2015	The 20th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference	10.1109/ASPDAC.2015.7058992	embedded system;electronic engineering;engineering;electrical engineering	EDA	16.320499329912092	67.54619795215424	194143

It is demonstrated that these multiple sequence families possess good auto- and cross-correlation properties. In the construction, multiple sets of binary sequences with each sequence of length p/sup 2/ and each families with p sequences are generated. The construction algorithm could be easily implemented in hardware. From the efficient hardware architecture devised, it is shown that rapid switching between generating different distinct sequences is possible. An application for the multiple sequence families in secure spread spectrum watermarking is investigated. In this application it is shown how the efficient hardware architecture for sequence generation could be useful and how it could improve the overall security of the watermarking scheme.		C. S.

Despite multiple innovations at technology-, device-and circuit-level, spin-based circuits suffer from poor energy efficiency, due to the high energy consumption of write operations. In this paper, we propose design optimizations to reduce the number of write operations in RM-based logic circuits, and therefore, achieve overall gain in energy performance. We performed in-depth study of the cutting-edge cryptographic primitive, block cipher SIMON, using experimentally validated Verilog-A models of MTJ and RM.

53e838263e8fa7ed9cfe6214a339a90a5367ccbe	nonparametric generalized belief propagation based on pseudo-junction tree for cooperative localization in wireless networks	signal image and speech processing;telecomunicaciones;communication systems;signalbehandling;quantum information technology spintronics;signal processing;kommunikationssystem	Non-parametric belief propagation (NBP) is a well-known message passing method for cooperative localization in wireless networks. However, due to the over-counting problem in the networks with loops, NBP’s convergence is not guaranteed, and its estimates are typically less accurate. One solution for this problem is non-parametric generalized belief propagation based on junction tree. However, this method is intractable in large-scale networks due to the high-complexity of the junction tree formation, and the high-dimensionality of the particles. Therefore, in this article, we propose the non-parametric generalized belief propagation based on pseudo-junction tree (NGBP-PJT). The main difference comparing with the standard method is the formation of pseudo-junction tree, which represents the approximated junction tree based on thin graph. In addition, in order to decrease the number of high-dimensional particles, we use more informative importance density function, and reduce the dimensionality of the messages. As by-product, we also propose NBP based on thin graph (NBP-TG), a cheaper variant of NBP, which runs on the same graph as NGBP-PJT. According to our simulation and experimental results, NGBP-PJT method outperforms NBP and NBP-TG in terms of accuracy, computational, and communication cost in reasonably sized networks.	appletalk;approximation algorithm;belief propagation;computation;cooperative mimo;counting problem (complexity);information;message passing;neutral body posture;simulation;software propagation;tree decomposition	Vladimir Savic;Santiago Zazo	2013	EURASIP J.

We propose Wake on Idle, a solution that can be implemented in the radio chip and provides these services without relying on the processor when the stable state is reached. No digital decoding is needed as we use pseudo random sequences to identify analog beacon positions in time and assess neighbors presence. Additionally, we use a code violation principle to provide medium access, ensuring that when a node wants to transmit data to a neighbor, the latter will be listening. We analyze this proposition, give some simulation results, and also provide extensive experimentation results based on an implementation running on two different hardware platforms and showing the concept to be valid, although some adaptation was needed to run on off-the-shelf radios. Even with this far from optimal initial implementation we can reach below 0.1% duty cycles for signaling periods on the order of minutes.	access control;burst mode (computing);computer hardware;continuous tone-coded squelch system;duty cycle;déjà vu;frequency-hopping spread spectrum;low-power broadcasting;multicast;performance;pseudorandomness;secure communication;simulation;testbed;wake	Maria Isabel Vergara Gallego;Franck Rousseau	2013	2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM	10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567104	real-time computing;wireless sensor network;energy conservation;telecommunications;computer science;operating system;low-power electronics;computer network	Mobile	14.895500604958892	70.4748076168501	194931
6bb40b043246f6779bbee35a04fcb1a01a1a8d73	a semi-markov decision process based dynamic power management for mobile devices		Power management for mobile devices, such as smartphone and tablet, are more important than ever because the growth of battery density doesn't satisfy the increasing demand for user experience with various applications. However, existing approaches have more or less drawbacks: (1) focusing on certain sub-system and neglecting global optimization, (2) having a great burden on computation or data collection, (3) the risk of exposing user's privacy information. In this paper, we present a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) based power management solution that balances user experience and power consumption. We choose GPS sampling rate and LCD brightness as control variables. This approach has less state number and needs less computation time. The simulation results show that the proposed solution can prolong usage time for about 53% and increase total experience by about 51% in comparison with the general fixed policy.	computation;control variable (programming);global positioning system;global optimization;markov chain;markov decision process;mathematical optimization;mobile device;power management;sampling (signal processing);semiconductor industry;simulation;smartphone;tablet computer;time complexity;user experience	Mengxi Zhang;Yanjie Li;Haoyao Chen	2016	2016 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR)	10.1109/RCAR.2016.7784034	real-time computing;simulation;engineering;operations management	EDA	13.419299423932845	69.93389246464007	195454

Because the environment is not static, it is very important to measure the signal strength of wireless communications periodically in order to take into account all the modifications in the indoor area. These continuous measurements are taken between Wi-Fi Access-points. Such an algorithm allows to keep a good level of accuracy avoiding a degradation of the calculated position over the time.

Moreover, an efficient secret key generation mechanism exploiting multipath relative delay is developed, and verification of this algorithm is conducted in UWB Line-of-sight (LOS) outdoor channels. For the first time, we compare key-mismatch probability of UWB indoor and outdoor environments. Simulation results demonstrate that the number of multipath proportionally affects key generation rate and key-mismatch probability. In comparison to the conventional method using received signal strength (RSS) as a common random source, our mechanism achieves better performance in terms of common secret bit generation. Simultaneously, security analysis indicates that the proposed scheme can still guarantee security even in the sparse outdoor physical environment free of many reflectors.	key generation;ultra-wideband	Jingjing Huang;Ting Jiang	2014	TIIS	10.3837/tiis.2014.02.011	telecommunications;computer science;ultra-wideband;reciprocity;computer security;computer network	Mobile	23.60553212051913	71.04949352792492	195787

The WiFi-based indoor positioning technologies have been investigated intensely. However, both positioning accuracy and stability are often degraded by RSS detection variance between different devices. To solve the two problems, this paper proposes a compensation strategy for RSS detection variance based on cosine similarity. Specifically, it uses cosine similarity as the metric to determine whether different devices could conduct compensation for RSS variance. To obtain the device pairs that satisfy the metric standard, it uses ratio correction method to compensate for RSS detection variance thus effectively solves the positioning accuracy and stability reduction causing by RSS detection variance between different devices. Experiments have shown that the proposed strategy reduces positioning error and improves positioning stability significantly.	cosine similarity;elegant degradation;location-based service;rss;regular expression	Lei Wang;Xiao Wu;Baoyu Zheng;Jingwu Cui;Hui Zhou	2016	2016 26th International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC)	10.1109/ATNAC.2016.7878781	simulation;telecommunications;engineering;computer security	HCI	20.75743247333898	74.04773617631588	197037

This paper proposes two novel approaches to the thermal analysis at the chip architecture level for efficient DTM. The first method, i.e., thermal moment matching with spectrum analysis, is based on observations that the power consumption of architecture-level modules in microprocessors running typical workloads presents a strong nature of periodicity. Such a feature can be exploited by fast spectrum analysis in the frequency domain for computing steady-state response. The second method, i.e., thermal moment matching based on piecewise constant power inputs, is based on the observation that the average power consumption of architecture-level modules in microprocessors running typical workloads determines the trend of temperature variations. As a result, using piecewise constant average power inputs can further speed up the thermal analysis. To obtain transient temperature changes due to the initial condition and constant/average power inputs, numerically stable moment matching methods with enhanced pole searching are carried out to speed up online temperature tracking with high accuracy and low overhead. The resulting thermal analysis algorithm has a linear time complexity in runtime setting when the average power inputs are applied. Experimental results show that the resulting thermal analysis algorithms lead to 10times-100times speedup over the traditional integration-based transient analysis with small accuracy loss	algorithm;initial condition;microprocessor;numerical stability;overhead (computing);quasiperiodicity;simulation;speedup;steady state;thermal management of high-power leds;time complexity;transient state	Hang Li;Lingling Jin;Wei Wu;Sheldon X.-D.

The registers being the main weakness of cryptosystems, the source of leaks the more easily exploitable, we proposed a secure DFF that reduces leaks. In this study, the authors present this countermeasure that considerably increases the robustness of cryptographic algorithms against SCAs. Moreover, the area and power overhead of our secure DFF in a cryptosystem is attractive.	algorithm;cryptography;cryptosystem;digital forensics framework (dff);flops;flip-flop (electronics);overhead (computing);side-channel attack	Bruno Vaquie;Sébastien Tiran;Philippe Maurine	2012	IET Circuits, Devices & Systems	10.1049/iet-cds.2011.0345	telecommunications;computer science;engineering;side channel attack;cryptosystem;processor register;computer security;computer network	Security	11.629743016400665	63.610871304243254	197212

These networks, which were born with the purpose of collecting environmental information, could be also used for wideband applications, e.g. transmitting audio and / or video data streams. The European project EAR-IT [1] uses acoustic detection to make smarter cities. The idea is to make large-scale deployments and use sounds to create innovative applications. Current technology can be a limitation in terms of performance. This document shows what parameters are relevant to be measured in a 802.15.4 Wireless Sensor Network to determine its suitability to wideband transmission of multimedia streams.

Many of those scenarios also require indoor positioning technologies, for example, warehouse goods positioning, item positioning in production assembly lines, worker positioning in construction sites. However, related researches about indoor positioning using RFID system has been having trouble in improving positioning accuracy, especially when tracking a randomly moving target. In this paper, we propose PTrack, a track prediction algorithm for tracking moving targets in indoor positioning systems which is based on RFID technology and the correspondences between the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) changes and the moving status of the target. Results show that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the positioning accuracy and achieves 1.7 m localization error in indoor environments, which makes a promising technology to support future pervasive RFID-based tracking applications.	algorithm;randomness	Gang Feng;Jian-qiang Li;Chengwen Luo;Zhong Ming	2016		10.1007/978-3-319-52015-5_15	radio-frequency identification;signal strength;warehouse;algorithm;computer science	Robotics	20.079685405767457	70.84151496259618	197898
44005e7f23c80a3821b713fcb4bbfcace9488e04	a compressive and adaptive sampling approach in crowdsensing networks		High data quality and low sensing cost are two primary goals in large-scale mobile crowdsensing applications. The oversampling and the undersampling are common problems which always result in a high cost or low data quality that can not satisfy the system requirement. To address this problem, taking into account low-rank latent structure, we propose a compressive and adaptive data sampling scheme (CAS) which exploits adaptivity to identify locations which are highly informative for learning the low-dimensional space of the data matrix. In contrast to existing random sampling methods, it involves a three-pass sampling procedure that firstly assigns a fraction of samples to estimate general information, then samples those more informative locations for exact recovery and finally estimates the values of the unsensing locations. Evaluations on synthetic datasets and real datasets for air quality monitoring show the effectiveness of CAS. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to not only significantly improve the sensing data quality but also reduce the computation complexity comparing with the state-of-the-art matrix completion methods.	adaptive sampling;computation;crowdsensing;data quality;ibm notes;information;low-rank approximation;oversampling;sampling (signal processing);synthetic data;system requirements;undersampling	Jingjing Chen;Zhonghui Chen;Haifeng Zheng;Xinxin Feng	2017	2017 9th International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)	10.1109/WCSP.2017.8171100	real-time computing;computer science;data matrix;matrix completion;sampling (statistics);oversampling;adaptive sampling;undersampling;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;data quality;system requirements	DB	12.38086468020911	73.63463298400471	198349

In this paper, we present two practical timing attacks on NoC that improve Prime+Probe technique, the P+P Firecracker, and P+P Arrow. Our attacks target the communication between an ARM Cortex-A9 core and a shared cache memory. Furthermore, we evaluate a secure enhanced NoC as a countermeasure against the timing attack.

While the computation within each individual domain may be synchronous, the interfaces between these domains often use asynchronous methods. One such approach is the STARI technique[Gre93, Gre95] where a self-timed FIFO compensates for clock-skew between the sender and receiver. This dissertation presents implementations of STARI where the FIFO consists of a single, handshaking stage. I start with the simplest case where the sender and receiver operate at exactly the same frequency with an unknown skew. I then generalize this design for links with clocks whose frequencies are rational multiples of each other, clocks whose frequencies are closely matched, and arbitrary clocks. In each of these cases, the STARI interface can exploit the stability of typical clocks to achieve low latencies and negligible probabilities of synchronization failure using very simple hardware. I have designed and tested a proof-of-concept chip fabricated with the T S M C 0.18/x CMOS process for the scenario where clocks of different domains are exactly matched in frequency. The tests have demonstrated our claims about the skew tolerance of the design and I am now in the process of designing the interface for further generalizations.	cmos;clock signal;clock skew;computation;fifo (computing and electronics);handshaking	Ajanta Chakraborty;Mark R.

f3e30b6abb13a908452b0a2aaa13893723af0503	market-based resource allocation for energy-efficient execution of multiple concurrent applications in wireless sensor networks		Many engineering disciplines have become reliant on WSNs in order to detect and track certain events of interest by monitoring various parameters, through a number of spatially distributed wireless sensors. Due to resource constraints of sensor hardware, traditional WSN applications involved exchanging an excessive amount of data, usually in an offline mode, between sensor nodes and a central unit, in order to apply computational analysis on the captured data. New sensor devices however, are equipped with more powerful resources and capable of running multiple concurrent processing, and applying computational data analysis can be implemented online and often in a distributed fashion. In this paper we will investigate the application of market-based algorithms for energy management, tasks allocation and resource coordination in WSNs with multiple concurrent applications. We will also propose a number of algorithms for calculating costs and utilities for multi-paradigm application requirements.	airplane mode;algorithm;cluster analysis;computation;computer multitasking;online and offline;programming paradigm;requirement;responsiveness;sensor;sleep mode	Mo Haghighi	2013		10.1007/978-3-642-40675-1_27	real-time computing;distributed computing;key distribution in wireless sensor networks;computer network	Embedded	10.170856019083399	73.35628262652595	199300

The research on counter-measures against power analysis attacks on embedded devices with security-sensitive applications turned out to be a challenging area. Very often the proposed countermeasures consume to much resources in order to increase the barrier to hinder a successful attack. The presented scheme uses randomized isomorphisms of the algebraic construction of the S-box and thus increases the resistance at a very low cost in terms of hardware resources. The resource utilization of the proposed masking scheme is smaller than a standard Boolean masking scheme for FPGAs. Our conducted experiments on the FPGA evaluation platform SASEBO GII demonstrates that we improved the resistance against the common DPA attack about 100 times compared to the non-hardened AES-128 version.	countermeasure (computer);embedded system;experiment;field-programmable gate array;graph isomorphism;internet;linear algebra;randomized algorithm;s-box;side-channel attack;unsharp masking;utility functions on indivisible goods	Bernhard Jungk;Marc Stöttinger;Jan Gampe;Steffen Reith;Sorin A.

However, these security design requirements may be in opposition to test needs and testability improvement techniques that increase both observability and controllability. Nevertheless, secure chip designers cannot neglect the testability of their chip; a high quality production testing is primordial to ensure a good level of security since any faulty devices could induce major security vulnerability. In this paper, we propose to merge security requirements with testability ones in a control-oriented design for security scan technique.	display resolution;requirement;software testability;vulnerability (computing)	David Hély;Frédéric Bancel;Marie-Lise Flottes;Bruno Rouzeyre	2005	European Test Symposium (ETS'05)	10.1109/ETS.2005.36	chip;reliability engineering;real-time computing;observability;controllability;vulnerability;computer science;engineering;information security;design for testing;software testing;data security;security testing;computer security;microelectronics;robustness;integrated circuit design	EDA	11.633799963909386	62.67675846373259	199507
